Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd  No     FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMobil Oil Australia Limited v Guina Developments Pty Limited     VR   This sort of question has arisen before  and in particular is the subject of a decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria  Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Guina Developments Pty Ltd     VR    The decision of the court was given by Hayne JA  His Honour pointed out at   that when the question of disclosure of confidential information to a trade rival arises  it must be remembered that confidential information once received cannot be forgotten  and may be used in a way in which the party disclosing the information never becomes aware   I think that is an important consideration in the present case  I am satisfied that the information in question is genuinely confidential  The evidence in the substantive hearing disclosed there is very close competition in the project homes market  Knowledge to a competitor of costings and margins would be very valuable for the purpose of setting prices   I do not think Barrett are seriously disadvantaged for the purpose of making its election because  as already mentioned  their Chief Financial Officer will have access to the report  If they wish  they could also retain some independent expert with knowledge of this particular industry   I note in particular that Mr Roberts is a person who is involved in the day to day operations of the business  and so the more likely to be in a position to take advantage of the information  This is not necessarily a case of any dishonest or improper use of information  As is stressed in Mobil Oil   once information is disclosed it becomes part of the person s stock of knowledge and it is unrealistic to expect that knowledge to be ignored    I certify that the preceding seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey    Associate Dated    June   Counsel for the Applicants  C D Golvan SC     Solicitor for the Applicants  Middletons     Counsel for the Respondent  S M Rebikoff     Solicitor for the Respondent  Mallesons Stephen Jaques   Date of Hearing    June       Date of Judgment    June         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
