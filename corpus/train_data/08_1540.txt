Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  Ms Budd applied to the Tribunal for a review of the SSAT decision and participated in a hearing before the Tribunal by way of telephone  The Tribunal delivered its decision on   February   affirming the SSAT decision and dismissing Ms Budd s application  see Budd v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   AATA    In such decision the Tribunal at   made the following finding of fact    She seldom goes out of the house and will only do so to get stationary  sic  supplies and post letters  That is the extent of her travelling  Ms Budd also stated in her letter dated   November   that she does not leave the house to do her voluntary work and instead writes the poems at home and then sends them to St Clare s Church  In a letter  undated but received by the Tribunal on   November   Ms Budd stated that  St Clare s does not need me to do  face to face  work    The Tribunal concluded at     I find that Ms Budd does not satisfy the travel test because the nature of her voluntary work does not require her to travel to and from her home for the purpose of undertaking that work  Ms Budd is able to conduct her voluntary work from home  In making my finding I have taken into consideration the reports of Dr Hugo Rodriguez  the letters from Sister Francis  the letter from Senator John Faulkner and several letters that Ms Budd sent the Tribunal   Where a notice of appeal is not filed within the time limits prescribed by s  A a  of the AAT Act  s  B  thereof provides  In the interest of justice  the grounds on which the Federal Court of Australia may allow further time under paragraph  A a  include  but are not limited to  the following grounds   a  if the Tribunal made an oral statement as to the reasons for the decision and afterwards gave a written statement of reasons for the decision  the written statement contains reasons that were not mentioned in the oral statement   b  the text of the decision or a statement of reasons for the decision has been altered under section  AA consideredComcare v Etheridge   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Court observes that it has a limited power to review questions of fact  see Comcare v Etheridge   FCAFC   at         but such power only arises  after the Court has given consideration of the questions of law which constitute the subject matter of the appeal    see Comcare at    In the current proceeding however no question of law is raised

 html  In these circumstances  the Court cannot substitute its own decision for that of the Tribunal  see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko Wallsend Limited and Others   HCA         CLR   per Mason J at       Although it is inappropriate for the Court to trespass into the merits  the Court notes that Ms Budd misinterprets the travel test in s   of the Act  Her submissions at hearing and her correspondence with the Court continually reiterated that she  does the work  and that she  does the travel    However  the existence of these two facts in isolation does not satisfy the travel test in s    The determinative issue before the Tribunal was whether she was required to travel in order to perform the work  The Tribunal found against Ms Budd on such issue and this Court cannot interfere with that finding   It follows from the above that it is not  in the interest of justice  to grant leave to Ms Budd to file and serve a notice of appeal out of time pursuant to s  A a  of the AAT Act  The Court accordingly dismisses the application with costs   I certify that the preceding thirty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

 of the AAT Act  the Court notes that it is  not limited to  the grounds contained in paragraphs  B a  and  B b   In Phillips v Australian Girls  Choir Pty Ltd   Anor   FMCA   Federal Magistrate McInnis considered the nature of the discretion contained in s  A a  of the AAT Act  and said at   In the light of A Hearn s case  it is clear that at least one of the principles referred to by Wilcox J in the Hunter Valley decision needs to be modified namely that it should not be any longer regarded as law that the inexcusable delay on the part of a solicitor should be visited upon the client and nor should it be a principle that there is in fact a pre condition to the exercise of discretion in favour of the applicant for extension to show an acceptable explanation for delay or that it s fair and equitable in the circumstances to extend time  In the light of the decision in Ahearn s  sic  case it is useful to set out in modified form the relevant principles in relation to the exercise of the Court s discretion when considering an extension of time in a human rights application based upon those principles distilled by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley as follows     There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made  Special circumstances need not be shown  but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is
