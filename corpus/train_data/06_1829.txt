Abrahams v Comcare   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedFrosch v Comcare   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Tribunal Member referred to the discussion of the Tribunal s jurisdiction by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare     ALD   which contained the observation  at   that although the Tribunal has the powers of the original decision maker under s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  they are     powers  f or the purpose of reviewing  the reviewable decision  not powers that may be exercised at large  Further  the powers and discretions that the  Tribunal  may exercise under s   are the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the determining authority for the purposes of reconsidering a determination under s   of the Act  The  Tribunal  will not be authorised on review of a reviewable decision to exercise any powers and decisions which would not have been available to the determining authority at the second tier decision making stage  albeit that such powers and discretions might have been available to the determining authority at the first tier decision making stage    There is no form of notice of injury legally prescribed  What is a  notice of injury  complying with s   is  as Whitlam J noted in Frosch v Comcare   FCA   at     a matter of law   The original decision maker might conceivably have had many powers  the exercise of which may have been prompted by what he or she knew of the applicant s claim  without those powers being powers or discretions relevant to the exercise of the decision to be made  However  it seems to me that the Tribunal Member did not adequately appreciate or apply the following legal propositions  which I think are correct         In construing a document purporting to be a notice of injury under the Act  a broad  generous and practical interpretation should be made  consistent with both the beneficial purposes of the Act and the likelihood that laypeople of differing levels of education  differing levels of medical advice and differing levels of legal advice  indeed in most cases they would not have any  will be giving the notice      In deciding what injury it is  as to which a claimant has given notice  the purposes of giving notice must be borne in mind  These are to enable Comcare  with the aid of the relevant employing agency  to determine whether the claim should be met      The powers of an original decision maker would extend to regarding informal notice as having been given in amplification of a notice formally given       Those powers would further extend to enabling a consideration of a claim better explaining  or better justifying  a claim in respect of an injury in respect of which notice had been fairly given      There is not always a bright dividing line available to assist in the decision whether powers of the kinds mentioned are being exercised in aid of a better understanding of a claim made in respect of an injury of which notice has been given  or whether the changed notice is sufficiently fundamental as to indicate that a different injury is being asserted  which will require a different decision from a decision in respect of the originally claimed injury under consideration  In determining that matter  considerations of the purpose of giving notice of injury  and more generally of enabling the decision maker to have a fair opportunity to investigate the claim properly  are paramount   While no legal criticism can be made of the Tribunal for declining to accept counsel s invitation to reconsider the matter entirely  since something new in   was being propounded as the injury  it seems to me to have been over technical  and to have been a legally impermissible mode of interpretation  to hold the applicant irretrievably to the use of what was plainly the then medical diagnosis which he had received
