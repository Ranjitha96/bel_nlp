Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Subsequently  however  the High Court has held that despite having the burden of proof  the taxpayer is entitled to know the basis on which the Commissioner has made an assessment  In Bailey v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   the High Court discussed the Commissioner s obligation to provide particulars in the context of s   of the ITAA  Barwick CJ observed  at         The taxpayer should be told the taxable facts  This inevitably  in my opinion  requires the Commissioner to inform the taxpayer of the operation of s   which has warranted the adoption of his view of the taxable facts  This involves the identification and disclosure of the contract  agreement or arrangement which has been treated as avoided by s         T he Commissioner must  in my opinion  be specific in his identification of the contract  agreement or arrangement     which justifies the amount of the assessment   In the same case Aicken J commented at     The purpose of particulars is to assist in the defining of issues and there is in my opinion no reason why in appropriate cases the Commissioner should not give particulars where they are necessary in order that both the appellant and the court may understand the basis upon which the assessment has been made          It is not in the interests of the proper administration of justice that  when the matter comes before the court  the appellant should have to speculate about  and adduce evidence to negate  every possible kind of agreement      In Bailey  the High Court did not regard the obligation to provide particulars as inconsistent with  or in any way compromising  the taxpayer s burden of proof  Rather their view was to the contrary  Gibbs J commented at   that    The fact that the taxpayer bears the onus of proving that the assessment is excessive makes it all the more necessary that he should be given particulars of the basis of the assessment   At   Mason J said that because the taxpayer has to prove that the Commissioner s assessment is excessive        the relevant facts in the appeal include the view of the facts on which the Commissioner has based his assessment  the manner in which he arrived at his assessment  These facts are not within the knowledge of the taxpayer  they are within the knowledge of the Commissioner   More recently  Greenwood J expressed a similar view in Clark v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at     Jacobs J acknowledged in Bailey that particulars are essentially factual rather than legal  however his Honour recognised that for a request for particulars to be appropriately directed to the matter in dispute the issues must be sufficiently defined  At     his Honour made the following comment        when there are no sufficiently defined issues it is not always possible to obtain particulars of facts without first ascertaining whether those facts will be relevant to questions which may be raised  In the present case it is therefore necessary for the taxpayer and the Court to know the basis of the assessments referred toClark v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Bailey  the High Court did not regard the obligation to

application before him Sundberg J referred to Gummow J s comments in Jackson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at   that the taxpayer was entitled to know both the Commission s view and the facts on which that view was based  His Honour also said that he was in agreement with an extra judicial observation of Beaumont J that the Commissioner s statement  must propound all the necessary ingredients of the claim for which  as a matter of legal substance  that party contends   Anatomy of a Federal Court Tax Case    UNSW Law Journal   at     and added  at     It is now well established that the statement takes the place of pleadings so that after the exchange of statements the parties to a tax appeal know the case each has to meet  A statement that leaves the taxpayer uncertain as to how the case is put against it is embarrassing and oppressive  A statement that does not disclose the facts on which the respondent has based his assessment and the manner in which he has arrived at it  suffers from these twin vices consideredGeorge v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commissioner relies on s  ZZO of the TAA which puts the onus on the applicant to prove the facts on which the applicant seeks to rely to show that the assessment is excessive and  unless the Court otherwise orders  limits the proceedings in this Court to the grounds stated in the taxation objection  In considering what the Commissioner must disclose in the appeal statements it is necessary to take account of the fact that the taxpayer has the burden of proof under s  ZZO  This factor was also an issue in George v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   which was the earliest case involving the Commissioner s obligation to provide particulars with respect to assessments  albeit that the question arose in the context of earlier legislation   In George  the taxpayer claimed that his taxable income was less than the amount assessed by the Commissioner  He sought orders that the Commissioner furnish particulars of the source from which it was alleged that he had derived that income  Kitto J declined to make the orders sought on the basis that it was the taxpayer and not the Commissioner who had the burden of proving that the assessment was excessive  His Honour commented  at   that in order to discharge the burden of proof the taxpayer    must necessarily exclude by his proof all sources of income except those which he admits  His case must be that he did not derive from any source taxable income to the amount of the assessment   The Full High Court  Dixon CJ  McTiernan  Williams  Webb and Fullagar JJ  dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Kitto J  In their joint judgment  at   the Court pointed out that        even were it true that the commissioner must     affirmatively prove by evidence that he formed a judgment of the amount of the income upon which the appellant ought to be taxed  it could not be part of his case to establish the facts upon which he acted in forming the judgment or the grounds on which he proceeded  the materials before him  or the reasoning actuating him  The need supposed of showing that he formed such a judgment could be no ground for requiring particulars of the sources of the taxable income ascribed by the assessment to the appellant consideredRio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   In Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   there was  as here  a dispute as to whether the statement of facts  issues and contentions was so inadequate that it should be struck out or whether it would be sufficient to supplement it with particulars  In that case the Commissioner s statement listed the issues and contentions in a table against which the Commissioner indicated his position by a simple  yes  or  no   Sundberg J held that the deficiencies in the statement could not be cured by further particulars  His Honour noted  at   that the ultimate decision in the appeal before him would  turn on the facts established by the applicant  and not on those perceived and stated by the  Commissioner  and rejected the claim that the applicant was seeking to invert the onus of proof citedWR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   His Honour did not suggest that in taking the place of pleadings  the statement should be treated in the same way as pleadings  The difference between pleadings and a statement of facts  issues and contentions or an appeal statement was recognised by Lindgren J in WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   where his Honour stated unequivocally  at   that a statement of facts  issues and contentions is not a pleading even within the extended definition of  pleading  in O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    Ultimately  however  what is clear from all of the authorities is that the issue is one of substance  the taxpayer  and the court  must be given a clear and succinct statement of the Commissioner s position without imposing any element of a burden of proof on the Commissioner  In substituting such a statement for pleadings the legislature has provided for a very practical approach to the unusual situation where the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the Commissioner s assessment is excessive  In my view  such a statement should not be overly scrutinised in an attempt to find errors or inadequacies  The question is  does the statement give the taxpayer a practical understanding of the Commissioner s position  The applicant s complaints about the inadequacies it perceived in the respondent s appeal statements are set out in detail in a letter dated   August   from its solicitor to that of the respondent  While expressly not conceding that those deficiencies could be cured by further particulars  a request for further and better particulars was enclosed with the letter  In its response dated   August   the respondent s solicitor declined to amend the statements but said that its client was prepared to give further particulars  Despite this  no further particulars had been given by the time of the hearing of the applicant s motions
