Garvey v Secretary  Department of Families  Housing  Community Services and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedHunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   Principles which may assist the Court in exercising its discretion under O   r   include the following         Applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so  the legislated time limits are not to be ignored  The applicant must show an acceptable explanation for the delay and it must be fair and equitable in the circumstances to extend time     Action taken by the applicant  other than by way of making an application for review  is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished     Any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension     The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension  and     The merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted     Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   at       Applying these principles to the application before me the following issues are clear consideredJess v Scott     FCR   First  the delay in this case in filing an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal is extreme  Wilcox J in Jess v Scott     FCR   at   observed  It would require something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave after  for example  a year      In this case more than five years have passed since the primary judgment was delivered   Second  no acceptable explanation for this delay has been given by the applicant in his written or oral submissions  or in either of his affidavits  While Dr Chalk has deposed that he has treated the applicant for approximately ten years and that the applicant suffers from chronic mental illness and while I understand that the applicant suffered a breakdown in   this does not adequately explain a delay of more than five years in bringing the present application   Third  no prejudice has been demonstrated by the respondent in this case  However this does not in itself justify the grant of an extension of time affirmedRobert Joseph Barry Garvey v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  As explained in the decision of Dowsett J of   April     Robert Joseph Barry Garvey v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA   events relevant to the decision of his Honour  and the application currently before me  date back to December    In summary    In December   the applicant applied for an invalid pension pursuant to the provisions of s   Social Security Act    Cth   That application was refused     The applicant subsequently sought a merits review of that decision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal  but was unsuccessful  He was also unsuccessful in his appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court   Secretary  Department of Social Security v Garvey     ALR        The applicant brought a new application before the Tribunal however the Tribunal determined that no new issues were raised in these subsequent proceedings     The applicant appealed against this decision of the Tribunal to this Court  however Dowsett J ordered the applicant s notice of appeal be struck out on the basis that the matter had already been finally resolved by the Full Court in    His Honour also ordered the applicant pay the respondent s costs   Garvey   FCA        On   November   the District Registrar in the Brisbane Registry of the Court made an order pursuant to O   r   Federal Court Rules in the following terms      On   April   the Court ordered that the applicant pay the respondent s costs of the appeal including the costs of the application to strike out and the costs of   April       On   October   an estimate of the respondent s bill of costs was made pursuant to the provisions of Order   rule   and allowed in the sum of     for which sum a Certificate of Taxation was issued on   October       THE COURT ORDERS THAT the applicant pay the sum of     to the respondent   Fourth  and in my view critically  even were the application to be granted there are no prospects of success on appeal  In both affidavits the applicant complains of findings by the Full Court however    This clearly demonstrates  as found by Dowsett J  that the applicant merely seeks to re agitate issues already resolved by decision of the Full Court in    Indeed this morning the applicant conceded that  in comparison with the proceedings before the Full Court  this was  the same case  but different arguments   In this respect I consider that the application before me  as was the notice of appeal before Dowsett J  is an abuse of process     The existing Full Court decision binds the Tribunal as well as single judges of this Court  I endorse doubts expressed by Dowsett J in his primary judgment as to the competency of the Tribunal to entertain the applicant s proceedings which were subsequently the subject of an appeal before his Honour   Garvey   FCA   at       The appropriate orders are to dismiss this application  with costs   I certify that the preceding twelve   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier    Associate Dated
