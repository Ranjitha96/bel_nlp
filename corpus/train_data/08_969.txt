cases cth FCA  html  Finally  with respect to potential issues of prejudice to the respondents  whether relating to privilege or otherwise  I emphasise that  the issue of the subpoena does not at this stage produce any prejudice to the  respondents   If the  applicants  after leave is granted and the subpoena is answered  decide s  to seek to bring any documents from that yield to the Court  then the Court will need to be addressed on any issue that might prejudice the  respondents     Calder v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at     To the extent that the subpoena yields documents said to be problematic for one reason or another  those problems can be dealt with in due course   For the foregoing reasons  leave to issue the subpoena will be granted   I certify that the preceding nineteen

for Railways v Small   SR  NSW    Secondly  the ACC is not presumably ignorant of the dispute in light of the prior correspondence  Thirdly  it is not being asked to form a judgment as to potential relevance of documents  it is simply being asked to produce documents as to which it has already formed a judgment regarding relevance  ie the documents referred to in the   May letter   Because it appears from the correspondence that the ACC has already reviewed and identified the relevant documents  I consider that the documents are identified with  reasonable particularity  Commissioner for

Association  Inc      ALR   With respect to the remainder of the respondents  objections  I note    that some of the documents requested may not be relevant in the end does not matter   the standard is potential  not actual  relevance  and   that the pleadings have not yet closed does not matter because there is no limit on the time at which the court can issue a subpoena  Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc      ALR   at      The problem of potential costs to the respondents in dealing with documents generated by the subpoena can and will be addressed in two ways  First  under the ordinary rule  costs follow the event  so that if the respondents prevail in the proceedings they will have the costs incurred in relation to this subpoena as part of those costs  Secondly  if the respondents  after seeing the response to the subpoena  are of the view that it has led to costs thrown away or other waste  their remedy is to make application for a separate costs

Ordinarily  that sort of request contained in the catch all would be set aside  given the well settled rule that the court will not ask a stranger to the proceedings  to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant   P Dawson     ACSR   at     However  the applicants submit that the form of the subpoena is  in this case  justified by the prior correspondence with the ACC  I accept this submission  The applicants are not asking the ACC to incur the costs of ransacking their records at cost  The   May   letter from the ACC states that the records have already been searched  Similarly  the applicants are not asking the ACC to form a judgment about matters which the ACC is ignorant  the judgment has already been formed  Moreover  public investigatory bodies like the ACC which have previously conducted or are conducting an investigation and collected documents in the course of such investigation stand in a different position to a non party such as a bank or business that simply happens to have acquired or generated potentially relevant documents in the ordinary course of business but has no special reason to know of any litigation or relevance of its records to that litigation  Such records as the ACC has can be  and usually are  clearly and separately identifiable and identified as documents obtained in the course of a particular investigation  P Dawson     ACSR   at     In addition  the submission that a court will not issue a subpoena as a substitute for discovery is not apposite  First  the authorities to that effect relate to the issue of subpoenas to a party to the litigation  not a non party such as the ACC  P Dawson     ACSR   at    Secondly   discovery  in this context is a term of art  as was explained by Heerey J in P Dawson     ACSR   at    It means only that a court will not ask a person to ransack their records without clear instructions as to what is being sought  Again  as I have explained  that is not the case here  The ACC has already identified the documents  the subpoena is simply a formality requested by the ACC as condition precedent to their handing over the documents   In short  I consider that where a non party  particularly a public investigatory agency  has    confirmed to a party that it has searched for and identified potentially relevant documents    indicated in writing that it has no objection to producing those identified documents provided a formal subpoena is issued  and   the court is satisfied identified documents in fact appear to be potentially relevant  there is in general no obstacle to the court exercising its discretion in the interests of justice to issue a subpoena for the production of those documents
