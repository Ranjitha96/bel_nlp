concerning costs  the issue is whether there is anything about the particular proceedings to persuade me that it is appropriate to depart from the usual order  Other decided cases in which some but not all factors are present or cases that present different considerations are   not particularly helpful     Fetherston at   per Heerey J   I note that in no other case cited by the parties were all

public interest litigation to an individual was discussed by Wilcox J in Woodlands at    His Honour adopted the approach of Morling J in Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc v Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd     ALR     namely that it was not in the public interest for a litigant to be heavily out of pocket for taking public spirited action  The applicants do not seek financial gain from the litigation  Even if they do intend to fly with Virgin and do not wish to pay for a carer to accompany them  the costs of the litigation far outweigh that cost  so as to render it irrelevant to a question of personal financial  rather than public  benefit citedBritish Columbia  Minister of Forests  v Okanagan Indian Band   SCC       N R    In Canada  the Supreme Court in

litigation  It is not sufficient  Virgin says  that the applicants do not want to be exposed to an order for costs in the ordinary course if they are unsuccessful   The applicants have not established that they would be forced to abandon the litigation if no order were made capping the costs  A large proportion of applicants in the Court are concerned at the possibility of being required to pay costs if they are unsuccessful   Dibb at   per Sackville J   However  I accept that these applicants would be inhibited or reluctant to continue the litigation if there were no order made under O  A r    In circumstances where neither applicant seeks a monetary outcome from the litigation  I do not see that their inhibition or reluctance to continue the proceedings for the reasons given to be unreasonable or irrelevant   Mr Ferguson is unlikely to be able to meet any substantial costs order  It is not apparent that  even if he were made bankrupt  he would be able to do so  The maximum costs order that he seeks directly relates to the indemnity provided under the grant to him of legal aid  Mr Corcoran is in no different a position from many applicants in the Court  He has sufficient assets to meet a costs order but is disinclined to put them at risk  The difference between his position and that of other litigants is that he will receive no financial gain if he succeeds in obtaining the orders sought  While  if successful  he would be able to fly on Virgin without a carer  he is presently able to fly on other airlines without that extra cost consideredFetherston v Peninsula Health  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Many of these factors have not been challenged by Virgin  However  Virgin submits that they are not sufficient to depart from the usual costs order  Virgin points out that  as was recognised in Fetherston v Peninsula Health  No     FCA         FCR   and Flew   there is nothing in the Act or in other legislation to indicate that policy considerations warrant a special provision for costs in human rights litigation   There is  of course  O  A r   and the circumstances in which this rule applies are not limited   The existence of a public interest in the determination of the issues in litigation is a factor of some significance in the awarding of costs  However  public interest and an arguable case are not necessarily decisive and not  of themselves  sufficient to prevent the usual costs order being made   Ruddock at     Woodlands at   Physical Disability at    The usual order for costs

reflecting the considerable time  expense and resources that will be required for the preparation and the hearing  Virgin also contends that the applicants have  to date  demonstrated a failure to conduct the matter in an efficient and economical manner  It has been noted  by Heerey J in Fetherston and by Barnes FM in Flew   that neither the Act nor the Federal Court Rules provide for a limitation to the usual costs order or any special provision for costs in proceedings brought under the Act  Unlike the Federal Magistrates Court  the Federal Court Rules do not limit and prescribe costs  enabling a party better to calculate at the outset of litigation the likely costs to be awarded to the successful party  However  this is only of assistance when an estimate can be made of the length of hearing and the costs of the evidence  In Flew   as here  Virgin has estimated the costs of a likely hearing  not including its costs of preparation and evidence consideredFlew v Mirvac

which may go towards establishing that there should be a departure in advance from the usual rules as to quantification of the amount of costs to be payable by the ultimately unsuccessful party     Flew at     A deterrent effect of a potential adverse costs order is insufficient of itself to warrant an order under O  A r     Dibb at   Flew at    Virgin says each applicant must establish that he will be   prevented or inhibited from conducting his case   if no order is made   Dibb at    Virgin submits that  while not determinative of the entitlement to an order  the applicants need to establish that they would be forced to abandon the litigation  It is not sufficient  Virgin says  that the applicants do not want to be exposed to an order for costs in the ordinary course if they are unsuccessful   Virgin submits that  as found by Barnes FM in Flew at   the fact that an applicant would need to go into debt to meet costs does not lead to an inference that he or she would be forced to abandon the proceedings if no order were made  Further  Virgin says that there is no sufficient evidence that either Mr Ferguson or Mr Corcoran would be forced to discontinue the proceedings if the costs were not capped  Mr Corcoran and his wife are in receipt of income and have assets  Those assets may  Virgin submits  enable Mr Corcoran to obtain a loan rather than sell the assets  In any event  reluctance to be exposed to the risk of selling an investment property cannot  Virgin submits  be equated to being  forced  to abandon the claim   As Barnes FM said in Flew at   impecuniosity of one party or claims about the relative financial significance of the cost of proceedings cannot of themselves be determinative  It would not be unusual that fear of exposure to costs acts as a deterrent to litigation  It is in that context that the comment that a party should not be  forced  to abandon litigation because of the possibility of an adverse  uncapped  costs order should be considered  While it may not be necessary to establish that the party was forced to abandon litigation for fear of costs  mere concern as to the effect of an adverse costs order on a party s asset position  or a concern that a party may become bankrupt if unable to meet a costs order are not  by themselves  factors that sufficiently render the applicants  position different from other litigants faced with the usual costs order   The applicants rely on a juxtaposition of factors  some but not all of which have been present in cases previously decided   a  there is no financial benefit to the applicants in bringing the proceedings   b  there is a public interest in the resolution of the issues   c  the need for a sufficiently disabled person to provide a carer on flights is likely to affect numbers of people for whom the incremental cost is likely to be insufficient to justify the commencement of proceedings under the Act   d  each of the applicants has asserted that he would be likely to be unable to proceed with the litigation if the O  A r   order were not made   e  the explanation given by each applicant is reasonable and has not been challenged as a bona fide reason   f  the application has been brought in a timely manner   g  the applicants have  after an initial period clarifying their case  sought to narrow the issues to be determined   h  if the matter had proceeded in the Supreme Court of New South Wales  a cap would have applied automatically  s   of the Legal Aid Commission Act    NSW    It cannot be said that the case lacks complexity  As pointed out by Beazley J in Sacks at   the intention on the introduction of O  A r   was to apply the rule principally to commercial litigation at the lower end of the scale in terms of complexity and the amount in dispute  That is  it was introduced to keep costs proportionate in low value litigation  The original object of O  A r   as set out in a letter from the Chief Justice of the Federal Court to the President of the Law Council of Australia regarding the introduction of the rule  was to   define a budget so that the management of the case might be tailored according to its economic limits    cf Sacks at   Flew at    That  however  is not a limitation on the availability of an order  There is no reason why it should not apply  in appropriate situations  to cases that are somewhat complex   Virgin contends that the costs likely to be incurred will be substantially in excess of   and in excess of the combined proposed cap of    Virgin estimates that the costs will be well in excess of   reflecting the considerable time  expense and resources that will be required for the preparation and the hearing  Virgin also contends that the applicants have  to date  demonstrated a failure to

fact and law are complex and thus outside the intended application of O  A r     Hanisch at   and that the preparation of the evidence will be both complex and costly   In relation to discovery Virgin points to what it describes as the broad  ambiguous and or irrelevant categories of disclosure sought by the applicants  Virgin says that the applicants  reliance on the current ITC does not necessarily narrow the scope of discovery  as those criteria also formed part of the earlier ITC  The reasonableness of those criteria may  Virgin says  involve consideration of the reasons why they were initially adopted by Virgin  This may require evidence from past and present employees   Virgin says that it will necessarily adduce extensive evidence in response to the applications concerning

usual order for costs consideredMcLean v Airlines of Tasmania Pty Ltd   EOC     The parties have referred to only one other case that has raised similar issues under the Act  McLean v Airlines of Tasmania Pty Ltd   EOC      In that case the Human Rights   Equal Opportunity Commission considered discrimination by an airline on the basis of disability  The applicant was seeking to fly on a small plane which was not easily wheelchair accessible and which had no cabin attendant  The Commission found that the discrimination was not unlawful as  in light of the facts of that case  it was reasonable for the airline to refuse access to the disabled applicant  While similar  these proceedings raise different and new issues to those addressed in McLean    It is not seriously contended by Virgin that there is no question of public interest raised in the proceedings  Virgin submits  however  that the claims involve self interest on the part of the applicants as well as public interest  This does not derogate from the broader impact of the ITC  The ability of disabled persons to fly with Virgin  a major commercial airline in Australia  without the extra cost of a carer raises questions of public interest beyond the private interests of the applicant   Claims for financial compensation by each of the applicants have been abandoned  Accordingly  the amount of damages that the applicants may seek to recover is not a factor that assists in the exercise of the Court s discretion citedMinns v State of NSW  No      FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The

usual order is not made  However  the nature and purpose of the proceedings are still relevant in the exercise of the discretion to award costs and the exercise of the discretion takes account of all of the circumstances   Ruddock at        There is no error in taking into account in a decision whether to award costs matters such as the absence of personal gain on the part of the applicants  the fact that a significant number of members of the public may be affected and that the basis of the challenge is arguable and raises  significant issues  as to the interpretation and application of statutory provisions   Oshlack v Richmond River Council   HCA         CLR   at   per Gaudron and Gummow JJ  at   per McHugh J   The same circumstances are relevant to an order under Order  A r   which  while making provision for the costs of a successful party  departs from the usual order that would otherwise be made consideredPhysical Disability Council of NSW v Sydney City Council   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Physical Disability Council of NSW v Sydney City Council   FCA     the applicant requested a O  A r   order after Madgwick J declined to grant the interlocutory injunction sought  This weighed against the exercise of his Honour s discretion to make the order  Unlike the applicant in Physical Disability the applicants have filed the notice of motion at an early stage in the proceedings  This is clearly appropriate  However  the timing means that the extent of the evidence and the costs to be incurred cannot be fully assessed at this stage  If an order is to be made  it is difficult to determine the amount at which costs should be capped   Virgin raises the history of the litigation to date and asserts that a number of steps have been taken unnecessarily because of the way in which the applicants have conducted the proceedings  There have been amendments to the application and to the points of claim and also correspondence in respect of the provision of particulars  Certain claims have been abandoned  The applicants do not really dispute that there has been a somewhat unfortunate procedural history or that any order capping the costs may exclude costs arising from the amendments or that any order under O  A r   should take effect from the date of filing of the notice of motion   The filing of the notice of motion early in the proceedings is relevant as is the procedural history prior to that filing   The existence of a public interest in the determination of the issues in litigation is a factor of some significance in the awarding of costs  However  public interest and an arguable case are not necessarily decisive and not  of themselves  sufficient to prevent the usual costs order being made   Ruddock at     Woodlands at   Physical Disability at    The usual order for costs applies notwithstanding that the Act is beneficial legislation   Fetherston at   per Heerey J   However  discretionary considerations may lead to a different result   Fetherston at     As stated by Madgwick J in Physical Disability at      if proceedings can properly be characterised as public interest litigation  the prime motivation of which is the upholding of the public interest in the rule of law  that may be a factor which contributes to a finding that there are special circumstances justifying a departure from the traditional rule   the characterisation of proceedings in that way is not alone enough to warrant such departure  Something more is required  That additional quality or requirement may be met by its being shown that the unsuccessful moving party had an arguable case and that the case had raised and resolved significant issues as to the interpretation and future administration of a statute dealing with matters of public interest and concern  which has practical implications for relevant sections of the public and for private persons     original emphasis  Virgin says that  while there is an undeniable public interest in people with disabilities having dignified access to goods and services  the applicants do not explain the importance of independent travel for people with disabilities or how the ITC undermine their sense of personal dignity  Virgin points out that persons with disabilities rendering them unable to comply with the ITC may require care during a flight  either from a carer or from one of the airline staff and that the applicants do not explain why the existence of a carer affects their ability to travel independently or their sense of personal dignity   The applicants may not have explained these matters  They may or may not be relevant to a final determination of discrimination  That does not  however  derogate from the public interest in the subject matter of these proceedings citedRegina  Corner House Research  v Secretary for Trade and Industry     W L R    It is of some interest to note that maximum costs orders  also known as protective costs orders  are made in other jurisdictions within the discretion of the court  For example  in the United Kingdom the Court of Appeal has set out the discretionary considerations in Regina  Corner House Research  v Secretary for Trade and Industry     W L R    at   as whether    the case is a public law case raising issues of general public importance     the public interest requires that those issues be resolved     the applicant has no private interest in the outcome of the case     having regard to the financial resources of the applicant and the respondent and the amount of costs that are likely to be involved  it is fair and just to make the order     if the order is not made  the applicant will probably discontinue the proceedings and will be acting reasonably in so doing appliedRuddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR   The general principle is that costs ordinarily follow the event and that a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order   Ruddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR   at   per Black CJ and French J   This reflects the principle that the award of costs to a successful party is principally by way of perceived restorative justice   Ruddock at    In Ruddock at   Black CJ and French J discussed the fact that novel legal issues and public interest litigation are cases where the usual rationale for the award of costs  that the successful party has been wronged at the hands of the losing party  does not necessarily apply  A losing party may  as their Honours point out  have had very good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation in an entirely reasonable way and an order that costs follow the event may work unfairness  It may also  as their Honours observed  pose a significant barrier against parties of modest means even if the contemplated claim has substantial merit   Chief Justice Black and French J said at   that criticisms concerning costs in public interest litigation did not justify a global modification of the usual rule that costs follow the event  but that the ability to exercise discretion is desirable  Further  as noted at   the compensatory principle   was long subject to a limited public interest qualification at common law    The further factor  that a party is deprived of costs because of its conduct of the proceedings  does not presently apply to Virgin  although Virgin submits that the applicants  conduct of the proceedings to date  in the amendment of pleadings and provision of particulars  is relevant   The fact that the proceedings are brought otherwise than for the personal or financial gain of the applicant does not detract from the general proposition that ordinarily costs follow the event   Ruddock at    The fact that litigation can be characterised as being  in the public interest  does not  of itself  mean that the usual order is not made  However  the nature and purpose of the proceedings are still relevant in the exercise of the discretion to award costs and the exercise of the discretion takes account of all of the circumstances   Ruddock at        There is no error in taking into account in a decision whether to award costs matters such as the absence of personal gain on the part of the applicants  the fact that a significant number of members of the public may be affected and that the basis of the challenge is arguable and raises  significant issues  as to the interpretation and application of statutory provisions   Oshlack v Richmond River Council   HCA         CLR   at   per

and    whether there is a public interest element to the case   Woodlands at   Flew at       It cannot be said that the case lacks complexity  As pointed out by Beazley J in Sacks at   the intention on the introduction of O  A r   was to apply the rule principally to commercial litigation at the lower end of the scale in terms of complexity and the amount in dispute  That is  it was introduced to keep costs proportionate in low value litigation  The original object of O  A r   as set out in a letter from the Chief Justice of the Federal Court to the President of the Law Council of Australia regarding the introduction of the rule  was to   define a budget so that the management of the case might be tailored according to its economic limits    cf Sacks at   Flew at    That  however  is not a limitation on the availability of an order  There is no reason why it should not apply  in appropriate situations  to cases that are somewhat complex consideredWoodlands v Permanent Trustee Company Limited     FCR   The parties agree on many of the factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the Court s discretion to make an order under rule    As discussed in the authorities which consider O  A r   and the equivalent provision in the Federal Magistrates Court Rules  the factors include    the timing of the application   Sacks v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR

applicants rely on the grant of legal aid and submit that costs should be capped at the extent of the legal aid indemnity provided to the applicants  as in Woodlands at    Mr Ferguson says that he   may be unable to pursue the litigation in the event of his application being unsuccessful    emphasis added  as he does not have the means to meet an adverse costs order and does not wish to be made a bankrupt  Mr Ferguson says that he is unemployed and in receipt of a Disability Support Pension   Mr Corcoran does have assets and could meet an adverse costs order but does not wish to be forced to sell property and thereby deprive himself and his family of financial security  He wishes to have the costs capped  even if the Court deemed   to be inadequate   The existence of a public interest in the determination of the issues in litigation is a factor of some significance in the awarding of costs  However  public interest and an arguable case are not necessarily decisive and not  of themselves  sufficient to prevent the usual costs order being made   Ruddock at     Woodlands at   Physical Disability at    The usual order for costs applies notwithstanding that the Act is beneficial legislation   Fetherston at   per Heerey J   However  discretionary considerations may lead to a different result   Fetherston at     The relevance of the cost of public interest litigation to an individual was discussed by Wilcox J in Woodlands at    His Honour adopted the approach of Morling J in Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc v Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd     ALR     namely that it was not in the public interest for a litigant to be heavily out of pocket for taking public spirited action  The applicants do not seek financial gain from the litigation  Even if they do intend to fly with Virgin and do not wish to pay for a carer to accompany them  the costs of the litigation far outweigh that cost  so as to render it irrelevant to a question of personal financial  rather than public  benefit   On the pleadings and the accepted facts of the disability of the applicants and their inability to comply with the ITC  the applicants have an arguable case of direct and indirect discrimination under the Act  The questions raised in the pleadings have not previously been considered in the Court and raise novel questions  a relevant factor   Woodlands at    In order to establish direct discrimination  the applicants must establish that the ITC are not reasonable  The factual considerations for an assessment of reasonableness are likely to be coextensive  or at least overlap  with the available defence of unjustifiable hardship in respect of the indirect discrimination claim  The evidence concerning reasonableness unjustifiable hardship is likely to be largely adduced by Virgin  The applicants have indicated the nature of the evidence they intend to adduce and it is in short compass and documentary in form  At this stage of the proceedings  the extent of Virgin s evidence is not apparent  It should be possible for the parties to formulate agreed facts as to some of the matters to be relied on by Virgin  such as statutory requirements  The issues have already been narrowed  If the scope of the factual issues can be further narrowed  the complexity will arise in submissions and in the evaluative process and will not necessarily mean a lengthy final hearing  If that is not the case  I can reconsider the maximum amount of recoverable costs
