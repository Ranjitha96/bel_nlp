represented there is some onus upon a party to be proactive  see  eg  Schiffer v Pattison   FCA   and Farley Smith   AAR   at    However  the solicitor representing the applicant in the circumstances of this case could hardly have been expected to know of the extent of the inadequacy of the translator when the applicant herself was not present to advise him  In an important respect  namely the inadequacy of the translation itself  the solicitor had no basis upon which to be proactive citedNAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe respondent submitted that to the extent that the Tribunal s decision depended on the assessment of the evidence of the applicant s witnesses  there is no evidence to suggest that the Tribunal was unable to make a proper assessment of that evidence  including the sincerity and reliability of the witnesses   NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at    For the reasons indicated above  I reject that submission even if it raises a relevant consideration for my current determination  In light of the inadequacy of the translation  the Tribunal simply could not properly assess the evidence of Ms Yu Lin and undertake the weighing exercise it was required to engage in  I wish to make one further observation as to the evidence before the Tribunal and the approach taken by the Tribunal  The Tribunal relevantly decided that         On   November   an enduring power of attorney was executed by the mother of Ms Eao  Ms Pao Yu Yu Lin  Ms Yu Lin  appointing Ms Eao as her attorney  On   March   Ms Eao executed a Deed of Acknowledgment of Trust both as trustee and as attorney for the beneficiary  Ms Yu Lin  reciting that the property had been purchased on   June   as trustee for the beneficiary  On   April   the property was transferred into the name of Ms Yu Lin alleging her entitlements pursuant to that trust  The transfer of land was executed by Ms Eao as attorney for Ms Yu Lin  Ms Eao acknowledged that  prior to March   no document existed which recorded her as holding the property in trust  whereas a document such as the option agreement warranted that she was the sole owner with no other person having any interest or rights in the property  She said that she had relied on professional advice from those who were aware that the legal owner was her mother                         Ms Yu Lin provided evidence confirming her daughter s evidence that the property had been purchased in the daughter s name but that she was the true owner  Ms Yu Lin said that the   was not a loan but funds for the purchase of the property  She maintained that she was happy to invest in Australia but would not want to benefit one daughter to the detriment of her two other children  She said that she trusted her daughter and was aware of the mortgage as security for loans to other companies  the failure to pay full rent as a result of financial difficulties and the option to sell to Messrs Hughes and Doolan  She said that she had borrowed a part of the   remitted to Australia                         The primary issue before the Tribunal is whether the rental income derived from the property in the three years ended   June   represented assessable income of Ms Eao or Ms Yu Lin  The only evidence of the property being beneficially owned during this period was the oral evidence of the mother  the daughter  the son  the daughter s de facto partner and his business partner   The only documentary contemporaneous evidence was a telegraphic transfer order  transferring   from Ms Yu Lin to the account of Ms Eao  The evidence pointing to beneficial ownership by Ms Eao or evidence indicating concern of acceptance of the above oral evidence included              a  Notwithstanding that the ownership arrangements were made with legal advice  no documentary evidence existed prior to   of any trust relationship  All prior documentation was to the contrary               b    of the purchase costs was borrowed directly in Australia by Ms Eao for no apparent consideration by Ms Yu Lin               c  Ms Yu Lin was prevented from acquiring land in Australia in                 d  An apparent informal acceptance of non payment of rent               e  The use of the property to provide security for borrowings of two other companies associated with Mr Hughes for no apparent consideration               f  Payment of  at least  some rent into the same bank account of Ms Eao  While the majority of the rent was paid into an account in the name of Ms Yu Lin  Ms Eao was the signatory on this account and there is no evidence of the subsequent disposition of the funds credited to that account               g  Ms Eao was employed by Superior Hide and was the person primarily responsible for recording payments and receipts of that business               h  The statement attributed to Mr Hughes at the interview with the ATO auditor in October   that the property was owned by Ms Eao               i  The evidence of Ms Yu Lin that                I would never want to benefit my daughter at the expense of my other two children  I would only ever invest any money if it would be for the benefit of my children jointly and then only after my passing                  This is at odds with the acceptance of non payment of rent and allowing the property to be used as security for personal guarantees                 j  The letter from Walker   Company in July   indicating the rent payments were interest on a loan from Ms Yu Lin     Emphasis added                On balance  I am satisfied that the applicant has not discharged the required onus of proof that she was not the beneficial owner of the property during the relevant period and that the amended assessments were excessive   It is unnecessary for the Tribunal to make a finding as to whether the   was a loan or gift to Ms Eao  It is appropriate to note that the actual source of the funds was not clearly demonstrated  It is accepted that it is possible the funds were by way of loan with the rental payments in lieu of interest and the subsequent transfer of the property to Ms Yu Lin in   being consideration for repayment of the principal  However  the full circumstances are something known only to the family     Emphasis added  As I have alluded to previously  it is apparent from the above extracts that the Tribunal did not explain its process of balancing the evidence set out by the Tribunal in sub paragraphs  a   j   The Court cannot ascertain to what extent the important evidence of Ms Yu Lin as translated had any impact on the balancing process  one way or another  In view of the failures of the translation process  the Tribunal could not make any proper assessment of the evidence  even allowing for the fact that the Tribunal was aware of the flaws in the process it had adopted citedO Sullivan v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSection   of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal apply notions

FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn my view  the evidence of Ms Yu Lin was effectively precluded from being properly presented because of the inadequacy of the translator

Tribunal is not obliged to undertake the  impossible task  of ensuring that a party takes best advantage of the opportunity to which he or she is entitled  see Sullivan   ALR   at   per Deane J
