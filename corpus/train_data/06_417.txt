of a further delay in the carrying out of the scheme contained in Part VAA by sending these matters to a Committee in the absence of any evidence whatsoever of jurisdictional error on the part of the Committee  What the respondents seek to do is to prevent the processes of the Court from being abused and to protect the integrity of its processes  see Cigna at     Of course  I have no view either way as to whether there was a live issue raised by Drs Do and Ho in the Committee although it must be noted that Mr Robinson conceded before me on the hearing of these motions that these matters are not  in the main  concerned with Regulation  b    I therefore propose to give the applicants and the respondents an opportunity to address me on the question of whether Dr Do or Dr Ho relied on Regulation  b  before the Committee  I recognise  as did the Full Court in Oreb   that it may not have been necessary for the applicants to have referred specifically to Regulation  b   However  it should appear from the transcript  the evidence and the written submissions  whether the practitioners may be taken to have relied on that Regulation referred toHealth Insurance Commission v Grey   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There is a substantial public interest in the prompt resolution of matters arising under Part VAA of the Act  As the Full Court said in Health Insurance Commission v Grey   FCAFC         FCR   at   the object of the scheme is to protect patients and the Commonwealth against abuse of the system   It would therefore be contrary to the public interest and  as I have said  contrary to the underlying purpose of the Order  to permit it to be used so as to further delay the resolution of these matters unless there is a live issue as to the application of Regulation  b  with evidence that the issue was in fact before the relevant Committee at the time of the hearings in     Order   was expressed as an agreement but it took effect as a consent order referred toOreb v Willcock   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I have before me two Notices of Motion filed by the respondents on   March   seeking dismissal of these proceedings pursuant to an order which I made on   December    The order which I made provided that subject to certain exceptions which are not presently relevant  the parties accepted that the outcome of the proceedings turned solely upon the result of an appeal from my judgment in Oreb v Willcock   FCA    The respondents contend that the result of the appeal leads to the dismissal of the present proceedings   My judgment in Dr Oreb s matter was handed down three days before the making of the order of   December    It dealt with an application for judicial review of three decisions made at separate stages of the peer review based Professional Services Review Scheme established by Part VAA of the Health Insurance Act    Cth   the Act     I dismissed Dr Oreb s challenge to an investigative referral made under s   of the Act as well as his challenge to an adjudicative referral made under s    However  I made an order setting aside the finding of Professional Services Review Committee No   that Dr Oreb had engaged in inappropriate practice  I did so because I found that the relevant Committee had erred in its construction of the  exceptional circumstances  exception contained in s  KA  of the Act and Regulation  b  of the Health Insurance  Professional Services Review  Regulations    the Regulations   and that it had taken into account an irrelevant consideration  in asking itself whether the circumstances relied upon by Dr Oreb were foreseeable   Counsel for the parties then agreed to the making of orders which included the following       Subject to issues raised in the constitutional argument  and except for the  racial issue  in the two Lee matters  N  and N  all of the parties in the remaining proceedings  Wong  Do  Ho  Lee  Lee and Bartos  accept that the outcome of the proceedings turn solely upon the result of the appeal in Oreb  being an appeal of the judgment contained in Oreb v Willcock   FCA           On the basis of this agreement  the hearings listed in the week of   December   in the matters Wong  Do  Ho  Lee  Lee and Bartos  are vacated with the exception of two Lee matters  N  and N  which are listed on   December     The statutory scheme under Part VAA of the Act was set out in some detail in the reasons for judgment of Lander J in Oreb   It is unnecessary to repeat the extensive terms of the relevant provisions  However  for convenience  I will set out the provisions of   s  KA of the Act and Regulation     Section  KA provides as follows           Subject to subsections   and  A  if  during a particular period  the relevant period   the circumstances in which some or all of the referred services were rendered or initiated constituted a prescribed pattern of services  the conduct of the person under review in connection with rendering or initiating services during that period in those circumstances is taken  for the purposes of this Part  to have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice        If the person under review satisfies the Committee that  on a particular day or particular days during the relevant period  exceptional circumstances existed that affected the rendering or initiating of services by the person  the person s conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services on that day or those days is not taken by subsection   to have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice       A  However  subsection   does not affect the operation of subsection   in respect of the remaining day or days during the relevant period on which the person rendered or initiated referred services even if the circumstances in which the referred services were rendered or initiated on that day or those days would not  if considered alone  have constituted a prescribed pattern of services        The regulations may prescribe  in relation to             a  a particular profession  or          b  an identified group or groups of practitioners in a particular profession              circumstances in which services of a particular kind or description that are rendered or initiated constitute  or do not constitute  a prescribed pattern of services for the purposes of subsection          The circumstances that may be prescribed under subsection   as circumstances in which services that are rendered or initiated constitute a prescribed pattern of services include  but are not limited to  the rendering or initiation of more than a specified number of services  or more than a specified number of services of a particular kind  on each of more than a specified number of days during a period of a specified duration                The circumstances that constitute exceptional circumstances for the purposes of subsection   include  but are not limited to  circumstances that are declared by the regulations to be exceptional circumstances                This section only applies to services rendered or initiated after the commencement of this section                This section does not preclude the Committee from making a finding under this Subdivision  other than section  KB  in relation to conduct during a particular period in connection with rendering or initiating services without considering whether or not the circumstances in which the services were rendered or initiated constituted a prescribed pattern of services  referred toOreb v Willcock   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The decision of the Full Court on the appeal was handed down on   September   see Oreb v Willcock   FCAFC     Oreb       Dr Oreb s appeal against my findings in relation to the investigative referral and the adjudicative referral was dismissed  The cross appeal  though stated in the order of the Federal Court to have been allowed  failed in substance  It succeeded only on the form of one of the orders which I made at first instance   The respondents  contention that the application of Dr Do  Dr Do  and or Dr Ho  Dr Ho  must be dismissed is put in two ways  First  it is said to follow from the dismissal of Dr Oreb s appeal  Second  it is said to follow from the reasons given by the Full Court for dismissing the cross appeal citedRepatriation Commission v Nation     FCR   The meaning of Order   is to be ascertained by the ordinary rules of construction  It is appropriate  in accordance with the accepted rules of construction to construe the order in the context in which it was made  Repatriation Commission v Nation     FCR   at       The context in which the order was made appears  at least in part  from the transcript of   December    This shows that the parties proceeded on the basis that all issues  whether of fact or law  in the remaining cases would be resolved by the result of the appeal in Oreb   Thus  the outcome of the appeal in Oreb   expressed in the orders of the Full Court  would  without more  determine the outcome of the remaining proceedings  including the matters of Dr Do and Dr Ho   There is nothing surprising about this approach to the meaning of my order because  construed in this way   result  is given its ordinary English meaning  Moreover  this is reinforced by the use of the word  solely  which shows that the intention of the parties was that there were no new issues of fact or law to be determined in the remaining proceedings referred toWong v Professional Services Review Committee No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Wong v Professional Services Review Committee No     FCA     I refused to make an order setting aside Order   to permit Dr Wong to run a fresh ground of review which was said to be previously unknown to the legal advisers   It is true as I said in Wong at   that the principle of finality of litigation applies to interlocutory orders  subject to the moving party establishing that new facts have come into existence  In the present case it cannot be said that new facts have been discovered which could not have been known on   December    Rather  through no fault of the legal advisers of the parties  the reasoning process of the Full Court in Oreb opened up a distinction between the construction of s  KA  and Regulation   which had not previously been drawn
