edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Krampel Newman Partners Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at       Ryan J concluded that s  ZZN of the TAA does not evince an intention contrary to the effect of s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  which is that the singular includes the plural  I respectfully agree  Thus  there is nothing in s  ZZN of the TAA which forbids the inclusion in the form of initiating application which is lodged with this Court of appeals against more than one objection decision   Krampel Newman concerned objection decisions each of which related to objections against income tax assessments  Does it make any difference here that one of the primary tax liabilities is in respect of income tax and the other is in respect of a net amount for the purposes of the GST Act   In my opinion it does not  for the following additional reasons   Another feature of s  ZZN is that it makes indifferent  generic provision for an appeal in respect of whatever constitutes an  appealable objection decision  as defined  That definition is to be found in s  ZQ of the TAA  The effect of that definition is that  subject to an exception that is of no present relevance  an  appealable objection decision  is any  objection decision  another term defined by s  ZQ  That definition  in turn  directs one to s  ZY  of the TAA  Again subject to an exception of no present relevance  the effect of that subsection is that an  objection decision  is any decision of the Commissioner in respect of a  taxation objection    Taxation objection  too  is a defined term  again  s  ZQ  and that definition provides that a  taxation objection  has the meaning given in s  ZL  I have already made some reference above to s  ZL  It suffices to add that the effect of s  ZL  is that an objection to which Part IVC of the TAA applies is a  taxation objection    By this circuitous path the position reached is that each of the objection decisions with which Mr Russell is dissatisfied and to which he refers in the application he filed may be the subject of an appeal to this court under s  ZZN of the TAA  Each is an  appealable objection decision   There is nothing in s  ZZN which explicitly mandates that an  appeal  lodged with the Court is competent only if it concerns one or more assessments in respect of the same type of taxation liability

citedPeerless Marine Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   AATA         ATR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  Moreover  the prospect that out of a single investigation by the Commissioner s staff there might emerge controversies in respect of both a GST and an income tax liability is by no means remote  The present case apart  in Peerless Marine Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   AATA         ATR   what emerged from the one investigation was a controversy as to whether the taxpayer was carrying on a business such that it was entitled to allowable deductions for expenditure incurred in the construction of what was alleged to be a prototype for a class of luxury motor cruiser and a related GST controversy as to whether  in respect of that same expenditure  it was entitled to input tax credits  The taxpayer elected to challenge the objection decisions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  Tribunal  rather than in this Court and the Tribunal heard and determined the GST and income tax controversies together  Had it sought to appeal those decisions  s  ZZN of the TAA would have permitted the joinder of those appeals in the one application  in my opinion  A construction of s  ZZN which would facilitate such joinder has about it such an obvious convenience and practicality that it is to be preferred to one which would not   Thus  the mere fact that Mr Russell has chosen to join in the one form of application appeals in respect of both income tax and GST assessments and related administrative penalty assessments does not  of itself render any of the appeals incompetent   That is not to say that the adoption of such a course binds the Court to hear each of the appeals together  On some occasions it may be convenient to hear and determine a GST appeal together with an income tax appeal  on other occasions it may not be  Order  B r   incorporates by reference  inter alia  the directions hearing provision made by O  A r

only joint  the Commissioner s submission might have some attraction  Under the general law of partnership  and prior to the death of any of the partners  every partner in a firm is liable jointly with the other partners for all debts and obligations of the firm incurred while a partner  s   of the Partnership Act    Qld   The rules of court provide that  subject to any grant of leave to the contrary  where an applicant claims relief to which any other person is entitled jointly with him  all persons so entitled shall be parties with him  O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   Further  O   r   of the Federal Court Rules permits a claim brought by two or more persons claiming as partners to be brought in the name of the partnership  When so brought any party may apply on notice to be furnished with the names and places of residence of those who were partners at the time when the cause of action arose  O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   It is possible for a partner to institute proceedings in the name of the partnership without the prior consent of his fellow partners but  if such a course of action is taken  the court may direct that the proceeding be stayed until that partner has given his fellow partners a full indemnity  together with security in respect of costs  Seal and Edgelaw v Kingston     KB   at   consideredSutherland v Gustar  Inspector of Taxes    Ch   As it happens  in Sutherland v Gustar  Inspector of Taxes    Ch     an analogous controversy arose in the United Kingdom in respect of the competency of the purported institution of an appeal by one partner  against the wishes of his fellow partners  who had reached an agreement satisfactory to them with the Inspector of Taxes  in respect of a joint assessment of the partnership to income tax which had been confirmed by the general commissioners  Under the then applicable legislation in the United Kingdom  a partner s liability to income tax was joint  The then Vice Chancellor  Sir Donald Nicholls  who delivered the judgement of the Court of Appeal  Nicholls V C  Leggatt and Henry LJJ  identified the problem raised in that case in a way which resonates in the present     Partners  do not always have the same interest in challenging an assessment  What is important to one partner may not matter to another  Similar divergences of interest  and differences of view about what is the best course for the partnership  can and do arise regarding other aspects of partnership business  Here  as elsewhere in the law  the courts evolved practical solutions  In the context of litigation  the courts devised procedures which protect a would be plaintiff partner by permitting him to go ahead with court proceedings but also protect the partners who do not wish to become embroiled in the proceedings  The traditional means used to achieve this end was for the minority partner to be permitted to bring the proceedings in the name of the partnership  Every partner is an agent of the firm  a principle now enshrined in section   of the Partnership Act         Vict  c     But the other partners had to be protected by an adequate indemnity     Ch at     Section   of the Partnership Act    UK  finds its local analogue in s   of the Partnership Act    Qld    The Court of Appeal solved the problem thus posed by construing the statutory procedural code for the institution of taxation appeals in a way which enabled any person assessed to tax to institute an appeal in respect of the assessment irrespective of whether he had been assessed alone or jointly with others  In the case of an appeal against a joint assessment  Their Lordships opined     In the latter case  in contemplation of law the notice of appeal is given on behalf of all those assessed in the sense  but only in the sense  that the notice effectually triggers an appeal against the joint assessment  This does not enable the person giving the notice then to conduct the appeal as though he were acting for all the partners  He has authority only to act and speak for himself  unless his co partners authorise him to act for them  If they do not  and if they wish to pursue a different line  they may do so  But an appeal against the joint assessment having been set in motion  they  along with the partner who gave the notice of appeal  are appellants for the purposes of the Act of    Accordingly  notice of the hearing must be given to them  and their concurrence is needed if the appeal is to be settled or abandoned pursuant to section       Ch at     Primacy must  of course  be given to the language of the applicable Australian legislation  Nonetheless  were liability in respect of a GST assessment joint  there would  with respect  be much to commend in the adoption of a similar approach to that adopted in Sutherland v Gustar to the construction of the right to appeal to this Court against an objection decision conferred by s  ZZ of the TAA on a  person dissatisfied  and in related practice and procedure  The  person dissatisfied  with the Commissioner s objection decision in respect of a GST assessment might well  for just the reasons identified by the Court of Appeal in Sutherland v Gustar   be but one of a number of partners   Yet a partner s liability in respect of GST and any related administrative penalty is not just joint  but rather joint and several  Within Schedule   to the TAA  s      provides  materially          Partnerships           Obligations that are imposed under this Schedule or an indirect tax law on a partnership are imposed on each partner  but may be discharged by any of the partners      The partners are jointly and severally liable to pay any amount that is payable under this Schedule or an indirect tax law by the partnership   Prior to the introduction of this provision into Schedule   the now repealed provisions formerly found in ss   and   of the TAA made identical provision in respect of the GST liability of partners  It would seem incongruous in these circumstances to construe the right of appeal conferred by s  ZZ of the TAA as being dependent upon the consent of each partner or even to require that each other partner be given notice of a challenge to an objection decision by one of them
