Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications  Information Technology and the Arts   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toGlobal Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Whilst Order  A makes no provision as to the means whereby discovery should be given by a party such as the Minister to a party such as Telstra  it seems clear to me that discovery must be given in the manner for which Order   rule   provides  namely        Unless the Court or a Judge orders otherwise  a party must give discovery by serving               a  a list of documents required to be disclosed  and      b  an affidavit verifying the list        Mansfield J expressed the same view in Global Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust   FCA   at      The form of the list of documents may  in my opinion  be taken to have been regulated by Order   rule   which relevantly provides        A list of documents required by or under this Order shall  unless the Court otherwise orders  be in accordance with Form   and conform to the requirements of this rule                A list of documents shall enumerate the documents which are     in the possession     of the party making the list        A list of documents shall enumerate the documents in a convenient sequence and as shortly as possible  but shall describe each document or  in the case of a group of documents of the same nature  shall describe the group  sufficiently to enable the document or group to be identified              Where a party making a list of documents has a solicitor in the proceeding  the solicitor shall certify on the list that  according to his instructions  the list and the statements in the list are correct   Form   of course  provides for documents to be enumerated one by one in either Schedule   Part   Schedule   Part   or Schedule   of the relevant list  The operative words in Form   are         The party has in his possession     the documents enumerated in Schedule           The documents enumerated in Part   of Schedule   are privileged from production

Contractors Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    Tyco  Hill J said at         While there is nothing in the procedural requirements of O  A  r   that deal with the filing by a respondent to an application for pre action discovery of affidavit evidence in opposition  it has never been suggested that such affidavits could not be filed  One example where affidavits were filed was Conrock Ltd v CSR Ltd     ALR    In that case  Pincus J finally made no order for costs against the respondent  notwithstanding that the applicant was successful  The affidavits went to the question of confidentiality of documents as well as a claim that compliance with the pre action discovery would be oppressive and onerous  In Legent Corp v Fundi Software Services Pty Ltd  unreported  Federal Court  Lockhart J  No G  of     July   affidavit evidence was filed by both the applicant and respondent and cross examination was foreshadowed  However  the matter settled  Justice Lockhart observed  at   that the parties could not necessarily assume that they would have a right to cross examine  His Honour cites no authority for this proposition  Perhaps what his Honour meant was that the Court would control  in its discretion  the extent of cross examination  having regard to the issue between the parties  One can only speculate        It would seem  also  that notices to produce have been issued in other pre action discovery proceedings  It seems that Gummow J in Aitken v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd     FCR   allowed the issue of a notice to produce and that it was answered  Likewise  it would seem that a notice to produce was issued in Legent and in CGU   CGU Insurance Ltd v Malaysia International Shipping Corp Berhad   FCA     It is not clear from the report of Aitken or Legent that any argument was directed at the question whether a notice to produce could issue and in those circumstances it is difficult to treat these cases as authority for the view that there is power to issue a notice  On the other hand  it is perhaps not irrelevant that it is only since CCA Beverages   CCA Beverages  Adelaide  Ltd v Hansford  unreported Federal Court  S G  of   O Loughlin J    November   that there was thought to be a difficulty with that power        However  for the reasons I have given  I am of the view that there is power to issue  in an appropriate case  a notice to produce in pre action discovery proceedings  Whether the notice should be confined clearly depends upon the issues that are said to arise and in respect of which the production of documents is sought  An applicant who seeks to use a notice to produce  in effect  to gain production of the very documents which are the subject of the pre action discovery will not have given the notice to produce in good faith  but rather  will have acted in a way that is an abuse of process  Otherwise  in principle at least  the notice to produce procedure may be exercised by both parties if otherwise relevant to issues in dispute  However  I would emphasise that it clearly is not contemplated that a pre action discovery proceeding become a full blown factual contest between the parties  The judge hearing the application will  no doubt  confine cross examination and examine the subject matter of any notice to produce to ensure this does not become the case   Hely J recorded his general agreement with Hill J s reasons  At   his Honour said     Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O  A for preliminary discovery  St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd     ALR    There is no reason why the ordinary interlocutory procedures should not be available to assist in the resolution of those contestable issues of fact  subject to the overriding consideration that the invocation of those procedures does not amount to an abuse of the process of the Court  Kimberley Mineral Holdings Ltd  in liq  v McEwan     NSWLR    Thus  at least prima facie  it would be an abuse of process for an applicant for preliminary discovery to seek to compel the production of documents by notice to produce  when the production of those documents is sought under O  A  r    But it does not follow  for example  that a subpoena sought to be issued by an applicant for preliminary discovery against a third party would necessarily be an abuse  depending upon the scope and purpose of the subpoena   It may be seen from what has been said above that the Minister s Notice to Produce served on Telstra could hardly amount to an abuse of process in the sense indicated in the passages from Tyco quoted above  A potential abuse of process might have arisen were Telstra to have issued a Notice to Produce to the Minister requiring the production of the very documents which a discovery order may identify   Telstra s objection to the Minister s Notice to Produce urged that  none of the documents sought in the Notice are relevant to the issues in the present proceeding    The Minister s original Notice to Produce dated   August   called for the production of documents covered by   separate paragraphs  By a Notice of Motion filed   August   Telstra sought an order that the initial Notice to Produce dated   August   be set aside followedAlphapharm Pty Limited v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In support of its proposed redefinition of paragraphs     in the Minister s third Notice to Produce dated   August   Telstra relied upon the decision of Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Limited v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited   FCA    Alphapharm    Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited apparently wrote a letter dated   April   to pharmacists throughout Australia in relation to Alphapharm Pty Limited s anti depressant drug  Zactin  and Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited s competing anti depressant drug  Prozac  which had been on the market for a much longer time than Zactin  Alphapharm Pty Limited complained to Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited about the letter  Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited s solicitors responded to the effect that their client had in its possession material which fully supported the allegations  This led Alphapharm Pty Limited to apply for an order pursuant to Order  A rule   of the Rules for discovery by Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited of such material so that Alphapharm Pty Limited would be able to decide whether to commence a proceeding in the Court against Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited alleging that the letter was misleading or deceptive in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth    In his reasons for judgment Lindgren J made certain observations concerning Order  A rule   as follows         Paragraphs    a  and    c  pose an objective test  the opening words  there is  in each paragraph signifying  there exists  but the  insufficiency test  of para    b  has both subjective and objective aspects                 Although I need not explore the subjective aspect fully  it seems clear that if the evidence went so far as to show that a particular applicant was already able to decide to commence a proceeding by  for example  showing that the applicant had in fact decided to do so  para    b  would not be satisfied even though the information available did not satisfy the objective aspect of the insufficiency test referred to below                 The fact that a particular applicant genuinely feels unable  because of a lack of information  to decide to commence a proceeding does not  without more  satisfy para    b  the objective aspect of the paragraph requires it to be shown as an objective fact that the applicant lacks  sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding                  In my view  the objective aspect of para    b  invokes a notion of  reasonable sufficiency  the question raised being whether it is reasonable that the applicant for an order be required to take its decision without having the information to become available from inspection of the document or documents of which discovery is sought                 If the insufficiency test is satisfied  a second question will arise  namely  whether the Court s discretion should be exercised in favour of the making of an order                 The questions posed by rule   and referred to above are to be answered in the context of an adversary system of forensic contest in which a proposed respondent is ordinarily entitled to withhold its evidence  certainly prior to the commencement of proceedings         The questions are also to be answered in the light of the nature of the  cause of action  contemplated and the range of information potentially available in respect of a cause of action of that kind                 Contrary to a submission of Eli Lilly  in my opinion rule   is not necessarily rendered unavailable by the fact that the applicant already has available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief  This is made clear by the reference in para  a  to the existence of  reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has     the right to obtain relief       emphasis supplied   It would impose an artificial constraint on rule     not supported by its terms or purpose  to exclude  a priori   all cases in which the insufficiency of the information possessed by the applicant to enable a decision to be made whether to litigate is due to a matter of  defence  which would defeat the prima facie case                 Rule   does not provide a means by which an applicant will be enabled to have available to it every document which would assist it in deciding whether to litigate  If that were the intention  paras  a  and  c  would stand alone and the additional condition set out in para  b  would not be necessary                 Paragraph    b  contemplates that after making all reasonable inquiries  the applicant has come up against a problem  namely  that it is lacking a piece of information or pieces of information reasonably necessary to enable it to decide whether to commence a proceeding   As I understood Telstra s submission  it contended that production of a document could be required if it showed that a decision had in fact been made by it to commence a proceeding against the Minister or the Commonwealth to obtain relief in the Court  It asserted that production could not be required of documents recording or referring to consideration by Telstra as to whether it should commence a legal challenge or legal proceedings  but it acknowledged that documents recording or referring to its ability to decide whether to commence such a challenge or proceedings would properly be amenable to a Notice to Produce calling for their production   It seems to me that an assertion that a subpoena and or a notice to produce should be set aside if it calls for the production of documents which do not answer the description of being  relevant  involves a misconception as to what the proper function of a subpoena and or notice to produce is   Given the terms of Mr Smith s affidavit sworn   August   upon which Telstra intends to rely on the hearing of its Amended Application under Order  A rule     I consider the documents identified in the said paragraphs to have sufficient apparent relevance to be amenable to a notice to produce at this stage  Senior counsel for Telstra was at pains to explain that much of what was contained in Mr Smith s affidavit was there simply to provide background and had only tangential relevance  This cri de coeur does not mean that the Minister may not challenge the factual background which is relevant to those issues which need to be addressed objectively and or subjectively on the hearing of the Order  A rule   application and to which Lindgren J made reference in Alphapharm    As to the scope of the requirement imposed by the said paragraphs  it is appropriate to observe that the Minister s third Notice to Produce dated   August   is significantly scaled down from the requirement sought to be imposed by the Minister s second Notice to Produce dated   August    Plainly  the Minister has had regard to much of the material to which Mr Healy deposed in his affidavit sworn   August   in narrowing down her requirement  In his affidavit sworn   August   Mr Healy said  inter alia        I am informed by Paul Smith  Business Development Manager employed by Telstra  and believe that                     b  having regard to the   categories of documents of which production is sought  in order to comply with the Notice  Telstra would be required to review a very large number of documents in Telstra s possession that refer or relate to the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program   Program   to determine which of those documents fall within the terms of the Notice  The following facts are relevant             i  Mr Smith has in his email mailbox approximately   emails    to   boxes of hard copy documents and   electronic documents all of which relate to the Program                   ii  there were approximately   other Telstra employees who formed the core team responsible for developing Telstra s proposal in relation to the Program                   iii  there were approximately   other Telstra employees who had input into Telstra s proposal  not including members of the Telstra Executive Team who are considered below                   iv  The Telstra employees who had input into Telstra s proposal were located in offices in at least Sydney   buildings  Brisbane   buildings  Melbourne   buildings  Adelaide   building  Perth   building  Canberra   building  and Darwin   building  and      v  a number of the Telstra employees who had input into Telstra s proposal no longer work for Telstra             c  in order to comply with category   of the Notice  Telstra would be required to review at least all documents in Telstra s possession held by             i  the   Telstra employees who attended the Industry Briefing       ii  the at least   additional Telstra employees who Mr Smith informed of the Industry Briefing       iii  any other Telstra employees who were informed of the Industry Briefing  including by any of the persons referred to in  i  and  ii  above            that refer or relate to the Program from   September   onwards to determine which documents record communications within Telstra  relating to  the Industry Briefing between Telstra and DCITA on   September   or record  any decisions made by Telstra resulting from  that Briefing  This is necessary because              of the breadth of the phrase  relating to  in sub paragraph  a  of category         category   is not limited to documents in the possession of certain persons within Telstra  and       category   is not limited to any date range other than being  after    September              d  in order to comply with category   of the Notice  Telstra would be required to review all documents referring or relating to the Program which are in the possession of at least             i  Mr Smith       ii  the other Telstra employees who formed the core team responsible for developing Telstra s proposal in relation to the Program            from at least   September    when the Guidelines in relation to the Program were released  until at least   June   when Telstra received the letter dated   June   from the Respondent advising Telstra that its bid had been unsuccessful for reasons including coverage  and      e  in order to comply with category   of the Notice  Telstra would be required to review at least all documents in Telstra s possession held by                       i  Mr Smith             ii  the at least   persons whom Mr Smith either immediately forwarded a copy of DCITA s letter of   June   to  or discussed the letter with                   iii  the   Telstra employees Mr Smith is aware received a copy  other than directly from him  of DCITA s letter of   June                    iv  any other Telstra employees who received a copy of  or were informed of the contents of  DCITA s letter of   June   including by any of the persons referred to in  ii  and  iii  above            for the period from   June   onwards to determine whether a document records  a consideration  by Telstra of DCITA s letter of   June     It may be observed that the Minister s third Notice to Produce  Ex AM  has introduced time frames limiting the documents  the production of which has been sought  and also confining the documents sought to ones recording communications and consideration at the level of what Mr Healy described as  core team  members and or members of Telstra s  Executive Team  and above

Jordan C J  pointed out in Small s case  The Commissioner for Railways v Small     SR  NSW    and  as appears in Burchard s case  Burchard v Macfarlane     QB   there are at least two steps in the procedure of having a third party bring documents to court  and in their use thereafter  Indeed  on a correct view  there are three steps  The first is obeying the subpoena  by the witness bringing the documents to the court and handing them to the judge  This step involves the determination of any objections of the witness to the subpoena  or to the production of the documents to the court pursuant to the subpoena  The second step is the decision of the judge concerning the preliminary use of the documents  which includes whether or not permission should be given to a party or parties to inspect the documents  The third step is the admission into evidence of the document in whole or in part  or the use of it in the process of evidence being put before the court by cross examination or otherwise  It is the third step which alone provides material upon which ultimate decision in the case rests  In these three steps the stranger and the parties have different rights  and the function of the judge differs  consideredSeven Network Limited v News Limited  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Once documents have been produced to the court  any objections to their production having been rejected  the documents are in the control of the court  At this stage the person producing the documents may state that he objects to them being handed to a party seeking access to them for inspection  Documents should not go beyond the judge against the objection of the owner  unless there is valid reason to do so  Subject to matters such as confidentiality  it is for the judge  as part of the second step  to determine whether the documents appear relevant in the sense that they relate to the subject matter of the proceedings  in which event the judge will permit inspection by one or both parties at an appropriate time  The question of their admissibility without more  in accordance with the rules of evidence  does not then arise  per Moffitt P in Waind s case at     cf per Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited  No     FCA   at       The ultimate question of whether any documents are ruled to be relevant and or admissible is left to the third stage of receiving evidence  As part of the second step inspection may be allowed  notwithstanding that a given document is not admissible as it stands  and notwithstanding that the party seeking inspection has not given any undertaking to tender it or use it in cross examination  per Moffitt P in Waind s case at     If a person wishes to resist production to the court of documents under a subpoena or in response to a notice to produce  objection should be taken as part of what Moffitt P describes as  the first step   Available grounds for objection to production include     a  that the documents called for are the documents of title of the party burdened with production   b  that the documents are privileged from production on the ground of self incrimination   c  that the documents are privileged from production on the ground of legal professional privilege   d  that the documents are required for some spurious purpose unconnected with the litigation   e  that the subpoena or notice to produce is oppressive in the sense that it is so wide as to impose an onerous task on the party burdened with production to collect and produce documents  many of which could have no apparent relevance to the litigation appliedThe Commissioner for Railways v Small     SR  NSW    As Moffitt P  with whose judgment Hutley and Glass
