Ltd  in liq    NSWSC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlIn Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd  in liq    NSWSC         ALR     Campbell J noted  at   that an alternative approach is to give the indemnifying creditor an advantage calculated as a percentage of the investment that that creditor made in funding the litigation  His Honour noted that in assessing that percentage  one would need to take into account that the indemnifying creditor had not only a risk of losing the investment made  but also a risk of being liable to pay other expenses of the liquidator and the liquidator s solicitors  and possibly the costs of the other side  Campbell J noted  at   that the funding creditor s entitlement could be compared  as a rough check  to the premium that would have been demanded by a litigation funder  RGH submits that the Transactions Proceeding  although apparently complex  was not risky  RGH submits that there is no evidence before the Court that it was considered to be risky  although I note that in para  b  of Mr Chamberlain s affidavit of   August   he claims there was a significant exposure to the risk of an adverse costs order  RGH submits that the Court should infer that if evidence to that effect was available  Mr Chamberlain would have adduced it  RGH also makes the following submissions At paras     of his written submission  Mr Docker  counsel for RGH  makes the following helpful submissions  Taking the first approach set out in   above  a percentage of the funds remaining after payment of priority debts and claims  an appropriate percentage of the net funds available for distribution which should be allocated for advantage to the DCT is   rd       The effect of this approach would be as follows  the DCT would be entitled to   rd of the total amount available      being     by way of priority  the balance of the DCT s debt  being          sic        will rank with the other unsecured debts  the total of the non priority unsecured debts will be                 the total available for distribution to the non priority unsecured debts will be               the percentage recovery on unsecured debts will be           x   this means that  the DCT will get a total of               which is     of its debt  RG H will get     which is     of its debt  and Hardys   sic  will get     which is     of their debt   If the alternative method referred to in   above is used  a percentage of the investment made by the indemnifying creditor in providing funding  and the priority is calculated by reference to the amount invested by the DCT      the above approach is supported  That is  the DCT will be receiving in priority an amount     which is more than   times the amount it invested as well as being reimbursed for the amount it invested   A third way of checking the approach is by reference to what a litigation funder would have received  If the figure of   of the amount recovered is used  although the examples in Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd     suggest the figure is often lower  the amount the DCT would receive     exceeds   of the recovery of     The above figures do not take account of when the distributions will be made  The instalment payments add a level of complexity to the exercise  In short  the DCT should share the burden of the late payments with the other unsecured creditors  Presumably  the DCT was consulted about the settlement which resulted in the instalment regime  However  if the DCT seeks to be paid immediately  it should receive less   Assuming the creditors all share in the delay  this would mean that the current amount available for distribution would be treated as one distribution and so would each instalment payment  For example  if   was available for distribution now  DCT would get   rd   being   as a priority  and the other   would be distributed rateably amongst the   unsecured creditors in accordance with their non priority debts   In an example with   the DCT would get   as a priority and the remaining   would be distributed rateably amongst the   unsecured creditors in accordance with their non priority debts  Mr Dawson  counsel for Mr Chamberlain  submits that the merits based standing of the DCT as funding creditor outweighs that of RGH and the Hardys in the following respects in particular  RGH elected not to lodge a proof of debt until the settlement of the Transactions Proceeding in November   immediately prior to the scheduled hearing  The DCT entered into the Indemnities in circumstances in which it was the only creditor who had lodged a proof of debt in the winding up  and it is not  just  for the purposes of s   to recognise the interests of RGH asserted at such a late stage over those of the DCT  as noted above  there is no evidence that RGH would have funded the Transactions Proceeding  and the Hardys  being the only other creditor  do not oppose the DCT s application  In my opinion  RGH s submissions understate the risk that was associated with the Transactions Proceeding  The pleadings are in evidence  They include a second further amended statement of claim and the separate defences of the first to sixth defendants and the seventh to twelfth defendants  The plaintiffs were the Company and Mr Chamberlain as its liquidator  The first to sixth defendants were the Hardy interests and the seventh to twelfth were the Company s accountants citedState Bank of New South Wales v Brown   ACSR  In the Earlier Reasons  I referred  at   to State Bank of New South Wales v Brown   ACSR   and
