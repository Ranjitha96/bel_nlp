Finance Committee   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAn important aspect of the inquiry as to whether it would be expedient in the interests of justice to allow the appellant to raise before this Court an issue not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court is the apparent merit of the issue  The appellant placed reliance on the High Court decisions in Pyrenees Shire Council v Day   HCA         CLR   and Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee   HCA         ALR    These cases concerned the law of negligence  it was in that private law context that the High Court gave consideration in each case to whether an affirmative common law duty of care required a statutory or public authority to exercise a power  The present case by contrast concerns public law principles of judicial review appliedMinister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Khawar   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlUnderstandably  the appellant s supplementary written submissions do not suggest that the Tribunal knew or ought to have known that the appellant had approached or would approach the Jordanian Embassy in Canberra  It was at the heart of the appellant s claim to be entitled to a protection visa that he was unable or  owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted  was unwilling to avail himself of diplomatic or consular protection extended by Jordan to its nationals in Australia   Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Khawar   HCA         CLR   at          In the circumstances  unless advised to the contrary  the Tribunal might reasonably regard it as unlikely that the appellant had approached or would approach the Jordanian Embassy for any reason  It is also understandable that the appellant s supplementary submissions do not suggest that the Tribunal knew  or ought to have known  that he had arranged  or would arrange  to obtain a new Jordanian passport issued in Jordan at a time when he was in Australia  The appellant accepts that it was unwise and foolish for him to have taken this step  The fresh grounds of appeal upon which the appellant s supplementary submissions indicate that he wishes to rely are all dependent on the contention that the decision of the Tribunal is affected by error because it failed of its own motion to investigate whether the expiry of the appellant s travel documents meant that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for reason of political opinion in Jordan referred toNADG of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlWhen the appeal was first called for hearing the appellant handed to the Court written submissions which he said had been prepared for him by a lawyer  The content and language of the written submissions are consistent with their having been prepared by a lawyer notwithstanding that they contain the assertion  I have been unable to obtain legal assistance  and are signed by the appellant personally  For the reason which I gave in NADG of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at         I consider that if the written submissions were prepared by a lawyer they should have been signed by that lawyer  The written submissions identify three purported errors said to affect the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court  As the first respondent s legal representative had received no notice of the appellant s intention to rely on these purported errors it was necessary to adjourn the appeal hearing  The first respondent s solicitors thereafter filed written submissions in response to those handed to the Court by the appellant  When the hearing of the appeal resumed the appellant was represented by counsel but his counsel was not the person who had prepared his written submissions referred toNARE of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe authorities reveal that an applicant for a protection visa must advance whatever evidence or arguments he or she wishes to rely on in support of his or her claim for a protection visa   Abebe v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     NARE of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at      As Wilcox J observed in Prasad v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at          The circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to inquire are  I think  strictly limited  It is no part of the duty of the decision maker to make the applicant s case for him  It is not enough that the court find that the sounder course would have been to make inquiries  It would not be appropriate to grant the appellant leave to raise the issue simply because  as he contended  it would be just to allow him to do so  see NARE of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs at    The decision of the Tribunal may only be set aside for jurisdictional error  The Tribunal did not make a jurisdictional error by failing to consider a claim which the appellant did not make  In all of the circumstances I conclude that the appellant should not be granted leave to raise before this Court the issue of whether the Tribunal was under a duty to make enquiries about whether the expiry of the appellant s passport was likely to lead to a chain of events resulting in his being persecuted for reasons of imputed political opinion should he return to Jordan  The affidavit of the appellant is therefore not admissible as its contents are irrelevant to any issue to be determined on this appeal  see   above   I turn  then  to the original written submissions of the appellant citedPrasad v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     FCR  The authorities reveal that an applicant for a protection visa must advance whatever evidence or arguments

 htmlThe first obstacle in the way of the appellant relying on these fresh grounds of appeal is that he did not rely on them before the Federal Magistrates Court  Leave is required to argue on appeal an issue not raised below  The Court must be satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice for the issue to be raised for the first time on appeal   SLMB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    Neither the supplementary submissions of the appellant nor his affidavit address this issue  In particular they provide no explanation of why the appellant did not tell either the Tribunal or the Federal Magistrates Court of his belief concerning the experience of his friend on return to Jordan and of his own fear of experiencing persecution in Jordan because of his claim for a protection visa  see   above   His contention that a Jordanian citizen who returns to that country after unsuccessfully seeking an Australian protection visa faces a real risk of persecution for reason of imputed political belief does not  it seems  depend upon the expiry of travel documentation  He has not suggested that his friend s passport had expired  Revelation of what the appellant believes happened to his friend would not have required disclosure of the appellant s unwise conduct concerning his own passport
