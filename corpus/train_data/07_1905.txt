Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAinsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Telstra seeks a declaration that   the decision of  the Commission  made on or about   April   under section  AKA   of the Act to issue the Competition Notice was invalid  Telstra submits that it has   a real interest in a clearly defined  straightforward declaration     Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at     The Commission submits that the appropriate declaration is that  in the events that have happened and in the circumstances of this case  the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice  The Commission submits that the decision to issue the Competition Notice in the form in which it was issued did not  in and of itself  affect Telstra s rights in any way or have any statutory consequences  it was the issue and service of the Competition Notice that was defective   Telstra relies on s  A of the Act which relevantly provides        Subject to this section  a person may  in relation to a matter arising under this Act     seek  the making of                 aa  a declaration in relation to the validity of any act or thing done  proposed to be done or purporting to have been done under this Act   The act or thing done under the Act was the issue of the Competition Notice  The words  in relation to  in s  A have wide import but the subject to which the declaration relates is the validity of the issue of the Competition Notice  not the anterior decision to issue that notice  which was not done under the Act  Section  AKA of the Act is not concerned with the decision to issue the Competition Notice but with the issue of and content of the Competition Notice and the preceding notice under s  AKA  the Consultation Notice   Telstra also relies on s  a  of the ADJR Act  which does not provide for a declaration of invalidity  As an alternative to a declaration  Telstra now seeks an order quashing the decision  Telstra points out that it was denied natural justice in the making of the decision  Telstra submits that the Commission s decision has consequences for its reputation  In those circumstances  it submits  it is appropriate that a declaration be made   Ainsworth at    However  apart from the fact that a decision was made to issue the invalid Competition Notice  there is no evidence that the decision had an effect or the consequences alleged citedApplicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Further  Telstra was not given a reasonable opportunity to consult  or to comment and make submissions  or to change its conduct to avoid the issue of the Competition Notice   Telstra No   at    The statutory scheme and common law principles afforded such a right  Telstra was  therefore  denied procedural fairness in the issue of the Competition Notice  The fact that the Commission could have issued a different Part A competition notice  such as the one now proposed  does not discharge the Commission s obligation to give Telstra procedural fairness   Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at       Section   of the Interpretation Act provides that the Interpretation Act applies to all Acts subject to a contrary intention  Subject to a contrary intention the Competition Notice is an instrument which is considered an Act for the purposes of the Interpretation Act and s   applies  s  a   The Commission submits that any contrary intention for the application of s   must be found in the instrument  The parties do not submit a contrary intention is apparent in the Competition Notice   Whether or not there is a contrary intention apparent in the Competition Notice  an indication of contrary intention is not limited to the instrument  It may be apparent from the legislation authorising the making of the instrument citedAzevedo v Secretary

Instruments Act as it is not legislative in character  nor is it a rule of Court citedDarling Casino Limited v Minister for Planning and Sydney Harbour Casino Pty Ltd     LGERA   A distinction is also to be drawn between  on the one hand  questions of severance which involve an excess of power so that the ultra vires portion of an instrument can be severed and the intra vires portion preserved and  on the other hand  a lack of power to make the whole instrument by reason of a failure to comply with the consultation provision in a statute   Darling Casino Limited v Minister for Planning and Sydney Harbour Casino Pty Ltd     LGERA    As Pearlman CJ observed in Darling Casino at   if the power was improperly exercised  the instrument is invalid in its totality  It is no answer that part of

French J  Collector of Customs  NSW  v Lawlor     ALR   at   and     referred to in Evans v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per Merkel J     d  A Part A competition notice is not a legislative instrument under the Legislative Instruments Act as it is not legislative in character  nor is it a rule of Court   The Commission submits that Telstra No   allows for the invalid parts of the Competition Notice to be distinctly identified so that they can be severed and that there is no indication of interdependence with other sections  Also  the Commission submits that severance would not give the Competition Notice a substantially different operation or effect   Evans   FCA   at   per Merkel J   The Commission seeks to sever paragraphs  g  and  a  referring to Lower Spend Customers and paragraph  e  referring to unbundled Fixed Voice Services  being the different kinds of anti competitive conduct to those summarised in the Consultation Notice   To the extent that the Commission seeks to sever the references to those parts of conduct that were not part of the conduct described in summary form in the Consultation Notice  severance is not possible  The Commission submits that the offending parts of the notice should be disregarded  as if they were not there  While it is possible to rule a line through the offending provisions  such a  blue pencil exercise  is not appropriate  To do so alters the nature of the conduct the subject of the notice   Victoria at   and also alters the content and meaning of the notice  I am not satisfied that the clauses proposed to be severed are other than interrelated and interdependent within the remainder of the Competition Notice citedEvans v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  If an Act  legislative instrument or an instrument issued by an authority acting within the power of a provision is construed as being in excess of authority  it is to be  read down  or severed to be valid to the extent that it is not within power  It is read down to bring it within power  providing that the instrument itself contains some test that would permit severance   Evans v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at   per Kenny J   However  as Kenny J pointed out at   it may not be possible if various aspects or requirements that are within and beyond power are interdependent   The Commission s submissions are as follows      Section  c  of the Interpretation Act operates to ensure that the Competition Notice is read and construed subject to Pt XIB of the Act and so as not to exceed the power of the Commission to issue the notice      When the Competition Notice is so construed  if it is found still to be in excess of the power of the Commission  then it is taken as a valid notice to the extent that it is not in excess of power by s        If two constructions of the Competition Notice were open and only one was within power  s  c  requires the Court to construe the notice so as to be within power  This may be achieved by severing the offending paragraphs  which are those that deal with the Lower Spend Customers and the bundling issues  The balance of the Competition Notice would therefore be valid   Section  a  of the Interpretation Act provides that each provision in the Competition Notice is to be construed as if it were a section of an Act  The Commission submits that s   can be satisfied by simply excising references to additional matter found to constitute a disconformity between the matter the subject of the Consultation Notice and the terms of the Competition Notice  The Commission recognises that this may not be appropriate if what seems to be a simple excision alters the sense of the Competition Notice or causes it to operate in an otherwise unintended or invalid manner citedFieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   The validity of the Competition Notice and procedural fairness afforded before its issue are determined by the content and context of the provisions of Pt XIB of the Act  There is no evidence of the decision or decisions that were made  A decision or  indeed  a series of decisions concerning a Part A competition notice or its issue could be made and never implemented  The decision itself has no statutory consequences in the Act  It does not sufficiently relate to the validity of the Competition Notice  Counsel were unable to point to any comparable case  such as those arising under s   of the Act or ss   and   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  where not only the statutory notice but also the decision to issue the notice was quashed or declared invalid  cf Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   where the validity of four notices issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation pursuant to s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act was considered but the decision to issue those notices was not  in effect  considered    A declaration under s  A aa  of the Act could extend to the validity of the Consultation Notice  the validity of the Competition Notice and the entitlement of the Commission to issue the Competition Notice  It does not extend to the decision to issue the Competition Notice   However  Telstra also relies on the ADJR Act  The Commission did not and does not dispute that the decision to issue the Competition Notice is a decision to which s   of the ADJR Act applies  In the light of that concession  I gave no consideration in Telstra No   as to whether or not this was so citedFoxtel Management Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     ALR   It is not disputed that the Competition

Harrington v Lowe   HCA         CLR   at    It does not apply to validate a provision which extends beyond power unless the operation of the remaining parts of the instrument remain unchanged  It does not apply where the instrument was intended to operate fully and completely according to its terms or not at all   Victoria v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     Section   of the Interpretation Act   like s  A   Harrington at   cannot be applied to effect a partial validation if  as here  it is apparent that the statutory provision for consultation was intended to operate

deciding  that the proposed changes to the Competition Notice make it accord with the Consultation Notice  those changes do not alter the fact that Telstra was  at the time of the issue of the

Section   of the Interpretation Act concerns the construction of instruments  Both ss  c  and     provide for a construction to be applied  To read and construe an instrument by the application of s  c  is not to rewrite it or to ignore its content  Section   has no application to a decision made under an Act  It has no application to a denial of procedural fairness   Severance is more likely when

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As stated in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at       An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect  Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition  The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute  its subject matter and objects  and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition  Unfortunately  a finding of purpose or no purpose in this context often reflects a contestable judgment   The Act does provide for the possibility of variation of a Part A competition notice but specifies in s  AOA that  while the notice is in force  variation can only be of a minor nature  The proposed variations cannot be said to fall into this category   Part XIB does not envisage that a Part A competition notice may issue with retrospective effect  If an invalid Part A competition notice were subsequently validated by the application of s   of the Interpretation Act   the re construed or amended notice would have retrospective effect for the period that the initial Part A competition notice would have been in force citedP   C Cantarella v Egg

Severance does not answer the fact that the decision to issue the Competition Notice was not properly made  The condition precedent to its issue had not been complied with  The statutory scheme for consultation prior to the issue of a Part A competition notice is rendered redundant if  once it is found that the procedure was not followed  the Part A competition notice is retrospectively altered to equate  on its face  with the s  AKA  notice  That makes a mockery of the intention of Pt XIB of the Act  Severance is not available in such circumstances   Sportodds Systems Pty Limited v New South Wales   FCAFC         FCR   at      As the Full Court said in Sportodds at     in relation to s  A of the Interpretation Act     Notwithstanding the broad terms in which these provisions are expressed  the statutory provisions are nevertheless limited   This limits the extent to which a court can redraft a statutory provision              But the essential issue remains is the court carrying out the permissible function of the interpretation of the statute  read in the context of the relevant Acts Interpretation Act provision  or is the court itself making legislation  To overcome the denial of procedural fairness found in Telstra No     the Commission says that  if the Competition Notice is construed by applying s   to read down the notice by adopting the alternative construction advanced by the Commission or read to disregard those parts that refer to Lower Spend Customers and bundling issues  there was no problem with procedural fairness as those parts of the Competition Notice were not operative  In the Commission s submission  the Competition Notice identified a number of independent kinds of anti competitive conduct  It says that  on severance of the kinds of conduct not described in the Consultation Notice  Telstra was given the opportunity to consult on the kinds of conduct that remain  As a consequence  the Commission submits  there is no longer a procedural fairness issue to be considered  The denial of procedural fairness simply disappears  This submission has an air of unreality and demonstrates a reason why s   does not apply where there has been jurisdictional error   I do not accept that the offending parts of the Competition Notice can be severed as proposed by the Commission citedStrickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Before embarking on the process of reading down  there must be some part of the impugned provision that is capable of being within power  While s   of the Interpretation Act may apply to cut down the scope of an overly wide provision  there is no occasion for reading down if the provision is wholly beyond power  As with s  A  s   does not turn an Act or instrument which is invalid as being wholly outside legislative power into an Act which is  in part  within power   Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd   HCA         CLR   at

carrier     TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS        At all material times  there were and are markets in Australia that are no wider than markets for      a  the supply and acquisition of wholesale Local Services  the Wholesale Local Services Market   and  b  the supply and acquisition of retail Fixed Voice Services  the Retail FVS Market         Each market identified above at paragraph   is a telecommunications market        MARKET POWER        In the supply of Local Services in the Wholesale Local Services Market  Telstra is not materially constrained by the conduct of      a  Telstra s competitors and potential competitors in the Wholesale Local Services Market  or  b  persons to whom or from whom Telstra supplies or acquires goods or services in the Wholesale Local Services Market

market power in the Wholesale Local Services Market by engaging in the conduct described in paragraph      EFFECT OR LIKELY EFFECT ON COMPETITION        The conduct described in paragraph   had and has the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening  preventing or hindering competition in the Retail FVS Market in one or more of the following respects   a  by raising the costs of Telstra s Rivals  and thereby          substantially reducing the incentives of Telstra s Rivals to engage in competitive activity to acquire new Retail Customers and to retain existing Retail Customers  and   or     resulting in higher Retail Prices for Fixed Voice Services than would otherwise be the case in a competitive market       b  by substantially increasing the barriers which prevent or hinder Telstra s Rivals from entering into or expanding within the Retail FVS Market  in at least one or more of the following respects        i  adversely affecting the capacity of Telstra s Rivals to generate or to maintain sufficient business to develop and to take advantage of economies of scale and scope  and    reducing the ability of Telstra s Rivals to expand product offerings and to invest in or to deploy new infrastructure and   or alternative technology in order to develop and to supply new and innovative products  particularly in the form of facilities based competition  which may  in the long run  result in more efficient delivery of services       c  by threatening the viability of at least some of Telstra s Rivals       KINDS OF ANTI COMPETITIVE CONDUCT        Each of the

and Consumer Commission  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA     Telstra No     I considered a Part A competition notice  the Competition Notice  issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  the Commission  pursuant to s  AKA  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Act   Telstra challenged the issue of the Competition Notice and the written notice given by the Commission pursuant to s  AKA  of the Act prior to the issue of the Competition Notice  the Consultation Notice    In Telstra No   I determined that the Consultation Notice and the Competition Notice differed in the kind of anti competitive conduct described  with those differences being ones of substance  at    Due to these differences  the Consultation Notice did not comply with s  AKA  of the Act and the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice  at    Telstra was not given the opportunity provided by the Act to respond to a s  AKA  notice and to make submissions to the Commission on the conduct the subject of the Competition Notice prior to its issue  Telstra was  therefore  denied procedural fairness and natural justice under statute and at common law  at     The parties subsequently made submissions on the appropriate orders to give effect to the reasons  I then indicated to the parties that I wished to hear further from them concerning the application of s   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the ADJR Act  in the context of the concession made by the Commission that the decision to issue a Part A competition notice was a reviewable decision under s   citedVanstone v Clark   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Section   of the Interpretation Act is applied as a rule of construction to permit the reading down of instruments  It is not a rule of law   Vanstone v Clark   FCAFC         FCR   at   per Black CJ referring to Pidoto v Victoria   HCA         CLR   at   per Latham CJ   The Commission has not referred to anything in the Act or in any extrinsic legislative materials to support the proposition that s   extends beyond such a limited application  Section   of the Interpretation Act concerns the construction of instruments  Both ss  c  and     provide for a construction to be applied  To read and construe an instrument by the application of s  c  is not to rewrite it or to ignore its content  Section   has no application to a decision made under an Act  It has no application to a denial of procedural fairness   Before embarking on the process of reading down  there must be some part of the impugned provision that is capable of being within power  While s   of the Interpretation Act may apply to cut down the scope of an overly wide provision  there is no occasion for reading down if the provision is wholly beyond power  As with s  A  s   does not turn an Act or instrument which is invalid as being wholly outside legislative power into an Act which is  in part  within power   Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Menzies J and cited by Black CJ in Vanstone at   followedVictoria v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section   of the Interpretation Act   like s  A  may apply where   particular clauses  provisos and qualifications  separately expressed  are beyond power   Harrington v Lowe   HCA         CLR   at    It does not apply to validate a provision which extends beyond power unless the operation of the remaining parts of the instrument remain unchanged  It does not apply where the instrument was intended to operate fully and completely according to its terms or not at all   Victoria v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at
