Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Navman Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd  in liq      FCR   In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd  in liq      FCR   at     a Full Court pointed to the difficulties in determining an applicable range by reason of the wide variety of considerations arising in each case appliedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Limited   ATPR     The principal  and probably the only  object of the penalties that are imposed by s   is deterrence  both specific and general  CSR at   NW Frozen Foods at     Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Limited   ATPR     at    There are many other authorities to the same effect   Resale price maintenance was first made illegal in Australia in   although the legislation did not refer to it in express terms  ACCC v High Adventure at     The policy which underlies s   of the Act is that competition is an important feature of the distribution of goods  Resale price maintenance  as a form of vertical price fixing  eliminates the competition which Part IV of the Act seeks to achieve  ACCC v High Adventure at     As the Full Court observed in ACCC v High Adventure   a number of reasons have been put forward to explain the undesirability of the practice  One of them is that resale price maintenance is often a manifestation of price fixing among retailers  Another is that it inevitably eliminates dealer competition  thereby restricting freedom of competition in the price of goods in the marketplace  ACCC v High Adventure at     I am not bound to accept statements merely because they have been agreed between the parties  Visy at    I accept that Navman sought to avoid complaints from some of its larger retailers  The threats contained in the emails of Mr Baird and Mr King to non compliant distributors suggest that this was so  But this also suggests that Navman s resale price maintenance conduct was a manifestation of price fixing among retailers  ACCC v High Adventure at   appliedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jurlique International Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It seems to me that these difficulties inform the approach which Spender J took in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jurlique International Pty Ltd   FCA    The effect of what his Honour said at     is that the Court should only depart from the penalties agreed by properly informed and legally assisted parties where it is clear that it should do so   Navman s contraventions of s   were serious  Its conduct was deliberate and was carried out over a lengthy period of time in relation to a range of expensive products  Navman s conduct extended over a period of more than three years in the distribution of marine products  and more than a year in the distribution of PCN products appliedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Determination of the amount of a penalty is not an exact science  Each case turns on its own facts and limited assistance is to be obtained from considering the amounts imposed in other proceedings  NW Frozen Foods at   Mobil Oil at   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited  No     FCA   at      Either approach raises broad questions of judgment because s   imports concepts of moral responsibility derived from the criminal law  Visy at     I am entitled to draw inferences and reach conclusions from the facts that have been agreed in the Joint Submissions  Visy at     The details of the contraventions show that Navman s conduct was not merely deliberate  It was pursued in an aggressive and high handed way by the company s most senior managers   Navman s corporate culture was not conducive to compliance with the Act   Mr Baird and Mr King did not receive any trade practices training from Navman  I would have thought that senior managers of a multi national company would have  at very least  a basic understanding of the law even without the need for detailed training  In any event  the failure of the company to provide training and see that its senior managers arranged training for their subordinates reflects badly on Navman s corporate culture   I am not bound to accept statements merely because they have been agreed between the parties  Visy at    I accept that Navman sought to avoid complaints from some of its larger retailers  The threats contained in the emails of Mr Baird and Mr King to

Mobil Oil   I referred at     above to the principal factors to which I must have regard  I would add to this that the view of the regulator  as a specialist body  is a relevant consideration  but it is not determinative of the ultimate question of the appropriateness of the penalty  Mobil Oil at  iv    It is open to the Court to commence its reasoning by referring to the proposed figure and then limiting itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range  Alternatively  the Court may adopt the reverse process of addressing the appropriate range independently of the agreed figure and then determine whether the proposed penalty falls within the range  Mobil Oil at   appliedNW Frozen Foods Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     FCR

Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR      per Branson  Sackville and Gyles JJ    The essential question which arises is not whether I would  without the assistance of the parties  have reached the
