Clark v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCarringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC     ACLC  No question arises under s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC   FCA       ACLC    Put in simple terms  the following distributions occurred in the   income year  CEPL as trustee of the CU Trust distributed the entire income of the trust to or for the benefit of a discretionary unit holder  DCE Holdings Pty Ltd  Clark Holdings  as trustee of the David Clark Family Trust  the  Clark Family Trust   Clark Holdings distributed the income so received to David Clark Enterprises Pty Ltd  Clark Enterprises  as trustee of the David Clark Enterprises Trust  the  Enterprises Trust  and Clark Enterprises distributed the income of the trust to David Clark and Helen Clark in equal shares as beneficiaries of that trust  By s   of the   Act  the assessable income of David Clark and Helen Clark includes a   share of the net income of the Enterprises Trust and in the event that the taxpayers are not able to establish that the CU Trust estate suffered previously unapplied net capital losses extinguishing the net capital gain arising out of the disposal of the Gladstone properties in the   income year  the net income of the Enterprises Trust will also include a significant part of the net capital gain  discounted by   made by the CU Trust in the   income year  Accordingly  the first question to be determined in these proceedings is whether the applicants have discharged the onus of establishing that in the   income year  the trustee of the CU Trust acquired the Rothwells shares quotedcitedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd     ATR  In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd     ATR       ALR   Lee  Emmett and Gyles JJ at   observed that       A  trust estate     will be that property the ownership of which is divided between trustee and beneficiary  The trustee will always be ascertainable  However  the class of beneficiaries  while identifiable  will not necessarily be closed and all beneficiaries may  of course  not be ascertainable  The Full Court recognised at   that since lack of continuity in the identity of the trustee from income year to income year would not prevent losses  in this case capital losses  in earlier years being available as deductions from assessable income in a later year   criteria must be established for determining when there is sufficient identity of the trusts involved to warrant such deductions being allowable   In framing the criteria  the Full Court said this        The trust obligations of the trustee and the corresponding rights of the beneficiaries may vary from time to time  in accordance with law  Similarly  the property that is the subject of such obligations and rights will not be static  Parts of the property might be distributed so as to cease to be subject to trust obligations  Further property may accrue as income or by further settlement so as to become subject to obligations where previously that additional property was not            However  at any given time it will be possible to identify the property that is the subject of the trust obligations and in respect of which the rights of beneficiaries exist  It is the income which accrues from that property  less outgoings from that property  that go to make up the taxable income of the trust estate or fund                The  ITAA   then imposes a liability either on the beneficiaries or  in some cases  on the trustee in a representative capacity   Superannuation fund  as that term is defined in the SIS Act and the  ITAA   contemplates a continuing regime regulating the manner in which a fund may be added to and the manner in which payments may be made from it  So long as one can identify a continuity of that regime  that will be sufficient            Thus  in order to determine whether losses of particular trust property are allowable as a deduction from income accruing to that trust property in a subsequent income year  it will be necessary to establish some degree of continuity of the trust property or corpus that earns the income from the income year of loss to the year of income  It will also be necessary to establish continuity of the regime of trust obligations affecting the property in the sense that  while amendment of those obligations might occur  any amendment must be in accordance with the terms of the original trust            So long as any amendment of the trust obligations relating to such trust property is made in accordance with any power conferred by the instrument creating the obligations  and continuity of the property that is the subject of trust obligation is established  there will be identity of the  taxpayer  for the purposes of s   and ss  E  and   notwithstanding any amendment of the trust obligation and any change in the property itself  The Full Court at   observed that in order to determine whether earlier losses of trust property are allowable as deductions from income  or capital gains  accruing to trust property in a subsequent income year  it will be necessary to establish some degree of continuity of the trust property or corpus that earns the income or capital gain from the income year of loss to the year of income  Secondly  there must be continuity of the regime of trust obligations affecting the trust property and while those obligations might change  continuity remains if the amendments are made in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument  in the proper exercise of the powers so conferred  It follows that if some degree of continuity of trust property is made out and continuity in the regime of trust obligations is established  there will be sufficient identity of taxpayer in the sense that the hypothetical representative trustee taxpayer on behalf of the trust estate that incurred the loss is the hypothetical taxpayer of the trust estate that made the net capital gain quotedcitedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd     ALJR  Although the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd     ALJR   considered the re settlement analysis undertaken by the Full Court  Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ  observed at   that  as the Full Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had held  the question of the availability of the deduction was one of continuity to be considered  in that case  in the context of a superannuation fund which  of its nature  may be expected to undergo change  The Court at   said this      The question is whether the eligible entity which derived the taxable income in the year ended   June   is a different entity from the eligible entity that incurred losses in the earlier years  If  as the appellant contends  it is a different entity  there is a question as to what happened to the original entity  The three main indicia of continuity for the purposes of Part IX are the constitution of the trusts under which the fund  if a trust fund  operated  the trust property   and membership   Changes in one or more of those matters must be such as to terminate the existence of the eligible entity  or to produce the result that it does not derive the income in question  to destroy the necessary continuity  The trusts under which the fund operated in     were constituted by the original trust deed in   as varied by the exercise  in   of a power of amendment  The property the subject of the trusts did not alter at the time the amendments took effect  Persons who were members of the fund before the amendments remained members of the fund after the amendments  The fund  both before and after the amendments  was administered as a single fund  and treated in that way by the regulatory authority     emphasis added Although the Court framed those three indicia of continuity  for the purposes of Part IX   of the   Act in the context of a superannuation trust  the notion of continuity in the trust estate that derived the income or made the capital gain and that incurred the loss on revenue account or suffered the capital loss also determines the availability of the allowable deduction or the application of previously unapplied capital losses  There is no reason to believe that these three indicia of continuity do not equally apply to trust estates for the purposes of Division   of Part III of the   Act and the   Act  The Commissioner contends that the arrangements of June   brought about a break in continuity firstly in the trust fund  secondly  in the trustee s interest in the trust estate  and thirdly  in the interests of the beneficiaries in the trust fund  Continuity in the Trust Fund Mr Denoon and Mr Clark intended however that the CU Trust continue in operation  It was necessary for Mr Clark s purposes that it do so  Both men proceeded on the footing that Mr Denoon  hoped  to be able to make a matching contribution to the CU Trust by   June    In the period between   June   and   June   they investigated potential property development projects to be undertaken by the CU Trust for the long term  during the period of Mr Denoon s consultancy  The question that arises is whether the suspension arrangements and the effect upon the administration of the trust by CEPL from   June   brought about changes in the interests of the unitholders  that is  the rights attaching to membership of the trust  so as to destroy the necessary continuity in the trust fund that made the capital gain in the   income year and that which suffered the capital loss in the   income year  Did the changes terminate the existence of the CU Trust or produce the result that it did not make the capital gain in question  Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd     ALJR   at    The points along the continuum were these  The Rothwells shares were acquired in the   financial year  They rapidly lost value  They were sold by the trustee on   May   giving rise to a CGT disposal and a capital loss  On   June   the suspension arrangements were put in place pending the realisation of either an expectation or a hope of Mr Denoon s matching contribution  By   July   Gemridge had made it plain to the trustee that it could not make a matching contribution and on   June   the trustee agreed to the transfer of the Denoon units to Clark Holdings  The transfers were signed on   April    In   the Gladstone properties were acquired and in the   income year the CU Trust realised a capital gain upon the disposal of those properties  All of the units in the CU Trust on   May   were held by the Denoon interests  By the arrangements of   June     of those units were transferred to the Clark interests  The Denoon interests retained   of the issued units although the joint venture arrangements placed the rights attaching to those units  in practical terms  in suspension citedOctavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight     CLR  The right of indemnity Carringbush enjoyed out of trust assets in respect of liabilities incurred in performing the trust confers upon the trustee a  beneficial interest  in the trust assets  Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight     CLR   at   per Stephen  Mason  Aickin and Wilson JJ  However  the right of indemnity Carringbush enjoyed was in any meaningful sense  illusory as the trust fund consisted of significant accumulated losses ultimately rendering the trust in terms of any activities  dormant  Mr Clark was not prepared to make a contribution to the trust fund that would be immediately susceptible to the former trustee s indemnity claim and thus there would not have been any future contribution in respect of which the liability of the original trust estate to the former trustee became altered  Whilst the deed purported to extinguish the beneficial interest of the trustee by discharging or extinguishing the underlying right of indemnity and thus alter an aspect of the beneficial interests in the trust assets  the measure of that right was  in all practical senses  valueless having regard to the state of the trust fund  The Commissioner contends that the right of indemnity as it subsisted in the trustee prior to extinguishment meant that the trust property was valueless to the unitholders and the extinguishment changed that  state of affairs  by enhancing the value of the assets from the perspective of the unitholders and freeing the trust estate  including future contributions  from any claim  Thus  the trust property was fundamentally altered  The trustee of the trust may be replaced  The second break in continuity is said to arise out of the discharge of the trustee s right of indemnity on the footing that the discharge altered the trustee s interest in the trust estate  The trustee s right of indemnity constitutes a beneficial interest in the trust assets  Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight  supra at   of these reasons   The right of indemnity continues notwithstanding the trustee s retirement from office and creditors of the trustee are entitled to be subrogated to the trustee s right of indemnity  The new trustee takes the trust property subject to the right of indemnity of its predecessor in office  The right of indemnity is consistent with the right of reimbursement conferred by s   of the Trustees Act    NSW  which applied to the CU Trust  The Commissioner says that the right of indemnity conferred as a matter of law is not capable of being excluded from the trust instrument  Kemtron Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties  Qld      QdR   at p    The Commissioner contends that the waiver of the right of indemnity was not brought about by any authorised amendment of the Trust Deed  Two things are said to flow from this  Firstly  the waiver of the former trustee s right of indemnity brought about a material change in the rights and obligations attaching to the trust property which was inconsistent with the continuity of the trust estate for tax purposes  Secondly  the release of the former trustee s right of indemnity is properly understood as an agreement which gave rise to a new trust in the same terms as the CU Trust absent the term as to indemnity and thus a new trust was brought into existence for the purposes of the general law citedKemtron Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties
