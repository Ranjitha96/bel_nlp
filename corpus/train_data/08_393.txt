observed at               there may well be cases in which the actual earnings of a business either represent the actual or potential earnings of a former worker during a period of partial incapacity  Where  for example  a business consists essentially of the provision of personal services by the former worker  eg a business of a sole plumber or casual gardener  and no significant investment of capital is involved  the actual net earnings of the business might properly be seen as representing the actual  reward for  the  labour  of the former worker  see J   H Timbers Pty Ltd v Nelson  at   during a period of partial incapacity  In such a case  if the former worker is carrying on business solely on his own account  the net earnings of the business might properly be seen as representing the  amount he is earning  in a business  if he is carrying on business in partnership or as an employee of a family company  the net earnings might properly be seen as representing the  amount he     is able to earn  either in employment or in a business     The difficulty with the approach of the Tribunal in the present proceedings is that the evidence the Tribunal was relying upon to reach its conclusion has not been identified  nor have findings of facts been made or reasons provided  The Tribunal has set forth a conclusion but none of the processes by which it reached that conclusion followedChen v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  No   question of law   it is considered  arises in circumstances of the

February   consideredComcare v Holt   FCA       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A Statement of Facts and Contentions should obviously not be construed with the constraints appropriate to a pleading in a Superior Court  Nor should a Statement of Facts and Contentions be filed with such generality that all issues which potentially may emerge will be held subsequently to fall within one or other of the matters set forth  But it should be drafted with a sufficient level of precision to enable both an opponent and the Tribunal to know the facts and contentions being raised for consideration  The procedures of the Tribunal are sufficiently flexible to permit of any subsequent need to revisit a Statement which has been filed if that is necessary to ensure that the   correct or preferable decision   is reached and reached in a manner which permits all parties to have a   reasonable opportunity to present his or her case   Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  s    Within those broad limits  the procedures followed by the Tribunal should be sufficiently flexible to permit new or additional contentions to be raised  where that is necessary to ensure that the Tribunal properly discharges its functions  and sufficiently flexible to ensure that contentions which may have been initially raised at the outset of proceedings are able to be later abandoned  eg  Comcare v Holt   FCA   at       FCA       ALD   at   per Mansfield J    Notwithstanding such flexibility  this first contention of Comcare is rejected   But Comcare s alternative submission  namely that the Tribunal has impermissibly equated profit with an ability to earn  it is considered should prevail  Comcare s Contentions as filed with the Tribunal unequivocally asserted that Ms Davies had   an ability to earn in suitable employment   and also that   an ability to earn should not be confused with ability to run a profitable business   followedComcare v Line   FCA

Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     FLR   Even where one or other or both parties are represented before the Tribunal  a party may depart from the contentions it has identified in its

including from questions asked by the Tribunal or that arise from evidence given and subsequent cross examination  Facts or contentions different to those raised in a Statement of Facts and Contentions may also arise from the manner in which a case is opened or even  although far from desirable  in closing submissions   In the present proceedings before the Tribunal  however  such questions as were asked of Ms Davies in cross examination  it is considered  could not fairly be construed as raising for resolution the potential for Ms Davies to engage in other forms of suitable employment  Neither the invoices disclosing monies charged for lecturing or the questions asked of her during cross examination would have alerted her to the possibility that Comcare could be suggesting the development of that part of her abilities as other   suitable employment   followedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Raptis     ALD   No   question of law   it is considered  arises in
