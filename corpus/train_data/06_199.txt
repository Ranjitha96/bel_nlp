Tran v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs  No     FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toTran v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   February   I delivered judgment in this proceeding  refusing an application for an extension of time within which to appeal the decision of a Federal Magistrate  Tran v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Tran No      In that judgment  I indicated that there was an outstanding issue to de determined  That issue was whether the applicant s solicitor should be ordered to repay to the applicant some portion of the costs that the applicant was ordered to pay to the respondents   Order   r  c  of the Federal Court Rules provides as follows     Without limiting the Court s discretion to award costs in a proceeding  if costs are incurred improperly or without reasonable cause  or are wasted by undue delay or by any other misconduct or default  and it appears to the Court that a legal practitioner is responsible  whether personally or through a servant or agent  the Court may  after giving the legal practitioner a reasonable opportunity to be heard  do any of the following                   c  direct the legal practitioner to repay to the client  costs which the client has been ordered to pay to another party    Order   r   was introduced in its present form in   by the Federal Court Amendment Rules  No      Cth   The rule in its earlier form was unduly restrictive  It required a reference to  and report by  a taxing officer before the power to order a solicitor to repay to his or her client costs ordered to be paid by the client to another party could be invoked  The rule in its previous form appears to have been rarely used  It is possible that because of its restrictive nature  costs orders against solicitors have tended to be dealt with in this Court pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act    Cth   That section provides  in substance  that the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge  Plainly s   confers upon the Court a wide discretion  though of course that discretion must be exercised judicially consideredLevick v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Section   does not expressly state that a power to award costs against solicitors is given to the Court  However  the authorities are clear that s   does encompass this power  See Levick v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR     Levick   in which the relevant principles are discussed by the Full Court   The principles under which an order for costs should be made against a legal practitioner for unreasonably instituting or maintaining a proceeding or defence  at least in relation to s   suggest that this power should be used sparingly  Indeed  in Levick   the Full Court suggested that in order to invoke the power  there must be something akin to an abuse of process  that is  using the proceeding for an ulterior purpose or without any  or any proper  consideration of the prospects of success  The Full Court referred to White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd v Flower   Hart     ALR   at   per Goldberg J to the same effect  See also Re Bendeich  No       FCR   at     per Drummond J   A somewhat different approach was taken by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Steindl Nominees Pty Ltd v Laghaifar     Qd R     Steindl   where Davies JA  with whom Williams JA and Philippides J agreed  rejected the proposition that it was not improper for a legal representative to present a case which that legal representative knew  or ought to know  was hopeless  Mansfield J regarded himself as bound to follow the approach in Levick   in preference to that adopted in Steindl   He therefore declined to make the order sought   It is unnecessary for me to say anything further about s    It may be arguable that the principles stated in Levick require some further consideration in the light of the later reasoning of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Steindl   However  any such reconsideration will have to await the attention of a Full Court   In due course  s   B notices issued  They were all but incoherent  At the hearing  the applicant s solicitor pursued what purported to be a constitutional argument  of sorts  for some minutes  and then acknowledged  in effect  that he was unable to argue the point  He was no better able to identify any constitutional issue in the costs hearing before me  It is interesting to note that in Levick   a bankruptcy case  a similar inability to articulate in any sensible manner a purported constitutional challenge to the validity of a series of Commonwealth Acts  including the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  and the Corporations Law  was properly visited with an order for costs against the debtor s solicitor   In the circumstances of this case  I consider that it would be unfair to require the applicant to pay the additional costs incurred by reason of the introduction of an entirely hopeless legal point  and one that would have been beyond the applicant s comprehension  It was her legal representative who pursued this point  even when he knew that he was in no position to say anything sensible in support of it   I propose therefore to make an order pursuant to O   r  c  to the effect that the applicant s solicitor repay the client the costs thrown away by reason of the pursuit of the constitutional challenge  I am told that the applicant is impecunious  It is likely that the respondents will pursue her for costs  The best course  in these circumstances  is to order that the method by which the applicant s solicitor repay her for these costs is to make a payment directly to the respondents  which sum will of course  be deducted from any amount owing by the applicant by way of costs  I will fix the amount to be paid by the applicant s solicitor in the sum of   which seems to me to be a very modest figure in the circumstances   The applicant s solicitor asked for time to pay  I will order the applicant s solicitor to pay to the respondents the sum of   that amount to be paid on or before   May       I certify that the preceding twenty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg   Associate Dated    March   Solicitor for the Applicant  Mr D Cheung       There was no appearance for the respondent     Date of Hearing    March       Date of Judgment    March         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au

html  In Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   Mansfield J reviewed the authorities in the context of an application by the respondent Minister for an order that the unsuccessful applicant s solicitor be ordered to pay the costs of the application jointly with the applicant  His Honour accepted that the Court had jurisdiction to make an order for costs against a solicitor  However  he declined in the exercise of his discretion to do so   It seems that the application before Mansfield J was brought under s   and his Honour regarded the test that had to be satisfied before such an order was made pursuant to that section as requiring a finding that the solicitor s conduct was tantamount to an abuse of process  He accepted that a hopeless case might support the inference that there was some ulterior purpose for the proceeding  However  he also noted the competing principle that a party is entitled to have a solicitor act for the party even in an unmeritorious case  He referred to Ridehalgh v Horsefield   Ch   at   where the Court of Appeal said     A legal representative is not to be held to have acted improperly  unreasonably or negligently simply because he acts for a party who pursues a claim or a defence which is plainly doomed to fail   In Bagshaw v Scott   FCA     Bennett J adopted a similar approach to that of Mansfield J in Kumar   Her Honour said  at   that the power to order costs against solicitors had to be exercised with care and discretion  and only in clear cases  There had to be something which amounted to a serious dereliction of duty  Simply instituting or maintaining on instructions proceedings which had no real prospect of success was not such a dereliction of duty   In Kumar   Mansfield J referred to O   r   in its present form  Having concluded that there was no warrant for ordering the solicitor in that case to pay costs  pursuant to s   he went on to say that this did not excuse the solicitor from the obligation to provide appropriate advice to the client before instituting proceedings  His Honour then said  at   that if the client did not take that advice  the solicitor  has the duty to the Court not to incur costs improperly or without reasonable cause   He referred to this power as the so called  wasted costs jurisdiction    It appears that his Honour drew a distinction between instituting proceedings that were essentially hopeless  where something akin to an abuse of process had to be shown before costs could be ordered  and conducting proceedings in a manner that involved costs being improperly incurred  or at least incurred without reasonable cause  On any view  there will be some overlap between the principles to be applied when considering whether to award costs against a legal practitioner under s   or under O   r   referred toRidehalgh v Horsefield   Ch   It seems that the application before Mansfield J was brought under s   and his Honour regarded the test that had to be satisfied before such an order was made pursuant to that section as requiring a finding that the solicitor s conduct was tantamount to an abuse of process  He accepted that a hopeless
