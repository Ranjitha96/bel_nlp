for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As to the second submission  the High Court has held that s   is a valid law with respect to aliens  Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR    In Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   the Full Court of this Court held  after it had identified the relevant considerations to the exercise of the power in s   that the section did not infringe or contravene Chapter III of the Constitution   I will not repeat what I said in Pull at       The other aspect of the applicant s third submission is his assertion made in his written submissions that the Tribunal member failed to give proper and genuine consideration to the relevant consideration of the expectations of the Australian community  There is no doubt that that is a relevant consideration  Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  supra  Direction No     Paragraph     of Direction No   provides as follows     Expectations of the Australian community           The Australian community expects non citizens to obey Australian laws while in Australia  Where a non citizen has breached  or where there is a significant risk that they will breach this trust or where the non citizen has been convicted of offences in Australia or elsewhere  it may be appropriate to refuse the visa application or cancel the visa held by such a person  Visa refusal or cancellation and removal of the non citizen may be appropriate simply because the nature of the character concerns or offences are such that the Australian community would expect that the person would not be granted a visa or should be removed from Australia  Decision makers should have due regard to the Government s view in this respect   The approach of the Tribunal member was to note that the applicant had accumulated an extensive criminal record in a relatively short time  He referred to the arguments put on the applicant s behalf to the effect that the Tribunal should take a broader view of community expectations  It was put to him that if a person had been in Australia for almost   years  the community would expect that he would not be  dumped  on another country and he should be regarded as Australia s problem  It was put to the Tribunal member that the applicant had been punished by imprisonment and should not be further punished by deportation  and even if he were  the visa cancellation process should be completed while he was still in prison  It was put to the Tribunal member that the community would also expect that the applicant would be rewarded for his attempts at rehabilitation and for a reasonable work history before he was sent to prison  It was put to the Tribunal member that evidence of the applicant s personal circumstances was also relevant to any assessment of expectations  The Tribunal member said     In part the broader interpretation advocated depends on shifting factors from the community protection and other considerations categories into the process of evaluating community expectations  While the categories laid down in Direction No   cannot be regarded as rigid or inflexible  the approach laid down by the Direction is prima facie the one that the Tribunal should follow  referred toHoffman v Chief of Army   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Counsel for the applicant referred to Hoffman v Chief of Army   FCAFC         FCR    In fact  the submission was based on the approach to statutory construction summarised by Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J in Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia   HCA         CLR    at   as follows     When the Legislature explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in which it shall be

power  referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  An error of fact is not a jurisdictional error if there was some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made  An error of fact might  depending on its nature  indicate that the decision maker did not give proper and genuine consideration to a matter he or she was bound to consider  That would be a jurisdictional error  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited   HCA         CLR    If there is error here  it is not of that nature  The Tribunal member clearly considered and considered thoroughly the best interests of the child and the applicant s relationship with his parents  The finding that his parents had not seen him since his release in early   may or may not be an error  but if it is it is an error of fact  Taking into account the applicant s stay with his family in   might lead one to qualify the finding that if in New Zealand the applicant could still maintain the sort of contact with his family that he had had in the past but  even if it did  that would amount to no more than an error of fact   I reject the applicant s submission that there was a jurisdictional error because the Tribunal member failed to take into account the applicant s three month stay with his family in   referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Re  Ex parte Applicant S      ALJR  followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant s first submission must be rejected  The High Court considered a similar submission in the recent case of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         ALJR     Nystrom    That was a case unlike the present because the visa holder in that case was not liable to deportation under s   of the Act  However  the observations of the Court do not turn on that fact    Heydon and Crennan JJ said  at      footnotes omitted     Mr Nystrom s argument that the power to deport and the power to cancel a visa  which will result in removal  deal with the same subject matter is wrong  The power under s   as restricted by s   to deport non citizens is a power in respect of the continuing presence in Australia of non citizens convicted of certain crimes  The power under s   to cancel a visa of a non citizen on character grounds  based on a  substantial criminal record  and thereby remove that non citizen is a much wider power  although it is also for the protection of the Australian community  The powers are distinct and cumulative    Not only do the powers have different purposes  different criteria apply for their exercise  The criteria in respect of a person s criminal record in s  c  and s   are not co extensive  although there is some overlap between s  c  and s  a   b  and  c   Criteria in s  d  and  e  give s   a wider field of operation than that which is covered by s  c     Moreover  it was not disputed that different consequences follow when the powers are exercised  A person who is subject to a deportation order is subject to discretionary rather than mandatory detention during any challenge  ss   and   but will then be deported unless the Minister revokes the order  A person who has a visa cancelled is subject to mandatory detention and removal  s   but may apply for a protection visa  s  E     While the powers are different  with different criteria for their exercise and different consequences when exercised  they are both special powers  The power in s   construed as it must be  together with ss   and   is not a vague or general power  The line of authority beginning with Anthony Hordern   Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia   upon which Mr Nystrom relied  has no application here as there is no repugnancy between the two powers  In fact  they are consonant with each other    The provisions have a different legislative history and a different relationship to the constitutional sources of power in s  xix  and  xxvii  as already explained  The Act contains two separate but consonant statutory systems for deportation and removal which operate differently  although the final outcome of removal may be the same  Section   does not in terms  confer on an alien any  statutory protection  from removal  consequent upon the cancellation of a visa under s      Here  s   has no application  To that extent  the facts here raise the issue of the interaction between s   as restricted by s   and s   more squarely than the facts in Jia Legeng   This distinction provides no reason to reconsider the statement in Jia Legeng that s   contains a separate statutory power  In fact  the distinction is an illustration of the discrete nature of the powers in question    Further  there is nothing in the relevant legislative history  or the terms of the two provisions  which would warrant  reading down  the power in s   which rests on s  xix  by reference to s  b i  which  while it applies to  non citizens  derived its language and purpose from the Act s former resting on s  xxvii     Accordingly  the power conferred in s   is not restricted by the operation of ss   and        Gleeson CJ made the following observations at    footnotes omitted     As to the issue concerning the effect  if any  upon s   of the Migration Act    Cth  of ss   and   of that Act  I would make the following comment  The contention that ss   and   give a person in the position of the respondent a protection or immunity from the exercise of the power conferred by s   is a statement of a conclusion  rather than an expression of a reason for reaching that conclusion  If there is such a reason  it must be found in a process of statutory construction  The provisions of s   on the one hand  and ss   and   on the other  are not repugnant  in the sense that they contain conflicting commands which cannot both be obeyed  or produce irreconcilable legal rights or obligations  They create two sources of power  by which a person in the position of the respondent may be exposed  by different processes  and in different circumstances  to similar practical consequences  There is nothing novel  or even particularly unusual  about that  It does not of itself mean that only one source of power is available  If  however  by reason of the apparent exhaustiveness with which one provision  or group of provisions  dealt with the position of a person such as the respondent  there were an incompatibility of a kind that required a conclusion that only one provision or group of provisions was intended to apply  then that would be a reason for accepting the respondent s contention  Again  if one provision  or group of provisions  were directed with particularity to the case of a person such as the respondent  and the other were merely of general application  the same could be said  As explained by Heydon and Crennan JJ  and also by Gummow and Hayne JJ  neither proposition can be made good when regard is had to the legislative history and context  In the result  the respondent s contention amounts to an assertion  a statement of an outcome that would be supportive of his freedom to remain in Australia  and in that sense protective of his interests  but without a convincing argument of statutory construction which sustains that outcome  Therefore  it fails      The reasoning of Gummow and Heydon JJ was to similar effect  at        I applied this reasoning in the recent decision of Pull v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at         Pull    That case was also a case where the visa holder
