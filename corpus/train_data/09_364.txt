his case but to discover whether he has a case at all   Hennessy v Wright      emphasis added Indeed it is useful to also note comments of Lord Esher MR in Hennessy v Wright  No       QBD   at   where his Lordship said in the context of interrogatories and  fishing  by the plaintiff in that case    In other words  the plaintiff wishes to maintain his questions  and to insist upon answers to them  in order that he may find out something of which he knows nothing now  which might enable him to make a case of which he has no knowledge at present    Significantly  the key issue arising in the notice of motion filed   November   is whether Habitare Pty Ltd and other parties should be joined as respondents to the substantive proceedings  The applicant candidly concedes that the purpose of the subpoena is to obtain further evidence On balance  I consider that the applicant in this case has established that the purpose of the subpoenas is to obtain further evidence relevant to the notice of motion filed   November   that this is a legitimate forensic purpose  and that the claim cannot be categorised as  fishing   I form this view because Accordingly  I consider that the applicant has demonstrated a legitimate forensic purpose for seeking issue of subpoenas in relation to the documents sought  and that the orders sought by the notice of motion before the Court cannot be characterised as  fishing    On the cards Is it  on the cards  that the documentation sought by the applicant will materially assist the applicant s case in relation to the notice of motion filed   November  citedHughes v WA Cricket Association     ALR  The practice whereby the Court gives leave for subpoenas to be issued against a third party pursuant to O  A has survived the introduction of O  A Federal Court Rules providing for orders of the Court relating to non party discovery  In relation to a third party  it is clear that a subpoena duces tecum may be directed to a third party prior to trial    where it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding that a person produce documents before the date of hearing of the application    Hughes v WA Cricket Association     ALR   at   cf P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd     ACSR   at    followedMcIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu

Against a third party however a subpoena is not to be used as a substitute for discovery  As Jordan CJ observed in The Commissioner for Railways v Small     SR  NSW    A writ of subpoena duces tecum may be addressed to a stranger to the cause or to a party  If it be addressed to a stranger  it must specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced  A subpoena duces tecum ought not to be issued to such a person requiring him to search for and produce all such documents as he may have in his possession or power relating to a particular subject matter  It is not legitimate to use a subpoena for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain what would be in effect discovery of documents against a person who  being a stranger  is not liable to make discovery  A stranger to the cause ought not to be required to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant     at  The law is clear that a subpoena cannot issue to facilitate  fishing  by a party  Of particular relevance in the circumstances of this case are comments of Jordan CJ in Small     SR  NSW    at   where his Honour observed    In the absence of special circumstances    A party is no more entitled to use a subpoena
