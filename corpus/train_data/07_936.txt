Commonwealth Bank v HREOC at     and  iv  The Court must weigh all relevant factors  While these may differ according to the circumstances of each case  they will usually include the reasons advanced

and the availability of alternative methods of achieving the alleged discriminator s objectives without recourse to the requirement condition  Waters v Public Transport Corporation at      However the fact that there is a reasonable alternative that might accommodate the interests of the aggrieved person does not of itself establish that a requirement or condition is unreasonable    citedBronk v Ineichen   F  d    th Cir   Some support for an interpretation which recognises the breadth of the statute can be found in two US cases where similarly drafted legislation was considered        In Bronk v Ineichen   F  d    th Cir   two profoundly deaf tenants complained that they had been the subject of discrimination by their landlord in relation to their dog which they claimed as a hearing dog  In acknowledging that it was necessary to establish as a minimum that the disabled persons  quality of life would be enhanced because the effect of their disability would be ameliorated by the accommodation of the animal  at   the United States Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit held that lack of formal schooling did not mean that the dog did not have enough skills to actually aid in the daily functions of a deaf person  at      The relevant legislation in that case was Wis Stat Ann SS     bm  which related  inter alia   to  an animal that is specially trained to lead or assist the individual with impaired vision  hearing or mobility         In Green v Housing Authority of Clackamas County   F Supp    D Or   where the landlord argued that the dog was not an appropriate accommodation for a deaf person because the plaintiffs were unable to produce any  verification  that the dog was a  certified  hearing assistance trained animal  the United States District Court found in favour of the plaintiff on grounds including that there was no relevant certification process for hearing dogs and no requirement as to the amount or type of training a service animal must

interpretation and the alleged discriminator should not be permitted to evade the statutory prohibition on indirect discrimination by defining its services so as to incorporate the alleged requirement or condition  Dawson and Toohey JJ in Waters   CLR at   Clarke   FCR at     This submission accords with comments of Sackville and Stone JJ in Clarke   FCAFC       FCR   where  in considering a claim brought against the Catholic Education Office in relation to facilities to be provided to a profoundly deaf child in Year   the  base group  was students admitted to Year   at the school in the relevant year or  alternatively  all students enrolled at the school in the relevant year  As their Honours also observed at      The other comparator is not  however  specifically identified  But as Dawson J observed in Australian Iron   Steel v Banovic at   a  proportion must be a proportion of something   This suggests that the second comparator is a group of persons with the disability  The comparison is not with the aggrieved person  since that person s ability to comply with the requirement or condition is addressed in s  c   In any event  it does not accord with the ordinary use of language to refer to the  proportion  able to comply with a requirement in relation to only one person   In this case the obvious  base group  constitutes members of the community who wish to access Cairns Base Hospital and or Smithfield Community Health Centre  There is however dispute as to the nature of the comparator group  namely whether it constitutes people with the specific disorder suffered by the applicant  as submitted by Mr Murdoch  or people with a psychiatric disability  as submitted by Mr O Gorman   Even in relation to the nature of the group  should it be defined as people with the applicant s disorder  evidence is scanty  As was made clear in the evidence of Dr Unwin  schizo typal personality disorder is the rarest of the personality disorders  TS p   ll       Mr Murdoch has submitted that I should make no finding as to this issue in light of the lack of evidence of the proportion of people with the applicant s disability who cannot comply  and the medical evidence of Dr Unwin that there is no difference between the proportion of people with and without the applicant s disability who can comply  There is no evidence before me as to the proportion of members of the comparator group  however defined  who would have difficulty complying with the requirement or condition of the respondent in this case   However  I am persuaded  as submitted by Mr O Gorman  that commonsense dictates that the majority of people in the community  including the community which seeks to access Cairns Base Hospital and or Smithfield Community Health Centre  would have no difficulty accessing the premises without an animal  and do not require an assistance dog to be able to access the respondent s premises  Accordingly for the purposes of s     I am prepared to hold that a substantially higher proportion of persons without the applicant s disability are able to comply with the requirement or condition imposed by the respondent in this case   Principles relevant to this question were summarised by Sackville and Stone JJ in Clarke   FCR at     as follows     i  The person aggrieved bears the onus of establishing that the condition or requirement was not

termed by Madgwick J in Cooper   FCA       FCR   and Drummond J in Sluggett   FCA       FCR   in s   available to a respondent who has breached s    It is curious that s   is so narrowly drafted  in comparison for example with the much broader provision in s   in relation to conduct in breach of s    However the form in which s   is drafted is matter for Parliament  not the Court  and does not in my view limit the manner in which s   should be interpreted  The defence of the respondent as pleaded in relation to unjustifiable hardship was not referable to the design or construction of its

Clarke   FCR at   citedFischer v Stuart  unreported  Supreme Court NT  Forster CJ    July   Second  and more importantly  I have genuine concerns about the operation of s  f  DD Act as presently drafted  I accepted the submissions of the applicant and the Commissioner as to the lack of qualification of the word  trained  because in my view it accorded with the meaning of the word in the Act  However  the language of the Act  in permitting a broad interpretation  in my view poses risks as to the functioning in the community of disabled persons with genuine assistance animals  The current form of s  f  DD Act as drafted has the following potential consequences        any animal that has been trained to assist a disabled person to alleviate the effect of his or her disability appears to fall within s  f  DD Act   So  for example  capuchin monkeys and miniature horses appear to be considered assistance animals notwithstanding that there may be minimal community acceptance of such animals as assistance animals  I note by way of illustration http advocacy britannica com blog advocacy service animals help humans live fuller lives      arguably inherently dangerous animals such as dingoes   Fischer v Stuart   unreported  Supreme Court NT  Forster CJ    July   could be trained to assist in alleviating the effect of a disability  and would therefore justify recognition under s  f      in relation to dogs  which are commonly used as assistance animals  there are no restrictions on the breed of dog which the DD Act recognises  This could lead to dogs without the appropriate temperament for public access being trained as assistance animals for the purposes of s  f      the DD Act specifically requires the animal to be trained only to assist in alleviating the effect of a disability  not trained to be obedient  or well behaved in public    there are no hygiene requirements nor health standards in relation to assistance animals  nor any requirement that the owner control the animal in s  f      the DD Act gives accredited training organisations no additional credence over animals trained otherwise  notwithstanding that accredited organisations such as those listed in the Guide Dogs Act    Qld  have community recognition and confidence   Third  lack of clarity in the current legislation as to the nature of an assistance animal contributes to conflict between the owners of such animals and service providers  as has been demonstrated in this case   Finally  and perhaps of most importance  is the fact that there is public confidence in and acceptance of the guide dog regime  which has more than   years recognition in State law in Queensland  and recognition throughout Australia and indeed the international community  It would be of concern if  because of the breadth of s  f  and consequent legislative endorsement given to animals with lower community acceptance and trained to inferior and less exacting standards  the public confidence and acceptance of guide dogs were to be in any way undermined  It is perhaps unfortunate that the DD Act does not  like the Guide Dogs Act    Qld  or the Dog Control Act    NZ  define assistance animals by reference to accredited training organisations  This would provide certainty for animal owners  service providers and members of the public  and strike a balance between the needs of the disabled as recognised in the DD Act and the confidence of service providers and the public as to standards of assistance animals in public places   At the hearing I indicated that I would provide my findings to the parties  and then seek submissions as to appropriate orders to make in these circumstances once the parties have had time to consider my reasons  Accordingly  I shall make orders as to the

FCA   where her Honour considered the issue of discrimination against a person with a guide dog in the context of s   alone  I also note the decision of McInnis FM in Haar v Maldon Nominees Pty Ltd

accompanied by a guide dog  visited a furniture store in Young in New South Wales  On entering the store the applicant was told by the respondent  the owner of the store  to take the dog out  The respondent refused to accept the applicant s claim that she was visually impaired  and ordered her out of the store saying he did not care if the dog was a guide dog  HREOC heard the complaint and found that the respondent s conduct in that case was unlawful by reason of s  a  DD Act in that the respondent had refused to allow the applicant access to the premises  The discrimination in that case was that the respondent had acted in breach of s  d    namely that the respondent had treated the applicant less favourably because of the fact that she was accompanied by a guide dog  On hearing an application to enforce the payment of   compensation ordered by HREOC  Stone J found that the applicant s evidence in the proceedings was unchallenged  that the conduct amounted to discrimination

 I note the decision of Stone J in Grovenor   FCA   and her Honour s application of s  a  in similar facts where denial of entry to a furniture shop by the proprietor was held to constitute a breach

also considered whether s  b  is relevant in light of the written communications between the applicant and Cairns Base Hospital and Smithfield Community Health Centre  where the hospital and the centre informed the applicant of the respondent s policy of not allowing animals  other than guide dogs  into the hospital without a prior assessment by the respondent  Although the respondent ultimately refused to allow the applicant access to its premises with his dogs so as to enliven s  a    in my view s  b  is also relevant because in discriminating against the applicant  the respondent had imposed terms or conditions upon which it was prepared to allow the applicant access to its premises  These facts may be compared with  and in my view are analogous to  Haar   ALR   where a person with a guide dog at a McDonald s restaurant was told that the next time she visited with the dog she should sit outside the  party  area of the restaurant as that area was frequented by children  McInnis FM considered that s  b  applied  as the restaurant  in discriminating against the applicant in that case  had imposed conditions on which it was prepared to allow the applicant access to its premises in the company of her guide dog   In relation to the application of s  a  and  b  however  I note the oral submission of Mr Murdoch that the case is actually  about access to services   and not about access to premises   Following consideration of this issue however  I have formed the view that the issue of access to premises  and accordingly s  a  and  b  is relevant  In this regard  I make the following observations   First  the events which occurred at the premises of the respondent fall within the ordinary meaning of refusal of  access to premises   The applicant attended the premises of the respondent  and on the relevant occasions was requested to leave  At Cairns Base Hospital on   November   he was escorted from the premises by security guards  and on three occasions at Smithfield Community Health Centre security guards were in place to ensure that the applicant did not enter the premises with his dogs  While the applicant may have attended the premises of the respondent  particularly Smithfield Community Health Centre  with a view to obtaining services  it is clear that the applicant was refused access to the premises because of the presence of his dog  He had received communications from the respondent indicating that it was prepared to allow him access to the premises with his dogs  but on the respondent s terms  To ignore the natural application of s  a  and  b  to the facts of this case would be to do an injustice to the applicant   Second  it is clear that the premises of the respondent in question were premises  that the public or a section of the public is entitled or allowed to enter or use  as contemplated by s  a  and  b   The premises in question were public reception areas of Cairns Base Hospital and the Smithfield Community Health Centre  which were public areas of medical facilities provided to the public   Third  I note the decision of Stone J in Grovenor   FCA   and her Honour s application of s  a  in similar facts where denial of entry to a furniture shop by the proprietor was held to constitute a breach of s  a    and consider the facts of that case sufficiently analogous to this case to

the word  trained  beyond its ordinary meaning as found in the Macquarie Dictionary  I agree with the Commissioner that there is no requirement in s  f    elsewhere in the DD Act   or in the regulations made pursuant to the DD Act   either explicitly or by implication  that an animal         Be trained by a particular type of trainer or organisation     Undertake a particular amount of training  or     Be accredited by or registered with a particular agency or organisation   In regard to comments of McMurdo J in Matthews   QSC     in that case it was not clear that the applicant suffered a disability within the meaning of the DD Act   further there appeared to be no evidence before his Honour that the relevant dogs in that case were trained at all  As his Honour said in that case     The applicant does not have a visual or hearing disability and it is not at all clear to me that his dogs are  trained to assist the aggrieved person to alleviate the effect of the disability   There is no evidence of any training apart from the applicant s own statement to me  in the course of his submissions  that he trains his dogs  It isn t plain that they are dogs trained in the sense which is relevant for the operation of section     Accordingly  I do not find submissions with respect to this case helpful citedPurvis v State of New South Wales  Department of Education and Training    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  While I accept this approach  and propose to consider the applicant s claims of discrimination separately under s   and s   DD Act   in my view interpreting the sections as operating independently does not mean that they are to be interpreted in isolation  either from each other or the balance of the DD Act   As was pointed out by Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ in Purvis v State of New South Wales  Department of Education and Training    HCA         CLR   at   in considering provisions of the DD Act      Each of these particular questions can be answered only by giving consideration to the relevant provisions of the Act  understood  as they must be  in the context of the Act as a whole     emphasis added  So far as relevant in this case  s   DD Act defines  disability  in relation to a person as                    g  a disorder  illness or disease that affects a person s thought processes  perception of reality  emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour   In summary  the applicant has submitted that  in addition to substance abuse disorder and dependence  he suffers a disability in the nature of a personality disorder  which is a disability within the meaning of s  g   The respondent conceded in submissions  both written and oral  that the applicant did suffer a disability  however there was some conflict in the medical evidence as to the exact nature of the disability suffered by the applicant  Notwithstanding the concession as to existence of a disability  Mr Murdoch for the respondent submitted that there is a need for the Court to come to a factual conclusion as to the nature of the applicant s disability  because the concept of alleviation of a disability in the meaning of s   DD Act  upon which the applicant s case to a significant degree rests  can only be considered properly and effectively in this case in light of a precise  factual decision as to the disability held by applicant  TS p   ll      I agree   At the hearing  expert evidence as to the nature of the applicant s disability was given by consultant psychiatrists Dr Paul Trott and Dr Alston Unwin  There was no dispute as to the expertise of either Dr Trott or Dr Unwin   The evidence was that the applicant s disability was either       a  a personality disorder of the mixed type  This was the diagnosis of Dr Trott at p   of his report dated   February    attached to Dr Trott s affidavit sworn   December    Both affidavit and oral evidence of Dr Trott were called by the applicant   b  alternatively  schizo typal personality disorder  This was the diagnosis of Dr Unwin on p   of his report dated   January    attached to Dr Unwin s affidavit sworn   June    Both affidavit and oral evidence of Dr Unwin were called by the respondent   In providing their expert opinions as to the personality disorder suffered by the applicant  Dr Trott and Dr Unwin referred to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  th ed text revision  American Psychiatric Association Washington     DSM IV  as a reference providing authoritative definition of personality orders  General diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder are there defined as      a  an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual s culture  This pattern is manifested in two  or more  of the following areas              cognition  ie ways of perceiving and interpreting self  other people  and events    affectivity  ie the range  intensity  lability and appropriateness of emotional response    interpersonal functioning    impulse control           b  the enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations  c  the enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  d  the pattern is stable and of long duration  and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood  e  the enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder  f  the enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  eg a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition eg head trauma    A personality disorder as defined by DSM IV  and as diagnosed by each expert  clearly satisfies the definition of  disability  within s  g  DD Act    Dr TrottcitedSheehan v Tin Can Bay Country Club   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  This view is consistent with the decision of Raphael FM in Sheehan v Tin Can Bay Country Club   FMCA     and to that extent I disagree with Mr Murdoch s submission that that case was incorrectly decided   Further  I accept the submissions of the applicant and the Commissioner that there is no pre requisite as to the type of animals that can be assistance animals for the purposes of s  f   I do not read any limitation to the terms of s  f  from paras  d  and  e  notwithstanding that those paragraphs were limited to dogs  Further  while I accept the evidence of Ms Sara Walker of Assistance Dogs Australia that Labradors and Golden Retrievers are trained as assistance dogs because of the social acceptability of the breeds and their extremely good nature  and that it is very uncommon for other breeds of dogs to be trained as assistance dogs  affidavit of Sara Walker sworn   August   paras     there is no limitation in the Act as to the types of dogs which can be assistance animals   The broad terms of s  f  DD Act can be contrasted with  for example  the Guide Dogs Act    Qld  which defines  guide dog  for the purposes of that statute in the following terms         guide dog  means a dog trained at an approved institution and used as a guide by a blind person or as an aid by a deaf person  s   Guide Dogs Act      approved institution  is defined by s   Guide Dogs Act to mean an institution that   a  trains dogs as guides for blind persons or aids for deaf persons  and   b  is declared under a regulation to be an approved institution for this Act     an  approved institution  for the purposes of s   Guide Dogs Act is defined by the Guide Dogs Regulations    Qld  as              Guide Dog Association of New South Wales and ACT    Guide Dogs for

in Waters   CLR at                 it would not make sense to say that a manicure involves a requirement or condition that those availing themselves of that service have one or both of their hands               the expression  requirement or condition  should be given a generous interpretation and the alleged discriminator should not be permitted to evade the statutory prohibition on indirect discrimination by defining its services so as to incorporate the alleged requirement or condition  Dawson and Toohey JJ in Waters   CLR at   Clarke   FCR at     Similarly in Sluggett   FCA       FCR   the nature of the complaint of the applicant  who suffered a disability as a result of childhood polio  in relation to long walks  many stairs  heavy doors  difficult stairways  open walk areas  crowded stairs  the distances between lifts  and the sometimes limited access to lifts at Flinders University  was such that the conduct was alleged to be unlawful in relation to the means of access to the premises pursuant to s  c    As I found earlier in this judgment  the respondent had a policy that persons entering its premises not do so accompanied by an animal unless the animal was a guide dog or a hearing dog or unless the animal had been assessed by the respondent as having training and hygiene standards acceptable to the respondent  I have found that the respondent discriminated against the applicant within the meaning of s   and s  f   Further  as was specifically acknowledged by the respondent in its written submissions  written submissions of the respondent filed

  February     February   and   March     On the facts of this case  the respondent has discriminated against the applicant on the ground of his disability by refusing to allow him access to its premises  which conduct is unlawful pursuant to s  a   As the respondent noted in written submissions  once management of Cairns Base Hospital had considered the matter after   November   it refused to allow the applicant access because it considered that his dogs were ill behaved  ill controlled and that there was inadequate evidence of proper assistance dog training  written submissions of the respondent filed   September   para       Finally  I note the very limited defence  or ground of exculpation as so termed by Madgwick J in Cooper   FCA       FCR   and Drummond J in Sluggett   FCA       FCR   in s   available to a respondent who has breached s    It is curious that s   is so narrowly drafted  in comparison for example with the much broader provision in s   in relation to conduct in breach of s    However the form in which s   is drafted is matter for Parliament  not the Court  and does not in my view limit the manner in which s   should be interpreted  The defence of the respondent as pleaded in relation to unjustifiable hardship was not referable to the design or construction of its premises as contemplated by s     and accordingly is of no relevance in the context of s     A number of general principles have developed in relation to the concept of  unjustifiable hardship  within the terms of the DD Act   These principles include the following        the issue whether the alleged discriminator is potentially subject to unjustifiable hardship arises only once the applicant establishes that the alleged discriminator has engaged in unlawful conduct  Cooper

follows     i  The person aggrieved bears the onus of establishing that the condition or requirement was not reasonable in the circumstances  Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR   at   ii  The test of reasonableness is an objective one  which requires the Court to weigh the nature and extent of the discriminatory effect  on the one hand  against the reasons advanced in favour of the condition or requirement  on the other  Bowen CJ and Gummow J in Secretary  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Styles     FCR   at   Deane J in Waters v Public Transport Corporation at     per Dawson and Toohey JJ  at    Since the test is objective  the subjective preferences of the aggrieved person are not determinative  but may be relevant in assessing whether the requirement or condition is unreasonable  Lockhart J in Commonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR   at     iii  The test of reasonableness is less demanding than one of necessity  but more demanding than a test of convenience  Styles at    It follows that the question is not whether the decision to impose the requirement or condition was correct  but whether it has been shown not to be objectively reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case  Heerey J in Australian Medical Council v Wilson     FCR   at     Sackville J in Commonwealth Bank v HREOC at     and  iv  The Court must weigh all relevant factors  While these may differ according to the circumstances of each case  they will usually include the reasons advanced in favour of the requirement or condition  the nature and effect of the requirement or condition  the financial burden on the alleged discriminator of accommodating the needs of the aggrieved person and the availability of alternative methods of achieving the alleged discriminator s objectives without recourse to the requirement condition  Waters v Public Transport Corporation at      However the fact that there is a reasonable alternative that might accommodate the interests of the aggrieved person does not of itself establish that a requirement or condition is unreasonable
