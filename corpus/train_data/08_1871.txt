National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAberdeen Construction Group Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue     TC   In the United Kingdom  the distinction between the  value  of an asset and its  state  or  nature  was drawn in Aberdeen Construction Group Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue     TC   which was concerned  in part  with para  b  of Sch   to the Finance Act    UK    Section  ZH c  which was introduced into the Act later in time is in similar  but not identical  terms to this UK provision  The taxpayer did point out that the first limb of the UK provision requires that expenditure be incurred on the asset  but I do not regard that a difference determinative of the issue before me and the way I consider the s  ZH c  should be interpreted   Under paragraph  b  of Sch   of the UK provision  one of the sums allowable as a deduction in the computation of the gain accruing to a person on the disposal of an asset was   b  the amount of any expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred on the asset by him or on his behalf for the purpose of enhancing the value of the asset  being expenditure reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of the disposal      In construing paragraph  b  UK courts have indicated that the state or nature of a share does not include its value  In Aberdeen Construction   TC   Lord President Emslie found that expenditure by the taxpayer in the form of loans to a company that were later waived was not the kind of expenditure to which paragraph  b  was directed and the paragraph was therefore not applicable  However  the Lord President went on to state  at   In any event  by no reasonable stretch of the imagination is it possible to classify the making of the loans or their waiver as expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred  on  the shares and I find it impossible to say that either were reflected in the state or nature of the shares which were sold  The waiver of the loans may well have enhanced their value but what para  b  is looking for is  as the result of relevant expenditure  an identifiable change for the better in the state or nature of the asset  and this must be a change distinct from the enhancement of value   Lord Avonside said that the loan  may have enhanced  the share s  value in so far as it might give  the company  working capital helpful to its trading  When the loan was waived the shares remained in their state and nature unchanged   at     This issue was not considered by the House of Lords when the matter went on appeal  although the appeal was successful   The Commissioner before me relied upon above passages in the UK authorities  and particularly the last sentence in Fenston s case  On the other hand  the taxpayer submitted that the UK authorities have no precedential value  either because in the case of Aberdeen the actual decision relied on was overturned by the House of Lords  and in the case of Fenston   the comments relied upon were clearly dicta  The taxpayer also contended that the dicta relied upon by the Commissioner before me in the above passages was wrong   The comments therein relied upon by the Commissioner do support the approach to the concepts of  value  and  state or nature  included within similar legislation which accord with my own view of the operation of s  ZH c   It may not have been strictly correct to refer  as was done by the Lord President in Aberdeen   to  an identifiable change  or a  change distinct from the enhancement of value   The UK provision  like s  ZH c  does not specifically talk in terms of  change  only the need for the expenditure being reflected in the state or nature of the asset  However  the clear approach taken by the UK authorities is to treat  value  as a concept falling outside the concept of  state or nature  in similarly worded legislation dealing with the same subject matter   Finally  in the taxpayer s submission  excluding the capital contribution from the cost base of the NMUK shares would give rise to an anomalous result  Payments into shareholders  funds may take a variety of forms  including the purchase of shares  the payment of calls on shares  and as here  by the making of capital contributions  It was contended that to allow some of these payments to be taken into account in determining cost base  but not others  being the capital contribution  is not capable of rational explanation   The Commissioner responded to this submission by contending that the exclusion of the capital expenditure of     million from the reduced cost base of the shares does not give rise to an anomalous result  It may be that the amount would have been part of the cost base if it had taken some other form  However  the way in which a company raises capital can take many forms  each with different taxing consequences  Moreover  it was submitted that the provision is not specific to cost base in respect of shares  but to assets generally  The way in which the taxpayer here determined to contribute capital to NMSLAL should not dictate the proper construction of the section because the taxpayer may have been able to secure the expenditure as part of the cost base if it had been done differently

Farwell J   in a passage which Lord Russell of Killowen in Inland Revenue Commissioners v  Crossman   A C      at p   described as an accurate exposition of the nature of a share  stated that a share is the interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money for the purpose of liability in the first place and of interest in the second  but also consisting of a series of mutual covenants entered into by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with     the Companies Act     a share is an interest measured by a sum of money and made up of various rights contained in the

interest of a shareholder in a company by a sum of money is no longer apt under present corporations law in Australia following the abolition of the concept of par value and of authorised capital   at     More specifically  a share comprises  a congeries of rights in personam     Archibald Howie   HCA       CLR   at   per Dixon J  which includes the right to participate in dividends  the right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a winding up  and the right to receive capital upon a reduction of capital by the company  Sydney Futures Exchange Ltd v Australian Stock Exchange Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   citedBradbury v English Sewing Cotton Company Ltd   AC   It may be said that these aspects contribute to the economic content of a share  Some commentators make mention of the  economic  character of a share  For example  Professor R Pennington in     Company Lawyer   concluded that  they are a species of intangible movable property which comprise a collection of rights and obligations relating to an interest in a company of an economic and proprietary character  but not constituting a debt   After all  a share is a fractional part of the capital  and thus confers upon the shareholder a certain  interest  to a proportionate part of the assets of the corporation whether by way of dividend or of distribution of assets in winding up  see Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Company Ltd   AC       per Lord Wrenbury  and that that  interest  might come to represent in value far more than the original capital which had been contributed  see Ord Forrest Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR       and   per Stephen J    It was on the basis of these bundle of rights in personam   the taxpayer submitted that capital expenditure in relation to shares will be  reflected  in the  state or nature  of the shares where the amount of the contribution increases shareholders  equity thereby increasing their value  and the amount of the contribution remains available for return to the shareholders pursuant to the rights attaching to the shares   In the present case  the payment of the capital contribution to shareholders  funds of NMSLAL was made for the purpose of  and to the extent of  sterling    million had the effect of  increasing the embedded value of NMSLAL and the embedded value of NMUK  and thus  the value of the shares in NMUK  The benefit of the contribution to the extent of  sterling    million remained reflected in the value of shares in NMUK at the time of their disposal  Moreover  after April   and until the date of sale  the amount of the contribution to the extent of  sterling    million remained in existence and was available to be returned to the shareholders  funds of NMSLAL  and distributed as capital to NMUK and by NMUK to the taxpayer pursuant to the rights attaching to the shares  This is how  as it was argued by the taxpayer  the capital contribution was reflected in the  state or nature  of the shares in the context of s  ZH c    I was taken to a number of dictionary definitions of the words  state   nature  and  value   Relevantly  the first definition given by the Macquarie Dictionary   th ed  for  state  is  the condition of a person or thing  as with respect to circumstances or attributes   The definition of  nature  relevantly refers to  the particular combination of qualities belonging to a person or thing by birth or constitution  referring to the inherent qualities of a person or thing   Value  is relevantly defined as  material or monetary worth  as in traffic or sale  and  the worth of a thing as measured by the amount of other things for which it can be exchanged  or as estimated in terms of a medium of exchange  citedEsso Australia Resources Ltd v

Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR         In our opinion the plain language of the sections is confirmed by the only directly relevant extrinsic material  which shows that parliament intended the consequence that is said by the appellant to be anomalous  Especially when different views can be held about whether the consequence is anomalous on the one hand or acceptable or understandable on the other  the Court should be particularly careful that arguments based on anomaly or incongruity are not allowed to obscure the real intention  and choice  of the Parliament       w e are unable to conclude that the operation of ss   and   on a literal reading does not conform to the legislative purpose   I do not accept that any anomaly arises from the construction pressed by the Commissioner in this case  I accept the submissions of the Commissioner that the taxpayer  having chosen a particular way in which to organise its affairs  must then be bound by any fiscal consequences that follow  and this does not lead to an anomaly  but arises because of the application of the legislative provision to the facts   In light of the above reasons  the application should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding seventy one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton    Associate Dated

context in which each word appears in s  ZH c  and the context in which s  ZH c  itself appears  see  eg  Falconer v Pederson   VR         I have already attempted to explain that context  Looking at the context in which the concept  state or nature  is used in s  ZH c  referable to a share  I do not consider that concept includes a share s value  As I have said  s  ZH c  in my view  clearly distinguishes the concept of  value  with  state  or  nature   I do not mean by this to treat the term  state or nature  as a composite phrase  but I do consider it appropriate to view both words in the context in which they appear alongside  value  as found in the first limb of s  ZH c   Undoubtedly  a share as an item of property differs from property such as land in that a share s characteristics are fixed primarily by the obligations and rights in the contract between company and shareholder  In the case of land  as the example in the Explanatory Memorandum would indicate   value  would not be included within the concepts of  state  or  nature   Similarly  in the case of a share  value  is not included within the concepts of  state  or  nature    Even by just considering the words  state  or  nature  themselves  I am also of the view that it cannot be said in relation to a share as an item of property  which may be bought and sold  that  value  forms any part of the nature or state of that form of asset  The  nature  of a share refers to the bundle of rights  and obligations  attaching to a share  as described previously  being the inherent qualities of a share  Those rights exist  and may be exercised  irrespective of their value  The  state  of a share does not refer to its  value  but refers to other matters  such as whether a share is fully paid up or not  The value of a share does not affect the  state  of a share  if one focuses on the particular condition of a share as an item of property consideredPilmer v Duke Group Limited  in Liquidation    HCA

own constructions  referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment  Capital Gains  Bill    Cth  which inserted s  ZH c  into the Act  I note that care must be taken in the use of an explanatory memorandum  see  eg  Re Australian Federation of Construction Contractors  Ex parte Billing   HCA         ALR         The Explanatory Memorandum stated  although in this text referring to  ZH c  which is in the same terms as s  ZH c  An example of the type of expenditure which may be included in the cost base to a taxpayer of an asset under paragraph  c  would be expenditure incurred on the extension of a building  Generally  expenditure on rates  interest and repairs will not fall within the cost base of the asset as these items of expenditure may be classed as expenses of a revenue nature and not of a capital nature  Note that expenditure incurred in enhancing the value of the asset must be reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of disposal  For example  if a carport is erected adjacent to an income producing property but at a later stage is dismantled and a garage erected  the expenditure incurred in erecting the carport would be disregarded in calculating the cost base of the property as it is no longer reflected in the state or nature of the asset  Similarly  paragraph  c  is designed to exclude from the cost base any expenditure incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of the asset by way of improvements which have wasted away prior to disposal   In considering the competing submissions on the construction of s  ZH c  the Explanatory Memorandum provides little assistance  although it does indicate an approach to the intended operation of the provision in relation to tangible assets  The example given of the type of capital expenditure covered by s  ZH c  is that of expenditure incurred to erect a carport adjacent to an income producing building  The example continues that if the carport were to be subsequently dismantled prior to sale  the expenditure would be disregarded as it would not be reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of the sale  Such an example is not easily translatable to intangible property such as shares as the example assigns physical characteristics to  state or nature   The example does indicate  however  that any physical changes brought about by the expenditure must continue and must not have dissipated prior to disposal of the asset  for a taxpayer to take advantage of the provision citedRe Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation   AATA         ATR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  I have considered the issue for determination without reference to any direct authority on s  ZH c   The phrase  reflected in the state or nature of the asset  has not been authoritatively considered by Australian courts  The only consideration of the phrase  appears in Re Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation   AATA         ATR     in which Member G A Barton considered the identical phrase as found in ss  ZH c  and  c  of the Act  Member Barton found that the taxpayer was not entitled to include capital expenditure by way of incentive payments in the cost base of the shares in calculating the capital gain on the sale of those shares  as they were not reflected in the  state or nature  of the shares at the time of disposal  There was no dispute that the incentive payments constituted expenditure of a capital nature  Member Barton concluded  however  that  at   The Tribunal finds that none of the rights that constituted the applicant s shares in the proprietary company and  subsequently  in the new company  was reflective of the incentive payments  There was no evidence before the Tribunal on which it could find that the applicant s shares in the proprietary company or in the new company  constituted a class of shares reflecting the amount of the incentive payments because they included a special or additional right attributable to such payments  The fact that the issued shares in the new company were listed on the boards of the London and Australian stock markets did not make the state or nature of the applicant s shares reflective of the amount of the incentive payments  The state or nature of the applicant s shares in the new company was indistinguishable from that of other issued shares in the new company  The Tribunal rejects the proposition that any causal link between the incentive payments and the listing of the issued shares in the new company makes the state or nature of the applicant s shares in that company reflective of the amount of the incentive payments for the purposes of ss   ZH c  and  c  of the ITAA    So the Tribunal finds that the state or nature of the applicant s shares in the proprietary company did not reflect the amount of the incentive payment when they were exchanged for shares in the new company  and the state or nature of the shares in the new company did not reflect that amount when the applicant disposed of them  In the light of this finding it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider whether the incentive payment was incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of the applicant s shares in the proprietary company and in the new company and whether the indexed cost base of the trustee s shares in the new company included any part of the incentive payment citedSydney Futures Exchange Ltd v Australian Stock Exchange Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  More specifically  a share comprises

of the FD Fenston Will Trusts v The Commissioners of Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs  unreported  Special Commissioners    February   In The Trustees of the FD Fenston Will Trusts v The Commissioners of Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs  unreported  Special Commissioners    February   the Special Commissioners considered s  b  of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act    UK  which likewise contains the phrase  reflected in the state or nature of the asset   The expenditure in this case was made by the trustees as capital contributions to a company in which they held shares  Those shares were the relevant assets  The appellants submitted that the shares increased in value following the expenditure and the expenditure was therefore reflected in the state or nature of the shares at that time  continuing through to the time of disposal  However  the Special Commissioners found at   that state or nature could not be equated with value  It is clear from the provision that Parliament did not intend that all expenditure incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of an asset should be deductible in computing capital gains  Only such expenditure as would be reflected in the  state and nature of the asset at the time of the disposal  was to be allowed  Further   state and nature  for these purposes must be something other than merely the value of the asset otherwise this phrase would add nothing to the immediately preceding words  In this case the Capital Contributions did not result in any increase in the number of shares in issue  or result in any change in the rights or restrictions attaching to the shares  The only effect of the Capital Contributions was to increase the surplus of the company which would increase the amount available for distribution to shareholders  and therefore presumably the value of the shares  We do not consider this sufficient for the expenditure on the Capital Contributions to be reflected in the state and nature of the shares  either at the time the expenditure was incurred or at any time subsequently   emphasis added  The Commissioner before me relied upon above passages in the UK authorities  and
