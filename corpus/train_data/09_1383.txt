proceedings in this Court the trustee has sought orders pursuant to s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Bankruptcy Act  to set aside the transfer by Mr Jensen of his interest in the Carrara property to the respondent  and consequential orders in respect of the matrimonial home  In Combis  Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen  Bankrupt  v Jensen   FCA   I dismissed the respondent s notice of motion seeking an order that the substantive proceedings be stayed as an abuse of process  At the same time I dealt in part with the trustee s amended notice of motion filed   March   and ordered that the trustee have leave to amend his statement of claim  However that part of the trustee s amended notice of motion seeking an order that paras  a to  i of the Defence filed by the respondent be struck out has remained unresolved  This is because The respondent now seeks leave to file an Amended Defence and Cross Claim  In her Amended Defence and Cross Claim the respondent has also sought to further amend para   the subject of the trustee s notice of motion  It was not in contention during the hearing before me that the trustee s application to strike out para   of the

property to the respondent by Mr Jensen was merely a transfer of the bare legal title In Combis  Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen  Bankrupt  v Jensen   FCA   the Court declined of its own motion to transfer these proceedings to the Family Court  In that decision I observed that no formal application for transfer had been made by the respondent and no opportunity provided to the trustee to answer such an application  The respondent has now specifically sought an order that these proceedings be transferred to the Family Court  and filed detailed submissions in support of her application  The trustee opposes such an order  in summary  on the following grounds The question whether bankruptcy related proceedings should be transferred from the Federal Court to the Family Court has been considered in a number of cases by this Court  So  for example  the respondent has drawn my attention to the following cases   First  Mr Griffin QC for the respondent submitted that if the trustee is successful in the substantive proceedings the respondent will make an application in the Family Court under s   of the Family Law Act seeking an order altering the interests of the trustee in the relevant property of Mr Jensen  As Besanko J observed in Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   at     the Federal Court can hear and determine the trustee s claim  but it cannot hear and determine a spouse s claim under the Family Law Act should it become necessary to do so  Since judgment was delivered in Combis  Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen  Bankrupt  v Jensen   FCA   it has become clear that citedNational Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation     FCR  In relation to the Cross Claim before me  there is no suggestion by the trustee that the respondent has unduly delayed her application to file a Cross Claim  that it would be unjust to the trustee if I were to grant leave to the respondent to file the Cross Claim  or that the Cross Claim is designed as a calculated harassment of the trustee in the principal proceedings  cf National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation     FCR   at    The s  ZQ notice the subject of the Cross Claim was issued on the basis of a claim that the transfer of the Hope Island property was made for no consideration at a time at which Mr Jensen was insolvent  and that it was void as against the trustee pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Similar issues  as between the same parties  are raised by both the s  ZQ notice and the principal proceedings  While  as submitted by Mr McQuade for the trustee  the issue of the s  ZQ notice does not require the trustee to commence proceedings in relation to the property the subject of that notice  I consider that the submissions of the respondent I listed earlier in this judgment concerning the broader question of whether the Court should grant leave to file the Cross Claim have merit  and I propose to adopt them  Accordingly  I consider it appropriate that the respondent have leave to file Cross Claim in the terms annexed to the affidavit of the respondent sworn   September       SHOULD PARAGRAPHS  e    AND   AMENDED DEFENCE AND CROSS

FCAFC  htmlIn claiming that the alleged relinquishment and forfeiture of claims by the respondent did not constitute valid consideration the trustee relied in particular on the decision of the Full Court in Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR     in which case their Honours had in turn considered the earlier Full Court decision in Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    The respondent claimed that her forbearance to sue and relinquishment of claims as pleaded in both the Amended Defence and the Cross Claim constituted consideration in the circumstances of this case  and that accordingly those pleadings were not untenable as claimed by the trustee  Submissions of the trustee In summary Mr McQuade for the trustee submitted that  The claims in relation to the properties listed in para  j of the Amended Defence  in respect of which the respondent alleges relinquishment and forfeiture of her claims and in respect of which the respondent also claims forfeiture of her claims to spousal maintenance  are inconsistent with the recitals and terms of the Financial Agreement  in particular Recital N and cl   and are therefore untenable  Recital K to the Financial Agreement stated that the agreement was entered into in substitution for any rights for spousal maintenance and property under Pt VIII of the Family Law Act   Whitlam and Jacobson JJ in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at       rejected the proposition that valuation of consideration in the form of a forbearance to sue could be undertaken by assessing the non financial and financial contributions to the marriage as if an application had been made under s   of the Family Law Act   The respondent s pleaded case is underpinned by the allegation of assessment of the value of the consideration  namely the relinquishment of causes of action on the basis of the factors set out in paras  a to  d and  f to  ia  of the Amended Defence and Cross Claim  For the reasons set out in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   and Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   that is untenable  Submissions of the respondent In summary  Mr Griffin QC for the respondent submitted that  The decision in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   does not support the proposition that forbearance to sue in matrimonial proceedings is of no commercial value and therefore not consideration within the meaning of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   is distinguishable because in that case the parties made an informal agreement which did not prevent the wife from applying for relief under s   of the Family Law Act   whereas in this case  the parties signed a formal agreement recognised under the Family Law Act   the respondent expressly relinquished and forfeited any claims and entitlements to property in Mr Jensen s name as well as an entitlement to spousal maintenance  the respondent has  by entering into the financial agreement and by virtue of s  A of the Family Law Act   lost the right to apply for relief under s   and s   of the Family Law Act in relation to spousal maintenance and alteration of property interests  Insofar as the decision in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   related to the meaning of the phrase  consideration of less than market value  it was obiter because  the primary judge in Lopatinsky found that a forbearance to sue under s   of the Family Law Act was consideration within the meaning of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   the Full Court found that there was no agreement to compromise Mrs Lopatinsky s claims and if there had been an implied forbearance to sue it was worthless because there were no consent orders entered under s   of the Family Law Act nor was the agreement approved under s   of the Family Law Act   the trustee in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   accepted that an implied forbearance to sue can constitute good consideration  The appeal in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   was allowed because the agreement of Mrs Lopatinsky not to sue was found to be unenforceable and therefore was not valid consideration  The outcome would have been different had the agreement been binding and enforceable  In any event the whole issue of consideration and forbearance to sue are matters of judicial debate  and the pleadings ought not be struck out on an interlocutory application  Forbearance to sue and bankruptcy The concepts of forbearance to sue and consideration sit uneasily with circumstances where property interests are altered in a matrimonial context and one of the spouses becomes bankrupt  This issue was considered in detail by the Full Court in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR    It is useful at this point to turn to that decision  Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky A property was registered in the name of Mr and Mrs Lopatinsky as joint tenants  The property was sold  Approximately eighteen months after the settlement of the sale Mr Lopatinsky became bankrupt  It appears that the Lopatinskys had agreed informally that  on settlement of the sale of the property  Mrs Lopatinsky would receive   more than she would have been paid out of the net proceeds if those proceeds had been equally divided between them  Mr Lopatinksy s trustee in bankruptcy claimed that Mrs Lopatinsky gave no consideration for the transfer to her of the   or alternatively that she gave consideration which was less than the market value of the sum transferred to her  and that accordingly the payment of that sum was void pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   So far as relevant the trial judge found that  Mrs Lopatinsky gave consideration for the transfer of the   in the form of a forbearance to sue under s   of the Family Law Act for an adjustment of property rights to reflect her contribution to the acquisition of the property and to the welfare of the marriage  Mr Lopatinsky had agreed to this arrangement        because he was settling  in a general sense  with his wife following the failure of their marriage in relation to all the matrimonial property  It is to be recalled that the bankrupt told the applicant she could take whatever money was necessary to purchase something for her and the children to live in and that he believed she would be fair  I also infer from these remarks of the bankrupt  having regard to he context in which they were made  that his offer was in recognition of the applicant s contribution to the family and the property they jointly owned as well as her future needs in raising their children  and an acceptance that a fair distribution of that property would result in her receiving a disproportionately large sum of the proceedings    Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky     Fam LR   at    Accordingly the trial judge ordered that the relevant s  ZQ notice be set aside  Before the Full Court the trustee contended that The Full Court allowed the appeal against the decision of the primary judge  The majority judgment in the case was delivered by Whitlam and Jacobson JJ  Their Honours considered the earlier decision of the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   upon which the trial judge in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   relied  and in summary observed that  The trial judge in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   had found that there was implied in the settlement a forbearance on the part of Mrs Lopatinsky to make a claim against Mr Lopatinsky under the Family Law Act   and that an implied forbearance to sue constitutes good consideration    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at     Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   was not a case involving express or implied forbearance to sue rather consent orders had been made and entered pursuant to s   of the Family Law Act which provided for   inter alia  the transfer of the matrimonial home    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   All the members of the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   were of the view that where a consent order is made under s   of the Family Law Act the transfer of property takes place pursuant to the order of the Court  Accordingly  as a matter of construction of s     there can be no  transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt     Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   The purpose of s   of the Bankruptcy Act is to prevent properties  including the matrimonial home  from being transferred to related parties to the disadvantage of the bankrupt s creditors  Disadvantage will occur if the property is transferred for no consideration or for less than market value    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   There is nothing in s   to suggest that Parliament intended that the term  consideration  in s  b  is to be read in anything other than its legal sense  It would be inconsistent with the observations of Wilcox and Branson JJ in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   to proceed upon the basis that  consideration  could be something less than the ordinary legal and commercial understanding of that term    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   In applying s  b  the first step is to identify the consideration which was actually given  If consideration was given  the second step is to determine whether its value was less than the market value of the property transferred    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   As Wilcox J observed in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   at     the issue of the value of contributions is to be determined at a time when the marriage has come to an end and any contributions to the marriage were made in the past  Past consideration is  generally speaking  no consideration  The only significant exception to that rule arises where there is an earlier promise to pay  express or implied  an exception which is difficult to apply to matrimonial contributions unless for example there is a valid prenuptial agreement to that effect    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   The primary judge acknowledged that there was no express agreement between the Lopatinskys that Mrs Lopatinsky would not maintain proceedings for an adjustment of her property rights under the Family Law Act    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   The trustee accepted that an implied forbearance to sue can constitute good consideration  While the evidence of such a forbearance was slim  it was in any event unnecessary to decide whether the primary judge was correct in drawing the inference that Mrs Lopatinsky had so acted because the approach of the primary judge as to what constituted consideration and the value of it was contrary to the decision in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    Their Honours continued         Findings of the primary judge  indicate that his Honour endeavoured to value the  consideration  provided by Mrs Lopatinsky upon the basis of her financial and non financial contributions to the marriage in accordance with the criteria referred to in s   of the Family Law Act               The short answer to this appeal is therefore that the primary judge s view of the value of the consideration given by Mrs Lopatinsky depended upon factors which cannot provide a basis for assessing the value of the consideration which was given    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at         In any event  actual forbearance to sue does not constitute consideration unless it is evidence of an implied promise to forbear or unless it is given at the express or implied request of the other party  There was no evidence to support a finding that Mrs Lopatinsky promised to give up a claim under s   of the Family Law Act   in that there were no proceedings on foot in the Family Court and no mention by either party of the possibility of such a claim    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   Further  even if the informal agreement between Mr and Mrs Lopatinsky was supported by consideration in the form of an implied promise not to sue  it would not amount to a legally binding agreement for a compromise of Mrs Lopatinsky s entitlement to make a claim for a further property adjustment    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   Findings   Second  even had such inconsistencies not existed between the terms of the financial agreement and the terms of para   and para   of the Amended Defence and Cross Claim  I consider that the reliance by the respondent on her financial and non financial contributions to the marriage as consideration for the transfer of the relevant properties is untenable  This is because the consideration pleaded by the respondent in para   and para   of the Amended Defence and Cross Claim  depended on factors which cannot provide a basis for assessing the value of the consideration which was given   Whitlam and Jacobson JJ in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   is clear authority that previous financial and non financial contributions to a marriage do not constitute  consideration   within the meaning of s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act   for the transfer of property from a person who subsequently becomes bankrupt to his or her spouse  Specifically  paras  a   b   c   d   f   g   h   i   a   b   c   d   g   h   i and  j of the Amended Defence and Cross Claim plead facts relevant to the circumstances of the marriage of the respondent and Mr Jensen and the financial and non financial contributions they have each made  In my view In light of these findings  I do not accept the respondent s submission that the facts pleaded in these paragraphs are directly relevant to support the respondent s allegation that the respondent provided consideration to Mr Jensen for the transfer  being either in the form of the consideration for the transfer of the relevant properties  or the consideration being in the form of the forbearance to sue for spousal maintenance and the respondent s abandonment of her interest in various specified assets  Accordingly these paragraphs in the Amended Defence and Cross Claim are untenable    Third  I do not accept the submission of the respondent that the decision in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   with respect to the meaning of the phrase  consideration of less value than market value  was obiter  The Full Court in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   accepted the general proposition that forbearance to sue could constitute good consideration  but found that the approach of the primary judge in endeavouring to  value  the alleged consideration provided by Mrs Lopatinsky upon the basis of Mrs Lopatinsky s financial and non financial contributions to the marriage in accordance with the criteria referred to in the Family Law Act was incorrect  at      In light of these clear findings I do not accept the submission by the respondent that Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   was distinguishable because no consent orders pursuant to s   of the Family Law Act had been entered in those proceedings    Fourth  I do not accept the submission of the respondent that the decision in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   is distinguishable because in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   there was only an informal agreement whereby the wife had relinquished her entitlement to sue  whereas in this case the respondent and Mr Jensen had executed a financial agreement pursuant to the Family Law Act in which the respondent had expressly relinquished and forfeited any claims and entitlements to property in Mr Jensen s name as well as an entitlement to spousal maintenance  I take this view because   a  Although one of the reasons for the decision of the Full Court in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   was that there was no evidence to support a finding that Mrs Lopatinsky had promised to give up a claim under s   of the Family Law Act   in fact the primary reason described by Whitlam and Jacobson JJ as  the short answer to this appeal   at     was the incorrect view the primary judge had taken of the alleged consideration provided in the circumstances of the case    b  It is not in dispute that a binding financial

by a person who later becomes a bankrupt     Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   The purpose of s   of the Bankruptcy Act is to prevent properties  including the matrimonial home  from being transferred to related parties to the disadvantage of the bankrupt s creditors  Disadvantage will occur if the property is transferred for no consideration or for less than market value    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   There is nothing in s   to suggest that Parliament intended that the term  consideration  in s  b  is to be read in anything other than its legal sense  It would be inconsistent with the observations of Wilcox and Branson JJ in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   to proceed upon the basis that  consideration  could be something less than the ordinary legal and commercial understanding of that term    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   In applying s  b  the first step is to identify the consideration which was actually given  If consideration was given  the second step is to determine whether its value was less than the market value of the property transferred    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   As Wilcox J observed in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   at     the issue of the value of contributions is to be determined at a time when the marriage has come to an end and any contributions to the marriage were made in the past  Past consideration is  generally speaking  no consideration  The only significant exception to that rule arises where there is an earlier promise to pay  express or implied  an exception which is difficult to apply to matrimonial contributions unless for example there is a valid prenuptial agreement to that effect    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   The primary judge acknowledged that there was no express agreement between the Lopatinskys that Mrs Lopatinsky would not maintain proceedings for an adjustment of her property rights under the Family Law Act    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   The trustee accepted that an implied forbearance to sue can constitute good consideration  While the evidence of such a forbearance was slim  it was in any event unnecessary to decide whether the primary judge was correct in drawing the inference that Mrs Lopatinsky had so acted because the approach of the primary judge as to what constituted consideration and the value of it was contrary to the decision in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    Their Honours continued         Findings of the primary judge  indicate that his Honour endeavoured to value the  consideration  provided by Mrs Lopatinsky upon the basis of her financial and non financial contributions to the marriage in accordance with the criteria referred to in s   of the Family Law Act               The short answer to this appeal is therefore that the primary judge s view of the value of the consideration given by Mrs Lopatinsky depended upon factors which cannot provide a basis for assessing the value of the consideration which was given    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at         In any event  actual forbearance to sue does not constitute consideration unless it is evidence of an implied promise to forbear or unless it is given at the express or implied request of the other party  There was no evidence to support a finding that Mrs Lopatinsky promised to give up a claim under s   of the Family Law Act   in that there were no proceedings on foot in the Family Court and no mention by either party of the possibility of such a claim    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   Further  even if the informal agreement between Mr and Mrs Lopatinsky was supported by consideration in the form of an implied promise not to sue  it would not amount to a legally binding agreement for a compromise of Mrs Lopatinsky s entitlement to make a claim for a further property adjustment    Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at   Findings   Fourth  I do not accept the submission of the respondent that the decision in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   is distinguishable because in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   there was only an informal agreement whereby the wife had relinquished her entitlement to sue  whereas in this case the respondent and Mr Jensen had executed a financial agreement pursuant to the Family Law Act in which the respondent had expressly relinquished and forfeited any claims and entitlements to property in Mr Jensen s name as well as an entitlement to spousal maintenance  I take this view because   a  Although one of the reasons for the decision of the Full Court in Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   was that there was no evidence to support a finding that Mrs Lopatinsky had promised to give up a claim under s   of the Family Law Act   in fact the primary reason described by Whitlam and Jacobson JJ as  the short answer to this appeal   at     was the incorrect view the primary judge had taken of the alleged consideration provided in the circumstances of the case    b  It is not in dispute that a binding financial agreement which is valid under the relevant provisions of Pt VIIIA of the Family Law Act has the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the court in respect of certain matters covered by the agreement  including financial matters or financial resources to which a binding financial agreement applies  Black   Black   FamCAFC   at     However the simple fact of acknowledgment by one spouse in a financial agreement of the provision of consideration for the transfer of property does not mean that the alleged consideration is adequate for the purposes of s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act if a transaction is subsequently challenged by a trustee in bankruptcy  As I noted earlier in this judgment   consideration  in the context of the bankruptcy legislation has its ordinary legal and commercial meaning   Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR   at    The fact that the movement of consideration is acknowledged in a financial agreement does not give the consideration validity it would not otherwise have    c  Further  and in any event  as I have already found in Combis  Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen  Bankrupt  v Jensen   FCA     the transfer of property pursuant to a financial agreement does not equate to a transfer of property pursuant to Court order  as was the case in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    The current legislative framework applicable to financial agreements contemplates that a trustee in bankruptcy may make application pursuant to both s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act to set aside a transfer pursuant to a financial agreement executed by the parties  Similarly  it is open to the Court to review the nature of the consideration stated in a financial agreement  The Court is not in any way prevented from doing so by the fact that the financial agreement is enforceable as between the parties under the Family Law Act    b  Alleged payment by the respondent and her mother for the Carrara property  resulting in the transfer of that property to the respondent by Mr Jensen was merely a transfer of the bare legal titlecitedOfficial Trustee in Bankruptcy v Racovitis   FCA  Forbearance to sue for an antecedent debt pursuant

Cummins   HCA         CLR     Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Crennan JJ observed           the following view expressed in the present edition of Professor Scott s work respecting beneficial ownership of the matrimonial home   The Law of Trusts    th ed   vol     at   should be accepted            It is often a purely accidental circumstance whether money of the husband or of the wife is actually used to pay the purchase price to the vendor  where both are contributing by money or labour to the various expenses of the household  It is often a matter of chance whether the family expenses are incurred and discharged or services are rendered in the maintenance of the home before or after the purchase                              That reasoning applies with added force in the present case where the title was taken in the joint names of the spouses  There is no occasion for equity to fasten upon the registered interest held by the joint tenants a trust obligation representing differently proportionate interests as tenants in common  The subsistence of the matrimonial relationship  as Mason and Brennan JJ emphasised in Calverley v Green     HCA       CLR   at   supports the choice of joint tenancy with the prospect of survivorship     The range of financial considerations and accidental circumstances in the matrimonial relationship referred to by Professor Scott answers the second concern of equity  namely the disproportion between quantum of beneficial ownership and contribution to the acquisition of the matrimonial home  In Cummins   HCA         CLR   the High Court upheld the decision of the primary judge that the subject of the relevant disposition of land was that which appeared on the transfer  namely the interest of the husband as joint tenant of the matrimonial home  without any displacement to allow for a beneficial tenancy in common in shares of which the larger was that of the wife  In these proceedings there is no dispute that the Carrara property  described in the financial agreement as the matrimonial home  was registered in the names of the respondent and Mr Jensen as joint tenants  The decision of the High Court in Cummins   HCA         CLR   supports an inference of joint tenancy with the prospect of survivorship as to the equitable interest held by the parties to the marriage  The pleadings of the respondent do not displace this inference  nor did the submissions at the hearing  In my view paras  e   e   ea   e and  f of the Amended Defence and Cross Claim are untenable  Conclusion It follows that paras  e
