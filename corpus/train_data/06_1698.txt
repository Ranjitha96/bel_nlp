provisions were said to be of significance to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee in its Report   Patents  Innovation and Competition in Australia   AGPS  Canberra    leading to the Act  That background does not  however  itself give meaning to the words of s   as enacted  although of course it is of assistance in construing those words   It is not necessary to explore fully the content of that expression  The Collins accepted that  but for one feature  the timber was a staple commercial product  The distinguishing feature  it was said  was that the Territory had  written off  the trees on the Howard Springs land as a commercial crop for use as timber  which they described as included within the term silverculture  in November   and therefore that the Territory thereafter regarded the Howard Springs land as only suitable for clearing so that the licences permitting the removal of the timber were merely part of a  salvage  operation  Silverculture  they said  included forestry operations for commercial timber  woodchips  aesthetics  and other commercial uses  But for having been  written off  there would  as the Collins submitted  have been no issue but that the timber was a staple commercial product   I accept that  in November   or thereabouts  the Territory decided upon advice that the trees on the relevant property at Howard Springs were not of sufficient quality for their initially intended use for commercial timber and other associated products discussedAnaesthetic Supplies Pty Ltd v Rescare Ltd     FCR   As counsel for the Territory recognised  there is an

ct  html  As counsel for the Territory recognised  there is an apparent difference in the views of the Full Court in Anaesthetic Supplies Pty Ltd v Rescare Ltd     FCR     Rescare   on the one hand and in Bristol Myers Squibb Company v FH Faulding   Co Ltd   FCA         FCR     Bristol Myers   on the other  as to the construction of s     The contrast with Bristol Myers can be seen from the remarks of Black CJ and Lehane J at     where their Honours said     We may say  with all the advantages of hindsight  that the drafting of s   is less than felicitous     it is perhaps a pity that the drafter chose to use the phrase  use of a product  which contains such a clear reference to the terminology of para  a  of the definition of  exploit   But s   provides its own dictionary  in subs    And our paraphrase of s   incorporating subs c  shows  in our view  that the construction urged by the appellant is not only a possible construction but a literal one  That literal construction being consistent with the apparent purpose of the provision  it is  in our view  plainly to be preferred      The reference to the construction of the appellant is to the contention that the use of an input to the process would amount to contributory infringement of the process patent then in suit by the supplier of the input   It is correct  as counsel for the Territory contended  that Bristol Myers was decided on the ground of want of novelty  so that strictly speaking those observations are obiter dicta   As I have decided this matter on another basis in any event  I think it is preferable simply to note the Territory s contention that I should follow the decision in Rescare   and not to decide the issue as between those two lines of authority  If I were to accept the Territory s contention  it would follow that s   did not apply to the  supply  of the timber to ACOC by the Territory in any event  because ACOC s use of the product supplied  the timber  did not itself infringe the patent  and that to conclude otherwise would extend the protection afforded a patentee beyond that provided for by s   of the Act   The additional contention of the Territory on this topic is that  in any event  it was the trees or the timber which was  supplied  and that the relevant product used by ACOC  if Bristol Myers is to be followed  is not the timber itself but the selected bark and wood from that timber   In my view  that alternative contention draws attention to the further submission of the Territory that it did not supply any product at all by the grant of the licences referred to discussedRescare Ltd v Anaesthetic Supplies Pty Ltd     ALR   In Rescare   Lockhart J  with whom Wilcox J agreed  at   said     The lasts remaining point is whether the primary judge erred in holding that s   of the   Act did not apply in relation to the alleged infringement of claims   and   in that he held that it was a precondition to the operation of that section in relation to a method claim that there be a product the use of which would infringe that method claim  In my opinion his Honour decided that question correctly      The other member of the Full Court  Sheppard J  did not address the issue  In the decision at first instance  Rescare Ltd v Anaesthetic Supplies Pty Ltd     ALR   Gummow J at   concluded     As I have indicated  where the invention relevantly claims a method or process  exploitation occurs  other than by use of the method or process  only by the doing of an act mentioned in para  a  of the definition of  exploit   There must be an act done  in respect of a product resulting from such use   Here  the respondent urges  and I agree  there is no such product with the result that  in a case such as the present  s
