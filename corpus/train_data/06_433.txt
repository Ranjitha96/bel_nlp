Securities and Investments Commission  In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd  ACN       v Carey   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   March   Siopis J made interim orders restraining the defendants from removing any of their property from Australia or from otherwise dealing with it except to the extent set out in the order  He also directed the surrender of their passports  His Honour published his reasons for those orders on   April   Australian Securities and Investments Commission  In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd  ACN       v Carey   FCA     On   April   I made orders extending the operation of the interim injunctions granted by Siopis J  subject to some undisputed variations  until  pm on   April   which was the date set down for the hearing of the substantive application  Following the hearing of the substantive application those orders were further extended to  pm on Thursday   April   subject to further agreed variations  Judgment on the substantive application was reserved to    pm on Thursday   April     There was an application made on behalf of the second defendant for an order setting aside the ex parte orders made by Siopis J on the basis that there had not been full disclosure by ASIC of relevant evidence to the Court  The second defendant submitted that ASIC s evidence predominately related to transactions involving other defendants which were not relevant to the second  I am not satisfied that any material non disclosure is shown  In any event the interim freezing orders lapse today citedASIC v Mauer Swisse Securities Ltd     ACLC   There is a variety of ways in which the interests of persons  to whom liabilities may be owed  can be protected by orders made under the section  The nature of the protection can vary according to the nature of the risks assessed  As Palmer J said in ASIC v Mauer Swisse Securities Ltd     ACLC   at          there may be evidence to suggest that fraud has been perpetrated on a large scale and that many of the victims have no or little information about the extent of the fraud  no or little means for their own investigations  and no or little resources to prosecute their own claims  In such a case  the interests of such persons are protected  within the contemplation of s   by enabling ASIC to conduct an investigation for the purpose of identifying the wrongdoers and exposing them not only to penalties under the Corporations Act and other legislation  but also to claims for compensation from the victims themselves      citedCAC v Lone Star Exploration NL     ACLR   The orders that can be made under the section are directed  inter alia  to the preservation of assets against which recovery may be sought in the event that liability to an  aggrieved person  is established on the part of a  relevant person   The orders are made in circumstances where  an investigation is being carried out   a prosecution has been begun  or  a civil proceeding has been begun   That is to say the orders can be made before liability is established and indeed before the evidence necessary to establish liability has been collected  While an application under the section is not interlocutory in an existing criminal or civil proceeding  it is interlocutory in a wider sense  It preserves the status quo and the assets of the relevant person pending the outcome of the investigation  prosecution or civil proceedings which are on foot CAC v Lone Star Exploration NL  No       ACLR   at    At the stage an order is sought the Court may not be in a position to identify with precision any particular liability owed by the person the subject of the proposed order  This consideration applies to final orders made under the section as well as to interim orders for which it expressly provides in s    The final orders made under the section are necessarily of a temporary or holding character rather than finally disposing of the rights and liabilities of the relevant persons affected by them citedCorporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd     ACLC   The circumstances in which the Court may make orders under s   are wide as indicated by the words  necessary or desirable     for the purpose of protecting the interests of a person       There is an element of risk assessment and risk management in the judgment the Court is called on to make  It follows  and has been accepted  that there is no requirement on the part of ASIC to demonstrate a prima facie case of liability on the part of the relevant person or that the person s assets have been or are about to be dissipated Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd     ACLC   at    Powell J  Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Adler     ACSR   at    Santow J  citedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler     ACSR   The circumstances in which the Court may make orders under s   are wide as indicated by the words  necessary or

NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  It is not a necessary consequence of an order appointing a receiver that the receiver should deal with or liquidate the assets in question  The interlocutory and protective character of orders made under s   must be borne in mind when defining the powers of the receiver  The appointment of a receiver has rightly been described as  an extraordinary step  ASIC v Burke   NSWSC   at    Austin J   However depending upon the nature of the powers conferred on the receiver it may be less drastic than a freezing order which can only be varied by order of the Court  The interlocutory history of this case has already demonstrated that circumstances not contemplated when the original interim freezing orders were made have required their variation from time to time  I accept  with respect  the observation made by Austin J in Burke at      Without wishing to lay down any general rules  it appears to me that the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver may be justified  even though Mareva Orders are in place  in a case where there is real doubt about the existence and location of assets such as investments  and about the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims  and additionally the defendants are engaged in business activities which entail that any Mareva Orders must allow assets to be turned over in the course of business  Where these circumstances exist in combination  and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved  the Court may conclude    that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected  and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors      The decision was cited with approval by Santow J in ASIC v Adler  supra  at       Section   does not make any express provision for the nature of the evidence on which the Court may act in making orders under it  Applications made under the section have an interlocutory character albeit there are no other specific proceedings to which they may relate  The section does not require concluded findings of fact about liability or whether assets have been dissipated  For the reasons already canvassed the Court  in making orders under s     engages in a risk assessment and management process  The logic of the section assumes that the Court will not always have before it evidence of the kind that would be necessary and admissible in proceedings to establish definitively the nature and extent of the assets of the persons under investigation and their liability to aggrieved persons  Nor will it necessarily have before it evidence of the kind that would establish definitively that dissipation of assets has occurred or is likely to occur or that flight is imminent   The logic of s   requires the Court to be able to act on evidence which might not be admissible in civil or criminal proceedings leading to a definitive determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties  Hearsay evidence may therefore be received and acted upon  not as proof of the truth of its content but as evidence of the existence of a risk or possibility that gives rise to the necessity for or desirability of a protective order  It is not necessary  in this context  to consider whether the proceedings are interlocutory for the purposes of the exception to the hearsay rule under s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  albeit that that exception is no doubt informed by similar considerations  Evidence may be received of the opinion of a suitably qualified person who has had the opportunity to review extensive documentation collected in the course of an investigation and to offer an overview of it for the benefit of the Court  In such a case the opinion or overview should be supported by reference to the relevant documentation and factual material  The opinion is received not for the determination of any ultimate issue of liability but as probative of the risk which the Court must assess in determining whether to make an order under the section  These considerations are relevant to the admissibility of some of the affidavit evidence which has been relied upon in this case   Specific objection has been taken on behalf of the second defendant to the use of transcripts of examinations conducted under s   of the ASIC Act  It was submitted that pursuant to s   of the ASIC Act such transcripts are not admissible in evidence against the person who has signed the record in a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty  It was submitted that the present proceedings are  in truth  proceedings for the imposition of a penalty  This is on the basis that if interlocutory in nature  then they are interlocutory in respect of proceedings not yet commenced but which will inevitably be penalty proceedings   Accepting that there is a possibility that penalty proceedings may be taken against one or more of the defendants in this case that does not  in my opinion  render the present application an application for the imposition of a penalty or an application incidental to such proceeding  As already noted  evidence may be relied upon of a hearsay or opinion character in these proceedings which might not be admissible in penalty proceedings  The same is true for s   transcripts   It was submitted for the second defendant that because ASIC seeks an order that the reasonable costs of the receivers and managers whose appointment it seeks should be payable from the collective assets of the defendants  that fact itself gives the present application the character of a penalty proceeding  In my opinion however  the submission is misconceived  An order for the payment of costs out of the collective assets of the defendants would not of itself amount to the imposition of a penalty  Although it may effectively deprive defendants of some of their property that imposition is not by way of punishment for any contravention of the law   Objection was also taken to the admissibility against the second defendant of transcripts of examinations of other parties conducted under s   of the ASIC Act  In this respect s   of the ASIC Act was relied upon  That section provides       Where direct evidence by a person  the absent witness   of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding  a statement that the absent witness made at an examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter       a  if it appears to the court or tribunal that             i  the absent witness is dead or is unfit  because of physical or mental incapacity  to attend as a witness  or    ii  the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance  or    iii  all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found  or              b  if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness        It was submitted for the second defendant that ASIC has not adduced evidence in respect of the matters set out in s  a  and that therefore the s   transcripts of those parties that are not parties to the proceeding may only be tendered if the conditions set out in par  a  are set out  Counsel for ASIC on the other hand submitted that the second defendant had not required ASIC to call any absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and that therefore the condition of admissibility under s  b  of the Act was satisfied  Given the urgency with which the application has been made  it is perhaps a little unrealistic to require advance notice by the second defendant of the requirement that any absent witness whose s   transcript is relied upon be called as a witness in the proceeding  In my opinion  however  the transcripts of the examinations conducted under s   can be relied upon as tending to establish the possibility that circumstances exist which give rise to the necessity or desirability of a protective order  What is in evidence here is the fact that the statement was made in the course of a s   examination  The fact that the statement was made  rather like the hearsay evidence referred to earlier  may support an inference that circumstances exist that make a protective order necessary or desirable  It is not necessary to rely upon such evidence for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement made
