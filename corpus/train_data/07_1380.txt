appellant  Mrs Gittins  appeals from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed her appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  Tribunal   see Gittins v Repatriation Commission   FMCA    The Tribunal affirmed a decision of the Veterans  Review Board  Board  that Mrs Gittins was not entitled to a war widow s pension under the Veterans  Entitlements Act    Cth   Act    On   October   Mrs Gittins applied for a war widow s pension  Her husband  Mr Philip Gittins  had died on   July    Mr Gittins was a veteran who served in the Australian Army from July   until December    He had served on operations in Japan from July   until July     Mr Gittins died as a consequence of a low grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma  In   Mr Gittins worked as a teacher at Brighton Grammar School  At that time  at the urging of his headmaster  Mr Gittins saw a surgeon about a mass on the left side of his neck  The mass has been present since about   and  over time  had grown more visible without causing any symptoms citedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   According to the Full Court of this Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   at     a four step process is required under ss  and  A of the Act to determine if an injury or death is war caused  These four steps can be summarised as        the material before the Tribunal is to be examined to see if it points to a hypothesis connecting the death with the circumstance of the veteran s service  In the absence of a hypothesis  the claim fails    if the material does raise a hypothesis  the Tribunal must see if there is a Statement of Principles  SoP  in force  If there is no SoP in force that fits the hypothesis  it will be taken to not be reasonable and the claim fails      if an SoP is in force relevant to the hypothesis  the Tribunal will consider if the hypothesis is reasonable  If the hypothesis is consistent with the template found in the SoP  the hypothesis is reasonable  If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template  the claim fails      the Tribunal must then consider whether it is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  If it is not so satisfied  the claim succeeds  If it is so satisfied  the claim fails   Further  the Federal Magistrate was correct in stating that there was only one cause of death  Mr Gittins did not die of phobia  but because of an inability to obtain clinical management for non Hodgkin s lymphoma  As there was a relevant SoP for that cause of death  it had to be considered  On having considered the foregoing  it was established by the Court below that Mr Gittins  circumstances did not fit the template contained in the SoP  That was the end of the matter  The claim should have been rejected on this basis alone  However  Riley FM correctly determined that the Tribunal properly applied  the first three Deledio steps  and that it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider step four  The Federal Magistrate also correctly determined at   that the SoP that applied to the kind of death found  governs the determination of whether the hypothesis that the death arose from relevant service is reasonable   Counsel for Mrs Gittins contended that the Tribunal  implicitly  found that phobia was one of the causes of death  An examination of the Tribunal s reasons reveals no such implicit finding  In any event  a finding should be precise  not implicit  In its reasons for decision  the Tribunal refers at   to death   from a low grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma    Phobia of doctors  is an aspect of  or a reason for  the  inability to obtain appropriate clinical management   It was not the actual medical cause of Mr Gittins  death  In fact  at   the Tribunal found that any connection between Mr Gittins  death and his experiences in Japan  that is  his phobia  were  too remote and too tenuous   The Tribunal said at     There is no evidence to substantiate a claim that Mr Gittin s hospital experiences in   and   caused his phobia  Nor can the claim be categorically refuted  There is merely insufficient evidence       The Tribunal also said at       Mr Gittins was hospitalised after his operational service on three occasions and also saw several doctors in relation to minor illnesses  discharge medicals and the like  and on no occasion reported a phobia relating to medical or hospital treatment   It is unnecessary for the Court to deal with the claim that the Tribunal failed to provide adequate reasons for its rejection of the second hypothesis in circumstance where it was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider it appliedRepatriation Commission v Hill     ALD   In Repatriation Commission v Hill     ALD     Hill   at   a Full Court of this Court approved the judgment of Goldberg J in Repatriation Commission v McKenna     ALD   determining that the hypothesis which is to be held by an SoP is that which connects the disease with the circumstances of the veteran s service  There must be a hypothesis  in the words of Riley FM in the judgment below at    which starts with the disease     and ends with the service    Further  in Hill at   the Court said  a hypothesis connecting a disease with war service will only be reasonable if the material that raises it includes all of the essential elements prescribed by the SoP    The Tribunal observed that Mrs Gittins relied on SoP No   of   concerning non Hodgkin s lymphoma  In particular  she relied on factor  j  of the SoP which refers to      the inability to obtain clinical management for non Hodgkin s lymphoma   Clause  j  of the SoP provides        t he factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting non Hodgkin s lymphoma or death from non Hodgkin s lymphoma with the circumstances of a person s relevant service are              j  inability to obtain appropriate clinical management for non Hodgkin s lymphoma referred toRepatriation Commission v McKenna     ALD   In Repatriation Commission v Hill     ALD     Hill   at   a Full Court of this Court approved the judgment of Goldberg J in Repatriation Commission v McKenna     ALD   determining that the hypothesis which is to be held by an SoP is that which connects the disease with the circumstances of the veteran s service  There must be a hypothesis  in the words of Riley FM in the judgment below at    which starts with the disease     and ends with the service
