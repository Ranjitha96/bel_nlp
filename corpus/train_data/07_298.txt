 html  Not surprisingly  the Trustee submitted that the applicant should not be granted leave  Indeed  the Trustee submitted that even if there had been a breach of reg     that would not necessarily be a matter that the Tribunal was bound to determine  or ought to determine  having regard to the particular limited nature of its enquiry and the peculiar circumstances of this case  On the other hand  underlying my concern was that if  in the circumstances of this case  reg     prohibited the Trustee from doing what it did  that is  paying the applicant s benefits into a joint bank account in the names of himself and his wife  then why  on any view  would the decision of the Trustee not to reinstate the applicant s account not be one which raised the issue of whether it was  unfair and unreasonable  Superannuation  Resolution of Complaints  Act    Cth  subs    So understood  review of that latter decision would be within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal  cf   Asgard Capital Management Ltd v Maher   FCAFC         FCR   at      In Asgard Capital Management Ltd v Maher a Full Court of this Court was called upon to construe the nature and scope of the obligation imposed on a trustee by reg     in the context of the facts which came before it  Those facts can be shortly stated  The respondent was a beneficiary of the Asgard Independence Plan Superannuation fund which had been established to provide retirement benefits to its members  As at late   the respondent s investment in the fund was    He instructed his financial adviser to deal with this investment in the following way    was to be credited to a joint bank account in the name of the respondent and his wife    was to be applied to the purchase of shares in Coles Myer  the balance of   was to be transferred to a new investment with the trustee  To enable the adviser to carry out this instruction  the respondent signed a blank payment request form  which covered three pages  directed to the trustee  He gave the form to his adviser and left it to him to complete the form in the required manner  It was this act which put the adviser in the position where he could misappropriate the money  He completed the form so that the trustee was directed to pay the whole of the respondent s entitlement into a bank account maintained by the adviser  As directed  the trustee deposited   into the nominated account  The adviser then transferred   to his client s bank account  He also purchased   worth of Coles Myer shares on his client s behalf  He kept the rest of the money  together with     interest  for himself   Following the discovery of the theft  the respondent lodged a complaint with the trustee alleging that by paying his superannuation entitlement to his adviser  the trustee had acted negligently or illegally  He demanded that the trustee make good his loss  The trustee rejected the complaint  The respondent took his case to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal  The Tribunal determined to set aside the trustee s decision  on the grounds that it was not fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the  respondent  in the circumstances   In substituting its own decision for that of the trustee  the Tribunal decided that the respondent should be paid a superannuation benefit of      The trustee then brought an  appeal  on a question of law  see s   of the Superannuation  Resolution of Complaints  Act    Cth   The question of law that arose was the meaning of the phrase  must not be cashed in favour of a person other than the member  in reg      The judge who heard the appeal affirmed the decision of the Tribunal   In the course of their reasons  the Full Court said  at      Although he did not expressly say so  the judge must have construed the words  must not be cashed in favour of a person other than the member  as prohibiting the payment of a superannuation benefit by the trustee to a member by making that payment not directly to the member  but rather at the member s direction or to the member s authorised agent  The question raised by this appeal is whether this is the correct construction of reg      citedAustralian Securities

in   of the notice of amended appeal  even if reformulated as questions  would not be questions of law with the possible exception of  b  they would be questions of fact or  at best  mixed questions of fact and law  Mixed questions of fact and law will not found an appeal  Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   per Branson J at   and Jacobson and Bennett JJ at   and even if  b  was reformulated into a question as to whether the Trustee failed to comply with Clause    b  of the MLC Master Key Superannuation Trust Deed  that question  if a question of law  raises two difficulties       The issue was not raised below and in those circumstances the Tribunal was not required to deal with it by specific reference to the trust deed in its reasons      The clause itself is permissive rather than mandatory so that the failure of the Trustee to require a claimant for payment of a benefit to comply with the terms of Clause    b  before payment would not amount to a failure on the part of the Trustee to comply with the provisions of the trust deed   During the course of the first day s hearing of the appeal  I indicated to the parties that the only issue which caused me concern was whether the Trustee was entitled to pay the applicant s benefit into a joint bank account in the names of himself and his wife in the face of regs     and     of the Superannuation Industry  Supervision  Regulations    Cth  which  relevantly  were in the following terms at the relevant date          A member s benefits in a fund         a  may only be paid by               i  being cashed in accordance with Division     or    ii  being rolled over or transferred in accordance with Division     or    A  and              b  must not be paid except when  and to the extent that  the fund is required or permitted under this Part to pay them  and              c  must be paid when  and to the extent that  the fund is required under this Part to pay them                                          Subject to regulation    B    a member s benefits in a regulated superannuation fund must not be cashed in favour of a person other than the member or the member s legal personal representative unless             a  the member has died  and                  b  the conditions of subregulation   or   are satisfied                The conditions of this subregulation are satisfied if the benefits are cashed in favour of either or both of the following                   a  the member s legal personal representative                   b  one or more of the member s dependants                    The conditions of this subregulation are satisfied if                   a  the trustee has not  after making reasonable enquiries  found either a legal personal representative  or a dependant  of the member  and                  b  the person in whose favour benefits are cashed is an individual   I acknowledged that this particular issue was not raised below and that it was not encompassed by the applicant s notice of appeal  Nevertheless  I indicated to the parties that I would be prepared to hear them on the issue of whether  if the applicant should apply for leave to further amend his notice of amended appeal to raise this issue  leave should be granted  For this purpose  I adjourned the proceedings to enable the parties to consider and address the issue and to file written submissions in support of their respective positions
