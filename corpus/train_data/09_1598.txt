of GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd and AMP Life Ltd   FCA   at     The expression  affected policyholder  is defined and used in s  C of the Act  That section is concerned with steps to be taken before the application for confirmation is made  In Re Insurance Australia Ltd   I held at     that an  affected policyholder  within the meaning of s  C is a holder of a policy being transferred under the scheme  Accordingly  in the present case it is the policyholders of Westport who are  affected policyholders  for the purposes of s  C of the Act  I also held  however  that this does not mean that the effect that the scheme will have on other policyholders is irrelevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion  Re Insurance Australia Ltd at    SRIAU has no existing policyholders  see
