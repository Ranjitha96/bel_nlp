Australia  No     FCA    the interim reasons  I determined that The key findings in the interim reasons that are relevant for present purposes may be summarised as follows  The present Yawuru community  as generally defined in the genealogies before the Court  is a recognisable body of persons who are likely to be descendants  on an ambilineal or cognatic basis  of members of the Yawuru community at the time of colonial contact and therefore at the time of sovereignty  The genealogies before the Court support an inference of continuity of the Yawuru community that existed at the time of sovereignty through to the present time  As the definition of the Yawuru community  based on ambilineal or cognatic descent  is in accordance with the traditional laws and customs of the Yawuru community  it follows that the present Yawuru community is one whose members are descended from the members of the Yawuru community at sovereignty in accordance with traditional laws and customs

Yawuru community s claim to the law ground at Kunin  the evidence concerning the Djugan led me to conclude  at   that  at least in relation to their traditional connection to Kunin  the Djugan people are a subgroup of the Yawuru people   At the hearing in this proceeding  which related to the establishment of native title in the Yawuru claim area  a considerably greater body of evidence was adduced in relation to the Djugan  An aspect of that evidence was that  unlike the Yawuru who practiced the southern tradition  the Djugan practiced the northern tradition  In the interim reasons I made certain observations  at     and   about the two traditions practiced in the claim area       Two legal traditions  which lay down  the law  are claimed to be applicable in Yawuru country  Each of the traditions involves the creation of the world by mythological creatures or heroes who gave the people their  law  waterholes  soaks or jilas    law grounds  songs   skin sections  and languages  Patrick Dodson outlined the path of the southern tradition in the Yawuru claim area in a restricted exhibit  The southern tradition is  the law  that is generally practiced by the Yawuru  Karajarri  Nyangumarta  Nygina and Mangala people  The northern tradition is generally practiced by the Bardi  Nyul Nyul  Jabirrr Jabirrr and Nyambal people  The southern tradition  southern law  may be referred to in Yawuru country as the Yawuru law  The northern tradition is often called Bardi law  The  law bosses  for the southern tradition in Yawuru country are Felix Edgar  Frank Sebastian  Gajai  Francis Djiagween  Lulga  Joseph  Nipper  Roe and Patrick Dodson  The  law bosses  for the northern tradition in Yawuru country were said to be Joseph Roe  Richard Hunter and Phillip Hunter      The two traditions are kept separate  Joseph Roe said that the laws sit side by side without overlapping because  Bugarrigarra make them like that  we re just following Bugarrigarra     While the Bugarrigarra and many of the basic rituals  customs and laws it prescribes are common to the northern and southern traditions  the two mytho ritual traditions differ in their origin  being the journeys and undertakings of the mythological creators of the respective traditions  However  support for the claim of the Yawuru claimants that both traditions were observed in the same country is to be found in R Piddington s article  which contains observations about the initiation ceremonies under both traditions in the country of the Karajarri people  which is to the south of the Yawuru claim area   R

two laws don t mix but they are respected in this country   Patrick Dodson said  i t s not a unusual thing for a Yawuru man to go through northern law   Yawuru community members who have been through both laws include Lulga and Patrick Dodson s grandson  by  skin  and nephew by blood  Sooty Pigram  Several men who are now deceased  have also been through both laws  namely Paddy Djiagween  Bandak Bernard  Peter Kajit  Johnny Peters  and Stanley Djiagween  as well as Lulu and Paul Sampi    Paul Sampi  a senior Bardi  law man  described how the northern tradition of  law  travels along two paths  The first path  Ungui   which is the first stage of  law  travels down from Bardi country along the east coast of the Dampier Peninsula from Swan Point to the mouth of the Fitzroy River at Langey Crossing  then west to Garawan and then to Willie Creek  From there  it travels back to the east to Garawan and then north to La Djardarr Bay  The other part  Ululong   the second stage of  law  travels down along the west coast of the Dampier Peninsula from Swan Point through to Wapunu in Karajarri country  Paul s evidence was that  after World War Two  Bardi men  who were living and working in Broome and wanted to be able to practice Bardi law in Yawuru country  asked permission of the Yawuru  law men  to start Ululong at Four Mile  Paul was living in Broome in   and  as he had been through Ungui   was able to go through the second stage of the southern law  He says that  i n those days people went through both law s      There is also a third tradition  which starts at Bilinnguru  Hidden Valley  in Yawuru country and goes out into the desert  This tradition is like a  song line  and is known as the Wanji or Dingarri   Peter Clancy  a Mangala man who gave evidence about the Wanji   stated that it speaks  Yawuru language in Yawuru country  Karajarri language in Karajarri country  and Mangala language in Mangala country  I know the songs for the Wanji right through     There was some confusion as to how the Yawuru claimants relied upon the northern tradition in making out their case  Ultimately  they accepted that the normative system upon which they relied was the southern tradition  but they claimed that under that tradition there was a recognition and acceptance of the overlapping role played by the northern tradition in the Yawuru claim area                  The evidence referred to above establishes that  on balance   the law  is still acknowledged and observed  notwithstanding that many of the rituals of  the law  are no longer practiced

notwithstanding that many of the rituals of  the law  are no longer practiced  Fundamentally   the law  as laid down by the southern tradition  remains  the law  that is acknowledged and accepted by the Yawuru community as governing all aspects of its traditional life  However  it does not follow that the Djugan and the Yawuru each possessed their own discrete communal native title rights and interests at and since sovereignty in respect of the northern and southern areas respectively  The entitlement of different groups to communal native title was considered by the Full Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Warumungu  Wakaya Native Title Claim Group   FCAFC         FCR     Alyawarr   at          The Full Court  after citing a number of cases  observed that members of a  community  may possess communal native title rights and interests  albeit that they are  intramurally allocated  to different groups or subsets of the community  Although each of the cases cited by the Full Court turns on its own facts  their Honours  at     accepted that the evidence of  extensive connections  across the claimant groups supported the primary judge s characterisation of those groups as  one native title holding community  that had the necessary connection with the land in the claim area  at a communal or claim group level   Accordingly  it is necessary to consider the totality of the evidence concerning the Djugan and the Yawuru in order to determine whether  notwithstanding their cultural and other differences at and since sovereignty  the Djugan and the Yawuru are one native title holding community that had the necessary connection with Yawuru  country  at a communal level  Extensive evidence was adduced to the effect that Yawuru  country  included the northern area  The evidence  which included the views of senior law men and women  was not seriously challenged  The evidence of senior law men from  country  adjacent to the claim area and the evidence adduced as to the views of senior Yawuru law men and women was that Yawuru  country  consisted of the southern and the northern areas  Peter Clancy  a senior Mangala law man regarded the northern area as being within  Yawuru Country because the old people told me   A senior Nyangumarta law man stated that the shared law that comes from the Bugarrigarra included  the whole lot of that country up to Willie Creek   Evidence adduced as part of the Walman Yawuru case was also to the effect that  Mimi  a senior Yawuru law woman who lived in Broome up to the  s  had claimed that Yawuru country included Broome and extended up to Willie Creek citedSampi on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People v Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSubject to the possible exception referred to above  I am satisfied that  generally  the evidence supports the inference contended for by the Yawuru claimants of exclusive possession and occupation of the Yawuru claim area  excluding the intertidal zone  where there has been no extinguishment  However  for the reasons given by French J in Sampi on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People v Western Australia   FCA   at     the right should be limited to exclusive possession and occupation and should not extend to the broader concepts of  use and enjoyment   I also agree with his Honour that the right claimed to  speak for  the land and to make decisions about its use and enjoyment by others is also subsumed in the global right of exclusive possession and occupation citedSampi v Western Australia  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn conclusion  the evidence and findings to which I have referred support a finding of the existence of the rights claimed by the Yawuru claimants as set out in   save that the references to use and enjoyment are to be deleted  Also  the proposed determination of the Yawuru claimants does not state the purposes for which the resources of the land and waters in the claim area  including the intertidal areas  may be accessed and used  cf Sampi v Western Australia  No     FCA    I doubt that it is contended that the purposes are to be unlimited or are to extend to a general right of commercial exploitation  In the circumstances  it is desirable that the Yawuru claimants address that issue  I would add that  apart from the fact that the rights claimed in the intertidal zone are not exclusive and are necessarily more limited than the rights claimed in the land areas  I see no proper basis for otherwise distinguishing between the native title rights and interests in that zone and in the land  No such distinction was drawn in the evidence or in the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the Yawuru community  As there will be some issues as to how the final determination should reflect my findings and conclusions  I propose to afford the parties an opportunity of making further submissions on that matter  There also remains for determination the issues the parties still propose to press in relation to extinguishment  as well as any issues arising out of these reasons  I propose to give directions for an early determination of all of those issues   I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for
