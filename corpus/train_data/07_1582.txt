Adelaide Bank Limited  in the matter of Adelaide Bank Limited ACN         FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedRe APN News   Media Limited     ACSR   Lastly  he brought to my attention the provision in the agreement which deems the ordinary shareholder to have warranted to Bendigo Bank that their ordinary shares are fully paid and free from encumbrances  The purpose of the clause was adverted to by Lindgren J in Re APN News   Media Limited     ACSR   at         In substance  the purpose of the deemed warranty is to prevent a shareholder whose shares are subject to encumbrances from receiving the same scheme consideration as that to be received by those whose shares are free from encumbrances  without any obligation  in effect  to refund to INMAL the amount required to discharge the encumbrance  It is not practicable for amounts secured by encumbrance to be deducted from the scheme consideration payable to the relevant scheme participants on the implementation date       The warranty will be deemed to have been given  not only by those offeree shareholders who vote to agree to the scheme  and who  therefore  can be seen to be consenting to give it  but also those who do not vote at all or who vote against the scheme  However  I do not think that this matters  What is important  in my view  is that the deemed warranty is no more than a device directed to ensuring that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged  The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty is the amount required to discharge the encumbrance   All three matters raised by Mr Bathurst QC were addressed by Lindgren J in this Court in Re APN News and Media Limited   ACSR    In all three instances  his Honour found that similar clauses in similar transactions were no bar to the implementation of the proposed transactions  I respectfully agree with his Honour s reasons   I am further satisfied that the directors have unanimously recommended the schemes of arrangement to all three classes of members of the plaintiff and that in doing so they have not acted otherwise than in accordance with their duties  I am satisfied that an appropriate independent expert s report was obtained and that the opinion expressed is that held by the author   I am also satisfied that the plaintiff put in place a due diligence committee which has rigorously examined the proposed merger citedRe Arthur Yates   Co Ltd     ACSR   On the hearing of this application today  Mr Bathurst QC  who led for the plaintiff  brought to my attention three particular aspects of the proposed schemes of arrangement  First  he drew my attention to the exclusivity transaction and the  no shop no talk  provision of the proposed merger  He also drew my attention to the fiduciary carve out provision within the merger implementation agreement  The  no shop no talk  provision is an unremarkable term commercially  It satisfies the criteria Santow J adduced in Re Arthur Yates   Co Ltd     ACSR    In my opinion  it is not a term which would make the proposed scheme of arrangement such that it ought not be submitted to its members   Secondly  he brought to my attention the terms of the agreement relating to a break fee  In relation to the break fee  he emphasised that there was a break fee payable by both parties to the transaction  Both the plaintiff and the Bendigo Bank must pay a break fee in the sum of   million if the transaction does not go ahead for any of the reasons given in the proposed scheme  The break fee is less than   of the plaintiff s market capitalisation of     billion which is within the Australian Takeovers Panel s Guidance Notes  Guidance Note   Lock up Devices   nd issue     In any event  the break fee is not payable in circumstances where the members vote not to implement the scheme  In those circumstances  the break fee is not a disincentive to the shareholders in their consideration of the proposed merger citedRe Bank of Adelaide     SASR   I am satisfied that that criteria has been established  The plaintiff is a Part     body as defined in s   of the Corporations Act   A scheme of arrangement of the kind proposed is a compromise or arrangement within the meaning of s   Re Bank of Adelaide     SASR    Subject therefore to the other subsections of ss   and     the plaintiff is entitled to seek the exercise of the Court s discretion and make the orders   Two preconditions for the exercise of the power in s   are provided for in s    First  pursuant to s  a    the Court is not entitled to make an order under s   unless   days notice of the hearing of the application  or such lesser period of notice as the Court or ASIC permits  has been given to ASIC  I am satisfied on the evidence that   days notice of the application has been given to ASIC   Secondly  s  b  of the Corporations Act prevents the Court from making an order unless satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the terms of the proposed compromise or arrangement and to make submissions to the Court in relation to the proposed compromise or arrangement  and the draft

Insurance Ltd     ACSR     I am satisfied  as Conti J was in Re CSR Ltd   ACSR   that the marginally different treatment of the ineligible foreign shareholders does not raise an issue as to the proper formation of classes of members affected by the scheme   For those reasons  it would be appropriate to make the orders sought on the application and to appoint a further date for the consideration as
