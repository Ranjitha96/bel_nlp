 the Court may consider directing that an application under s  C be heard and determined at the same time as the main application  That is a course of action which Wilcox J in Bodney v State of

were not authorised by the native title claim group to bring that claim  and so to make out a very clear case of want of authorisation  or a clear failure to comply with one or other of the requirements of ss      A or      The objection is not simply that hearsay evidence cannot be received on an application such as the present  As I have said  it is common ground that the application is an interlocutory one in respect of which hearsay evidence may be admitted by reason of s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  see e g  Bodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR   at     per Stone J  Section   requires evidence of the source of the hearsay material within the affidavit  It is contended that such evidence has not been given  so that that particular part of Mr Petherick s affidavit of   April   should not be received  or alternatively that it should not be received by reason of s   of the Evidence Act   There is no explanation as to why Ray Petherick should not have given evidence of those facts directly  There is nothing to verify on his part the reliability of his diary  although it has considerable detail within it  However  I think it identifies the source of the information  namely Ray Petherick and there is some independent confirmation of the events to which it refers by Captain Wodidj having signed the affidavit on   April   which was filed in support of the Town of Batchelor No   application as amended  It is a different question as to the weight to be given to that affidavit of Captain Wodidj generally upon the whole of the evidence   I propose to receive that part of the affidavit of Mr Petherick  but I indicate that I do not think it carries much weight  There is direct evidence from Captain Wodidj as to the fact that he did not intend to authorise the bringing of the Town of Batchelor No   application as amended as an authorised applicant or on his behalf as an asserted member of that native title claim group  or to authorise the claim to be brought as a senior member of the Emu Clan  He plainly disavows any interest as a member of any native title claim group which may have native title rights and interests in respect of the Batchelor area  Nevertheless  there is some evidence of attempts made by Thomas Petherick through Ray Petherick to secure Captain Wodidj s agreement to being a nominated applicant for the claim group  and to indicate his preparedness to be a member of the claim group   For reasons which appear below  nothing turns upon the receipt of that evidence in all the circumstances referred toDey v Victorian Railways
