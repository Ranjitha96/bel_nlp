Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSAAP v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On   April   I gave directions in the proceeding  including a direction that the applicant file and serve any amended application  with proper particulars of the grounds relied upon  I also granted a certificate pursuant to O   of the Federal Court Rules   so that the applicant could receive legal advice from a barrister  Counsel who ultimately appeared for the applicant accepted the referral  An amended draft order nisi was filed  in which prohibition was sought against the Minister  and certiorari and mandamus against the Tribunal  although the Tribunal was still not named as a respondent to the proceeding  Remedies cannot be sought against the Tribunal unless it is named as a respondent  so it will be necessary for me to make orders adding the Tribunal as a respondent  with consequential amendments to the documents filed  See SAAP v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA       ALR      By s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas  A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  The terms  Refugees Convention  and  Refugees Protocol  are defined in s   of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on   July   and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on   January    It is convenient to call these two instruments  taken together  the  Convention   For present purposes  it is sufficient to note that  pursuant to the Convention  Australia has protection obligations to a person who       owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country    Section  R of the Migration Act provides relevantly as follows        For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations   to a particular person  Article  A  of the Refugees Convention as   amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to   persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that Article   unless               b  the persecution involves serious harm to the person  and             Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph    b  the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes   of that paragraph       a  a threat to the person s life or liberty       b  significant physical harassment of the person       c  significant physical ill treatment of the person       d  significant economic hardship that threatens the person s   capacity to subsist       e  denial of access to basic services  where the denial threatens   the person s capacity to subsist       f  denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind  where the   denial threatens the person s capacity to subsist  followedApplicants M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for the Minister argued that  at least as to part of the relief claimed  the application was out of time under the High Court Rules    the High Court rules  and  unless the Court extended the time  that relief could not be granted  As I have said  the relief sought against the Minister is prohibition  The High Court Rules contained no time limit in respect of an application for prohibition  Counsel for the Minister contended that it was inappropriate to seek prohibition against the Minister  once the Tribunal decision has been made  if it is not set aside  the Minister has a statutory obligation to remove the applicant from Australia  While this argument may be correct  it is of no consequence in the present case  It is conceded that  as against the Tribunal  the remedy of certiorari was sought by the filing of the application in the High Court within the time limit then fixed by O   r   of the High Court Rules  The application to the High Court was not filed within the two month time limit  fixed by O   r   of the High Court Rules  in respect of an application for mandamus  In Applicants M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     after examining some of the authorities  I expressed the conclusion that the better view is that  once the High Court has remitted an application for an order nisi to this Court  the time limits applicable in that court are no longer of any consequence  I remain of that opinion   In any event  there was an amended draft order nisi filed in this Court  Although the use of an amended draft order nisi was perhaps not the most convenient procedure  it was of itself sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court  conferred by s  B of the Judiciary Act   afresh  On the assumption that the Tribunal s decision is affected by jurisdictional error  and is consequently not  a decision   made   under this Act  for the purposes of the definition of  privative clause decision  in s   of the Migration Act   the time limit then fixed by s   was inapplicable  On that assumption  there was no time limit fixed for invoking the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s  B of the Judiciary Act   in respect of the Tribunal s decision  See Applicants M  at     If it were necessary to enlarge the time limit for the application for mandamus  to give the applicant a constitutional entitlement to seek certiorari as an adjunct to mandamus  certiorari being a remedy not mentioned in s  v  of the Constitution   then I should not hesitate to do so in the present case  There has been no undue delay  The proceeding was commenced within the time limited for an application for certiorari  The delay is not  in any event  gross  The Minister has not claimed to have suffered any prejudice by reason of the delay  The applicant s claim is one that has merits   An alternative view is that certiorari might be a remedy available to the applicant  pursuant to s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  in a proceeding in which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked validly by the remittal by the High Court of the application for prohibition against the Minister  even if the applicant could not succeed in obtaining that remedy against that respondent   For all these reasons  it is unnecessary to consider the issue of the time of the commencement of the proceeding any further   The applicant s case included a number of facts which  if accepted  distinguished him from most  if not all  of the people dealt with by the Egyptian authorities as a result of the activities at the nightclub  At the time of the events  the applicant was not a teenager  but was in his mid twenties  He was not merely attending the events at which what were regarded as satanic rituals were taking place  but was facilitating those events  by making videotapes  and ensuring that the memory of the events was kept alive  by selling the videotapes to the participants  It was perhaps true to say  as the Tribunal did  that he was not an  organiser  of the events  but he was certainly not in the same category as the ordinary participants
