Magistrates Court dismisses application to set aside sequestration order      November     notice of appeal from Federal Magistrate s decision filed in Federal Court of Australia   The appellant s grounds of appeal can be summarised briefly  First  he claims that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to go behind the judgment of the Local Court to determine if there was a debt owed to the respondent  Second  he claims that his Honour s discretion to make the sequestration order miscarried in that  in assessing the appellant s solvency  his Honour made errors of fact  took into account irrelevant matters and failed to give sufficient weight to other matters   At the hearing of this appeal I refused the appellant s application to adduce evidence that was not put before the Federal Magistrate for the following reason   Section   of the Federal Court of Australia Act deals with the Court s reception of evidence on appeal         In an appeal  the Court shall have regard to the evidence given in the proceedings out of which the appeal arose  and has power to draw inferences of fact and  in its discretion  to receive further evidence     It appears that there were some irregularities or discrepancies in the documentation of the debt and the assignment  but although the assignment was pleaded in the Local Court  the appellant did not take issue with that plea in his defence in the Local Court  Instead  while not admitting that there had been a default under the loan agreement with Avco  the appellant s defence was that the agreement with Avco had been fully satisfied by Avco taking possesson of the motor car  In his judgment in the Supreme Court appeal  Malpass AJ noted at         The plaintiff conducted his case before the Local Court on the basis that there was no issue concerning the assignment  At the commencement of her judgment  the Magistrate made a finding that the interests  rights and entitlements under the agreement for loan had been assigned  In my view  she did not fall into error in making that finding    The plaintiff now complains that there was no evidence of the assignment before the court and that there was no evidence of service of notice of the assignment  The defendant disputes that contention  It looks to admissions  the documentary material that was before the court and to evidence given by the plaintiff during his cross examination                      There is a contest between the parties as to what inferences may be drawn from all of the material  It is unnecessary to enter into that debate  It suffices to say that the material leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff was aware of the assignment and was not concerned to make any challenge in relation to it    Leaving that consideration aside  it seems to me that it was unnecessary to tender the assignment  or any notice of it  in the light of the admissions that arise from the pleadings and the manner in which the plaintiff conducted his case in the Local Court     His Honour concluded      It would seem from the record of the proceedings that neither the parties nor the court noticed the discrepancies in the purported notice  No doubt  this was because the assignment and notice thereof were not seen as matters in issue   This last comment may be a little confusing  The assignment of a debt is not complete in law until notice has been given to the debtor in this case the appellant  s   Conveyancing Act    NSW   Irrespective of the technicalities however  the point remains that the appellant did not raise the issue in the Local Court  It was raised in the Supreme Court where the appellant submitted that there was no evidence of the assignment before the Local Court  This is not surprising  As the appellant did not traverse the plea of assignment no evidence was required and no adverse inference can be drawn from its absence   Malpass AJ considered whether the appellant should be bound by the course he adopted at the trial or should be allowed to raise a new point on appeal  His Honour concluded at          In my view  the plaintiff  appellant  should be bound by the course adopted during the hearing before the Local Court  It is conceded that it is a case where  had the matters been placed in issue  the defendant may have led evidence which had the possibility of defeating the point  Further  in the circumstances of this case  I do not consider it to be either expedient  or in the interests of justice  to entertain the new point in this appeal    The purport of the appeal is to have the proceedings remitted back to the Local Court so that the case can be reheard  This would seem to be a pointless exercise  From what has been said from the bar table  it appears that the defendant may be in a position to prove all issues concerning the assignment and the plaintiff is faced with an insurmountable jurisdictional problem    It may further be observed that what is in dispute has been described as not being a significant sum  There has already been an arbitration  a purported re hearing and an appeal  Neither the parties nor the public interest would be well served by a further hearing    I should add that changing times have seen the court adjusting the approach to be taken to cases where parties appear in person  No longer is it a rare event  It is now approaching an event of almost daily occurrence  Many are litigants in person because they choose so to be  Many have become experienced litigants running numerous cases before the court  The transcript of the Local Court proceedings presents a picture of this plaintiff conducting himself with skill   The  insurmountable jurisdictional problem  to which his Honour referred was apparently a consequence of the claim being for less than    As his Honour explained earlier in his judgment  given the amount of the claim the appellant was not entitled to a rehearing after he was unsuccessful in the arbitration  see ss         Civil Procedure Act    NSW  s   Local Courts Act    NSW   His Honour commented that the jurisdictional issue had been overlooked but that if the proceedings were remitted to the Local Court  the respondent intended to agitate the issue before that court   Although the validity of the assignment was never directly challenged in the Federal Magistrates Court  in asserting that his Honour should have considered the question  Ms Goodchild relied on the fact that the judgment of the Local Court and the judgment of Malpass AJ on appeal were before him and should have alerted him to consider the validity of the assignment  In my view the fact that the judgments were before his Honour is a long way short of what would be required for this submission to be accepted  There was no obligation on the Federal Magistrate to reconsider every issue that had been raised  and settled  in the past  From his Honour s point of view there was no reason to doubt that the issue  although the subject of contest in the past  was now accepted as having been resolved   I also do not accept that it would be appropriate for this Court to allow the appellant to reopen that issue either in this Court or before the Local Court  Since the arbitration  purported re hearing and appeal to which Malpass AJ referred  an application to set aside the bankruptcy notice has been dismissed by a registrar of this Court  a sequestration order has been made by a registrar of this Court  there has been an unsuccessful application to set aside the sequestration order in the Federal Magistrates Court and now an appeal to this Court  There are even greater reasons now to say  as did Malpass AJ  that it is not in the interests of the parties or the public for there to be a further hearing

Federal Magistrate should go behind the judgment of the Local Court was raised but not in the context of any challenge to the assignment  His Honour s comments indicate that the issue was considered in the context of whether the Local Court judgment was final      To the extent that it may have been argued during the course of the proceeding  it is not appropriate in this instance for this court to go behind the judgment of the local court relied upon in the bankruptcy notice which in turn then triggered the creditors petition  The power of the court to go behind the bankruptcy notice is referred as being a matter of course for discretion     His Honour referred to Wren v Mahony at   and continued      Lest there be any doubt in the present case  applying the relevant principles to the circumstances set out in the affidavit material relied upon by the debtor it is my concluded view that there is no basis in that law for this court going behind the judgment  I am satisfied for reasons given  that the judgment relief  sic  upon in the bankruptcy notice can properly be characterised as a final judgment albeit that it does not include reference to costs yet to be assessed
