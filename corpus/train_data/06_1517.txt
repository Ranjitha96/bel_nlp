SZHKI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedB  of   in the matter of an application for a Writ of Mandamus  Prohibition and Certiorari against Refugee Review Tribunal   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In B  of   in the matter of an application for a Writ of Mandamus  Prohibition and Certiorari against Refugee Review Tribunal   FCA     B  of     Dowsett J dealt with a similar situation to that of the present appellant  There the appellant decided not to attend hearing after his migration agent advised him as to his likely prospects of success  His Honour stated at     The Tribunal had tried to advise him of these matters in the correspondence  Even accepting that he did not receive those letters  I cannot accept that he was unaware of the purpose of the hearing  He asked the immigration adviser whether he could attend and clearly understood that it was the occasion for making submissions  She did not tell him that he could not attend  but that there was no point in his so doing  That was a matter for judgment  He chose to act on this advice  That he did not attend the hearing was a consequence of such choice  There was no denial of procedural fairness  See R v Home Secretary  Ex parte Al Mehdawi     AC   at   and SBA Foods Pty Ltd v Victorian WorkCover Authority   Anor   VSC   per Gillard J at      See also Stefanovski v County Court of Victoria   Anor   VSC   per Gillard J at      A passage from the decision in Al Mehdawi was cited with apparent approval by Gleeson CJ in Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy   Ors   HCA         CLR   at     However the passage in question was not directly supportive of the outcome in Al Mehdawi   I also note that his Honour there observed that   Procedural unfairness can occur without any personal fault on the part of the decision maker    See also SZEYH v Minister for Immigration   FCA   at       per Jacobsen J   Clearly  the appellant made a choice  of exactly the same kind described by Dowsett J in B  of     It is not a case  such as that which confronted the Court in the M  case where the appellant s migration adviser responded on his behalf  contrary to instructions and declined the invitation appliedM  v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  In M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA     M  case   Bryant CFM said the following  at     All the Australian authorities require some defect in the decision making process  Re MIMIA  Ex Parte Lam   HCA   where at para   McHugh and Gummow JJ said          But the failure to meet that expectation does not reasonably found a case of denial of natural justice  The notion of legitimate expectation serves only to focus attention on the content of the requirement of natural justice in this particular case  The ends sought to be attained by the requirement of natural justice may be variously identified  But at least in a case such as this the concern is with the fairness of the procedure adopted rather than the fairness of the outcome  It is with the decision making process not the decision  as Lord Brightman put it    What is delivered by the requirement of natural justice is the right to a hearing  a technical expression in law  before action is taken   Clearly  the appellant made a choice  of exactly the same kind described by Dowsett J in B  of     It is not a case  such as that which confronted the Court in the M  case where the appellant s migration adviser responded on his behalf  contrary to instructions and declined the invitation consideredNADK of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Similarly  in NADK of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       and   the Full Court was willing to accept that the appellant was not told of the hearing but even so found that that matter was of no legal relevance and did not constitute jurisdictional error affirmedSZHKI v

austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It does not matter that an appellant s non attendance is by reason of their own election or by no fault of their own  In VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     Sundberg and Hely JJ stated  at     Part   of the Act  in which ss      A    A    A and  C appear  must be read as a whole  Sections  A    A    A and  C are specific provisions qualifying the general provisions of s    The scheme they involve expressly contemplates that  in particular circumstances  an applicant will not attend a hearing  including cases involving no fault of the applicant  Notwithstanding that  the Tribunal is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant s absence
