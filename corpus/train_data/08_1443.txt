  and Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALR   at     There is sufficient objective evidence to establish a prima facie allegation of delay on the part of Ultradrilling caused by its own conduct  It is important to note that Ultradrilling s contentions proceeded not on the basis that there could be no implied term relating to time but that the legal argument there existed one or more implied terms covering all of the instances set out in the schedule to the letter dated   February   was  patently feeble   That contention is understandable  However  the evidence before the Court on these issues  including the terms of the contract  is not exhaustive  cf TR Administration   ACSR at      Indeed  what evidence was before the Court suggested that there was in fact no formal  integrated written contract  but instead a series of emails  purchase orders  and invoices  including the Purchase Order partially set out above appliedElm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Ultradrilling submitted that the fact that West now puts forward these details of the offsetting claim to overcome the difficulties identified by the Deputy Registrar should tell strongly against the genuineness of the claim  both on the issue of whether the delays are recoverable by West against Ultradrilling and the amount of any such claim  In any event  Ultradrilling contends that the evidence now provided does not rise above mere assertion and should be rejected on that basis alone  see Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal   NSWSC   at       and TR Administration   ACSR at      Ultradrilling focused  in particular  on the charges for  lost mark up  and the  lost profit  on the pumps  see   above   Ultradrilling contended that if  as was required  a line was drawn to distinguish between evidence that was merely spurious  bluster or assertion and evidence which provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile  the offsetting claim would be dismissed  TR Administration at       I reject this submission  What this application has demonstrated is that the terms on which West engaged Ultradrilling to drill bore holes and the manner in which Ultradrilling completed that work is the subject of dispute  Those issues cannot be resolved and should not be resolved in the present application  Moreover  it must be recalled that West is not required to establish the precise dollars and cents or provide a fully evidenced claim  Elm Financial Services at     Secondly  the bases on which Ultradrilling contends that charges for  lost mark up  and the  lost profit  on the pumps are spurious cannot be accepted   Lost mark up  was criticised by Ultradrilling on the grounds that  t he sense in which this amount was  lost   was  unexplained   However  that loss was explained  In Mr West s additional affidavit and accompanying spreadsheet  see     above  it was described as the margin which West would have received on the engineer s labour   that is  the difference between the rate charged to the client and the rate actually paid to the engineer  Whether such loss is recoverable from Ultradrilling and if so  whether   is the correct rate to apply in calculating the loss  are issues to be determined in other forums  The other loss  the  lost profit  component  was challenged by Ultradrilling on the basis that because the pumps were said to be custom built for the Project  there could be no  usual practice  for renting the pumps and it was not plausible to assume that each of the pumps  if not required on the Project  would have been immediately rented out for the whole period to a third party at   per day  Again  those are issues that will need to be resolved in another forum   In the present case  it cannot be said that the evidence was merely spurious  bluster or assertion  The evidence ultimately provided by West provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile  Whether West will succeed at any trial of the issue is irrelevant   Adding together the   in genuine dispute and the approximately   in offsetting claims yields a total amount which exceeds the balance of   claimed by Ultradrilling pursuant to the Statutory Demand  In the circumstances  the appropriate orders are that the Statutory Demand be set aside under s  H  of the Act and that Ultradrilling pay West s costs of and incidental to the application  both before the Registrar and this Court  such costs to be taxed in default of agreement   In view of those orders  it is unnecessary to separately consider setting aside the Statutory Demand on one or more of the grounds set out in s  J of the Act         I certify that the

reject Ultradrilling s  failure to particularise  contention on a number of bases  First  it cannot be said that when Mr West identified incidents allegedly caused by Ultradrilling and giving rise to the need to place Ultradrilling on standby pending further instructions  he was purporting to give a complete list  So much is made clear by the language of para   of his affidavit of   May    Secondly  it is apparent from the contemporaneous correspondence before the Court that Macmahon itself attributed delays on the Project to what it described as  lack of production  by Ultradrilling  In those circumstances and having regard to the nature of the incidents identified  it is neither possible nor appropriate for a Court in a proceeding of this nature to seek an exhaustive list of each incident  determine its cause  and then ascertain the time and cost of any such delay  There is objective evidence that there is a genuine dispute about whether Ultradrilling was entitled to charge separately for  other standby  for the whole of the amount of    Put another way  contrary to the submissions of Ultradrilling  it cannot be said that the dispute as to the whole of the amount is a  patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence  Rhagodia Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd     ACSR   at    internal citation and quotation marks omitted   There is  sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation  as to the truth of the assertion  Rhagodia at    internal citation and quotation marks omitted    As noted earlier  West contended that it also had offsetting claims of   against Ultradrilling based on Ultradrilling s alleged delay in completing the drilling work that was said to constitute a breach of the contract between West and Ultradrilling  The losses arising from the breach were said by Mr West in his   May affidavit to comprise       for internal administrative costs       short payment from Macmahon  and       for other delay costs incurred by West   Before turning to consider these amounts  it is necessary to say something about the general nature and alleged cause of the offsetting claims  There is no dispute that the Project was delayed  As noted earlier  what is in dispute is the cause of the delays and  having determined the cause  the precise costs resulting from those delays and their recoverability under the contract  i e  whether the delays constitute breaches of one or more terms of the contract   Some of the costs said to arise from the delays I have already considered  see

  ACSR   at     The test to be applied in determining whether an offsetting claim exists is the same as that applied in ascertaining the existence of a genuine dispute  TR Administration Pty Ltd   ACSR at     As noted earlier  Ultradrilling was engaged by West as a subcontractor on the Project to undertake extensive drilling work  West in turn had been hired by head contractor Macmahon Contractors Pty Ltd  Macmahon   The Statutory Demand issued by Ultradrilling claims an amount that is said to represent the balance due to it from West for the drilling work done pursuant to the contract  The genuine dispute alleged by West is whether certain amounts are in fact payable and owing under the contract  the offsetting claim is for losses said to arise out of Ultradrilling s breach of the contract due to its delay in completing the work   West contends that of the   remaining unpaid on the Statutory Demand  there is a genuine dispute in relation to   arising from excessive and incorrect charges by Ultradrilling   There is sufficient objective evidence to establish a prima facie allegation of delay on the part of Ultradrilling caused by its own conduct  It is
