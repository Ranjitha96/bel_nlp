Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     citedSoondur v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs     FCR  First  although the appellant was previously included as a dependent in her mother s application for a protection visa  the appellant remains entitled to make an independent application for a protection visa  Soondur v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs     FCR   per Gray  Carr and Goldberg JJ  The respondent makes no challenge to the competency of the application  Second  there seems to be no authority on the question of whether the scope of the inquisitorial role of the Tribunal might be different or whether the Tribunal might be required to make particular enquiries  in discharging the statutory duty of review  when the application for review is made by or on behalf of a minor  In this case  however  the question does not arise because the application was made by the appellant in reliance on the circumstances and claims of her parents and her father had the carriage and prosecution of the application for a protection visa on her behalf and also in relation to all subsequent challenges by the appellant  The appellant s interests before the Tribunal were represented by her father as next friend  Accordingly  it follows that none of the grounds of appeal to this Court have been made out  It therefore follows that the appeal must be dismissed with an order that the appellant pay the first respondent s costs of and incidental to the appeal    I certify that the preceding forty five   numbered paragraphs are a true
