In the Matter of Study Overseas Now Pty Ltd  Deregistered  Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v Australian Securities   Investments Commission   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALR   The provisions of s  AH  have the effect  relevant to this case  that the Court must be satisfied that the ACCC is a person aggrieved by the deregistration and that it is just that the registration be reinstated  The application of those statutory requirements was considered by Austin J in similar circumstances in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALR    In that case the ACCC submitted that it had a public duty to improve competition and efficiency in markets and to foster a fair and competitive operating environment for businesses  One of the strategies used to achieve that objective is litigation in cases of serious breaches of the TP Act  The ACCC considered  in that case  that the conduct which it alleged was a serious example of price fixing and market sharing and that it had a duty in the public interest to reinstate and sue the perpetrator of some of that conduct  The former officers of the company then before the Court accepted that the ACCC had standing to apply as did his Honour   In relation to standing  the present case is relevantly indistinguishable from that before Austin J  I find that the ACCC has the necessary interest in proceeding against the company in the discharge of its statutory functions such that it is  a person aggrieved by the deregistration  for the purposes of s  AH    In the case before Austin J the company whose reinstatement was sought had been placed in liquidation by a members  voluntary winding up  In the present case the company was voluntarily deregistered  A director of the company made a declaration of solvency on   December   under s  AA  citedNewham v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ACSR   The ACCC accepts that where a reinstatement is sought in order to enable an applicant to pursue a claim against the company reinstated  it must appear that the claim has reasonable prospects of success or raises a serious question to be tried  Newham v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ACSR   Gausten v Outokumpu Australia Pty Ltd  unreported  Supreme Court of Western Australia  Master Sanderson     In her affidavit in support of the application for reinstatement  Bianca Sumner  a Project Officer employed by the ACCC  exhibited the written agreement which is at the heart of the proceedings instituted by the ACCC  That agreement contained the following provisions        To all English Language Institutions in Perth        The Perth International Student Agencies  which are KOKOS International Pty Ltd  IAE Edu Net WA  Study Overseas Now  Nanuri Education Centre and Jobbok International  have organized an agreement along with the Council of Korean Agency  The agreement is proposed to prevent excessively discounted fees offered by the agencies mentioned above     The agencies pledges  sic  to offer fair dealings accordingly to the agreed conditions which are listed below that all International students  including Working Holiday Makers   Tourists  will not be offered discounts beyond the noted amount on the school s invoice      Unfortunately the problem has arisen to enormous proportions in Sydney and it sets a fine example  The agents there are competing with each other by offering     off their own commission to students  In result of this  students are taking this matter to their advantage and requesting for more concessions  It is believed that all persons it concern  sic  do not want this predicament to occur in this market in Perth      Therefore  The Council of Korean Agency wishes to monitor and control unfair commissions apart from official privileges offered by Education Institutes  It is also aimed to all Institutions to cooperate within the agreement for fair dealings in the Korean Market      Listed below are the agreed conditions             The five agencies in Perth will organize a Net Work System and cooperate by working together and monitoring any illegal activities         All other agencies should follow the system  which has been organized by the five agencies mentioned above  and carry it into an effect         If any of the five agencies as well as others has performed unfair illegal activities will face a penalty fee ordered by the Council of Korean Agency        All Education Institutions in Perth to cooperate by reporting to the Council of Korean Agency if any illegal activities are performed by any agencies        No enrolment for school for   months      On the face of it the evidence of the agreement indicates that the ACCC s claim has reasonable prospects of success   There are obvious public interest considerations in favour of the litigation proceeding against all companies said to have been party to the arrangements of which the ACCC complains  Given that those proceedings are still pending it is neither necessary nor desirable to enter upon any further analysis of their merits  It is sufficient to say that on the materials before the Court it is just that the company be reinstated
