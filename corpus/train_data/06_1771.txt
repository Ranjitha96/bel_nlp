absence of a racial basis for the looting and destruction of the appellant s family business in May   impacts upon the Tribunal s characterisation of the events of September   and its conclusion that   even if there were a further riot  it is no more than speculation that ethnic Chinese might be its target because of their race and  even if they were  the chance is remote that  the appellant  may face serious harm during it    It also impacts on the failure by the Tribunal to consider whether there had been a relevant change between May   and September   even in the context of a change in political leadership and policies  To the extent that the Tribunal relied upon evidence that some ethnic Chinese were not targeted because of their race but instead suffered harm in the context of a breakdown of law and order  that evidence was adverse information that was  credible  relevant and significant  in the sense discussed in VEAL at   to    The Tribunal was obliged to give the appellant the opportunity to deal with it  Its failure to do so resulted in a denial of natural justice and jurisdictional error citedCommissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at     appliedKioa v West   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Federal Magistrate considered that the Tribunal complied with its obligations to provide natural justice  His Honour observed that there was no requirement to provide all material to the appellant as long as an opportunity was given to deal with adverse information   that is credible  relevant and significant to the decision to be made    at   citing Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at    His Honour also stated that  a  decision maker is not required to disclose information that is already obvious     The appellant also submitted to his Honour that the Tribunal failed to consider the question of state protection  This ground was not included in the amended notice of appeal  Federal Magistrate Scarlett concluded that the Tribunal did not need to consider whether protection may be withheld for reason of ethnicity  at    That finding followed from the conclusion that the Chinese in Indonesia were not targeted because of their ethnicity and that it was speculation that ethnic Chinese might be targeted   A further issue arose during the hearing of this appeal that was not within the amended notice of appeal  That is whether there was an absence of evidence or of an available inference  so that the Tribunal s conclusion was not open to it or that the Tribunal decision was otherwise illogical  There was no objection to these grounds of appeal  The parties addressed the issue in more detail in written submissions filed after the hearing   The Tribunal s reasoning seems to be as follows       The May   riots did target ethnic Chinese       Only a very small percentage of the country s ethnic Chinese were harmed during those riots       The appellants were unharmed       There is no evidence that the appellant s siblings  who continue to reside in Indonesia  have been harmed since May   because of their race       There have been changes in Indonesia since August   when the appellant left the country       There were demonstrations in Jakarta in September         Those demonstrations were directed at the authorities  there was some looting of businesses in Chinatown but the evidence does not indicate that ethnic Chinese were among those targeted because of their race       There was an outbreak of violence in Bandung in   in which a predominantly Chinese area was targeted but there were no reported deaths or injuries       Even if there were a further riot  it is no more than speculation that ethnic Chinese might be targeted because of their race    Even if Chinese were targeted  the chance of such riots resulting in serious harm to the appellant was remote   The Minister also submits that  because the information was in the public domain and sourced from newspapers  it was  obvious  and therefore there was no requirement to put it to the appellant  The Minister relied on Kioa at   and Miah at   in support of its submission  Those authorities do not stand for that proposition and the submission is rejected  The mere fact that information has been published does not make it obvious  nor does mere publication make apparent the use to which the information will be put by the Tribunal   The transcript of the Tribunal hearing was not available to the Federal Magistrate  After the hearing of the appeal  the Minister filed a copy of the transcript and supplementary submissions which referred to the transcript without objection  The appellant was given an opportunity to  and did  put further submissions in reply  The parties thereby consented to my perusal of the transcript   The Tribunal told the appellant that the recent changes in Indonesia were   quite significant   as far as the appellant was concerned and that there had been some   significant changes   since the May   riots  The Tribunal stated to him that there had been no press reports of anti Chinese riots in Java in   citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi     ALD   Mr Karp  who appears for the appellant  acknowledges that mere illogical reasoning on the part of the Tribunal is not sufficient to attract jurisdictional error   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi     ALD   at    He points out  however  that a decision that was

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW   FCAFC         FCR   at       Two of the three reasons advanced by the Tribunal for its lack of satisfaction of a well founded fear of persecution were based on independent evidence of  significant changes  in Indonesia since the appellant s departure  The Tribunal concluded that the appellant s fear  though genuine  was not well founded  In its view  the chance of persecution was remote   The amended notice of appeal asserts an obligation on the part of the Tribunal to put matters to the appellant to provide the opportunity for him to respond

ALR   In NADH of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at     Allsop J  with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed  provided some elucidation of the analysis to be undertaken in dealing with an allegation of illogicality  As his Honour pointed out  perfect logicality is a standard not necessarily achieved in the reasoning process of many decision makers  indeed  illogicality may highlight the understanding of how an error occurred within jurisdiction  There must  of course  be a process of reasoning   Mr Karp does not submit that the Tribunal decision was of the kind described by Allsop J in NADH   a decision that lacked reasoning  It cannot be said that the Tribunal could not or did not reach its conclusion by a process of reasoning   It was not inevitable  logically  that because the May   riots were directed towards the ethnic Chinese and the appellant was ethnically Chinese  that the destruction of his family s business in Jakarta was racially motivated  It cannot be said that the conclusion was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come to it  It was open to the Tribunal to conclude that  in the context of general lawlessness  the destruction of his salon was not based on his race   The appellant has not established jurisdictional error on this ground citedPilbara Aboriginal Land Council Aboriginal Corporation

Allsop J with whom Gyles and Conti JJ agreed  SZBPM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   to     The Tribunal member did not suggest to the appellant that it doubted that the destruction of his family s business was due to it being owned by a Chinese family  cf Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Applicant S      ALR   at    She did not suggest to him that ethnic Chinese were not targeted in the   May riots because of their race  To the contrary  she suggested that this part of his claim was accepted   The Tribunal accepted in its decision that   some ethnic Chinese suffered harm amounting to persecution during the   riots   and that   if there were a real chance that an individual might face  such harm  during riots or at any other time  because of his or her race  that person would come within the definition of a refugee    However  it drew a distinction between those persons and the appellant  It found that the looting and destruction of his business occurred not because the business was owned by a Chinese family  but in the context of a breakdown of law and order and widespread rioting affecting many shop front businesses  The Tribunal said that it was not satisfied that the appellant was targeted because of his race   The Minister submits that the Tribunal accepted the appellant s subjective fear arising during and subsequent to the May   riots  that was not contradicted in the Tribunal s findings  The Minister contends that the Tribunal was not satisfied  however  that the looting of the appellant s shop was for reasons of his or his family s ethnicity  That is  the Tribunal accepted the appellant s subjective fears but did not accept that they were objectively well founded at the

Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at     citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The observations of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA   are apposite  In SZBEL the Tribunal did not challenge what the appellant said  express reaction or invite him to amplify those matters that the Tribunal later found to be  implausible   at    Where an issue arose at the Tribunal hearing that was not an issue before the Delegate  the High Court held that it was incumbent on the Tribunal to identify that issue and to tell the applicant of it  at    The applicant was entitled to be on notice that his account on a particular aspect was an issue arising in relation to the decision under review  at    Where the Delegate had not based his decision on an aspect  the Delegate s reasons did not indicate that that aspect of the account was in issue and the Tribunal did not identify the aspect as important and did not challenge what the appellant said  there is a denial of procedural fairness  at         Had the appellant been given an opportunity to respond to the issue of the cause of destruction of the salon in   the Tribunal may have concluded that the looting of businesses in the Chinatown district of Jakarata did have a racial nexus  and that if this were to reoccur  as it apparently had in Bandung  the applicants could suffer harm serious enough to amount to persecution   The Tribunal stated that its failure to be satisfied that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution was for three reasons  The second of these was that there had been significant changes since the appellant left and  even if there were a further riot  the chance was remote that the appellant would face serious harm  This  on its face  is a separate basis for its conclusion that there was no well founded fear of persecution  I am satisfied that the Tribunal did put to the appellant the changes that had generally taken place in Indonesia after May    However  this second reason was inextricably linked to the Tribunal s conclusion that  while demonstrations in September   involved looting of businesses in Chinatown  ethnic Chinese were not then targeted because of their race and as such  it was speculation that ethnic Chinese might be targeted in the future citedSZBPM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Subject to

have affected the conclusion as at the date of the Tribunal decision  that changes in Indonesia meant that  it there were a riot  the chance of harm was remote  If there has been a denial of natural justice  there is jurisdictional error where  as here  the ultimate conclusion could have been affected   VAAD v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     citing Re Refugee Review Tribunal  ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   at     and     Accordingly the appeal should be allowed   The Federal Magistrate made a recommendation to the Minister in clear terms  at      His Honour understood that it was merely a recommendation but included reference to it in his reasons and in his orders  I was informed at the hearing that  apart from drafting a letter that was not forwarded to the Minister  no action was taken to give effect to that recommendation   I do not approve that course of action  I would have thought that the solicitors had an obligation  at the least  to bring that recommendation to the attention of their client  This obligation is  in my view  analogous to the obligation to pass on to a client any matter requiring further instructions  This would apply to a recommendation by a judicial offer where the party is a holder of public office   I am informed that guidance issued by the Minister provides that it is inappropriate for the Minister to consider exercising her discretion under s   of the Act where there is migration related litigation that has not been resolved  The appeal lodged from the decision of Scarlett FM resulted in the suspension of further consideration of the referral of this matter to the Minister by the Department  I am also informed that the Department has expedited its assessment of the appellant s case  That does not affect the obligation on the part of the solicitors to pass to the client the Federal Magistrate s recommendation appliedVHAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous
