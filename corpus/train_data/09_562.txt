Davis v Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia  No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedLuton v Lessels   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Luton v Lessels   HCA         CLR     the High Court gave detailed consideration to the scheme  In that case  the plaintiff contended that the scheme was unconstitutional on two broad grounds  namely that   a  It involved the imposition of taxation in contravention of s   of the Constitution   and   b  Aspects of the scheme legislation constituted an impermissible attempt to vest the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the Registrar  No argument was advanced in Luton   HCA       CLR   that the scheme was invalid because it could not be supported by s  xxxi  of the Constitution   In any event  at least two members of the Court  Gleeson CJ and McHugh J  expressly held that the legislation was supported by the powers conferred by s  xxii     xxxvii  and  xxxix  and s   of the Constitution   The remaining members of the Court proceeded upon the basis that the legislation was valid  Before considering the precise questions raised before the Court in Luton   HCA       CLR     at      pp     Gleeson CJ said    The legislative scheme   The objects of the Assessment Act are set out in s    The principal object is to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial support from their parents  To that end  the Act provides for a level of support to be determined in accordance with legislatively fixed standards  and permits carers of children to have the level readily determined without the need to resort to court proceedings  There is an office of Child Support Registrar established by s   of the Registration and Collection Act  An application for administrative assessment of child support may be made  to the Registrar  under Pt   of the Assessment Act  Such an assessment is made in accordance with a statutory formula  unless the Registrar determines  or a court orders  that the provisions relating to administrative assessment of child support should be departed from  Assessment Act s    A parent s liability to pay child support arises on the acceptance by the Registrar of an application  s    The making of an assessment gives rise to a debt owing by the liable parent to the carer who is entitled to child support  the debt may be recovered in a court of competent jurisdiction  s    It may be observed that  although the legislation is enacted in furtherance of a clearly defined public policy  it creates a distinctly personal liability  The natural and moral obligation of a parent to support a child becomes  by force of the legislation  a legal obligation reflected in a debt  calculated in accordance with the Assessment Act  owing by a parent to a carer of the child  Although it is not directly relevant to the questions raised  the legislation was enacted following a referral of matters by a number of States  and is supported by the powers conferred by s  xxii   xxxvii  and  xxxix  and s   of the Constitution   The principal objects of the Registration and Collection Act are to ensure that children receive from their parents the financial support that the parents are liable to provide  and that periodic amounts payable by parents towards the maintenance of their children are paid on a regular and timely basis  s    Those objects are achieved by a system of registration and enforcement  The scheme is available to a carer who wishes to take advantage of it  Some carers may not  They can rely on private enforcement if they wish  If a liability has arisen under a child support assessment  it may be registered under the Registration and Collection Act  s    The effect of registration is that the carer is no longer entitled to enforce payment of the liability and  instead  there is a debt owing by the liable parent to the Commonwealth  s    The carer entitled to child support becomes entitled to payment of an amount equivalent to that collected by the Commonwealth from the liable parent or on account of that parent s liability  s    The debt owed by the liable parent to the Commonwealth must be paid in the manner prescribed by the Act  and may be collected from certain debtors of the parent  Amounts collected are paid into  and disbursed to carers out of  the Consolidated Revenue Fund  The Commonwealth does not benefit financially  Towards the end of his Honour s discussion of the taxation ground of challenge  at      p   his Honour also said  The Assessment Act creates a private or personal obligation  in the form of a debt payable by the liable parent to the eligible carer  The debt is recoverable by the carer  The creation of a legal obligation  enforceable by private action  in a parent  to pay for the support of a child  is not taxation  It is a scheme for the creation and adjustment of private rights and liabilities  But the existence of the obligation is of significance in considering the aspect of the legislative scheme upon which the plaintiff principally relies  which is in the Registration and Collection Act  What is alleged to be taxation is in substance no more than a mechanism for the enforcement of a pre existing private liability  If a child support assessment is registered under the Registration and Collection Act the debt payable by the liable parent to the eligible carer is extinguished  and replaced by a debt payable by the liable parent to the Commonwealth  The Commonwealth  as necessary  collects the amount owing  and pays it into the Consolidated Revenue Fund  An amount equal to the amount collected is transferred to the Child Support Account  Payments of child support are then made to the carer from the Child Support Account  What is involved is a collection mechanism to facilitate the recovery of child support payments that a parent becomes liable to make under the Assessment Act  It enables the discharge of a personal obligation created by the Assessment Act  A multiplicity of payments may be involved  the amounts of payments are likely to be modest  and many carers would lack the means or the will to undertake private recovery proceedings  The practical advantages of such a scheme are obvious  but they do not include any financial benefit to the Commonwealth  The payment of moneys collected by the Commonwealth into the Consolidated Revenue Fund  is necessitated by s   of the Constitution   which refers to  revenues or moneys   The legislation does not have either the purpose or the effect of raising revenue for the Commonwealth  Its purpose is to create  and facilitate the enforcement of  private rights and liabilities  The Assessment Act creates a personal liability in a parent to the carer of a child  the Registration and Collection Act gives the carer the facility  in exchange for extinguishment of the liability to the carer  to have the Commonwealth recover the child support payments assessed and pay an equivalent amount to the carer  In the context of dealing with the second ground of challenge to the scheme  Gleeson CJ ultimately held that the exercise by the Registrar of the Registrar s powers to assess child support payments did not involve the determination of pre existing rights and obligations but rather involved the creation of new rights and obligations for the future  see      pp     and therefore did not amount to the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth  His Honour then said at      p   Furthermore  the enforceability of such rights and obligations depends upon the intervention of a court and the independent exercise of judicial power  cf Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   HCA         CLR   at     Attorney General  Cth  v Breckler   HCA         CLR   at          The Registrar cannot enforce his or her own assessments or determinations  In addition  neither an assessment nor a departure determination is conclusive  In the case of an assessment  after an objection made to the Registrar has been decided  an application may be made to a court for a declaration that an applicant is or is not entitled to an administrative assessment  or to appeal against the assessment  ss    A       In the case of a departure determination  following the disallowance of an objection either the liable parent or the carer may apply to a court  ss      In both cases  the court exercises original jurisdiction  and the court has broad powers to override decisions of the Registrar  cf Attorney General  Cth  v Breckler   HCA         CLR   at          For those reasons  the Assessment Act does not purport to confer judicial power upon the Child Support Registrar  As to the Registration and Collection Act  if a person to whom a liability in respect of child support is owed chooses to seek registration  the Registrar is required to register the liability  with the legal consequences earlier described  If a payer or payee is dissatisfied with the registration  or the particulars entered in the register  there is a right of objection  and a person aggrieved with the Registrar s decision on the objection may  appeal  to a court  The registration of a child support liability does not involve a binding and conclusive determination of existing rights and liabilities  It creates rights for the future  Under s   of the Act  debts due to the Commonwealth may be recovered in a court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the Registrar  The Registrar is involved in various ways in the collection and recovery mechanisms  These mechanisms include garnishment of wages and salaries  These functions do not involve the exercise by the Registrar of judicial power  cf Re Registrar  Social Security Appeals Tribunal  Ex parte Townsend   HCA         ALJR   at     HCA         ALR   at   per Toohey J    In the same case  in a joint judgment  Gaudron and Hayne JJ at      pp     said    The Registration and Collection Act   The Registration and Collection Act  originally enacted as the Child Support Act     commenced operation on   June    Its principal objects   Registration and Collection Act   s   include ensuring   a  that children receive from their parents the financial support that the parents are liable to provide  and      b  that periodic amounts payable by parents towards the maintenance of their children are paid on a regular and timely basis   Part III of the Registration and Collection Act  ss    B  provides for the registration of certain liabilities of a parent  or step parent  of a child to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the child  A person liable to make such payments is referred to in the Registration and Collection Act as  the payer   Section   identifies what is a registrable maintenance liability and Div   of Pt III  ss     provides for the registration of such liabilities  Section   of the Registration and Collection Act provides that  if a registrable maintenance liability is registered  first  the amounts payable  are debts due to the Commonwealth by the payer in accordance with the particulars of the liability entered in the Child Support Register  and  secondly   the payee is not entitled to  and may not enforce payment of  amounts payable under the liability   Registered maintenance liabilities that are enforceable under the Registration and Collection Act are called  enforceable maintenance liabilities   s    An amount that is a debt due to the Commonwealth under s   is called a  child support debt   s    Part IV of the Registration and Collection Act  ss     provides for the collection of amounts due to the Commonwealth for enforceable maintenance liabilities  If the payer is an employee  the general rule is that  as far as practicable  the amount will be collected by deduction from the payer s salary or wages  s    Provision is made for the Registrar to give notice to the employer of such a payer  s   instructing the employer to make periodic deductions from salary or wages paid by the employer to the payer  Section   obliges the employer to make the necessary deductions  s   requires the employer to pay to the Registrar the amounts deducted  An amount payable to the Registrar under Pt IV of the Act  including  therefore  an amount payable under s   is a debt due to the Commonwealth  s    Until the amendment of the Registration and Collection Act in     Child Support Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  Sch   Item   the Registrar was the Commissioner of Taxation  Registration and Collection Act  s   and each Second Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation was a Deputy Child Support Registrar  s    The amending legislation provided that the Registrar was to be  the person who holds  or is acting in  the position known as the General Manager of the Child Support Agency  or if there is no such position  the person holding  or acting in  a position specified by the Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services  McHugh J agreed with Gleeson CJ  At      pp     Callinan J said    The Collection Act   The objects of the Collection Act are to ensure that children receive from their parents the financial support that the parents are liable to provide  and that periodic amounts payable by non custodial parents towards the maintenance of their children are paid on a regular and timely basis  s    Part III of the Act provides for the registration of  registrable maintenance liabilities  which include liabilities that arise under a child support assessment  s    Section  A requires the Registrar to register liabilities arising under a child support assessment by entering particulars of the liability in the Child Support Register unless the payee elects in his or her application not to have the liability enforced under the Collection Act  or if the application for the child support assessment was made by the liable parent  When a child support liability is not registered  the payee may apply to the Registrar for the registration of the liability  s    When a child support liability is registered  the payee  either alone or jointly with the payer  may elect to have the liability no longer enforced under the Act  s  A  The particulars that are required to be entered in the Child Support Register include the names of the payer and payee  details of the child support assessment  the name and date of birth of the relevant child or children  the periodic amounts payable by the payer  and the payment rate and payment period  s    When the Registrar amends a child support assessment under which a registrable maintenance liability arises  the Registrar must immediately make such variations to the particulars entered in the Child Support Register as are considered necessary or desirable to enable the amendment to be given effect under the Act  s  A   The Registrar also has power to vary the particulars entered in the Child Support Register for the purpose of correcting a clerical error or mistake  s    Upon registration under s   amounts payable under the child support assessment become debts due to the Commonwealth by the payer and the payee is no longer entitled to  and may not enforce payment of the relevant amounts  Part IV of the Act makes provision for the collection of registered child support liabilities by the Commonwealth by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer  The Registrar may give a notice to an employer of the payer specifying the name of the payer and instructing the employer to make periodic deductions from the payer s salary or wages  and to direct payment to the Registrar  s    The employer is then under a duty to make such deductions  and to pay to the Registrar the amounts deducted  ss   and    The deduction and payment of an amount from the salary or wages of a payer operates  to the extent of the payment  as a discharge of the payer s liability to make payments to the Registrar  and as a discharge of the employer s liability to pay the amount to any person other than the Registrar  s    Part V makes provision for the payment and recovery of child support debts  It includes a provision which allows the Registrar to apply towards payment of such debts any amounts owing to the debtor by the Commonwealth under an Act of which the Registrar has the administration  either as Child Support Registrar or as Commissioner of Taxation  s    The Registrar may also garnishee debts owing by third parties to a child support debtor  s  A  or make deductions from social security pensions or benefits  s  AA   Part VI made provision for the payment of child support to payees from the Child Support Reserve  The Child Support Reserve was established as a component of the Reserved Money Fund  and comprised amounts transferred to the Reserve out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund equal to the amounts received by the Registrar in payment of child support debts  The money is now held and paid out of a special  differently designated account  See discussion by Gaudron and Hayne JJ at        The registration of a child support liability under the Act  or the variation of any particulars entered in the Child Support Register  must be notified to both the payer and the payee  s    Part VII confers rights of objection against decisions relating to registration  and of appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction against a decision of the Registrar in relation to an objection  Although there have been amendments made to both Acts since Luton   HCA       CLR   was decided  the Court s exposition of the legislation remains relevant to a consideration of the scheme in its present form  Of particular relevance to the present application are ss  A        and   of the Collection Act  Those sections are in the following terms     A Registrar may collect child support related debts from a third person     The Registrar may give written notice to a person   a  by whom money is due or accruing  or may become due  to a child support debtor  or   b  who holds  or may subsequently hold  money for or on account of a child support debtor  or   c  who holds  or may subsequently hold money on account of some other person for payment to a child support debtor  or   d  who has authority from some other person to pay money to a child support debtor   requiring that person to pay to the Registrar   e  if the amount of money is more than the maximum notified deduction total an amount equal to the maximum notified deduction total  or   f  if the amount of money is equal to or less than the maximum notified deduction total the amount of money  or   g  if the notice specifies an amount of money that is to be paid out of each payment that the notified person becomes liable  from time to time  to make to the debtor that amount until the maximum notified deduction total is satisfied      A  A notice given under subsection   requires the notified person to continue to make payments in accordance with that subsection until the maximum notified deduction total is satisfied    B  For the purposes of subsection   maximum notified deduction total is an amount specified in a notice under that subsection that does not exceed the support debt of the child support debtor to whom the notice relates     A person who refuses or fails to comply with a notice under subsection   is guilty of an offence   Penalty         A  Subsection   does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse    B  Subsection   is an offence of strict liability     A notice   a  must specify a day  not being a day before the money becomes due or is held  on or before which the money is to be paid  and   b  may be varied by the Registrar specifying a later day for making a payment under the notice       Subsection  K  of the Crimes Act   does not apply in relation to anything required to be done under subsection       If the Registrar gives a notice under subsection   the Registrar must provide a copy of the notice to the child support debtor     A notice is taken to be provided under subsection   if the Registrar sends the notice to the last address of the person known to the Registrar     A notice is taken to have been given to the Commonwealth  a State or a Territory if it is served on a prescribed person     If a person is convicted of an offence against subsection   the court may  in addition to imposing a penalty on the person  order the person to pay to the Registrar an amount that is not more than the amount  or sum of the amounts  as the case may be  that the person refused or failed to pay to the Registrar     A person who makes a payment in compliance with a notice under subsection   is taken to have made the payment under the debtor s authority or the authority of any other person concerned and is indemnified in respect of that payment     If   a  the Registrar gives a notice under subsection   and   b  before the person to whom the notice is given complies with it  payment of the amount due by the debtor is made   the Registrar must immediately give the person written notice of that payment       For the purposes of this section  where   a  a person has paid money to a co operative housing society in respect of the issue of withdrawable shares in the capital of the society  and   b  the co operative housing society has not repaid the money   the money is taken to be   c  if the money is repayable on demand due by the co operative housing society to the person  and   d  in any other case money that may become due by the co operative housing society to the person       For the purposes of this section  if  apart from this subsection  money is not due  or repayable on demand to a person unless a condition is fulfilled  the money is taken to be due  or repayable on demand  as the case may be  to the person even though the condition has not been fulfilled     In this section    child support debtor means a person who is liable to pay a child support debt or a child support related debt     child support related debt   in relation to a person  includes   a  the amount of penalty  if any  imposed under section   in respect of that debt  and   b  any costs ordered by a court to be paid to the Commonwealth in respect of an offence committed by the person

maintenance liability that is enforceable under the Collection Act  As explained by the High Court in Luton   HCA       CLR     the Registrar must register in the Child Support Register kept under the Act a registrable maintenance liability once such a liability arises  see ss     and  A of the Collection Act   The obligation to register such a liability does not arise if the carer to whom the maintenance is owed elects to pursue his or her own remedies and not to take advantage of the Commonwealth s collection scheme under the Collection Act  s   and s  A  of the Collection Act   Once the registrable maintenance liability is registered under the Collection Act  the underlying debt created by the child support assessment or Court order becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth from the payer in accordance with the particulars of the liability entered in the Child Support Register  s   of the Collection Act   The claim sought to be made in par  B is that s  A of the Collection Act is invalid because it impermissibly bestows upon the Registrar the judicial power of the Commonwealth in contravention of Ch III of the Constitution   In my view  when the Registrar issues a s  A Notice  she does not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth  Section  A provides for a collection mechanism in respect of debts already due to the Commonwealth under s    Those debts become due to the Commonwealth when they are registered in the Child Support Register  As Gleeson CJ pointed out in Luton   HCA       CLR   at    p   there is a right of appeal in respect of such a registration  The registration of a child support liability does not involve a binding and conclusive determination of existing rights and liabilities  It creates rights for the future  In Luton   HCA       CLR   at     Gleeson CJ stated very clearly that the Registrar s powers of collection in respect of registered child support debts do not involve the exercise by the Registrar of judicial power  The remaining members of the Court came to the same conclusion  Paragraph  B is a re hash of an old  defeated argument  In my view  the reasoning of the High Court in Luton   HCA       CLR   provides a complete answer to Mr Davis  claim  Furthermore  in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCAFC   at     a Full Court of this Court held that the decision in Luton   HCA       CLR   foreclosed any constitutional challenge  I agree appliedLy v Jenkins   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe relevant principle was explained by Sackville J in Ly v Jenkins   FCA         FCR   when  at      pp     his Honour said  It is  accepted constitutional doctrine  that the Commonwealth  when it invests the judicial power of the Commonwealth in a State court  must take that court constituted and organised from time to time  Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions  NSW    HCA         CLR       ALR   at CLR   per Brennan CJ  The doctrine was stated by Knox CJ  Rich and Dixon J in Le Mesurier v Connor   HCA         CLR   at   as follows   T he power is to confer additional judicial authority upon a Court fully established by or under another legislature  Such a power is exercised and its purpose is achieved when the Parliament has chosen an existing Court and has bestowed upon it part of the judicial power belonging to the Commonwealth  To affect or alter the constitution of the Court itself or of the organization through which its jurisdiction and powers are exercised is to go outside the limits of the power conferred and to seek to achieve a further object  namely  the regulation or establishment of the instrument or organ of Government in which judicial power is invested  an object for which the Constitution provides another means  the creation of Federal courts   Mr Roberts  in his oral submissions  seemed to suggest that this doctrine renders the Commonwealth constitutionally incapable of altering the jurisdictional limits of a State court by investing that court with federal jurisdiction  This is not so  The position was explained by Latham CJ in Peacock v Newtown Marrickville   General Co operative Building Society No   Ltd     CLR   at    This is a power to give new  additional  jurisdiction to State courts  The Parliament may select such State courts as it pleases  It may give them much or little new jurisdiction  It may make the jurisdiction as wide or as narrow as it pleases with respect to persons  localities or amounts involved  or  as in the Judiciary Act   s     it may allow the State law to operate in respect of such matters  But the State court must be taken as it exists  The constitution or structure of the court cannot be changed by the Federal Parliament    Emphasis added    Parliament may therefore affect the functions of a State court  but the  court s organization and constitution are inviolate  Russell v Russell   HCA         CLR       ALR   at CLR   per Stephen J  Adams v Chas S Watson Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Latham CJ  at   per Starke J  at   per Dixon J  His Honour there illustrated the principle by referring to s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth  as an example of how the Commonwealth Parliament may permissibly affect the functions of a State court within the principle as explained by his Honour  Moore and Kiefel JJ agreed with the reasons of Sackville J on this point  Paragraph  A  Serious Question to be Tried Counsel for Mr Davis submitted that the claims made by Mr Davis in par  A were supported by s  B  and s  B A  of the Judiciary Act    Cth   He did not rely upon the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   Counsel submitted that the Notice was invalid and of no effect for two broad reasons  namely    The Notice was bad in form  and    The decision to issue the Notice was invalid because the pre conditions or jurisdictional facts founding its issue had not been established  In support of his first broad ground  Counsel for Mr Davis made a number of points about the Notice appliedSebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic   Felts Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic   Felts Pty Limited   FCA   I discussed the relevant principles to be applied by this Court in considering whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction in aid of private rights  At     I said  In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     a majority of the High Court held that  where an interlocutory injunction is sought  inter alia  in respect of private rights  it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought  Their Honours who comprised the majority made clear that the final relief sought need not be injunctive in nature  See   to    pp      per Gleeson CJ    to    pp      per Gaudron J  and   to    pp       to    pp     and    p    per Gummow and Hayne JJ   At    p   Gleeson CJ also specifically cited with approval Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies    th edn     pp      In his Reasons for Judgment  at    p   Gleeson CJ expressly approved the following passage from the Reasons for Judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at    In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show   that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case  in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief    that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted  and   that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction   These remarks of Mason ACJ which were approved by Gleeson CJ echo the observations made by the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at    pp     when referring to the well known passage in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA       CLR   at     Gummow and Hayne JJ said   By using the phrase  prima facie case  their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed  it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial  That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument   HCA         CLR   at    With reference to the first inquiry  the Court continued  in a statement of central importance for this appeal   HCA         CLR   at    How strong the probability needs to be depends  no doubt  upon the nature of the rights  the plaintiff  asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks   At   to    pp   and   their Honours went on to explain the similarities and differences between the test expounded in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA       CLR   and the test articulated in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd   UKHL       AC   as follows  When Beecham and American Cyanamid are read with an understanding of the issues for determination and an appreciation of the similarity in outcome  much of the assumed disparity in principle between them loses its force  There is then no objection to the use of the phrase  serious question  if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question  like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham   depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham   However  a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that  provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff s claim is not frivolous or vexatious  then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient  The critical statement by his Lordship is  t he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious  in other words  that there is a serious question to be tried    UKHL       AC   at    That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters of onus   UKHL       AC   at    So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial  the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought      Emphasis added    Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed  They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought   The second of these matters  the reference to practical consequences  is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application  See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   at     and the article by Sofronoff    Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect   Australian Law Journal  vol          The first consideration mentioned in Beecham   the nature of the rights asserted by the plaintiff  redirects attention to the present appeal  At   to   I have summarised Sebel s claim for final relief  At   I have set out the claim for interlocutory relief with which these Reasons deal  Sebel s application for interlocutory relief is in aid of the private rights to which I have referred in   to   above  The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia   HCA       CLR   require Sebel to show that   a  it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted  and    b  the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction   The first of these matters involves an assessment by the Court as to whether the claimant would  in all material respects  be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy  as he would be in if an injunction were granted  see the discussion of this aspect in Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies    th edn    at pp     at pp     and at pp      The second of these matters requires the Court to exercise a discretion  In exercising that discretion  the Court is required to assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by the defendant  third persons and the public generally if an injunction is granted  with that which is likely to be suffered by the claimant if no injunction is granted  In determining this question  the Court must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief  if granted  will adequately compensate the claimant for the continuing breaches which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted  In order to address the irreparable injury question  the balance of convenience and the balance of justice in the present case  it is necessary to consider the nature and strength of Sebel s case and the circumstances in which the respondent decided to compete with Sebel by importing the Titan chair into Australia and by promoting and selling that chair in this country  It is also necessary to consider and evaluate the impact that the grant or refusal of an injunction will have or is likely to have on third persons and the public generally  In Patrick Stevedores Operations No   Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia  No       CLR   at   and    pp     Brennan CJ and McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  in a joint judgment  expressly adopted a passage from Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies  th edn    at pp     which may be summarised as follows   a  In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application  the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances   b  Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case  and   c  Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive  I will apply these principles in the present case  The Application for Leave to Amend the Originating Process Mr Davis sought leave to amend his Application in the manner described in   and   above  His application for leave to amend was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that each of the additional claims sought to be added to the Application was bound to fail  In my view  the claims made in proposed new pars  B and  C are both bound to fail  For that reason  I refuse leave to amend insofar as the inclusion of those paragraphs is concerned  Paragraph  A raises different considerations although I think that the claim made in that paragraph is barely arguable  The Registrar did not point to any particular prejudice  other than costs  if par  A were included followedWhittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlParagraph  B is a re hash of an old  defeated argument  In my view  the reasoning of the High Court in Luton   HCA       CLR   provides a complete answer to Mr Davis  claim  Furthermore  in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCAFC   at     a Full Court of this Court held that the decision in Luton   HCA       CLR   foreclosed any constitutional challenge  I agree
