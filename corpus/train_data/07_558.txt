GE Capital Finance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAmalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     FCR   In view of the respondent s submissions  it is necessary to consider the effect of s    By the operation of s   the Agreements Act incorporates the Assessment Act subject to s    However  each Act retains its own identity and the imposition of the relevant tax is still imposed by and at the rates declared by the Income Tax  Dividends  Interest and Royalties Withholding Tax  Act    Cth  and the Income Tax Rates Act    Cth  by reference to the Assessment Act  The incorporation has the consequence  as a matter of a drafting technique  of incorporating the text of the Assessment Act into the Agreements Act  As Lockhart J said in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     FCR   at     It is not uncommon to find in an Act a provision that an earlier Act is incorporated and shall be read as one with the later Act  The effect of such a provision is to transpose the earlier into the later Act or to write every provision of the earlier Act into the later Act as if they had been actually printed into it  It is a rule of construction of statutes  but it cannot be used in effect to amend the provisions of the earlier Act which is to be read as one with the later Act  Sometimes an Act provides that it is incorporated and shall be read as one with an earlier Act  The effect is the same namely  to transpose the later into the earlier Act  See

  per Jordan CJ  Cadbury Fry Pascall Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   per Williams J  and the cases there cited  Tasman Timber Ltd v Minister for Industry and Commerce     ALR     Undoubtedly  the drafting technique of incorporation by reference may require necessary adjustments or modifications to be made in the incorporated provisions  In Cadbury Fry Pascall Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   Williams J said    The tax is imposed by the Tax Act  which prescribes the rates of taxation  This Act incorporates the Assessment Act and provides that the two Acts are to be read together  My own view  to which I adhere  as to the effect of such a section  is stated in Perpetual Trustee Co  Ltd  v Wittscheibe as follows           In re Woods  Estate  Ex parte Her Majesty s Commissioners of Works   Buildings the Court of Appeal held that if a subsequent Act bring into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act  the legal effect of that is to write those sections into the new Act just as if they had been actually printed into it  It has also been held that where two Acts are to be read together the Court must construe every part of each of them as if it had been contained in one Act  unless there is some manifest discrepancy making it necessary to hold that the latter Act has to some extent modified something found in the earlier Act  see Hart v Hudson Bros Ltd   Phillips v Parnaby   and Williams v Tooth   Co Ltd     Footnotes omitted      See also McGillivray v Piper     ALR     However  be that as it may  because s   is made expressly subject to subs   then the real issue in this case is not so much the application of the principles expressed by Williams J in Cadbury   CLR at   but whether s   brings about the result contended for by the respondent  This result does not hinge on the reading of the two Acts as one  but upon whether there is any relevant inconsistency between the Agreements Act  and relevantly here  the Assessment Act  It is to be noted that s   does not only deal with inconsistency in relation to the incorporated Act  namely the Assessment Act  but also with any Act imposing Australian tax  The obvious purpose of s   is to ensure that the Agreements Act is to prevail  but only in respect of its field of operation and according to its provisions   Section   operates to determine whether the beneficiary s share of the income may be taxed in Australia in accordance with the business profits article  Such a provision has effect notwithstanding the operation of the withholding tax provisions and s  B h ii  as contended for by the applicant  In my view  s   facilitates the operation of the business profits article which is only enabling and does not impose any tax itself  Section   is not in its terms  nor in the context in which it appears  concerned with the operation of s  B of the Assessment Act and was not intended to so operate  Section   is not a definition provision which purports to replace the definition of  permanent establishment  for the purposes of the application of s  B h ii   The work of s   is in connection with Art   and enables tax to be imposed in the circumstances set out in the extrinsic materials referred to by the respondent  As I had said  s   does not impose any tax in itself  or in conjunction with Art   assuming it applies  Section   is not directed to the operation of the withholding tax provisions and provisions that actually impose tax  and was introduced as an enabling provision only to assist in the taxing of distributions to a trust beneficiary which has a non resident in the context of the business profits article where the concept of a permanent establishment is significant  Each of s   and s  B can thus operate without affecting the operation of the other and without any inconsistency referred toDirector of Public Prosecutions  NSW  v Alderman     NSWLR   For the purposes of this case  it is unnecessary to go any further into the issues mentioned by Sheller JA in Director of Public Prosecutions  NSW  v Alderman     NSWLR   at     and the question of whether the incorporation may effect an amendment to the earlier Act citedJames Hardie   Coy Pty Ltd v Seltsam Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Even if the purpose for the introduction of s   or the mischief to which s   was addressed  was in fact to effectively modify or affect the operation of s  B h ii  my view is that the purpose has not been implemented  I am mindful of the comments of Kirby J in James Hardie   Coy Pty Ltd v Seltsam Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   that  unless driven to the result by unyielding words  no judicial satisfaction is to be derived from concluding that the manifest target of legislation has been missed   However  again assuming in favour of the purpose contended for by the respondent  I cannot ignore the actual words of the legislation  see Mills v Meeking   HCA         CLR   at   and R v L     FCR   at    In my view  the text and context of s   in the Agreements Act does not allow the court to read that provision as being reasonably capable of applying to the operation of the withholding tax provisions  or more specifically to the operation of s  B h ii  see generally the discussion in Pearce DC and Geddes RS  Statutory Interpretation in Australia   th ed  Butterworths    pp      Even adopting a position which would allow courts a flexible approach to overcome what could be said to be a drafting failure to facilitate the legislative intention  the respondent in this case cannot overcome the text and context in which s   appears  The Court would need to embark upon the task of impermissibly re writing the Agreements Act to facilitate the result the respondent seeks  I would need to transform a provision dealing only with the scope of the taxing power into one that effectively imposes a tax citedMcGillivray v Piper
