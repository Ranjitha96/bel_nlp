SZHYP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant formally submitted that the approach of the Federal Magistrate was erroneous in that the Minister carried the burden of proving that s  A  did not apply to the information upon which the Tribunal based its finding that the appellant had had assistance from his adviser since May    see s  A   However  I consider it appropriate to proceed on the same basis as the Federal Magistrate  namely that the appellant carried the burden of establishing that s  A applied to the information  This was the approach adopted by Moore J  with whom in this regard Weinberg and Allsop JJ agreed  in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at        see Weinberg J at   and Allsop J at     The Tribunal s reasons for decision record that it had before it the file concerning the appellant maintained by the Minister s Department  That file includes the appellant s protection visa application  The file reveals that the appellant s protection visa application was received by the Department under cover of a letter dated   May   signed by Mr Haque  In this letter Mr Haque asserted that he acted for the appellant with respect to his visa application  The statement that formed part of the appellant s visa application discloses on its face that it was declared by the appellant before Mr Haque  Other correspondence on the Departmental file suggests that Mr Haque was still the appellant s adviser at the time of the delegate s decision  I am therefore prepared to proceed on the basis that it is more likely than not that the Tribunal had regard to information in the Departmental file before making its finding regarding the appellant s assistance from his adviser   However  a finding that the Tribunal had regard to information in the Departmental file does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that s  A applied to that information  If the Tribunal obtained the same information from the appellant during his Tribunal hearing  for example  s  A b  operates to prevent s  A applying to the information   SZEEU v Minister for Immigration   FCR per Moore J at    To succeed in his contention that the Tribunal failed to comply with the requirements of s  A in respect to the information upon which its finding was based  it was necessary for the appellant to satisfy the Federal Magistrate that the Tribunal did not base its finding on information that he gave for the purposes of his application to the Tribunal   It was open to the appellant to adduce evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court of what information he did  and did not  give to the Tribunal for the purposes of his application  including during his hearing  However  he did not do so  The circumstances surrounding his failure to adduce evidence of the information he gave to the Tribunal during his hearing were as follows  The Federal Magistrate had ordered that evidence of what was said at the appellant s Tribunal hearing was to be presented in the form of a transcript verified by affidavit and that a tape recording would not be received in evidence without the leave of the court obtained prior to the hearing  No transcript was tendered in the Federal Magistrates Court  When his Honour drew attention to the evidentiary problems which the appellant faced in the absence of the transcript  the appellant s counsel applied for the hearing to be adjourned to enable a transcript to be obtained  That application was refused  The appellant does not challenge the appropriateness in the circumstances of the refusal of the adjournment application   It was also open to the appellant to make an application to this Court to receive on his appeal evidence additional to that adduced in the Federal Magistrates Court  see O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    No such application was made   The case sought to be made by the appellant before the Federal Magistrates Court and on appeal was that  even in the absence of evidence of what information the appellant provided to the Tribunal during his hearing  the Federal Magistrate ought to have been satisfied  on the balance of probabilities  that the information on which the Tribunal based the finding identified in   above was not information provided by the appellant during that hearing  In my view this case necessarily fails   The written reasons for decision of the Tribunal reveal that the appellant attended his Tribunal hearing accompanied by Mr Haque who was acting as his adviser  The reasons also reveal that the circumstances in which the appellant completed his protection visa application were the subject of discussion during the hearing  In particular  the reasons record that the appellant advised the Tribunal that  h e had explained his refugee claims to his adviser  who had then recorded them in writing in English   In the context  in my view  the reference to  his adviser  is to be understood as a reference to Mr Haque  The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus tend to establish that the appellant gave to the Tribunal the information that Mr Haque was his adviser both as at the date of the Tribunal hearing and in May    ie the date of his visa application    The finding of the Tribunal that Mr Haque had been available to give the appellant advice throughout the period between May   and the date of the Tribunal hearing may reflect an inference drawn solely from the information identified in the previous paragraph  If it does  s  A plainly did not apply to that information because it was information that the appellant gave for the purpose of his application to the Tribunal   Even if it be assumed that the Tribunal placed weight on information in addition to that identified in   above in reaching its finding  that additional information may have been given to the Tribunal by the appellant for the purpose of his application or it may have come to the Tribunal from another source  Nothing before the Federal Magistrate suggested that the second of these options was inherently more likely than the first  Indeed  the following factors suggest that his Honour was right to conclude that the first option was the more likely   As mentioned above  the appellant did not give evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court to the effect that he gave no relevant information additional to that identified in   above to the Tribunal  Nor did he seek to adduce evidence on appeal to that effect  He did not tender in the Federal Magistrates Court a verified transcript of the Tribunal hearing  Nor did he seek to adduce evidence on appeal to establish what he said at the Tribunal hearing  The appellant did not adduce evidence in either Court to explain the above forensic decisions  It is possible that cost was an impediment in the way of the appellant s obtaining a transcript of the Tribunal hearing  However  it seems unlikely that the same could be said in respect of the tape recording of the hearing or the adducing of evidence from the appellant himself  It is appropriate in the circumstances to conclude that evidence of what the appellant said at his Tribunal hearing would not have assisted his case   The appellant has failed to demonstrate that the Federal Magistrate ought to have concluded that s  A had application to the information before the Tribunal on which it made the finding that Mr Haque had been available to give the appellant advice throughout the period between May   and the date of the Tribunal hearing  He has therefore failed to show that the Federal Magistrate ought to have allowed his application for judicial review on the basis that the Tribunal failed to comply with the requirements of s  A
