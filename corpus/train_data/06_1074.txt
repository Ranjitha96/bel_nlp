Sim v CBFC Limited   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCBFC Ltd v Sim   NTSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nt NTSC  htmlOn   August   reasons for the orders made on   July   were published  CBFC Ltd v Sim   NTSC    This application under s   of the Bankruptcy Act was made immediately following the learned Supreme Court judge delivering reasons for the orders made on   July    It seeks a stay of the proceedings in the NTSC  and a discharge of the orders made on   July   including the warrant for Mr Sim s arrest  Section   of the Bankruptcy Act relevantly provides          The Court may  at any time after the presentation of a petition  upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit               a  discharge an order made  whether before or after the commencement of this subsection  against the person or property of the debtor under any law relating to the imprisonment of fraudulent debtors and  in a case where the debtor is imprisoned or otherwise held in custody under such a law  discharge the debtor out of custody  or              b  stay any legal process  whether civil or criminal and whether instituted before or after the commencement of this subsection  against the person or property of the debtor               i  in respect of the non payment of a provable debt or of a pecuniary penalty payable in consequence of the non payment of a provable debt        referred toStorey v Lane   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBecause there is extant a creditor s petition for the making of a sequestration order against the estate of Mr Sim  there is no doubt that the Court has jurisdiction under s   of the Bankruptcy Act   see Storey v Lane   HCA         CLR    In my view the Absconding Debtors Act is a law to which s  a  of the Bankruptcy Act refers  In my view  s   is directed to legislation which is intended to protect a creditor or creditors within a particular jurisdiction from adverse consequences of a debtor leaving the jurisdiction prior  or after  to the making of a sequestration order  Section  c  of the Absconding Debtors Act indicates that the Absconding Debtors Act falls within that description  Those consequences may be the result of deliberate wrongful conduct by the debtor  or  as here  by innocent conduct of the debtor  The purpose of the law under which imprisonment may be imposed is the important feature  because s   is intended to provide relief in certain circumstances against the means of enforcement of a debt which is not consistent with the Bankruptcy Act  see Storey v Lane  consideredCommissioner for Motor Transport v Train   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOne consequence of that decision was that the decision of Gibbs J  as a judge of the Court of Bankruptcy  in Re Hollis     FLR   was overruled  That decision concerned the Road Act  That it was overruled is not immediately significant  What is significant in that decision  in my view  are comments of Gibbs J about the operation of the then form of s   of the Bankruptcy Act  His Honour at     regarded s   as being directed to legislation which  by imprisonment and other orders  was a means of enforcing the payment of the debt  See also per Gibbs J in Re Caddies  Ex parte Stapleton     ABC   at    I do not think that either Barwick CJ or Stephen J in Train necessarily disagreed with those comments  They provide a different focus for determining whether the Absconding Debtors Act is a law relating to the imprisonment of fraudulent debtors  The Absconding Debtors Act is clearly directed to the enforcement  or the better enforcement  of the payment of a debt  It is perhaps surprising that legislation permits the issue of a warrant to arrest a debtor  to better secure the enforcement of a debt in the light of the trend evident even in the nineteenth century to abolish the practice of enforcement of payment of debt by imprisonment  The review of Australian legislation by Walsh J in Train indicates that trend  See also per Barwick CJ in Train at    The general approach of Gibbs J in Re Hollis to the scope of operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act seems more consonant with its purposes  and with the role of the Bankruptcy Act as regulating the relations between a creditor and a debtor once the processes for which it provides are invoked discussedRe Hollis     FLR  One consequence of that decision was that the decision of Gibbs J  as a judge of the Court of Bankruptcy  in Re Hollis     FLR

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI have not overlooked the expense which CBFC and the CBA have clearly incurred in the proceedings under the Absconding Debtors Act   It was their choice to bring those proceedings  They did so to take advantage of the different  and lower  threshold for a warrant for arrest under the Absconding Debtors Act   They did so in the light of the risk of Mr Sim applying for an order under s   of the Bankruptcy Act  That he did not bring this application earlier no doubt has increased the costs they have incurred  and that is a factor I have put into the balance  But I do not consider his defence of the proceedings in the NTSC involved him acting in a manner consistent only with Mr Sim having chosen not to exercise his right to apply under s   of the Bankruptcy Act  either generally or in the light of the reasons for judgment  cf Commonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR    There is also no evidence from CBFC or from the CBA that they continued to conduct the proceedings under the Absconding Debtors act relying upon any assumption of fact induced by Mr Sim s continued defence of those proceedings  One matter which counsel for CBFC and the CBA raised  which I reject  is that there was insufficient opportunity to make an application to this Court or to the FMC for an order under s   of the Bankruptcy Act at or immediately after the hearing of the petition  and so the application was made under the Absconding Debtors Act   The Registry of this court is open during normal hours and has an after hours number  It is well known that a judge of the Court can be available at very short notice  if necessary  to hear any urgent application  That is not to say that it was inappropriate to have instituted the proceedings in the NTSC under the Absconding Debtors Act that was a matter for CBFC and the CBA but simply to reject one explanation for having done so  The reason for having done so  as appears from the transcript of the hearing in the SCNT and in his Honour s reasons at   is the judicial advantage under the Absconding Debtors Act compared to s   of the Bankruptcy Act that  as his Honour accepted  the Absconding Debtors Act does not require proof that Mr Sim was about to abscond with a view to avoiding payment of his debts  However  as I have sought to point out  that judicial advantage also illustrates a difference from the policy of the Bankruptcy Act in circumstances such as the present  Another matter raised by counsel for CBFC and the CBA which I reject is that Mr Sim has improperly delayed in making this application  In fact  he did so within a day of the reasons for judgment of the SCNT being published  As the factual issues before his Honour included whether Mr Sim did intend to abscond so as to avoid paying his debts  it was sensible for Mr Sim to await the reasons to see what factual finding was made on the issue  I have also had regard to Mr Sim s preparedness to undertake to the Court to return to Australia  by inference within a reasonable time  to assist his trustee in the event that he is made bankrupt  He is prepared to offer a surety for his return  Thomas Winter  in the sum of   and Mr Winter too has deposed to his preparedness to offer that surety and to his having assets sufficient to meet it  I propose to accept that undertaking  but to impose upon Mr Sim the time limit of three calendar months from this date  or such later date as may be agreed in writing by his trustee  He will  upon his return to Australia  have to surrender his passport to his trustee  His trustee  assuming Mr Sim is made bankrupt  will then have sufficient time to investigate Mr Sim s affairs in such manner as the trustee may consider appropriate  and to arrange for Mr Sim to be examined under s   of the Bankruptcy Act  The trustee will control Mr Sim s capacity to travel overseas so as to allow an adequate time to complete with Mr Sim such inquiries as he wishes  I am more disposed to accept that undertaking  supported by the surety  as Mr Sim has extensive family in Australia  an elderly parent  three children and seven grandchildren  Finally  I note  largely by way of an aside  that the Chief Minister on   November   said of the Absconding Debtors Bill       I t is really only a power that is exercised when the person will not comply with the order of the court  It is virtually imprisonment for contempt of the court s orders  not imprisonment for debt      Northern Territory  Parliamentary Debates    November   p      As the decision in the NTSC indicates  the power is exercisable in much wider circumstances  but for that reason its exercise may be vulnerable to an order under s   of the Bankruptcy Act  For those reasons  I order under s  a  of the Bankruptcy Act that upon the written undertaking of Mr Sim to the Court to be filed in a form approved by the District Registrar that  in the event that a sequestration order is made against his estate  he will return to Australia within three calendar months of the making of the sequestration order and will cooperate with his trustee in respect of all inquiries and procedures which his trustee requires in relation to his bankruptcy  and upon Thomas Harry Edward winter providing to and filing in the Court a surety in the sum of   in a form approved by the District Registrar to the effect that  in the event that Mr Sim does not fully comply in every respect with his undertaking  Mr Winter will forfeit to the Crown the sum of   and that process may be executed against his property for the said sum of   the orders of the NTSC made on   July   and extended on   August   under the Absconding Debtors Act in respect of Mr Sim be discharged
