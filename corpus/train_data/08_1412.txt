concern the issue of costs following my judgment on the merits in this matter  In the matter of Arc Energy Limited   FCA    Arc Energy   The reasons in that judgment give relevant context and background to these reasons  I heard oral submissions as to costs after judgment was delivered but gave Arc Energy Ltd  Arc  and Buru Energy Ltd leave to put in further written submissions directed to the case of Re Crusader Limited     Qd R   cited by Oil Basins  Arc submits that Oil Basins Limited  Oil Basins  ought pay the Plaintiff s costs of responding to the application filed by Oil Basins during the afternoon of Thursday    August   which occupied much of the hearing on the afternoon of Friday    August    It also opposes Oil Basins  application for a costs order in its favour   Furthermore  the litigation was instituted so close to the members meeting as to ensure  objectively speaking  that Arc would not be able to advise the proxy voters of it or of the companies response to it prior to the meeting  The long delay in commencing the litigation was unexplained  The claims made in the litigation are deficient of supporting material and obvious legal merit  Arc Energy at    As I said in Arc Energy at     I invited counsel for Oil Basins to explain why the adjournment was being pressed  when obviously Oil Basins has no personal standing to protect the interests of Arc shareholders  Its interests would have been served by the making of the orders sought under s  c  of the Act  I was not given any answer which I found to be satisfactory  Oil Basins  conduct in bringing such a belated application upon a paucity of fact and without a satisfactory explanation leads me to conclude that its real reasons are for some commercial gain or advantage  by putting a roadblock in front of the progress of the scheme  It should not be allowed to succeed in that course unless of course there is  objectively viewed  a proper basis for granting the orders sought   It was appropriate for Oil Basins to bring the matter of the litigation and the situation of the proxy voters to the attention of the Court  I am satisfied however that the application for an adjournment with associated orders was made for an ulterior purpose  Arc Energy at    It unnecessarily added to the costs of the hearing  Even if Oil Basins may be considered to be an objector this finding is an

Intervener       a  Prior to filing the interlocutory application  neither Oil Basins nor its solicitors raised with Arc  or its solicitors  the issues which were the subject of the application  The issues concerning s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  did not need to be the subject of an application   Arc accepted that orders pursuant to s   should be made and would have proposed those orders had Oil Basins sought them in correspondence  It did not  Indeed  Arc s solicitors corrected the errors in the formulation of the s   orders as expressed in Oil Basins  interlocutory application       b  The interlocutory process filed on behalf of Oil Basins indicates that the adjournment application  which proposed a supplementary statement be issued and a fresh scheme meeting be held  was an  alternative   Oil Basins changed its position in this regard on Friday    August  by seeking orders     and   at the hearing       c  The affidavit filed in support of the interlocutory application was deficient and unhelpful  It was sworn by Kim Warren McGrath  who is the chairman of Oil Basins  and a director of that company  Mr McGrath had access to legal advice before swearing the affidavit  Mr McGrath s affidavit contained obviously objectionable material  paragraphs   and   and included a misleading heading  above paragraph    It offered no real assistance to the Court  and failed to annex the   December   ASX announcement  which was highly relevant  and which Arc produced   see annexure  DDK  to the Fifth Kirk Affidavit        d  Counsel for Oil Basins  during the hearing on   August   was unable to explain the reason for Oil Basins  delay in commencing proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia against Arc  The delay is in excess of   months  taken from the date of the ASX announcement on   December    The litigation was filed  without warning  on   August   only   days before the scheme meeting and   days before the Court hearing  The apparent explanation offered by Mr McGrath in his affidavit  see paragraphs   and following  under the misleading heading  Discovery of plaintiff s breach of confidentiality agreement  lacks credibility in the circumstances       e  Counsel for Oil Basins  during the hearing on   August   was unable to explain to the Court the  interest  which Oil Basins had in raising issues concerning the disclosure to members  and in seeking an adjournment of the scheme  The Court has inferred that Oil Basins  was acting to obtain some commercial advantage       f  In addition  it is relevant to consider the seriousness of the order which was sought by Oil Basins  order    That order was pressed by Counsel for Oil Basins at the hearing on   August  Order   proposed an adjournment of the hearing  the preparation and distribution to shareholders of a supplementary statement  and the convening of a further scheme meeting of members  which would then have resulted in a further Court hearing before this Court  All of this would have involved considerable time and expense  and a delay to the scheme process  This must be seen in the context of a scheme which             i  was intended to establish an Australian mid tier oil and gas company with an expected market capitalisation of greater than   billion       ii  would establish a newly listed company  Buru Energy Limited       iii  an independent expert had determined was in the best interests of  and fair and reasonable to  ARC shareholders  and      iv  the ARC shareholders had overwhelmingly voted in favour of         In this context  it is of considerable concern  and relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion on the question of costs  that Oil Basins would be prepared to apply to this Court for such a serious order based on only the flimsiest of affidavit material   I accept the submissions made by Arc  The question of what was the real purpose of Oil Basins in pressing for an adjournment is a primary consideration  During the substantive hearing I asked counsel for Oil Basins what interest it had in seeking an adjournment on behalf of proxy voters in Arc  none of whom he represented  The following exchange took place  HIS HONOUR  As a matter of interest  what is the interest of the shareholders of Arc got to do with your client  MR BRUCE  Well  yes  that is I was wondering when your Honour might ask me that  HIS HONOUR  Well  I ve asked it  I ve asked the question  MR BRUCE  It is  your Honour  that we simply say that it is a matter for the court  We are here principally to seek the relief that we ve sought  and that has been agreed to  but we say that that has a material impact which is disputed  HIS HONOUR  Well  it has absolutely no impact at all upon the first set of orders that were sought  MR BRUCE  No  no  HIS HONOUR  It only has impact on the alternative relief you seek  MR BRUCE  That is correct  HIS HONOUR  It wasn t a flippant question  I would like to know what interest it is of your client as to the concern of the proxies filed by shareholders of Arc  MR BRUCE  It is simply  your Honour  that it is the duty of the court to be satisfied in all the circumstances  HIS HONOUR  But why are you telling me what the duty of the court is  Why are you telling me that there should       MR BRUCE  Sorry  your Honour  HIS HONOUR  Why are you telling the court that there should be an adjournment  Why do you want an adjournment  MR BRUCE  Because we consider  your Honour  that that well  I should perhaps just sit down  appoint and say  your Honour  that we have it s a matter for the court and we thought that it was our duty to bring those matters to the court s attention  HIS HONOUR  You ve brought it to the attention of the court but you re pressing for the adjournment  I m asking you why you want the adjournment  That goes beyond informing the court as to its duty  MR BRUCE  Yes  I accept that  HIS HONOUR  Why do you want the adjournment  MR BRUCE  To ensure that the Buru shareholders know what they re getting themselves in for  is one answer  sir   If the purpose of Oil Basins had been merely to inform the Court as to the position of the proxy voters in light of the litigation launched by Oil Basins then that was achieved by reading the affidavit of Mr David Charles Griffiths sworn   August    The purpose behind the application for the adjournment however was not explained  It was the hearing of that application which consumed much of the Court time on Friday   August   citedRe Ampol Ltd     ACLR   Oil Basins
