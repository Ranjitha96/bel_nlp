that the making of a rolled up offer inclusive of costs and interest may detract from the weight to be given to its refusal in the exercise of the discretion  Finn J referred to authorities on the point in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at     His Honour cited single judge decisions to the effect that such offers ought not to be a relevant consideration on the question of costs and would not be considered in the same way as a Calderbank letter  His Honour was invited to depart from that line of first instance authority  However he was not prepared to say it was clearly wrong  Notwithstanding that  in the circumstances of the case he had to decide  his Honour found that    The fact that the offer gave no indication at all of the breakdown     between the claim  interest and costs blunts significantly the weight to be given the offer   While respecting the general approach to rolled up offers reflected in the cases to which Finn J referred  such approaches cannot be calcified into rules of law which fetter a general discretion  They simply reflect a common sense proposition that generally speaking such an offer is not unreasonably refused  There may  however  be circumstances where a rolled up offer  refused by an applicant who is unsuccessful  may support a claim for indemnity costs citedJohn S Hayes   Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd     FCR   The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion  That discretion is not to be fettered by transformation of approaches and practices developed through the cases into quasi statutory rules  In John S Hayes   Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd     FCR     Hill J said  at     care must be taken not to

question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion  I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited     ALR   at   questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be  plainly unreasonable  for the requirement that it be  unreasonable   Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word  plainly  which is itself evaluative  has no useful function   At the time that Sirtex made its offer to UWA the prospect of UWA succeeding against Sirtex depended critically upon       UWA establishing its case against Dr Gray and  in particular  that he had breached his fiduciary duty       UWA establishing that Sirtex was accessorially liable in relation to that breach  a position that depended upon establishing that Sirtex was aware of facts constituting  and which would have indicated to a reasonable person  the breach of fiduciary duties owed by Dr Gray to UWA   It cannot be said that UWA acted unreasonably in proceeding on the basis that it had a reasonable cause of action against Dr Gray  True it is that the case as framed and presented depended upon an important proposition of law as to the existence of an implied term in the contract of Dr Gray s employment with UWA  But the correctness of that proposition had not previously been tested in Australia in circumstances of the kind which arose in this case  This is not a case  in my opinion  in which it is appropriate to take a hindsight test to the facts known to UWA at the time of Sirtex s offer and conclude that it ought to have known that the law was against it   There were of course other hazards in the way of UWA s path to success against Dr Gray and therefore against Sirtex  The question whether the relevant inventions were made while Dr Gray was an employee of UWA was one issue upon which findings adverse to UWA were made on all but the DOX Spheres technology  There was also a finding adverse to UWA that none of the Sirtex directors  apart from Dr Gray  were on notice of a potential claim  To establish any cause of action against Sirtex based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to that company  In addition  UWA faced substantial defences by Sirtex based on UWA s delay in commencing proceedings after it first became aware of the facts relevant to its claimed causes of action   The preceding factors may be seen as weighing to some degree in favour of the Sirtex motion  On the other hand the offer came as the trial commenced  That is a factor  given the focus on the trial process which would then have existed  that militates against a finding of unreasonableness on the part of UWA in refusing the offer  That conclusion is not affected by the fact that Sirtex was making a counter offer  The counter offer was not a variation on a theme opened by UWA s offers  It was quite different and could have been proposed earlier
