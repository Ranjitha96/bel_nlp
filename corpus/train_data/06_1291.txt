Macquarie Underwriting Pty Ltd v Permanent Custodians Limited   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedDecor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR  In my opinion  there is sufficient doubt as to whether such a conjunctive construction can be said even to be reasonably arguable to warrant reconsideration by a Full Court   Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at      There was no claim for indemnity made by ARMA during the currency of the first policy  The primary judge noted that Permanent s case was primarily based on the second policy   Permanent  No   at    The primary judge seems to have accepted that the applicable insurance cover related to the second policy   Permanent  No   at   citedFAI General Insurance Co Limited v McSweeney     ANZ Insurances Cases    Permanent s submissions to the primary judge were to the effect that the letters from Permanent to Mr Teves were couched in words that did not amount to   a claim nor an assertion of the breach of duty   but merely raised   the possibility of overvaluation  foreshadowing future action in the event of a shortfall     Permanent  No   at    It was put to his Honour that  as there was   no claim as such then pending   there was no basis for any claim to indemnity unless further events transpired or   crystallised     Permanent  No   at    His Honour referred to the decision of Lindgren J in FAI General Insurance Co Limited v McSweeney     ANZ Insurances Cases     at     that circumstances   may give rise to a claim   where the   bringing of a claim against the insured in respect of them was a  definite risk  or a  real possibility  or  on the cards     The primary judge concluded that it was reasonably arguable that Exclusion     had no operation  at least because of the lack of clarity in the letters as to whether any loss or damage would crystallise by way of actual sale of the properties in question   Permanent  No   at    On that basis  his Honour concluded that it was open to argument that Exclusion     may have no operation  In coming to that conclusion  based upon the crystallisation of the loss of damage  his Honour was considering a  Claim  that is in the sense of a bringing of a claim in the nature of an originating process  as in McSweeney    His Honour seems to have dealt compendiously with Claim and claim or  alternatively  dealt with the former but not with the latter  He relied on the absence of any sale of the properties the subject of ARMA s valuations prior to the commencement of the second policy   Permanent  No   at    His Honour recorded the insurers  contention that there was no liability under the second policy because of an absence of disclosure of the notifications by Permanent to Mr Teves   Permanent  No   at    His Honour did not consider the effect of those notifications on Exclusion      The insurers emphasise that this was not a question of disclosure but of awareness of circumstances  His Honour held that it was open to argument that the exclusion clause had no operation but that was in the context of whether loss or damage relevantly crystallised  That was relevant to whether a  Claim  might result but not a  claim  as defined in the policy  The next issue was whether  as submitted by Permanent  even if the notification did constitute knowledge of circumstances which might result in a   claim   s   of the Insurance Act operated to preclude the Insurers from relying on Exclusion      Section   of the Insurance Act provides        No other remedies     The provisions of this Division are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or incorrect statement  citedFishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd     ANZ Insurance Cases    The primary judge accepted that the threshold issue before him was whether the foreshadowed claim against the insurers was reasonably arguable  in the sense that it   could be seriously put     Permanent  No   at    His Honour also recognised that  as stated by Mason P  with whom Meagher and Handley JJ agreed  in Fishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd     ANZ Insurance Cases     the applicable principle is that even though an arguable case against an insurer is established  the Court is   seized of the discretion to grant leave    at   citing National Mutual Property Services  Australia  Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd     ALR   at    The insurer is at liberty to argue its right to disclaim liability in the proceedings which follow a grant of leave but   it does not follow   that a court that is positively satisfied of the insurer s entitlement to disclaim  after issue has been joined on that matter as between the plaintiff and the insurer  must exercise the discretion in favour of the grant of leave     Fishwives at   citedNational Mutual Property Services  Australia  Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd     ALR  The primary judge accepted that the threshold issue before him was whether the

ATC  The insurers relied upon Pech v Tilgals     ATC   where Dunford J considered a comparable if not identical clause to Exclusion     and held that it was not concerned with non disclosure because   the claims specified are excluded from the cover whether the circumstances are disclosed or not    at    The primary judge accepted that Pech was relevant to the second policy  However  his Honour concluded that Pech did not provide   sufficient bearing   on the circumstances in this case   Permanent  No   at    His Honour did not consider the impact of the reasoning in Pech on s    The primary judge seemed to accept that the applicable policy was the second policy  The insurers relied upon Exclusion     to   destroy   Permanent s case  The insurers asserted a complete defence to the cause of action because the letters from Permanent to Mr Teves constituted  by their content  circumstances of which  at the least  Mr Teves and ARMA ought reasonably to have realised to be circumstances which might result in or intimated   an assertion  allegation or complaint of any act or omission causing or potentially causing loss or damage   or   an intention to seek compensation  damages or other legal relief    The insurers assert that this was not a question of non disclosure because Exclusion     applies whether the circumstances are disclosed to the insurer or not  The primary judge did not consider the application of Exclusion     for other than non disclosure  whether a defence was thereby available and whether it was a total answer to the cause of action  The primary judge seemed to accept that the reasoning in Permanent v FAI applied with respect to s   the consequence being that the insurers could not rely on Exclusion      Permanent v FAI concerned a failure to disclose  The insurers  submission that Exclusion     is not relevantly concerned with a failure to disclose and that s   has no application was not dealt with  His Honour did not explain why the reasoning in Pech was not applicable consideredPermanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn essence it is submitted that there is no arguable case against the insurers  that they have been incorrectly joined in the proceedings and that the primary judge erred in joining the insurers and finding a reasonable cause of action against

is  in effect  a non disclosure clause for the purposes of s    The primary judge recognised that  in Permanent v FAI   Hodgson CJ in Eq was concerned with a claimed exclusion from liability for non disclosure and with whether the insured was aware of the circumstances which might give rise to a claim  In these circumstances  Hodgson CJ in Eq thought s   applied   Permanent  No   at   Permanent v
