austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html   That pursuant to Federal Magistrates Court Rule     the Respondent be found guilty of contempt of this Court for failing to comply with the order for discovery made by this Court on   July   in that it did not discover the full chain of email correspondence dated   December   variously between the Applicant and Ms Leesa Baker and then Ms Baker and Ms Hall and Ms Lindsay           FACTS       Because of the manner in which the Federal Magistrate decided the case  he did not need to set out a chronology of events  It is best to do so in order to deal with the issues on appeal  The following statement of facts is substantially drawn from the submissions for the appellant  I am satisfied the facts are properly based in the evidence  It needs to be borne in mind that it was only the appellant s evidence which was relevant  The appellant was entitled to have that evidence considered at its highest   May v O Sullivan   HCA         CLR   Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden   NSWCA         A Crim R   per Ipp AJA at      I shall discuss some of the evidence in more detail when considering the individual charges      The appellant commenced full time employment with the respondent as an accountant on   December    In December   the appellant was promoted to financial controller and received substantial pay increases during   and    In May   the appellant married  In November   the appellant became pregnant and in August   gave birth to her son  In November   during her maternity leave  the appellant met with Mr Stephen Byron  the respondent s Managing Director  and indicated that she would like to return to work in February   on a part time basis  Whilst Mr Byron said he would consider her request  the appellant was uneasy about the way in which he treated her  she generally considered that he had been evasive and was unlikely to accede to her request citedAustralasian Meat Industry Employees  Union and Others v Mudginberri Station Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The other two charges are different in nature as they involve alleged breaches of orders   cf Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union and Others v Mudginberri Station Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR     The subpoena in question was issued on   February   directing the respondent to produce the documents on   February   in the form described in paragraph       of these reasons  The full email chain containing six separate emails dated   December   was not produced  although two of those six emails were produced   The Federal Magistrate found that there was no prima facie case for the respondent to answer as the subpoena called for material from the server  not from the back up tapes  He said that there was no evidence that the email chain in question was on the respondent s server at the relevant time  He was not prepared to infer that the full email chain was still on the server in February   appliedHaw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor   AC   This is a circumstantial case  The Federal Magistrate was required to take into account all inferences most favourable to the appellant  which could reasonably be drawn from the primary facts  see the decision of the Privy Council in Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor   AC   at    In my opinion  it would not be possible  on the primary facts  to exclude the hypothesis that any destruction of the emails that took place was the result of actions by persons with no knowledge of the proceedings or potential proceedings or was a result of a procedure which did not take account of those proceedings  It is quite possible that a system could have existed which provided for the destruction of emails at fixed times during the year  at a particular length of time after an employee has left or as directed by some person in the administration or technology areas to suit the convenience of administration  In other words  any destruction may have been the result of a routine procedure  There is no inference available from the primary facts that would exclude that hypothesis unless there is speculation as to the circumstances of the alleged destruction   Counsel for the appellant referred to the evidence of Mr Ferraro that it was not usual commercial practice to delete a former employee s email mailbox if that employee had played an important role in the organisation  Even if that evidence were admissible  it would not say anything about the commercial practices of this respondent and would not assist in denying the hypotheses to which I have referred citedKrakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This analysis is a symptom of what appears to me to be an underlying problem  namely  that the party charged with interfering with the course of justice is a corporation with a number of employees carrying out a number of functions  The principles according to which a corporation can be guilty of contempt of court by interfering with the course of justice were not a topic raised below and only surfaced during the course of argument on this appeal  Even if a corporation can be guilty of such a charge  it is not legitimate to aggregate the knowledge of individuals and attribute the aggregated knowledge to the corporation   R v AC Hatrick Chemicals Pty Ltd     A Crim R   at   cf  in a different context  Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      In the present case  it is not possible to know who deleted the emails  that is if they were deleted  or on whose instructions the emails were deleted  That being the case  it is not possible to attribute to those persons the knowledge held by others within the organisation as to the actual or potential litigation  The relevant knowledge as to the litigation would have to be held by the representative of the corporation who was also responsible for the deletion  Further  that person would need to be the directing mind of the corporation for guilt of such a charge  in effect  a common law offence requiring mens rea  being attributed to the
