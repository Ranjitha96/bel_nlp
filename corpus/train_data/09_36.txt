FCAFC  htmlSubsection   relevantly provides that within   days of the magistrate s determination of eligibility under subs   of the Act  a person may apply to this Court  for a review of the order   The review is by way of rehearing  rather than the more restricted function the Court exercises when engaging in judicial review in the strict sense  see Brock v United States of America   FCAFC         FCR   per Black CJ at     Jacobson J at     and Rares J at      Subsection   relevantly provides that the Court may  by order  either confirm the order of the magistrate  or quash the order and direct a magistrate to order the release of the person  Pursuant to subs  d  the court to which the application is made shall have regard only to the material that was before the magistrate citedDavies v Flackett   RTR  In relation to the application of each of these provisions to the relevant conduct  the applicant made the following submissions  Dual Criminality of Category One  Section  BA Crimes Act         Section  BA requires the accused to have practised a deception  According to the translated copy of the Arrest Warrant  the co accused  El Najarin  signed the contract with Mobilcom  There is no allegation that the applicant had any personal dealings with Mobilcom  that could be considered to have been deceptive  Thus  there is no allegation that the applicant practised a deception     For s  BA to be satisfied  there must be a causal connection between the deception practised and the advantage obtained  There is no issue that a financial advantage was obtained but whether it be the   euros advance commission or the   euros discount in respect of the purchase price  they were both obtained prior to the registration of the SIM cards  and for that reason there can be no causal connection between the two     The registration of the SIM cards under false names could not constitute a relevant deception because registration occurred using a computer system called maui  The registration of the SIM cards occurred not through an employee of Mobilcom  where no person is deceived but rather a computer system  no criminal liability can attach  see In re Holmes     WLR       at     per Stanley Burnton J  Davies v Flackett   RTR   per Bridge J  Kennison v Daire     SASR   per O Loughlin J  a machine cannot be the subject of deception  cited with approval R v Baxter     Qd R     per Connolly J and R v Fischetti     FLR     at   per Gray J  In this context  the respondent may not place reliance upon the extended definition of deception in s  BA b  of the Crimes Act because there is no suggestion that the applicant or his co accused were not authorised to register SIM cards  On the contrary  it appears to have been the very purpose of the contract with Mobilcom  Therefore  the registration of the SIM cards was not a relevant deception for the purposes of s  BA   even if the data entered was  false    Section  A Crimes Act       In the alternative  the respondent submitted that the relevant conduct would be punishable under s  A Crimes Act   The respondent relied upon the receipt of what are termed  advance commission payments   However  there is no suggestion in the copy of the arrest warrant or indeed in any document whatsoever  that the applicant was to apply such advance commission payments in any particular way  that being a requirement of s  A  Overall  not one of the documents discloses the purpose of the advance commission payments  Although there is reference to such payments  the purported terms upon which such payments were purportedly made are not specified in any supporting document  Thus  there is insufficient information  upon which this Court could determine whether the conduct would also be punishable in New South Wales     Moreover  there is no allegation that the applicant collected  or even received  any moneys  Since the terms of the contract are not set out in any detail whatsoever  it may  for example  have been that Mobilcom was contractually bound to pay at a particular point in time  Where moneys have not in fact been received  there can be no liability under s  A Crimes Act    Section   Crimes Act       The respondent next contended that dual criminality is satisfied in respect of s    However  this argument suffers from the same defect as that relating to s  BA  Firstly  the respondent suggests that the false pretence was the  fraudulent registration  of the mobile telephones  However  there is no suggestion whatsoever that the act of registration was done in order to obtain the telephones  and nor could it be  since they were all obtained much earlier  Indeed  such a suggestion would be absurd  since the phones would have to have been already in the possession of Pluscall  before they could be registered  For liability to attach  the false pretence must occur before the property is obtained  R v Steels     JP       Insofar as the respondent relies upon the concluding of the contract with Mobilcom  this too cannot found the basis for criminal liability  since there is no allegation that the applicant made any false pretence  Furthermore  there is no allegation that the respondent  obtained any property  as required by s    At best  the company  Pluscall  obtained the property  Again  there could be no conviction pursuant to s   for the conduct alleged   Section  A Crimes Act       Where a person is charged with an offence contrary to s  A    the prosecution  must  prove that the  accused  used dishonest means to prejudice the rights of such a person in his or her dealings with  the body corporate  Spies v The Queen   HCA         CLR       at   per Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  As set out in respect of s  BA   there is no allegation that the respondent employed such dishonest means  Accordingly  double criminality would not be satisfied in respect of s  A    Dual Criminality of Category Two      In relation to the final offence  the respondent again relies upon s  BA of the Crimes Act   However  as before  there is absolutely no allegation that the applicant dealt with MCI  except in relation to the alleged provision of purportedly false bank  bail bonds  a translation that is patently incorrect and inadequate  The word used in the original German document is  B rgschaft  which correctly translates into English as  guarantee   Notwithstanding that  and any other possible errors  absent an allegation that the applicant practised a particularised deception upon MCI  upon which it relied  the applicant could not be guilty of an offence contrary to s  BA      Reliance is also placed upon the fact that minutes were transferred to a company in Germany by Star Way Com  However  there is no allegation that this fact would in any way have impacted upon MCI s willingness to provide telephone minutes  upon condition that it is paid  Thus  this act cannot be said to be causal in respect of the granting of a financial advantage     Thus  the only conduct  which might be said to be relevant  would appear to be the provision of the forged guarantees  However  the purported copy of the arrest warrant  and of course its translation  is  once again  inadequately vague  It merely states   The accused person as well as Houggati and Mohamed Kazzaz then provided as a security for the present and future demands of MCI from Star Way Com a forged bail bond      Once again  here the word  demands  is quite misleading  The word  F rderungen  in the original German correctly translates to  claims  in the sense of legal claims  Apart from that  the warrant fails to disclose the precise conduct  which is alleged against the respondent  Did the applicant  in fact  provide the guarantee  Did he provide the guarantee to someone else  who  in turn  provided it to MCI  In particular  there is no allegation whatsoever that the applicant knew that the guarantee was forged  Compare Linhart v Elms     ALR       per Foster J    Although sub subpara  c  clearly does not require that the whole of the available evidentiary material be laid before the magistrate in Australia  it does  in my view  at least require that precise allegations of the  manner and means  of the making of the basic fraudulent representations be provided      Section     of the Criminal Code suffers from the same problems  Additionally  the offence would not apply  had the same conduct occurred in Australia  In order to satisfy the provision  the person must obtain a gain from a  carriage service provider   That term is  in turn  defined by s   of the Telecommunications Act    Cth  to include persons providing a  listed carriage service  a term defined by s   of the Act  These provisions demonstrate that there must be at least one point of connection with Australia  Since  the warrant does not allege that MCI had any connection with Germany  the conduct would not fall within s     citedHarris v Attorney General

provide the guarantee  Did he provide the guarantee to someone else who in turn provided it to MCI  In particular  it is said that there is no allegation whatsoever that the applicant knew that the guarantee was forged  Reference was made to what was said in Linhart v Elms     ALR       per Foster J  On my reading of the Arrest Warrant  there is no doubt that it alleges that the applicant  together with the others named  provided the bail bond  guarantee  to MCI  and not to some third party that provided it to MCI  It is true that there is no specific allegation that the applicant knew that the bail bond  guarantee  was forged  but the implication is self evident  I am of the view that the dual criminality requirement of subs  c  of the Act in relation to the Category Two Offence is satisfied by recourse to s  BA of the Crimes Act  citedR v Baxter     Qd R  In relation to the application of each of these provisions to the relevant conduct  the applicant made the following submissions  Dual Criminality of Category One  Section  BA Crimes Act         Section  BA requires the accused to have practised a deception  According to the translated copy of the Arrest Warrant  the co accused  El Najarin  signed the contract with Mobilcom  There is no allegation that the applicant had any personal dealings with Mobilcom  that could be considered to have been deceptive  Thus  there is no allegation that the applicant practised a deception     For s  BA to be satisfied  there must be a causal connection between the deception practised and the advantage obtained  There is no issue that a financial advantage was obtained but whether it be the   euros advance commission or the   euros discount in respect of the purchase price  they were both obtained prior to the registration of the SIM cards  and for that reason there can be no causal connection between the two     The registration of the SIM cards under false names could not constitute a relevant deception because registration occurred using a computer system called maui  The registration of the SIM cards occurred not through an employee of Mobilcom  where no person is deceived but rather a computer system  no criminal liability can attach  see In re Holmes     WLR       at     per Stanley Burnton J  Davies v Flackett   RTR   per Bridge J  Kennison v Daire     SASR   per O Loughlin J  a machine cannot be the subject of deception  cited with approval R v Baxter     Qd R     per Connolly J and R v Fischetti     FLR     at   per Gray J  In this context  the respondent may not place reliance upon the extended definition of deception in s  BA b  of the Crimes Act because there is no suggestion that the applicant or his co accused were not authorised to register SIM cards  On the contrary  it appears to have been the very purpose of the contract with Mobilcom  Therefore  the registration of the SIM cards was not a relevant deception for the purposes of s  BA   even if the data entered was  false    Section  A Crimes Act       In the alternative  the respondent submitted that the relevant conduct would be punishable under s  A Crimes Act   The respondent relied upon the receipt of what are termed  advance commission payments   However  there is no suggestion in the copy of the arrest warrant or indeed in any document whatsoever  that the applicant was to apply such advance commission payments in any particular way  that being a requirement of s  A  Overall  not one of the documents discloses the purpose of the advance commission payments  Although there is reference to such payments  the purported terms upon which such payments were purportedly made are not specified in any supporting document  Thus  there is insufficient information  upon which this Court could determine whether the conduct would also be punishable in New South Wales     Moreover  there is no allegation that the applicant collected  or even received  any moneys  Since the terms of the contract are not set out in any detail whatsoever  it may  for example  have been that Mobilcom was contractually bound to pay at a particular point in time  Where moneys have not in fact been received  there can be no liability under s  A Crimes Act    Section   Crimes Act       The respondent next contended that dual criminality is satisfied in respect of s    However  this argument suffers from the same defect as that relating to s  BA  Firstly  the respondent suggests that the false pretence was the  fraudulent registration  of the mobile telephones  However  there is no suggestion whatsoever that the act of registration was done in order to obtain the telephones  and nor could it be  since they were all obtained much earlier  Indeed  such a suggestion would be absurd  since the phones would have to have been already in the possession of Pluscall  before they could be registered  For liability to attach  the false pretence must occur before the property is obtained  R v Steels     JP       Insofar as the respondent relies upon the concluding of the contract with Mobilcom  this too cannot found the basis for criminal liability  since there is no allegation that the applicant made any false pretence  Furthermore  there is no allegation that the respondent  obtained any property  as required by s    At best  the company  Pluscall  obtained the property  Again  there could be no conviction pursuant to s   for the conduct alleged   Section  A Crimes Act       Where a person is charged with an offence contrary to s  A    the prosecution  must  prove that the  accused  used dishonest means to prejudice the rights of such a person in his or her dealings with  the body corporate  Spies v The Queen   HCA         CLR       at   per Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  As set out in respect of s  BA   there is no allegation that the respondent employed such dishonest means  Accordingly  double criminality would not be satisfied in respect of s  A    Dual Criminality of Category Two      In relation to the final offence  the respondent again relies upon s  BA of the Crimes Act   However  as before  there is absolutely no allegation that the applicant dealt with MCI  except in relation to the alleged provision of purportedly false bank  bail bonds  a translation that is patently incorrect and inadequate  The word used in the original German document is  B rgschaft  which correctly translates into English as  guarantee   Notwithstanding that  and any other possible errors  absent an allegation that the applicant practised a particularised deception upon MCI  upon which it relied  the applicant could not be guilty of an offence contrary to s  BA      Reliance is also placed upon the fact that minutes were transferred to a company in Germany by Star Way Com  However  there is no allegation that this fact would in any way have impacted upon MCI s willingness to provide telephone minutes  upon condition that it is paid  Thus  this act cannot be said to be causal in respect of the granting of a financial advantage     Thus  the only conduct  which might be said to be relevant  would appear to be the provision of the forged guarantees  However  the purported copy of the arrest warrant  and of course its translation  is  once again  inadequately vague  It merely states   The accused person as well as Houggati and Mohamed Kazzaz then provided as a security for the present and future demands of MCI from Star Way Com a forged bail bond      Once again  here the word  demands  is quite misleading  The word  F rderungen

the applicant  in fact  provide the guarantee  Did he provide the guarantee to someone else  who  in turn  provided it to MCI  In particular  there is no allegation whatsoever that the applicant knew that the guarantee was forged  Compare Linhart v Elms     ALR       per Foster J    Although sub subpara  c  clearly does not require that the whole of the available evidentiary material be laid before the magistrate in Australia  it does  in my view  at least require that precise allegations of the  manner and means  of the making of the basic fraudulent representations be provided      Section     of the Criminal Code suffers from the same problems  Additionally  the offence would not apply  had the same conduct occurred in Australia  In order to satisfy the provision  the person must obtain a gain from a  carriage service provider   That term is  in turn  defined by s   of the Telecommunications Act    Cth  to include persons providing a  listed carriage service  a term defined by s   of the Act  These provisions demonstrate that there must be at least one point of connection with Australia  Since  the warrant does not allege that MCI had any connection with Germany
