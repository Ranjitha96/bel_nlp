of South Australia   HCA         CLR   at   where his Honour said     In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show   that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case  in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief    that he will

Supreme Court  see s   of the IR Act  referred toFrancome and Another v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd and Others     All ER   The Court is satisfied that the balance of convenience or the  balance of justice   see Donaldson MR in Francome and Another v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd and Others     All ER   at   is in favour of the relief sought being declined referred toLinfield Linen Pty Ltd v Nejain     SR  NSW    It does not follow that the Court is required as of course  to grant an interlocutory injunction if a claim is made that is merely arguable  Despite the submissions of Senior Counsel for Tristar concerning the effect of the Terms of Reference  particularly the submission claiming that the first term was directed at the employer and employee relationship within Tristar  I am not satisfied that Tristar has established a   fair prima facie case and a fair probability of being able to succeed in that case at the hearing    see Roper CJ in Linfield Linen Pty Ltd v Nejain     SR  NSW    at     The Court has considered the submission of Tristar and critically examined the findings of the Commission concerning the effect of s   of the WPR Act arising from such examination  The effect of s   of the WPR Act is arguable  but the Court is unable to draw the conclusion to the requisite standard to justify the grant of injunctive relief  That is  the Court is not satisfied that there is a  probability  that Tristar will succeed on this question  Accordingly  the Court finds that a serious question to be tried  as that term has been interpreted by the above authorities  has not been established   In determining the harm that might be sustained by Mr Hong if the injunction is not granted  the evidence adduced by Mr Hong must be considered  Relevantly  his affidavit states such alleged prejudice as follows       I reside and work in Adelaide  South Australia  Although I am required to travel during the course of my employment  it is difficult for me to perform my duties as a Managing Director of the Arrowcrest Group if I am required to give evidence in Sydney on   March         The Arrowcrest Group conducts a large business and many negotiations occur with respect to potential contracts and deals within and outside of Australia I am most concerned about being compelled to give evidence before the Inquiry in that I may be forced to reveal information or produce documents on behalf of Tristar that are of a commercially confidential nature  This could result in Tristar specifically and the Arrowcrest Group generally suffering detriment       On or about   February   the Office of Workplace Services commenced a prosecution against Tristar in the Federal Court of Australia alleging a number of issues including that Tristar has  injured  their workers because of an alleged failure to provide work to these workers  The prosecution before the Federal Court deals with many similar issues as those encompassed in the terms of reference and therefore I am concerned that being compelled to give evidence in the Inquiry could prejudice Tristar s position  consideredNew South Wales v Commonwealth     ALJR   In particular  Tristar submits that the Commission erred in holding that the word  apply  in s   operated to limit the words  in relation to  to those State Industrial Laws which created rights and obligations  Tristar submits that the words  in relation to  contained in s   of the WPR Act apply to industrial matters broadly and are not merely confined to matters relating to employer and employee relations  Tristar submits that s  a  would be constitutionally invalid if the words  in relation to  were not read down  see     and that the decision of the Commission is contrary to the decision of the finding of the High Court of Australia in New South Wales v Commonwealth     ALJR   especially at   to   distinguishedRe Cortaus  in Liq  Sheahan v Joye   Ors  No        ACSR   As to the balance of convenience  it is submitted that only Mr Hong seeks relief by restraining the Commission from calling upon the summons to give evidence  In support of its application  Tristar relies upon the decision of Branson J in Re Cortaus  in Liq  Sheahan v Joye   Ors  No        ACSR   at     wherein her Honour determined that requiring a person to attend an examination and compulsorily give evidence under oath constituted an infringement of his or her civil liberties   As to the balance of convenience  the Minister submits that the decision in Re Cortaus   ACSR   was distinguished by Edmond J on the ground that the summonsed parties in Cortaus   ACSR   were parties to the proceeding itself   The inconvenience to Mr Hong in travelling to New South Wales to answer the summons can be readily disregarded and it is not seriously advanced as a reason relating to the balance of convenience  The Court also gives negligible weight to the consideration that Mr Hong might find it difficult to perform his duties  However the necessity to answer questions and divulge information is relied upon  As was pointed out by Edmonds J  the summonsed parties in Re Cortaus   ACSR    were parties to the proceeding itself   see Tristar Steering   FCA    His Honour was clearly mindful that the summonsed parties were parties to the appeal pending before the Full Court  Such consideration may have substantially dissipated in view of the leave granted to join Mr Hong as a party to the application   Despite this amendment  I consider that the decision of Branson J in Re Cortaus   ACSR   is distinguishable  Unlike the facts relied upon for the relief claimed in that decision Mr Hong has not complained that his civil liberties might be infringed  Rather his claim for relief is based on entirely different grounds  namely his concern   about being compelled to give evidence before the Inquiry in that I may be forced to reveal information or produce documents on behalf of Tristar that are of a commercially confidential nature    Mr Hong was also concerned that he might be required to reveal information concerning other litigation before this Court which could   prejudice Tristar s position   referred toTesco Supermarkets Limited v Nattrass   UKHL       AC   Since Mr Hong was not a party to the proceedings before Edmonds J  the Court on this application has approached the issue of the claim for relief as an entirely new matter  even though Mr Hong has been intimately involved  as Managing Director  in the management of Tristar and as such may be assumed to have been the  mind of the company   see  Tesco Supermarkets Limited v Nattrass   UKHL       AC   at    As a consequence  it becomes unnecessary for the Court to determine whether the relief claimed in paragraph   of the application before Edmonds J is the same or substantially the same as the relief now claimed  The Court observes that there is a difference only to the extent that the parties were different before his Honour and the prayer for relief before his Honour as set out in Order   thereof sought to restrain the issue of any summons  whereas the relief now claimed seeks to restrain the Commission from calling upon the summons   There is one aspect of his Honour s judgment however which is significant  and which would apply with the same effect in relation to the present application  namely the finding at paragraph   as follows     Moreover  there is no issue that the Commission s report to the Minister cannot affect the legal rights and obligations of Tristar    Based upon the available evidence  the same observation applies with equal force to Mr Hong   For the reasons referred to above  the Court in the exercise of its discretion  declines to grant the relief claimed by the applicants   I certify

came on before Edmonds J who refused such relief  see Tristar Steering   Suspension Australia Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of NSW   FCA     On   March   a Summons to Give Evidence  the summons  addressed to Mr Cheng Hong  the Managing Director of Tristar  was issued pursuant to s  b  of the IR Act  The summons was served upon Mr Hong in Sydney  The present application for injunctive relief and for the joinder of Mr Hong was filed on   March    During the hearing an order was made that Mr Hong be joined as an applicant  For convenience  when both applicants are referred to hereafter they shall be referred to as  Tristar    Tristar claims that there is a serious question to be tried which it articulates as follows     Is the exercise by the Commission of its function of inquiry under s  d  of the Industrial Relations Act    NSW  in relation to the first term of reference an operation of a  State Industrial Law   as defined in s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth  which has the effect that the State Industrial Law would  otherwise apply in relation to an employee or employer  within the meaning of s   of the Workplace Relations Act       Tristar also submits that Edmonds J did not determine whether there was a serious question to be tried but dismissed the proceedings before him on the grounds that the balance of convenience did not justify the grant of the injunction sought   Mr Hong submits that his rights and liabilities may be infringed because he is required to attend before the Commission and give evidence and that the failure to comply with the summons exposes him to potential fines and penalties as provided by s   of the IR Act   The Minister submits that Edmonds J has already determined whether interlocutory relief should be granted  by refusing the application before him  Tristar had sought an order restraining the Commission from issuing any summons to produce documents  The Minister says that the summonses foreshadowed in the proceedings before Edmonds J have now issued  Further  although Mr Hong is now a party  and was at all material times  the corporate mind of Tristar as its Managing Director  there are no materially changed circumstances which would justify the Court entertaining the present application  see BP Chemicals ANZ Pty Limited v Manildra Starches Pty Limited   FCA     Contrary to the submissions of the applicants the Minster submits that Edmonds J did make a determination that there was no serious question to be tried as stated in paragraph   of his Honour s judgment where his Honour said     In the limited time I have had to read and consider the Commission s decision and hear Tristar s Senior Counsel s submissions as to the arguable errors in the Commission s process of reasoning  I am not persuaded that the Commission s decision on both the jurisdictional application and the stay application is wrong   His Honour s reference to the balance of convenience thereafter merely showed that he was considering the necessary issues raised by the application before him  The Minister relies upon the submissions he made before Edmonds J  which  in substance  seek to demonstrate that the WPR Act does not operate to exclude the jurisdiction of the Commission to undertake its functions pursuant s  d  of the IR Act  and that the decision of the Commission is correct   Tristar has raised extensive submissions both before the Commission and before Edmonds J in support of its contention that s   of the WPR Act operates to invalidate the Inquiry because of the introduction of s   of the WPR Act  Only if the Court comes to the conclusion that there is a   sufficient likelihood of success    see O Neill     ALR   in Tristar s case should the Court then consider granting an interlocutory injunction  The Court is required to scrutinise the claim to satisfy itself at least that there is a  likelihood of success  before proceeding to grant such relief  In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   Gleeson CJ at   said     In McCarty v North Sydney Municipal Council   the Chief Judge in Equity described the proposition that a plaintiff seeking an interlocutory injunction must show at least a probability that he will succeed in establishing his title to the relief sought at the final hearing as  so well established that no authority is really needed in support of it    The inconvenience to Mr Hong in travelling to New South Wales to answer the summons can be readily disregarded and it is not seriously advanced
