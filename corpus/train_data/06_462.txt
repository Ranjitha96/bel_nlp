In the Matter of Piccoli Tesori Pty Ltd  Deregistered  Ex parte  Bertuol   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toCasali v Crisp   NSWSC         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  It may be accepted that the fact that a person is a shareholder  or a director  of a deregistered company does not in itself establish that person to be a  person aggrieved  for the purpose of s  AH  of the Act  However  a shareholder who is a creditor of the company who could have expected payment of the debt in whole or in part  or who had an expectation of a distribution from surplus assets or a dividend from retained profits would be a person prejudicially affected by deregistration of the company and  therefore  a  person aggrieved    See  Casali v Crisp   NSWSC         FLR   per Young CJ in Equity at       The company has assets that exceed its liabilities  the net worth of the company being represented in substantial measure by undistributed profits  A shareholder in the company  therefore  has an expectation of the distribution of a dividend from the retained profits and is a person aggrieved by deregistration of the company  an event that has removed that expectation and has vested the property of the company in ASIC for ASIC to dispose of  and deal with  as it sees fit pursuant to s  AE a  of the Act   I am satisfied that it is appropriate that Mr Bertuol be substituted for the company as plaintiff in the matter referred toGA   RJ Elliot Pty Ltd  formerly a company  Ex parte Mitcham     ACLR   The provisions of s  AH  suggest that the Act has continued to recognise that a deregistered company has sufficient existence for the purpose of making an application under s  AH  as a  person aggrieved  notwithstanding that under s  AD  the company  cease d  to exist  upon deregistration   See  GA   RJ Elliot Pty Ltd  formerly a company  Ex parte Mitcham     ACLR   per Young CJ at   CTG Pty Ltd v Yamamori  Hong Kong  Pty Ltd     ACSR      The terms of s  AH  are consistent with a statutory form of a  nunc pro tunc  order  That is to say the Act contemplates that an order under s  AH  will have a retrospective effect that makes good the deregistered company s standing to make the application  There are no authorities directly on point  It may be accepted that the deregistered company has no standing to commence other proceedings   See  Sweeney   Vandeleur Pty Ltd v BNY Australia Ltd     ACSR   referred toGIS Electrical Pty Ltd v Melsom   WASCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  html  In the absence of any material that suggests that the legislature identified and sought to remedy a mischief that had arisen out of a company being permitted to apply for reinstatement of its registration there seems to be no reason to apply a restrictive interpretation to the term  person aggrieved  as used in s  AH a i   Apart from the historical context referred to above the term is an expression of wide import that is not to be given a restrictive interpretation   See  GIS Electrical Pty Ltd v Melsom   WASCA         FLR   per Steytler J at      If the proper construction of the Act is as I have posited the company would have capacity to make an application as a  person aggrieved    Putting to one side for the moment the question whether the Act contemplates that a deregistered company has capacity to make an application under s  AH  there would seem to be adequate grounds in this case to conclude that by the company being subjected to deregistration when it was successfully carrying on business it became a person  aggrieved  for the purpose of s  AH   Indeed s  AB  does not empower ASIC to deregister a company unless it has no reason to believe that the company is carrying on business  Although the subsequently enacted  AB A  empowers ASIC to deregister a company that has defaulted in paying  review fees  without qualifying that power by requiring ASIC not have reason to believe that the company is carrying on business  that provision does not detract from the foregoing argument   To avoid doubt as to whether the company has the capacity to make application under s  AH a i  Mr Bertuol now seeks to be substituted for the company as plaintiff in this matter referred toCTG Pty Ltd v Yamamori  Hong Kong  Pty Ltd     ACSR   The provisions of s  AH  suggest that the Act has continued to recognise that a deregistered company has sufficient existence for the purpose of making an application under s  AH  as a  person aggrieved  notwithstanding that under s  AD  the company  cease d  to exist  upon deregistration   See  GA   RJ Elliot Pty Ltd  formerly a company  Ex parte Mitcham     ACLR   per Young CJ at   CTG Pty Ltd v Yamamori  Hong Kong  Pty Ltd

makes good the deregistered company s standing to make the application  There are no authorities directly on point  It may be accepted that the deregistered company has no standing to commence other proceedings   See  Sweeney   Vandeleur Pty Ltd v BNY Australia Ltd     ACSR   referred toRe L Carroll Ltd     NZLR   The respective legislative provisions acknowledged however  that a deregistered company had capacity to make application for the restoration of registration  notwithstanding the cessation of existence of the company   See  Re L Carroll Ltd     NZLR   per O Regan J at   referred toSweeney   Vandeleur Pty Ltd v BNY Australia Ltd     ACSR   The provisions of s  AH  suggest that the Act has continued to recognise that a deregistered company has sufficient existence for the
