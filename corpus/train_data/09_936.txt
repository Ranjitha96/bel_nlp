SZMRS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedHabib v Director General of Security   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlNotwithstanding the absence of such an opportunity to respond to the additional concerns of the Tribunal  it is nevertheless considered that there has been no denial of procedural fairness such as to warrant the Tribunal decision being set aside  The Applicant was clearly on notice that the Tribunal had considerable reservation in respect to letters such as the ones upon which he sought to rely  The opportunity was extended to him to advance such submissions in respect to this more generally expressed concern in such manner as he saw fit and to advance such further evidence as he considered appropriate  The additional factors relied upon by the Tribunal were but further factors in support of a conclusion that letters such as the June   letter were to be given little  if any  weight  A necessity to expressly raise with the Applicant the more specific concerns of the Tribunal may have arisen had the Tribunal sought to rely on those concerns for a purpose other than supporting its conclusion as to the weight to be given to the letter  Albeit arising in the context of an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  such was the concern of the Full Court in Habib v Director General of Security   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       FCR   at   per Black CJ  Ryan and Lander JJ  It is not incumbent upon the Tribunal to bring to the attention of a party before it each and every particular concern it may have in respect to a particular document such as the June   letter  To do so would be to come perilously close to  if not to trespass into  a requirement that the Tribunal expose its tentative reasoning process for scrutiny prior to decision  The opportunity guaranteed by s   of the   Act   to give evidence and present arguments   like the content of the rules of natural justice   Habib  supra   at     FCR at   per Black CJ  Ryan and Lander JJ  is to be interpreted and applied in a   practical   manner  Although reservation is expressed as to the manner in which the learned Magistrate reached her conclusion  it is not considered that the Tribunal denied the Applicant procedural fairness  Concurrence is expressed with the conclusion as ultimately reached by the Federal Magistrate  It follows that the Application for an extension of time should be granted but that the Appeal should be dismissed  There is no reason why costs should not follow the event appliedJess v Scott     FCR  An extension of time may be granted where there are   special reasons   O   r    When considering this provision in Jess v Scott     FCR     Lockhart  Sheppard and Burchett JJ observed at     What is needed to justify an extension of time is indicated in r   by the words  for special reasons   It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed  though filed after the expiry of twenty one days  In that context  the expression  special reasons  is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty one days  But it may be so distinguished  not necessarily will  for the rule gives a discretion  wherever the court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case  Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary  We do not think the use of the expression  for special reasons  implies something narrower than this consideredMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK   FCAFC     Emmett  Kenny and Jacobson JJ reviewed the constraints imposed by s  B of the Migration Act    Cth   the   Act  being a provision contained in Part   Division   of that Act  In doing so they observed that   there was nothing in Division   to indicate that any of the procedural powers contained in it were to be used fairly   and that   it was possible that those powers could be used in ways that were not fair  without infringing the procedural requirements of Division       FCAFC   at     Their Honours further observed      While the Tribunal has a duty to raise clearly with an applicant the critical issues on which a review may depend  there is no general rule that the Tribunal cannot make a finding that a document is not genuine without specifically referring to its concerns about the document  The circumstances may be such that the Tribunal had sufficiently alerted an applicant to the doubts it had about the genuineness of all documents that the applicant had submitted  While a finding of forgery should not be lightly made  the circumstances of a particular case may be such that it would be unnecessary to afford a person affected by such a conclusion the opportunity of dealing with it  The decision of the Full Court in WACO s Case turned upon the application of well known and established principles to the particular and peculiar circumstances of that case   VAAD v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at      WACO s Case does not establish any new principle   Because the June   letter was forwarded after the conclusion of the hearing  no opportunity thus presented itself to the Tribunal to confront the Applicant with those further concerns that emerged during the preparation of its reasons for decision  unless the Tribunal chose to convene a further hearing  But no generally expressed   unfairness   arose as a result of the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded and no jurisdictional error is exposed  Considerations as to whether a document is a forgery or whether there are other reasons why a document should be given little or no weight may presently be left to one side  Of present relevance is the fact that the Applicant had been   sufficiently alerted   by the Tribunal as to its concerns in respect to documents such as the June   letter  To go further and impose upon the Tribunal a requirement to alert the Applicant to each and every factor which may weigh upon the Tribunal when assessing the weight to be given to that letter would be to impose a requirement to disclose its deliberative process appliedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIf the weight to be

Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIt has been further observed that    t he discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the court to do justice between the parties   WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Lee  Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ  The discretion to grant an extension of time is obviously not confined to those circumstances in which an appeal would thereafter succeed  An extension may be granted where  to do justice between the parties  the Court should consider and resolve a case on its merits rather than resolving it by reference to a failure to comply with a procedural requirement  In circumstances such as the present  where it is considered that an applicant seeking an extension of time has a case of some merit  where the extent of the delay is minimal and where no prejudice has been occasioned to the respondent  an extension of time should normally be granted  In the present proceeding  an extension of time is granted pursuant to O   r   extending the time within which a Notice of Appeal may be filed to   April    The draft of the proposed Notice of Appeal as filed on that date is to be treated as the Notice of Appeal  citedWAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlBefore the Federal Magistrate it was contended that the June   letter provided corroborative evidence and had been rejected upon a   positive basis   which had not been put to the Applicant  In advancing this contention  reliance was placed upon the following observations of French J  as His Honour then was  in WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA       Corroborative evidence may be rejected as of no weight because it is dependent upon and can be shown to be undermined by findings as to the tendering party s credibility  In such a case a failure to put to the tendering party that the evidence may be so regarded cannot constitute a breach of procedural fairness  This is just a special case of the general proposition that procedural fairness does not require the decision maker  in this case the Tribunal  to invite comment upon its thought processes on the way to its decision  But where corroborative evidence is rejected on the basis of a finding of fraud or forgery or on some other positive basis which has never been put to the tendering party there may be a failure of procedural fairness  Such a failure may have very practical effects for it means that the corroborative material is never weighed in the balance of the general assessment of the tendering party s credibility  The Federal Magistrate concluded      The June   Letter clearly contained a spelling mistake in its last sentence and the name of the author was spelt differently in the June   Letter  Whilst the Tribunal stated that it did not give the June   Letter any weight and stated that the June   Letter was   dubious in other ways   the Tribunal referred in particular to the blacked out banner and the spelling mistakes  Certainly  it was open to the Tribunal to have regard to the spelling mistakes in characterising the letter as   dubious    The blacked out banner  whilst forming part of the Tribunal s expression that the June   Letter was   dubious   did not cause the Tribunal to find that the June   Letter was a forgery  Rather  the weight given by the Tribunal to the content of the June   Letter provided no support to the   genuineness   of the Applicant s claims that his father was a vice president of the local Awami League     In the circumstances  I am satisfied that the consideration by the Tribunal of the June   Letter did not reflect a positive finding that the document was not genuine  Rather  the June   Letter was simply a document that the Tribunal did not find provided any further corroborative evidence in respect of the Applicant s claims  With great respect to the learned Federal Magistrate  any conclusion as to whether or not there has been jurisdictional error by reason of a denial of procedural fairness is not to be confined to those circumstances where there has been   a positive finding that  a  document was not genuine    If the weight to be given to any particular document or letter is to be affected by reasons other than those previously canvassed during the hearing  it is obviously a far preferable course for those other reasons to be disclosed and an opportunity expressly provided to respond to those reasons  Once such an opportunity has been provided  it is thereafter a matter for the Tribunal alone to give to the evidence before it such weight as it sees fit   Minister for
