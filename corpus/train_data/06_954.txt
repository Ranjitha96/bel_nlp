within s  iii  see ALRC Report at      There is  therefore  jurisdiction encompassed within the reach of s  iii  which Parliament has not conferred on federal courts and invested in State courts as

pilotage that was carried out by the pilot  The claim can be directed at the ship because it is a claim against the relevant person who is asserted to be responsible by law for the pilot s default  The direction of the claim against the defendant does not make the claim any less in respect of the pilotage of the ship that was undertaken  than it would have been if made against the pilot

cases such as The  Vera Cruz   No       PD   and Currie v McKnight   AC   appear on their own facts to require a close and direct connection between the damage and the ship as an instrument  Lord Diplock approved these cases in The  Eschersheim    but factually applied the phrase more broadly than perhaps was done in those cases  A similarly somewhat broader approach can also be found in The  Industrie    LR   A   E   The  Chr Knudsen    P   and the The  Minerva    P     The need in the cases for the direct connection and for the ship to be somehow the instrument of the damage can be seen in Currie v McKnight where damage was caused to a ship by the crew of another ship cutting the mooring lines linking two ships in order to allow their ship to depart  The first ship  after the mooring lines were cut  was unable to get a head of steam up in time and was driven ashore  The court said that the damage to that ship was caused by the human acts of the crew of the other ship alone and not by the ship on which they were aboard when they cut the lines  This was so  even though what they did was in connection with the operation of taking that other ship to sea  One can see both closer notions of causation than perhaps are current today and the echo of the personification theory in the need for the ship itself to be the active or noxious instrument to be operative considerations see for instance Lord Halsbury LC in Currie v McKnight at     The phrase that it must be the fault of the ship itself is not a mere figurative expression  but it imports  in my opinion  that the ship against which a maritime lien for damages is claimed is the instrument of mischief  and that in order to establish the liability of the ship itself to the maritime lien claimed some act of navigation of the ship itself should either mediately or immediately be the cause of the damage     footnotes omitted   In this respect  see Toh  K S op cit at   referred toCyber Sea Technologies Inc v

Scofield     Lloyd s Rep    discussedDe Lovio v Boit   F Cas     This view had its roots in the seminal decision of Story J sitting as a Circuit Judge in De Lovio v Boit   F Cas     in rejecting the view that had up to that point been expressed as to the linkage of the phrase  of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  in Article III section   of the United States Constitution to the character and content of English jurisdiction at the time of Independence  see for example United States v McGill   US     at      Washington J sitting as a Circuit Judge   Nevertheless  as can be seen from all the judgments in the Federal Court and the High Court in The  Shin Kobe Maru    the discerned width and scope of s  iii  was a product of the liberal construction of a provision of the Australian Constitution   though set against a context of the recognised international character of the jurisdiction amongst maritime nations of the world as incorporated in the United States Constitution   from which source  Article III Section   the words of s  iii  were taken   The rich international character of the jurisdiction can be seen in the expression of the scope of the jurisdiction by Story J in De Lovio v Boit at       The clause however of the Constitution not only confers Admiralty jurisdiction  but the word  maritime  is superadded  seemingly ex industria  to remove every latent doubt   Cases of maritime jurisdiction  must include all maritime contracts  torts and injuries  which are in the understanding of the common law  as well as of the Admiralty   causae civiles et maritimae   In this view there is a peculiar propriety in the incorporation of the term  maritime  into the Constitution   The disputes and discussions  respecting what the Admiralty jurisdiction was  could not but be well known to the framers of that instrument     One party sought to limit it by locality  another by the subject matter  It was wise  therefore  to dissipate all question by giving cognisance of all  cases of maritime jurisdiction  or  what is precisely equivalent  of all maritime cases  Upon any other construction  the word  maritime  would be mere tautology  but in this sense it has a peculiar and appropriate force     The language of the constitution will therefore warrant the most liberal interpretation  and it may not be unfit to hold  that it had reference to that maritime jurisdiction  which commercial convenience  public policy  and national rights  have contributed to establish  with slight local differences  over all Europe  that jurisdiction  which under the name of consular courts  first established itself upon the shores of the Mediterranean  and  from the general equity and simplicity of its proceedings  soon commended itself to all the maritime states  that jurisdiction  in short  which collecting the wisdom of the civil law  and combining it with the customs and usages of the sea  produced the venerable Consolato del Mare  and still continues in its decisions to regulate the commerce  the intercourse and the warfare of mankind              At all events  there is no solid reason for construing the terms of the Constitution in a narrow and limited sense  or for ingrafting upon them the restrictions of English statutes  or decisions at common law founded on those statutes  which were sometimes dictated by jealousy  and sometimes by misapprehension  which are often contradictory  and rarely supported by any consistent principle  The advantages resulting to the commerce and navigation of the United States  from a uniformity of rules and decisions in all maritime questions  authorise us to believe that national policy  as well as juridical logic  require the clause of the Constitution to be so construed as to embrace all maritime contracts  torts and injuries  or  in other words  to embrace all those causes  which originally and inherently belonged to the Admiralty  before any statutable restriction   It will be necessary to return to aspects of s    For present purposes  it is only necessary to emphasise that it was not intended that the closed lists in s   and   would exhaust the scope of s  iii   Rather  the lists of claims were those which  conformably with the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Arrest of Sea Going Ships done at Brussels on   May    the   Arrest Convention  and with comparative international admiralty practice of major trading partners  were seen to be appropriate to found the procedure central to Admiralty practice  the action in rem  and the consequential availability of arrest   For instance  there would seem little doubt that one class of maritime contracts concerned with maritime commerce is marine insurance  Indeed  De Lovio v Boit itself is authority for the proposition  never doubted thereafter in the United States  that a policy of marine insurance is a maritime contract and therefore  of admiralty jurisdiction   Claims concerning disputes about marine insurance claims are not  however  with the exception of premiums or calls in s  s  of the Act  general maritime claims   It is also important to understand the international or world wide nature of the reach of the Act effected by s   which is in the following terms      Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section  this Act applies in relation to     a  all ships  irrespective of the places of residence or domicile of their owners  and    b  all maritime claims  wherever arising      This Act does not apply in relation to a proceeding commenced before the commencement of this Act      This Act does not apply in relation to a cause of action that arose     a  in respect of an inland waterways vessel  or    b  in respect of the use or intended use of a ship on inland waters      Paragraph  b  does not have effect in relation to a cause of action if  at the time when the cause of action arose  the ship concerned was a foreign ship   Section   of the Act deals with  associated jurisdiction   It is in the following terms    The jurisdiction that a court has under this Act extends to jurisdiction in respect of a matter of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction not otherwise within its jurisdiction that is associated with a matter in which the jurisdiction of the court under this Act is invoked referred toFournier v The Ship  Margaret Z      NZLR   For the reasons that I have identified  it is unnecessary to decide either of these questions  Given the restrictive approach to maritime liens in Anglo Australian law  there are significant obstacles in the way of the first question  being an argument that a new class of maritime lien should be recognised  see for example  The  Acrux    The  Halcyon Isle    AC   and Fournier v The Ship  Margaret Z      NZLR       referred toGood v The London Steamship Owners  Mutual Protecting Association   LR   CP   The plaintiff says that the claim is one arising out of the act or omission of a person  being the person in charge of the tug  for whose wrongful acts or omissions the owner of Global Peace is liable  This way of putting the claim invokes s  d iii   The plaintiff also says that the claim is one arising out of an act or omission of the owner  through the asserted default of the master  thereby invoking s  d i   This much can be accepted  However  more is required  The act or omission must be in the navigation or management of the ship    In the present context  the general maritime claim must concern the ship for the purposes of s    The ship for s   is the same ship as for s  d   However  whilst it is undoubted that the act or omission  as asserted  of the tugmaster was an act or omission in the navigation or management of the tug  that does not mean that it was not also in the navigation or management of the tow  Global Peace  If the events  as asserted  occurred in the towage operation  it can be said that the acts or omissions took place in the navigation or management of Global Peace as well as of Tom Tough  This arises out of the nature of the towage operation  the tug is in the course of navigation and its operation is effecting or is part of the navigation or management of Global Peace    Navigation  is a word capable of wide meaning  It is used  sometimes in the phrase  navigation or management  in a number of maritime

artificiality of the distinction based on the need for the ship to be an active agent  but recognised the importance of it in the jurisprudence  see the discussion of the cases at      A helpful passage is at     It is true that these cases are no more than illustrations of the manner in which the test has been applied  But they show that when the injury arises from some defect in the condition of the ship considered as premises or as a structure upon which the person injured is standing  walking or moving  the ship is treated as no more than a potential danger of a passive kind  a danger to the user  whose use is the active cause of the injury  But where the injury is the result of the management or navigation of the ship as a moving object or of the working of the gear or of some other operation  then the damage is to be regarded as done by the ship as an active agent or as the  noxious instrument       In the present case  according to the allegations  the improper navigation of the ship caused her so to behave that she capsized  Her behaviour as an active agent was the direct cause of the harm  and in that sense she was the noxious instrument   What then is claimed here  One goes to the statement of claim which supports the amended writ  The oil came from Global Peace   The defendant says that it was the ship s bunker fuel  That can be seen for various purposes  including the operation of the arrest provisions to be part of the ship  Scandinavian Bunkering AS v The Bunkers on Board the Ship FV  Taruman    FCAFC    It is alleged that those in charge of Global Peace   the pilot and master  failed in their duties in the navigation or management of the ship  in respect of its handling in the berthing operation  It is also alleged that those in charge of the tug were negligent for which the owner of Global peace was responsible  The propositions by way of assertions are that the ship was mishandled by  in part  those on board the ship  Thus  if these allegations are made good Medi Vitoria has had her hull fouled by the oil that has escaped from Global Peace by  in part  the faulty navigation or management or handling of Global Peace in manoeuvring the ship in the berthing operation  To paraphrase the words of Dixon J in Nagrint v The Ship  Regis  at   the injury to Medi Vitoria is claimed to be the result of the navigation or management of Global Peace as a moving object in her berthing or some other operation in her berthing discussedOwners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR  http www austlii

broad Constitutional scope of s  iii   It was not limited by English and colonial history  it was not tied to the state of Admiralty jurisdiction in England or the local colonies as at   or    Rather  it was stated  at   that s  iii      extends to matters of the kind generally accepted by maritime nations as falling within a special jurisdiction  sometimes called Admiralty and sometimes called maritime jurisdiction  concerned with the resolution of controversies relating to marine commerce and navigation referred toOwners of SS Kalibia v Wilson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second question raises an important issue about the approach to s   and it is appropriate to say something about this  As a matter of construction of s   a number of considerations are relevant  First  the approach enunciated by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket and discussed in The Queen v Gray  Ex parte Marsh and The  Tieng Sheng  No   to which I have already referred must be borne in mind  Secondly  the word  includes  in s   reflects the fact that the Act leaves open the possibility of other maritime liens being recognised beyond those listed  This might occur by reference to the development of Australian maritime law in this respect  or by the recognition of foreign maritime liens by reference to principles of private international law different to

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This kind of distinction between a limitation relevant to the jurisdiction of a court which goes to the existence of jurisdiction  that is as a condition which must exist before authority to adjudicate arises  and which goes to the exercise of jurisdiction was discussed by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte   HCA         CLR   at   as follows    It cannot be denied that  if the legislature see fit to do it  any event or fact or circumstance whatever may be made a condition upon the occurrence or existence of which the jurisdiction of a court shall depend  But  if the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts  as distinguished from the court s opinion or determination that the facts do exist  then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal  possessing power to determine that question  decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid  Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course  nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed     See also The Queen v Gray  Ex parte Marsh   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason J  as he then was  and in an Admiralty context  see The  Tian Sheng No       Lloyd s Rep   at   per Sir Anthony Mason sitting in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal   Conformably with the approach described in Parisienne Basket   The Queen v Gray   Ex parte Marsh and the The  Tien Sheng No   these are questions which should be seen as to be resolved within jurisdiction  if the assertions made are that there is liability under the PS  CL  Act and the Pollution Convention   Section  b  of the Act should be read with ss   and   of the PS  CL  Act and the Pollution Convention  By doing so  I conclude that the claim described in s  b  is to be characterised by the assertions made and not by reference to the evidence which would see the claim under the Pollution Convention succeed or fail   Thus  the Court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate this claim  It is another question  however  whether it should now be dismissed  Mr Street said that he wanted to cross examine Mr White on this issue  I will hear the parties as to the proper conduct of the motion insofar as it seeks to dismiss this claim summarily   The second question raises an important issue about the approach to s   and it is appropriate to say something about this  As a matter of construction of s   a number of considerations are relevant  First  the approach enunciated by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket and discussed in The Queen v Gray  Ex parte Marsh and The  Tieng Sheng  No   to which I have already

That can be seen for various purposes  including the operation of the arrest provisions to be part of the ship  Scandinavian Bunkering AS v The Bunkers on Board the Ship FV  Taruman    FCAFC    It is alleged that those in charge of Global Peace   the pilot and master  failed in their duties in the navigation or management of the ship  in respect of its handling in the berthing operation  It is also alleged that those in charge of the tug were negligent for which the owner of Global peace was responsible  The propositions by way of assertions are that the ship was mishandled by  in part  those on board the ship  Thus  if these allegations are made good Medi Vitoria has had her hull fouled by the oil that has escaped from Global Peace by  in part  the faulty navigation or management or handling of Global Peace in manoeuvring the ship in the berthing operation  To paraphrase the words of Dixon J in Nagrint v The Ship  Regis  at   the injury to Medi Vitoria is claimed to be the result of the navigation or management of Global Peace as a moving object in her berthing or some other operation in her berthing referred toState Government Insurance Office  Qld  v Crittenden   HCA

Lloyd s Rep   A convenient description of the phrase and its contents can be taken from the judgment of Lord Diplock  in whose reasons all members of the House of Lords concurred  in The  Eschersheim      Lloyd s Rep   at     The figurative phrase  damage done by a ship  is a term of art in maritime law whose meaning is well settled by authority  see The Vera Cruz     P D    Currie v  M Knight    A C     To fall within the phrase not only must the damage be the direct result or natural consequence of something done by those engaged in the navigation of the ship but the ship itself must be the actual instrument by which the damage was done  The commonest case is that of collision  which is specifically mentioned in the convention  but physical contact between the ship and whatever object sustains the damage is not essential a ship may negligently cause a wash by which some other vessel or some property on shore is damaged   In The   Eschersheim   there was a challenge to jurisdiction and a stay application  The tug Rotesand took in tow the ship Erkowit  which had been holed in a collision with a third vessel  A salvage agreement was signed between those on Rotesand and Erkowit s master  The tug beached Erkowit in a sinking condition  No particular damage to Erkowit or her cargo was caused by the beaching  but extensive pollution damage later occurred to surrounding areas from oil in Erkowit   and the cargo and the crew s possessions on Erkowit were later damaged and lost  The claims were against the salvors for negligent salvage  The owners claimed for loss of the ship  the master  crew and cargo owners claimed for the loss of possessions and cargo  Brandon J at first instance said the claims thus made were not for damage done by a ship  that is Rotesand   the Court of Appeal disagreed  The House of Lords agreed with the Court of Appeal  The following parts of Lord Diplock s judgment at   reveal the fineness of the distinctions involved and the difficulty of resolving these issues entirely satisfactorily on a motion about jurisdiction by reference to the  character  of the claim    In the instant case the act of casting off the Erkowit in such a way as to beach her upon an exposed shore was something done by those engaged in the navigation of the Rotesand  as a result of which the Erkowit and her cargo were left exposed to the risk of being damaged by wind and wave if the weather worsened before she could be removed to a more sheltered position      I do not understand it to be claimed that the actual beaching caused any physical damage to ship or cargo  but for the purposes of this appeal it must be assumed that the chain of causation is unbroken between the beaching of the Erkowit and her subsequent breaking up by wind and wave  Had the damage been caused by the beaching  there could in my view have been no question but that the Rotesand could properly be regarded as the actual instrument by which that damage was done  Although for my part I find this a borderline case  I do not think that the intervening failure of the appellants to take steps to avert the risk of damage  which forms the subject of the alternative grounds of negligence  prevents the Rotesand from remaining the actual instrument by which the damage subsequent to the beaching was done  I accordingly agree with the Court of Appeal that the shipowners  and cargo owners  claims also fall under par   d  of s      In The  Rama      Lloyd s Rep   Clarke J discussed The  Eschersheim  and concluded at   that to be  damage done by a ship  three criteria must be satisfied     a  the damage must be caused by something done by those engaged in the navigation or management of the ship in a physical sense   b  the ship must be the actual or noxious instrument by which the damage is done  and  c  the damage must be sustained by a person or property external to the ship   The early cases such as The  Vera Cruz   No       PD   and Currie v McKnight   AC   appear on their own facts to require a close and direct connection between the damage and the ship as an instrument  Lord Diplock approved these cases in The  Eschersheim    but factually applied the

requisite legal character in any given case may not be straightforward  In a number of cases the courts have examined the assertions made in  and facts proven in relation to  the writ and accompanying documents to answer the question whether the claim  as made  answers the description of the words of the relevant paragraph as an appropriate enquiry as to the jurisdiction of the court  see  for example  The  Bass Reefer  The  Acrux    P     and The  Antonis P Lemos      Lloyd s Rep    How  in any given case  the plaintiff chooses to discharge the responsibility on it to satisfy the court of the jurisdiction of the court is a matter for it  The plaintiff may choose to lead evidence of the underlying claim  But it should always be borne in mind that it is the claim  that is the relevant assertions  that must bear the requisite legal character  Care should be taken not to invest this task with a function or requirement of proving the claim at some prefatory level or to some preliminary standard of satisfaction  To do so would raise difficulties of a character similar  indeed related to  those that Willmer J saw posed by the defendant s unsuccessful argument in The  St

Court discussed the approach to interpretation of the Act at   to    I need not set out those passages here  To those comments  only two matters need be added for emphasis  for the purposes of this case  First  provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court should be interpreted liberally and without imposing limitations not found in the express words  The  Shin Kobe Maru   HC  at    Secondly  a particular aspect of the importance of the context provided by the ALRC Report  otherwise discussed in The  Cape Moreton  above  is the consideration referred to by the High Court in The  Iran Amanat  at   as follows    The Australian legislation having been enacted against the background of English legislation and authority set out above  the definition of  relevant person  should be understood as having the same meaning as the courts had given to the corresponding words in the English statute  When the Parliament has enacted legislation  affecting the subject of international shipping  and followed a statutory precedent from overseas which has by then received a settled construction  there is every reason to construe the statutory language in the same way in this country unless such construction is unreasonable or inapplicable to Australian circumstances appliedThe  Moschanthy      Lloyd s Rep   As the High Court said in The  Shin Kobe Maru  the question is whether a claim made bears a certain legal character  The High Court in that case also said  at   that the word  claim       would ordinarily be construed as the assertion of a right or interest recognized by the law and carrying an entitlement to relief     This analysis must be undertaken  by reference to the nature of the plaintiff s case as put forward  without reference to     whether it is likely to succeed or not  The  Moschanthy      Lloyd s Rep   at    See also Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v Pegasus Lines SA     NZLR   at      Statements in some of the cases of the necessity to show some strength in the case before the jurisdiction of the court is attracted  that is before the court is legitimately seized of authority to adjudicate  appear impermissibly to combine the attraction of jurisdiction with its exercise  cf The  Bass Reefer      FCR    See generally  Toh  KS Admiralty Law and Practice  Butterworths Asia    p   and the cases there discussed referred toWestpac Banking Corporation v Paterson     ALR   Here  by the time the question is to be assessed  the hearing of the motion  the proceeding was constituted by the amended writ  the application to further amend the writ and the statement of claim  The jurisdiction of the court is not to be assessed frozen at an anterior point of time  Westpac Banking Corporation v Paterson     ALR    Whilst the authority given in s   is to commence a proceeding  it is legitimate  at least so long as there is no fundamental change in the identity of the claim in the proceeding  as there is not here in any of the amendments  to have regard to documents  such as the statement of claim  filed after the commencement of the proceeding which illuminate its nature and character   Here  the plaintiff s claim is that there is a maritime lien arising from all the circumstances pleaded  see   of the statement of claim  These circumstances include an assertion that there has been damage done by a ship  This  of course  is a recognised basis of a lien  s  b    Though   of the amended writ has an ambiguity arising from the second half of the paragraph  reading the amended writ and statement of claim together  the assertions therein amount to a proceeding on a maritime lien for damage done by a ship  Once this conclusion is drawn the Court has authority to hear the proceeding
