austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe nature of a certified agreement and the means of enforcement  together with the role of this Court conferred by s  A  has been the subject of analysis by the Full Court in ACTEW Corporation Ltd v Pangallo   FCAFC       FCR    Whitlam and Gyles JJ there observed        The argument that the remedies provided by the Act are inadequate to ensure compliance with a certified agreement and that there should be means for enforcing obligations beyond those specifically provided by this statute is contrary to the history of enforcement of industrial obligations  as explained by Madgwick J in Wattyl  The Act has  for some time  reflected the policy of not specifically enforcing industrial obligations  except insofar as express remedies are provided  In any event  the point loses much of its force when consideration is given to ss    LT and  LW  This is not the occasion to explore all of the ramifications of those provisions or to decide what role  if any  the courts have to play in enforcement of such provisions  It is sufficient to say that there is no complaint about the operation of the dispute settling mechanism in this case    it is the result about which complaint is made  There is no need to call in aid the power of a court to make a declaration of right as to the construction of the agreement as that role is expressly dealt with by s  A of the Act                 W e accept the submission that the Act has created the concept of a certified agreement  has given it statutory force and has also regulated the means by which it may be construed and enforced in accordance with the principle in Josephson v Walker   In our opinion  the statute excludes a court of general jurisdiction of a State or Territory from the field  except insofar as it is expressly included  and is inconsistent with the ability of such a court to make a binding declaration of right as to the effect of a certified agreement           See

Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union  No     FCA   per Sackville J at   citedCooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIt was appropriate that the challenge to jurisdiction be raised by a Notice of Contention as envisaged by Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules    Cth   That Rule provides as follows      If the respondent proposes to contend that the judgment should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by the court below  but does not seek a discharge or variation of any part of the judgment  the respondent need not file a notice of cross appeal  but must             a  file a notice of the respondent s contention within   days after the service upon the respondent of the notice of appeal  or within such further time as the Court or a Judge fixes  and    aa  serve a copy of the notice on the appellant  and    b  give notice to the appellant of the record of evidence or documents before the court below relating to the contention  for inclusion in the appellant s draft index of appeal papers  and    c  at the appointment to settle the appeal papers  request the Registrar to include the record of evidence or documents in the appeal papers         Consistent with that rule  the Respondent wished to have the decision of the Chief Industrial Magistrate   affirmed   and did not seek a   discharge or variation   of such part of the judgment under appeal as embraced the construction of clause   which it successfully advanced at first instance  As noted by Branson J in Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR    French J  as His Honour then was  agreeing        As the terms of O   r   make clear  the purpose of a notice of contention is to place the appellant and the Court on notice that the respondent contends that the judgment below  ie the orders made below  can be supported on grounds other than those which the court below relied on when pronouncing the judgment  That is  that even if a ground of appeal is made out  it may not lead to the order the subject of the appeal being set aside or varied  The filing of a notice of contention is not a mechanism for challenging any order made below or for challenging the failure of the court below to make an order to which a party below claimed to be entitled  The importance of resolving the Notice of Contention was considerably reduced  however  when Senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondent accepted that the Appellant could by one means or another have the question as to the proper construction of the Agreements now resolved by this Court  Whether that means was by way of an application being made under the provision identified by Senior Counsel as s  A of the   Act and returnable instanter   or by treating the present Notice of Appeal as such an application  it was properly accepted by Senior Counsel were questions which could be left to one side  However the question as to the jurisdiction of Chief Industrial Magistrate s Court was resolved  both the Appellant and the Respondent wanted the Court to go on and resolve the construction of the Agreements   But Senior Counsel also maintained that the question as to jurisdiction of the Chief Industrial Magistrate s Court remained an important question which needed to be addressed and resolved citedKucks v

Construction Employees  and Builders  Labourers  Federation   FCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlNotwithstanding considerable reservation  it is considered that those claims could best be characterised as claims for the underpayment of wages and for penalties   rather than as applications impermissibly seeking an interpretation of a certified agreement which only this Court can give  cf Master Builders  Association of Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders  Labourers  Federation   FCA         FLR   at   to   per Evatt and Northrop JJ  As emphasised by Senior Counsel for the Respondent  cause for reservation may be founded upon the very manner in which the case was opened  The Chief Industrial Magistrate asked at the outset      Are you going to open and tell me what this is about       After some preliminary matters were mentioned  Counsel on behalf of the now Appellant answered as follows      Your Honour the matter before the court is one of an interpretation of a certified agreement          He concluded his brief opening with these words      So your Honour the matter before you is one of the interpretation for correct construction of an industrial instrument being a certified agreement          There was only passing reference in the opening to any claim for wages and no reference to penalties  Notwithstanding the manner in which the case may have been opened  however  the applications as filed were expressed in terms of claims for underpayment of wages and penalties  Neither the scarcity of the evidence in support of those claims  nor the manner in which the claims were presented  is sufficient to deny to those claims the character of proceedings which properly fell within the jurisdiction of the Chief Industrial Magistrate s Court  The scarcity of the evidence presented may well have provided a sufficient basis upon which those claims could possibly have been rejected  Had a different conclusion been reached by the Industrial Magistrate as to the construction of clause   it may have been appropriate to extend a further opportunity to the claimant employees to remedy the deficiency in the existing evidence  So much was recognised by the Chief Industrial Magistrate in his reasons for decision  But it was the construction of clause   which ultimately proved fatal to the claims being advanced  A further opportunity to supplement the deficiency in the evidence became unnecessary by reason of that construction citedMcAleer v University of Western Australia  No     FCA

itself the light of that history  and to prefer to peer unaided at some obscurity in the language     citedWestern Newspapers Pty Limited v Warren     IR  In addition to the jurisdiction conferred by s   of the   Act  s  A of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the   Act  as in force at the relevant period  defined a   court of competent jurisdiction   as including a magistrate s court and in Western Newspapers Pty Limited v Warren     IR   at   it was concluded that the Chief Industrial Magistrate s Court of New South Wales was a court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of s    Section   conferred jurisdiction to impose a penalty  As noted by Moore J in Warren   the source of the Commonwealth Parliament s power to confer federal jurisdiction on a state court is to be found in s  iii  of the Constitution       IR at    The present Appeal originated on   February   when two proceedings were commenced in the Chief Industrial Magistrate s Court  In one proceeding the Applicant Union sought   inter alia   an order that     plus interest be paid to a member of the Union  Mr Colin Haidle  increasing to a claim for     plus interest at trial  In the second proceeding the Applicant Union sought an order that     plus interest be paid to another union member  Mr John Hodge  increasing to a claim for     plus interest at trial  In addition  in both proceedings the imposition of a penalty was sought  The entitlement to be paid those monies depended upon the construction of a series of three agreements made under the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   The first of these agreements was the Ulan Coal Mines Ltd Underground Mine Certified Agreement     the second being the Ulan Coal Mines Ltd Underground Certified Agreement       and the current agreement being the Ulan Coal Mines Ltd Underground Certified Agreement     The provision of each agreement upon which the claimed entitlement to monies was founded  clause   was in relevantly identical terms  That clause provided for payment and rates of payment on weekends and holidays
