Commissioner engaged in  double counting  with any knowledge or belief that there was a failure in compliance with the provisions of the Act  and   the reasoning in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   was fairly open to the construction that it supported the course taken in making the second amended assessment  the High Court s decision in Futuris reinforces the conclusion in   above consideredCommissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Limited   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The more so because  following the hearing of the motions  the High Court handed down its judgment in Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Limited   HCA         ALR    The joint judgment of Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Crennan JJ contained the following relevant observations    It follows from what has been said respecting s   that not only is it not a privative clause  but there is not the conflict or inconsistency between s   s   and the requirements of the Act governing assessment which calls for reconciliation of the nature identified in Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth     CLR    The point sought to be made here respecting the relationship between ss   and   and those requirements was expressed in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   by Dawson J as follows       The requirements of the Act which govern the making of an assessment do not produce any inconsistency with the provision that a notice of assessment constitutes conclusive evidence in recovery proceedings  That is because s   provides that the validity of any assessment shall not be affected by reason of the fact that any of the provisions of the Act have not been complied with      Having regard to s   there is no inconsistency  apparent or otherwise  between the requirements of the Act relating to the making of an assessment and s   and no reconciliation is called for  Indeed  as I have said  s   does no more than give evidentiary effect to s           It follows that there is no scope here for the operation of the so called Hickman principle  Futuris framed its case as if Hickman was engaged and by adoption of Dixon J s words           provided always that its decision is a bona fide attempt to exercise its power  that it relates to the subject matter of the legislation  and that it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body       But it was only the first mentioned consideration  bona fide attempt  that was relevant at all in the judicial review proceeding  The notion of bona fides had the content explained earlier in these reasons and did not enter the case by the tortuous path of statutory construction and reconciliation with which Dixon J was concerned    Something more should also be said respecting Richard Walter  That case decided first  that the Act permits the Commissioner to issue assessments on an alternative basis to different taxpayers in respect of the same income and  secondly  that s   does not limit the jurisdiction conferred by s  B of the Judiciary Act   Neither holding is challenged in this litigation    Various views were expressed in Richard Walter respecting the construction of and relationship between s   and s    Reference was made to the then accepted distinction between mandatory and directory provisions  and to what seems to have been some doctrinal status then afforded to Hickman  As to the first matter  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   has changed the landscape and as to the second  Plaintiff S  has placed  the Hickman principle  in perspective  Hence this appeal should be decided by the path taken in these reasons and not by any course assumed to be mandated by what was said in any one or more of the several sets of reasons in Richard Walter   Whether or not one agrees with their Honours  anterior findings at   and I do not  that   there was nothing to support any conclusion that the Commissioner engaged in  double counting  with any knowledge or belief that there was a failure in compliance with the provisions of the Act  and   the reasoning in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   was fairly open to the construction that it supported the course taken in making the second amended assessment  the High Court s decision in Futuris reinforces the conclusion in   above referred toR v Hickman  Ex parte Fox and Clinton   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  No allegation is made in the pleadings that in making the assessments the Commissioner did not exercise the power of assessment in good faith or did not otherwise satisfy the Hickman test from R v Hickman  Ex parte Fox and Clinton   HCA         CLR   at   merely that    The Commissioner failed to turn his mind to certain factual matters  and    the Commissioner had regard to information which he should not have considered    These are matters relevant to proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  and it is uncontroversial that there are proceedings pending in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal seeking review of the Commissioner s objection decisions  However  neither of these matters is sufficient to challenge the validity of the assessments
