CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In turn  the respondent has submitted  in summary      a  The Acting Magistrate was not considering whether any criminal offences had been committed  b  The Acting Magistrate s findings were on the balance of probabilities under the Domestic Violence Family Protection Act    Qld  c  The Acting Magistrate did not take into account whether Ms Thompson had in any way acted in self defence  or whether any other defences may have been available to her had she been charged under criminal law  d  As discussed in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions   HCA         CLR    guilt  is only relevant when considered in the context of conviction of an offence  e  The decision of the Acting Magistrate could in no way be considered to be a finding of guilt of anyone  much less a finding of guilt in respect of an offence of violence  f  The reference to recording  a finding of guilt  is a reference to circumstances where a court  having found someone guilty of an offence  may not record a conviction  g  Regulation    g  Migration Regulations contemplates circumstances where an applicant has suffered from domestic violence but the requirements of reg    e  are not satisfied  However  the applicant has not sought to rely on reg    g    During the course of argument I put to the applicant s counsel that the logical conclusion of his argument was that  even if Ms Thompson had been charged with a criminal offence in respect of the wine glass incident and had been acquitted of having committed an offence because she had successfully raised a defence such as self defence or provocation   she would  for the purposes of reg    e  Migration Regulations have nonetheless been  found guilty of an offence with respect to domestic violence   The reason for this is that the applicant has submitted that  finding of guilt  means a finding of the occurrence of acts or omissions which constitute an offence of violence  apparently irrespective of the formality of conviction or a guilty verdict  Counsel submitted that in such circumstances reg    e  Migration Regulations would be attracted  because there had been a finding of guilt  in the relevant sense   TS p   par     In my view  that cannot be  To say that a person could be acquitted of an offence under the criminal law  but nonetheless  found guilty  in the context of an offence of violence for the purposes of the Migration Regulations   stretches the limits of the interpretation of the words  finding of guilt  and indeed exposes a fundamental flaw in the applicant s argument   An important case in the context of interpreting both  guilt  and  finding of guilt  is Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions   HCA         CLR   which involved an interpretation of s   Crimes Act    ACT   So far as is relevant in the case before me  it is clear from the decision of the High Court that      a  Linguistically   guilt  may mean  inter alia  the fact or state of wrongdoing  independently of any curial finding such as an admission of guilt  as noted by Heydon J at   as well as the curial determination of  guilt   as noted by McHugh J at   b  In the context of criminal offences   guilt  is referable to a curial determination  As McHugh J pointed out in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions at   after considering scenarios where a person could be accused of a range of criminal offences including murder  manslaughter  rape  indecent assault  burglary and housebreaking             In all these cases  it is fanciful to speak of  guilt  as being an entity that is independent of the jury s verdict  It is the conviction recording the jury s verdict that establishes the  guilt  of the prisoner  Like Bishop Berkeley who  maintained that material objects only exist through being perceived  the lawyer maintains that  guilt  exists in a criminal law context only when it is perceived as the   of a conviction  To assert otherwise is to deny the presumption of innocence  a presumption that operates until the entry of a conviction rebuts it             c  A   finding of guilt  refers to a curial determination of guilt  In my view this was accepted by all judges in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions    Applying the reasoning in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions   in my view the reference to a court  recording a finding of guilt   in respect of an offence of violence  in reg    e  Migration Regulations is a reference to a curial determination of guilt when a person has been charged with a criminal offence involving domestic violence  and has been brought before a court to answer that charge   Regulation    e  distinguishes between the conviction of an alleged perpetrator of an offence of violence  and recording a finding of guilt against the alleged perpetrator of an offence of violence  In my view the explanation for this distinction is simple  In the Penalties and Sentences Act    Qld  for example  s   gives courts a discretion to record or not record a conviction as provided by that Act  In considering whether or not to record a conviction  a court is required to have regard to all the circumstances of the case  including the nature of the offence  the offender s character and age  and the impact that recording the conviction will have on the offender s economic or social wellbeing or chances of finding employment  s    This legislation is reproduced in similar terms in other jurisdictions  see for example s   Sentencing Act    Vic  s   Crimes  Sentencing Procedure  Act    NSW  s   Criminal Law  Sentencing  Act    SA  s   Sentencing Act    WA  s   Sentencing Act    Tas  s   Crimes  Sentencing  Act    ACT  s   Sentencing Act  NT    Regulation    e  recognises that person may be found guilty of an offence without a conviction being recorded against their name  The prerequisite to both situations however is that a person has been charged with a criminal offence   Accordingly   recording a finding of guilt  is an action open to a court in dealing with an accused charged with a criminal offence  In my view the learned Magistrate  in making a finding of fact in the context of an application for a domestic violence order requiring proof on the balance of probabilities  and which did not in any way involve criminal charges in respect of an offence of violence or otherwise  was not recording a finding of guilt in respect of an offence of violence committed by Ms Thompson or anyone else  The applicant has not established that he has suffered from domestic violence as defined by s      e  and therefore has not satisfied the criteria in subcl       Migration Regulations   As a result  the application fails     I certify that the preceding thirty three
