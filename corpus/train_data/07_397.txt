cth federal ct  html  Because of difficulties that arose in ascertaining the identity of the membership of CRI  the matter came back to Court on   November   with the receiver seeking an expansion of his powers  For reasons published on   December   I made orders expanding the powers of the receiver in the following terms  inter alia         Without limiting the other powers conferred on the

independent commercial and legal advice as he deems appropriate  including without limitation the advice of senior counsel        The receiver is not required to file security pursuant to Order   Rule

Settlement   It provided for the creation of a new charitable trust in essentially the same terms as had been contemplated by the agreement made on   July    It also provided           CRI and UWA

against CRI on the basis that no order as to costs is made and that existing orders for costs  if any  be discharged as between CRI and UWA   In accordance with the orders made on   December   it was necessary for the University and CRI to seek approval of the settlement agreement  Because that approval process did involve some reference to what occurred in mediation and was opposed by Sirtex  the application for approval was referred to another judge  Graham J citedUniversity of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   March   Graham J
