claim group  in accordance with the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by them  should be recognised as the native title holders for Determination Area A  As has been

additional Native Title claim which would have the practical effect of changing the position of that common boundary without the prior consent of the other claimants        The Eastern Guruma
