J at   citedPowerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp      ALR  In this application  the applicant seeks an order staying the orders of   June   which comprise four orders  Since order   of the orders of   June   is not an operative order effecting a dismissal  I do not propose to stay the operation of the declaration as to the effect of the order of   October   from the date of the failure to comply with the condition  Order   of the order of   June   is a refusal of an extension of time for compliance with the order of   October    That matter is the subject of leave to appeal  If the appeal is meritorious  the Court has power to set aside order   and extend time to enable an amended application to be filed thus reinstating the application  An application to stay a refusal to extend time is apt to be construed as an order extending time  That matter is before the Full Court  The applicant also seeks a stay in respect of the orders of   October    I propose to stay order   of that order  pending the determination of the appeal  with leave  from the refusal on   June   to extend the time for the filing of an amended application  to the extent that the order of   October   provides  prospectively  that the application  stands dismissed   The respondent does not oppose the application for a stay which I understand to mean that the respondent submits that in exercising the discretion I ought to be satisfied that there is at least an arguable case to be made  although not a persuasive case  in support of the appeal with leave consistent with Powerflex Services Pty
