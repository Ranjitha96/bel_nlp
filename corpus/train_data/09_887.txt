and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn   May   for reasons which I then gave  I granted certain interlocutory injunctive relief on the application of the Australian Communications and Media Authority  ACMA    Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong   FCA    These reasons should be read in conjunction with those of   May    The interlocutory relief granted on   May   was not as extensive as the ACMA had sought  but that was because of comprehensive undertakings which were then proffered to the Court  On that day  I also made directions for the further conduct of the proceedings  Those directions included the following  The first respondent provide a response to the applicant s request for particulars dated   May   on or before   June    The first respondent provide to the applicant a full electronic copy of that database referred to in paragraph   of the first respondent s discovery list filed   March   or alternatively access to that database for the purposes of the applicant creating an electronic copy  on and from not later than   June    The first respondent file and serve an amended discovery list by   June   which list    identifies  as fully and accurately as possible  the documents previously held by the first respondent  which it no longer holds  and what became of them    identifies whether each such document is in its power or control and the steps it has taken to obtain documents that are within its power or control    lists  to the extent they are within the discovery categories required of the first respondent  documents in relation to the employment of Ms Teresa Posella    incorporates in the response to item   of the said discovery categories  production of any database in relation to the premium telephone number   citedAon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University   HCA  Mr Salcedo states that he and his colleagues did not wish to appear without the services of a lawyer but could not afford that  Like any other individual party  each of the Fourth  Fifth and Seventh Respondents is entitled to represent himself if he chooses  None of them have indicated an active interest in so doing or even that they are actively seeking alternative legal representation  The preference voiced by Mr Salcedo is not a basis for the ignoring of the progression of a case in the Court in accordance with the Court s directions  That case management considerations are relevant to the exercise of discretions in respect of matters of practice and procedure arising under the rules of court was recently emphasised by the High Court in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University   HCA   at    Mr Salcedo also makes reference to negotiations having occurred with the ACMA in relation to the proceedings and attaches  without the permission of the AGS  a copy of a  without prejudice  letter written by the AGS in that regard  That attachment should not have occurred  The ACMA  by the AGS  does not object to the marking of the letter as an exhibit but with the proviso that the attachment should not be available for general searching  That seems to me the appropriate course to take in respect of it  I shall give directions accordingly citedHumphreys v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFurther  the Court is alternatively empowered to give judgment or make any other order against the respondent concerned  In other words  there is no requirement that evidence be adduced by the parties seeking default judgment in respect of the matters pleaded in the statement of claim  Instead  the statement of claim must be scrutinised to see whether it discloses a cause of action in law in respect of the relief sought  In Humphreys v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd  ACN         IPR   at     to   I concluded that this was the effect of the rule  I shall not repeat what is there stated followedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd     ALR  That is not to say that the receipt of evidence is precluded on an application for default judgment under O  A  Prior authority establishes that additional evidence consistent with a party s case as pleaded in the statement of claim may be considered with respect to the relief sought  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd     ALR    Kiefel J  affirmed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    Dataline   In Dataline   Kiefel J also noted of O  A that The statement of claim alleges numerous contraventions of s   and s   of the Spam Act    Cth   Spam Act   It further alleges contraventions by the First and Second Respondents of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  with the Fourth  Fifth and Seventh Respondents being alleged to be parties to these corporate contraventions  Albeit at the risk of over generalisation  the conduct alleged may be summarised as the deceptive use of fabricated profiles on dating websites in order to obtain mobile telephone numbers for the purpose of sending or causing to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages to the unsuspecting telephone account holders  Yet  further conduct alleged involves the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages which purport to supply a  single club  or  fantasy chat  service to unsuspecting telephone account holders  So far as the First  Second  Fourth  Fifth and Seventh Respondents are concerned  I am satisfied that the statement of claim alleges contraventions known to law of the Spam Act and the Trade Practices Act and which enliven the Court s jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief  I am further satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is not merely a bland recitation of statutory prohibitions but rather has been framed with sufficient precision to enable the Respondents concerned to identify the conduct which is the subject of restraint and so as to permit ready identification of an event of default  The declarations sought are in these terms    Declarations concerning contraventions of the Spam Act    Cth    A declaration
