Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited  No     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBeach Petroleum NL v Johnson  No     FCR   In Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson  No       FCR   at  F G von Doussa J said of O   r  c  that     The purpose of the rule is to avoid the expense  delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of taxation  The power is appropriate to be used in complex cases   In my opinion it is also appropriate to be used in cases which are simple and in which there would be utility in the court cutting the Gordian knot of protracted fights about costs which is the hallmark of this particular piece of litigation  It is a commonplace for the court to fix in administrative appeals under the Migration Act    Cth  an amount of costs for a successful party   In my opinion  it is appropriate that an amount of costs be fixed by the court so as to prevent yet further argument and delay in finalising this matter
