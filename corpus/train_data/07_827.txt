SZCQA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedGomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   The appellant requires leave to amend his pleadings pursuant to Order   Rule   of the Federal Court Rules   The principles relating to a grant of such leave were considered by the Full Court of this Court in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   where the Court observed that   exceptional circumstances  might exist to justify such grant  The Court said at      The reference to  exceptional circumstances  indicates that there remains a discretion in the court to entertain a new ground of appeal if it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so     The function of this Court in an appeal is to review alleged errors of the Federal Magistrate and not alleged errors of the Tribunal see  Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     However  since the decision in NBKT which was handed down after Emmett FM gave her decision directly impacts upon the issues to be considered in this appeal    exceptional circumstances   as referred to in Gomez exist  Accordingly the Court considers that the interests of justice require that the appellant be permitted to rely upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and the Court will consider the appellant s claims as they relate to the Tribunal proceedings consideredM  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  There is no evidence that the Tribunal provided any notification to the appellant  in advance of the hearing date  that the statutory declaration would be relied upon  Further  the Tribunal was not invited by the appellant by a written communication before or at the hearing to consider the information in his declaration which would have activated the exemption  see M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   and SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     nor did the appellant bring the statutory declaration to the hearing  These facts suggest that the statutory declaration was not regarded by the appellant as being significant in his application before the Tribunal consideredNAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The information contained in the statutory declaration formed part of the reasons for the Tribunal s decision  It was not uncontentious  foundational or basic  nor was it information which was given to the Tribunal by the appellant to enliven the exception under s  A b   The fact that the appellant was asked to supplement the information in his statutory declaration orally in answer to the Tribunal s questions and the fact that the appellant referred to the statutory declaration in the course of these answers is not sufficient to constitute   giving  the document to the Tribunal  see SZFXG  NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     which was approved by the Full Court in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     per Moore J  with whom Weinberg J  at     and Allsop J at     agreed  Accordingly s  A  of the Act applied to the information the appellant had provided to the Tribunal in answer to its questions consideredNBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  On   August   the hearing of this matter was adjourned pending delivery of the decision of the Full Court of this Court in NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   which considered the nature of the Tribunal s obligations under s  A of the Act  The hearing was again adjourned on   February   to   May   so that a copy of the transcript of the Tribunal s hearing could be provided to the Court   At the hearing on   May   the appellant sought leave to file an Amended Notice of Appeal which claimed as follows         The Refugee Review Tribunal breached s  A  of the Migration Act    Cth  in that the information provided by the Appellant in his Statutory Declaration sworn   February   in support of his protection visa application was not republished to the Tribunal and accordingly that information does not fall within the exception in s   A        For the reasons set out hereunder the Court granted leave to the appellant to rely on the Amended Notice of Appeal   The Minister submits that NBKT determined that for the purposes of s  A b  no distinction should be drawn between the circumstance in which an appellant provides information to the Tribunal  in chief  rather than orally in response to questions asked by a Tribunal member during a hearing before the Tribunal  Accordingly  to satisfy the requirement of s  A b  of the Act  it is sufficient for the appellant to provide information orally to the Tribunal  and there is no requirement that such information be provided in writing   The appellant submits that NBKT establishes that if the information relied upon by the Tribunal was communicated by an applicant by way of responses to questions asked by the Tribunal concerning the protection visa application  the exception provided by s  A b  of the Act will apply if the nature of the information is uncontentious  foundational or basic  Conversely  the exception in s  A b  will not apply if the nature of the information relied upon by the Tribunal is contentious  complex and diverse   The function of this Court in an appeal is to review alleged errors of the Federal Magistrate and not alleged errors of the Tribunal see  Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     However  since the decision in NBKT which was handed down after Emmett FM gave her decision directly impacts upon the issues to be considered in this appeal    exceptional circumstances   as referred to in Gomez exist  Accordingly the Court considers that the interests of justice require that the appellant be permitted to rely upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and the Court will consider the appellant s claims as they relate to the Tribunal proceedings   In SZFXG the Full Court considered whether s  A b  of the Act applied in respect of a historical fact  namely the date of the appellant s arrival in Australia  and held that the exception did apply to such technical details  The decision of the Full Court in NBKT adds a further refinement to the principles established by the authorities considered in SZFXG   The Court in NBKT rejected the narrow approach to s  A and clarifies the circumstances in which the exception provided by s  A b  may operate consideredSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  McHugh J in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at   referred to the rationale underlying the statutory requirements of s  A  of the Act in relation to evidence adverse to an appellant provided by a third party  His Honour found that such provision was intended to ensure that an appellant is aware of the significance of such information to the Tribunal s determination  He said     So it is in the interests of fairness that the applicant should have the information in writing and should be given an opportunity to comment on it  For that reason s  A should not be regarded as spent because the applicant is present at the hearing   In this instance his Honour s observations provide a guide for the interpretation of s  A of the Act  namely  where the Tribunal intends to rely upon information which is more than historical fact or other basic detail  the appellant is entitled to be given notice that the Tribunal will rely upon such information   There is no error in the judgment in Emmett FM  However arising from the Amended Notice of Appeal  the Court finds that the appellant was entitled to receive notice from the Tribunal that it would be relying on the statutory declaration for the purposes of determining his application for review  The Court finds the Tribunal s failure to provide such notification breached s  A  of the Act and accordingly the appeal is upheld   I certify that the preceding twenty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy    Associate Dated    June
