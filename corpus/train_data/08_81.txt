austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As stated by the Full Court in HP Mercantile Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at       It is clear  both having regard to the modern principles of interpretation as enunciated by the High Court in cases such as CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd   HCA         CLR   and s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  that the Court will prefer an interpretation of a statute which would give effect to the legislative purpose  as opposed to one that would not  This requires the Court to identify that purpose  both by reference to the language of the statute itself and also any extrinsic material which the Court is authorised to take into account distinguishedSterling Guardian Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The first instance decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   per Stone J  and the Full Court decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   did not directly consider the operation of the provisions before me  and the purchase of the land there was completed before   July   although the relevant stratum units were not registered under the relevant legislation until   March    The focus of the Court s attention in that case was upon the operation of s     of the GST Act   The applicant also relied upon some observations of Stone J in Sterling   FCA    In the course of her judgment  her Honour made the following comments    Although it is common to speak of the  stratum units  or  home units  being sold  technically it is the fee simple estate in the relevant stratum unit  being the lot s  and common property  that is the subject matter of the sale  The fee simple is a proprietary interest in land and  as with all interests  as opposed to the subject of those interests  it is intangible  The point is made in the following extract from an essay by K Gray and SF Gray   The Idea of Property in Law  in Land Law  Themes and Perspectives   Bright and Dewar eds    at p            T he beginning of truth about property is the realization that property is not a thing but rather a relationship which one has with a thing  It is infinitely more accurate  therefore  to say that one has property in a thing than to declare that the thing is one s property  To claim property in a resource is  in effect  to assert a strategically important degree of control over that resource  and to conflate or confuse this relationship of control with the actual thing controlled may often prove to be an analytical error of some substance         The attraction of the identity submission diminishes somewhat when its implications are considered  If that approach is correct  s     does not apply in this case because the taxable supplies acquired for the purpose of building the home units were of property that is not identical to the stratum units that were sold  It follows that the margin scheme could apply to any such development  even if the land subject to the development was acquired pursuant to a taxable supply  In other words  on the applicant s approach  a developer could buy the land  the construction materials and everything else required for the building of home units pursuant to a taxable supply and still pay GST only on the margin which  in general terms  is the difference between the costs and the sale price  It would be irrelevant whether the land was acquired before or after the commencement of the GST Act  That would not be the case  however  for a developer who bought individual lots for development as individual residences rather than for strata development          The respondent submitted that the GST Act is not concerned with whether property in land is a matter of physical fact or abstract right but rather with supplies as business transactions  made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise that you carry on  s      According to the respondent  the GST Act proceeds  on the basis that a supply of real property is a supply of tangible asset  not the disposal of an intangible interest or bundle of rights  Putting the matter another way  one can say that the applicant acquired the Camperdown land  technically the fee simple estate in the land  prior to the GST Act commencing and disposed of it after subdivision by registration of the Strata Plan and construction of the home units  The disposition was piecemeal as each stratum unit was sold but ultimately the whole of the land  or the entire interest  that was acquired was sold  The reference in s      see   above  to the stratum unit supplied being a supply of  part of the land  acquired supports this practical analysis rather than a technical legal analysis  Had the latter approach been intended one might expect the section to refer to the part as being less than the whole of the interest in the land rather than to the land itself  This practical approach is consistent with the approach taken by Mason J in Moruben Gardens Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ALJR   at        The respondent s approach is also supported by the role of the margin scheme and the context in which it operates as described above       The explanation given in the EM     makes it abundantly clear not only that GST is only payable on value added after the GST Act commenced on   July   but also that the cost of improvements to the property made since that date could not be taken into account when calculating the original purchase price  The EM ignores the fact that improvements may not only have added to the value of the real property but become  in law  part of the real property  It is not the juridical nature of the improvements that is critical but the fact that they have been brought about pursuant to a taxable supply  The clear thrust of the GST Act  both in its wording and as explained in the EM  is that of a practical business tax imposed with respect to elements of commerce  As Senior Counsel for the respondent pointed out  although in economic terms the burden of the GST is borne by the ultimate consumer  in terms of  imposition  collection and administration  it is a tax on business  It is for the taxpayer to prepare business activity statements and pay the appropriate GST and in this context abstract propositions about interests in land and the acquisition of a brand new set of rights arising from registration of a strata plan are irrelevant       T he applicant s submissions are not consistent with this purpose      For these reasons I do not accept the applicant s identity submission  In my view  it therefore follows that unless the margin on which the GST is payable is to be calculated without reference to the non land costs the application of the margin scheme would be precluded by s     of the GST Act   The reference to the  identity submission  was a similar submission to the one addressed above  but her Honour was not specifically dealing with the operation of s     or s     but s     of the GST Act  Her Honour did not consider the specific wording of s     or s     or the factual scenario before me  In my view  the comments of Stone J do not lead in this proceeding to the applicant s construction of s     being accepted   Whilst my above conclusion as to the proper interpretation to be given to s     disposes of this proceeding in favour of the respondent  it is appropriate to make some further observations on submissions made by the parties in respect of this first issue distinguishedSterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first instance decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   per Stone J  and the Full Court decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   did not directly consider the operation of the provisions before me  and the purchase of the land there was completed before   July   although the relevant stratum units were not registered under the relevant legislation until   March    The focus of the Court s attention in that case was upon the operation of s     of the GST Act   However  before me the respondent contended as follows    In the present case the stratum units that were sold by way of the Supply Contracts did not exist at   July   those legal interests only came into existence on the registration of a plan of subdivision after   July    Accordingly  it could be contended that s     has no application to the present circumstances as the stratum units could not have been acquired  within the meaning of Item   in the table  or held  within the meaning of Item   in the table  as at   July   as they did not exist at that time      However  it is the Respondent s position that the references in s     to an  interest  unit or lease  should be interpreted in accordance with the principles set out by the Federal Court at first instance in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  at     in relation to Section      In that case  Stone J held that  where the property was subdivided after the purchase  the acquisition cost of each unit for the purposes of s     was the cost of the corresponding portion of the  parent  title and it was irrelevant that the individual stratum units did not exist at the time of acquisition      Applying these principles to the present case the Respondent contends that the stratum unit is only acquired or held on   July   if the parent freehold title was acquired or held on that date and it is not to the point that the stratum unit interests did not exist at that time  This approach appears to have been implicitly assumed by the Applicant in its submissions   My view is that the initial contention posited by the respondent is correct  Whilst the respondent sought to take a different position  I must construe the provisions as I consider they are to be properly understood as a matter of law  The failure of one party to adopt a particular interpretation cannot prevent a court from adopting that interpretation if the court considers the interpretation is correct  see generally Pearce DC and Geddes RS    Statutory Interpretation in Australia     th ed  LexisNexis    at       The property  in the juridical sense  that was sold by way of the Supply Contracts was not the same property that was acquired or held  no matter what meaning is given to those terms   Accordingly  s     does not apply  the applicant did not on any view acquire or hold before   July   the Stratum Unit which it sold  and the requirements specified in the second column of the table were therefore not met  This  in my view  is the correct way to interpret and apply s     and the table   The margin scheme was introduced to obviate unfairness on some forms of business activity see Sterling   FCR at    However  I cannot ignore the text of the GST Act  particularly here Div   and the clear wording of the operation of the provisions under consideration before me  Further  the interpretation I favour does give effect to the legislative purpose of obviating unfairness  but as confined by the words of the provisions themselves   Whilst the Explanatory Memorandum to the relevant legislation talks in general terms  nowhere can the applicant demonstrate that the Explanatory Memorandum addresses the first issue before the Court  The appropriate way to consider the ambit of s     is to look to the text itself  keeping in mind the ordinary principles of statutory construction   In my view  the table in s     when referring to  relevantly here  the unit acquired  refers to the corresponding  juridical concept or intangible legal interests  referred to in s     namely the  stratum unit  see Sterling   FCR at    per Heerey  Dowsett and Conti JJ   The table specifically refers to  the  unit  This is consistent with the approach in s     the margin is normally to be calculated by the comparison of the consideration for supply and acquisition in respect of the unit  in question   The margin scheme envisages the comparison between the same units and  for that matter  between the same interests or leases  One would readily expect this to occur so that the calculation of the margin can be determined  putting aside the identification of a date  on the basis of the acquisition and supply of the same unit  interest or lease   Therefore  the margin scheme can only apply to the same property  in the juridical sense  being acquired and subsequently sold  The specific wording of s     of the table in s     and of s     and then the specific reference back in these provisions to the supply of the stratum unit in s     supports this view   The applicant  in an attempt to refute the approach that the acquired property should be identical to the supplied or sold property  referred to s     which provides      Subdivided land     For the purposes of section     if the freehold interest  stratum unit or long term lease you supply relates only to part of land or premises that you acquired  the consideration for your acquisition of that part is the corresponding proportion of the consideration for the land or premises that you acquired
