Wilkshire v Registrar of Trade Marks  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredWilkshire v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Wilkshire v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA   I ordered that the application made by Mr Wilkshire under s   of the Trade Marks Act    Cth  be summarily dismissed under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The second respondent  the Bombala Council  requested at the time I published my judgment that I vacate my proposed order as to costs as it wished to seek indemnity costs in the matter appliedRe Wilcox  Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd     ALR  The Council puts its claim for indemnity costs on two bases  The first relies upon the discretion the Court has to depart from the usual principles informing the judicial discretion to award costs where the circumstances of the case warrant such a departure  see Re Wilcox  Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd     ALR   at      The second relies upon an offer of compromise being made under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   it being contended that  the application having been dismissed summarily  Mr Wilkshire obtained a result less favourable than the terms of the offer of compromise dated   June   which was made to him  I can deal with the second of these grounds shortly  In my view there is reason for a court to be slow to allow indemnity costs to be obtained under O   r   in circumstances in which the relevant order obtained  against which the Order   r   comparison is to be made  is an order for summary dismissal  I do not consider it to be a policy of O   to provide a successful party as of course with the forensic advantage of indemnity costs when involved in proceedings with another whose case is hopeless and doomed to failure  For my own part I would be reluctant to order indemnity costs pursuant to O   r   on a motion for summary dismissal unless an award of indemnity costs is itself warranted by the principles informing the judicial discretion to award such costs  It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon those principles  Some number of them were expounded by Sheppard J in Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     see also Re Wilcox   and see generally Dal Pont  Law of Costs     ff   nd ed    appliedColgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn my view there is reason for a court to be slow to allow indemnity costs to be obtained under O   r   in circumstances in which the relevant order obtained  against which the Order   r   comparison is to be made  is an order for summary dismissal  I do not consider it to be a policy of O   to provide a successful party as of course with the forensic advantage of indemnity costs when involved in proceedings with another whose case is hopeless and doomed to failure  For my own part I would be reluctant to order indemnity costs pursuant to O   r   on a motion for summary dismissal unless an award of indemnity costs is itself warranted by the principles informing the judicial discretion to award such costs  It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon those principles  Some number of them were expounded by Sheppard J in Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     see also Re Wilcox   and see generally Dal Pont  Law of Costs     ff   nd ed    citedOgawa v The University of Melbourne  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt is not the case that because a person is a lay litigant he or she is for that reason immune to an order for indemnity costs  see Ogawa v The University of Melbourne  No     FCA   at         Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd   FCA   at      This said  there is an understandable reluctance to make such orders unless clear and compelling reasons for doing so are present notwithstanding the litigant s lack of legal representation citedBhagat v Global Custodians Ltd   FCA  It is not the case that because a person is a lay litigant he or she is for that reason immune to an order for indemnity costs  see Ogawa v The University of Melbourne  No     FCA   at         Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd   FCA   at      This said  there is an understandable reluctance to make such orders unless clear and compelling reasons for doing so are present notwithstanding the litigant s lack of legal representation
