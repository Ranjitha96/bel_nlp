Asciak v Australian Secured and Managed Mortgages Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedGlass v Demarco   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Glass v Demarco   FCA     a bankruptcy petition was before the court  The debtor filed an affidavit in which he gave evidence about an offer of compromise in another court proceeding  Objection was taken by the petitioning creditor to the admissibility of that evidence who relied on s   of the Evidence Act   The debtor relied on s  i  of the Evidence Act   At par   Emmett J said         The contention  as I understand it  is that a right of the debtor is affected by the offer because the debtor  by reason of the offer  has a right to accept it and thereby create a contract of compromise  I consider that the reference to a right in s i  is to an existing right and it is not satisfied by reason of a right coming into existence upon the making of an offer    Although it might be said that the plaintiff had at the date of the conciliation conference rights by virtue of his position as a director of the defendants  that right was not affected by the making of the communications in respect of which the plaintiff wishes to adduce evidence citedTalbot v NRMA Limited   NSW SC   In Talbot v NRMA Limited   NSWSC     Hodgson CJ in Eq said at par      Mr Shand has referred me to s   of the Evidence Act   which states that privilege would not prevent the producing of evidence of a communication or document which affects the rights of a person  In my opinion  that cannot mean a communication or document that is relevant to a right of a person because that would virtually eliminate the legal professional privilege as a ground for non admission of evidence  In my opinion  that must mean a communication or document that affects in some fairly direct way what are the actual rights and perhaps also duties of a person    I consider that these observations apply equally to the communications in respect of which the plaintiff wishes to adduce evidence  They do not affect in any direct way the actual rights of the plaintiff   I do not consider that subpar  j  of s   is of any assistance to the plaintiff  Notwithstanding the provisions of subs   of s     I am not satisfied that the circumstances identified by the plaintiff form any basis for suggesting that the communications in respect of which the plaintiff wishes to adduce evidence and the document which was handed to his legal advisers were made or prepared in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or of an offence or the commission of an act that rendered any person liable to a civil penalty  There is not sufficient evidence before me upon which I could form even a tentative or preliminary view that Ms Asciak was seeking to commit a fraud or an offence or an act that rendered her liable to a civil penalty   The plaintiff relied in his written submissions on subpar  k  of s   of the Evidence Act   This was not addressed in oral submissions and there is no material before me upon which it could apply citedHardcastle v Advanced Mining Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Hardcastle v Advanced Mining Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA    Emmett J  in the course of analysing the right of inspection conferred by the subsection  considered that specific books should be identified  His Honour said at par      That does not mean to say that specific documents need to be identified by the former director  A former director would not necessarily remember every piece of paper that a Company had  However  in my view  the section requires that a person seeking to inspect books must identify at least specific categories or classes of books  which have some bearing on the relevant legal proceeding  There may be a question as to whether or not the former director is required to identify precisely how the relevant books are relevant or material to that proceeding  There must  however  be some indication of the nature of the books sought and the bearing that the books have on the proceeding in question    I agree with these observations and am satisfied that the ultimate formulation of the order sought by the plaintiff identified the books sought to be inspected with sufficient particularity   The defendants submitted that the proceeding in the Federal Court did not relate to anything the plaintiff had done in his capacity as a former director of the defendant companies   In Hardcastle v Advanced Mining Technologies  supra  Emmett J considered that there was a second possible limitation on the operation of s  F  of the Corporations Act   His Honour said at par         the proceeding must be a proceeding to which the former director is a party or believes might be brought against him or her or which he or she proposes to bring in his or her capacity as a director of the company   It would be curious if a person who  fortuitously  happened to have been a director of a company in the past would be entitled to access to books of the company that might be material to proceedings brought by that former director or which might be brought against the former director in a capacity totally unconnected with the capacity of the former director as a director  I do not express any firm or final view on that question at this stage because it does not arise in the application before me  Section   authorises intervention by the Court where a person in contravention of the law refuses to permit inspection    Emmett J did not form a concluded view on this issue and I would  with respect  not read such a limitation into the provision   The defendants submitted that on the proper construction of s  F  of the Corporations Act the only right given to a director was to inspect such books of the company which came into existence during the period of seven years immediately preceding the date upon which the former director ceased to be a director of the company  I do not accept this construction of s  F   The reference to seven years in the subsection is a reference to the period during which the right to inspect exists  that is to say  the right to inspect is a right which continues for seven years after the date upon which the person ceases to be a director of the company  If that right is exercised during that seven year period  it is a right to inspect books which may well have come into existence a considerable period before the date upon which the person ceased to be a director of the company  and it also is a right to inspect books which have come into existence after the date upon which the person ceased to be a director of the company  The period of seven years referred to relates to the period during which the right to inspect arises  it is not a period which relates to the period during which the books of the company came into existence   The defendants submitted that the plaintiff was not proposing in good faith to bring a proceeding in the Family Court  They submitted that the lack of good faith was evidenced by the facts that in August   both parties had been involved in a Family Court property dispute  they had been represented by highly qualified advisers  they had made a decision which was recorded in consent orders and that   months later it could not be said that the plaintiff was acting in good faith in raising the issues he had  The defendants pointed to the fact that the plaintiff was seeking to criticise the expert s report which had been given to the parties prior to the conciliation conference and that it had always been open to him to do so prior to the making of the final orders  In short  it was submitted that the plaintiff was not acting in good faith in bringing an application in November   to rectify matters which were within his control prior to the making of the final orders citedStewart v Normandy NFM Ltd
