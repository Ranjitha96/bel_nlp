of the Constitution are well settled and were most recently comprehensively and authoritatively examined in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Worthing   HCA         CLR    Sections  LZ  and   of the WR Act  as at before   March   and s   of the WR Act thereafter  operate to ensure that a federal industrial instrument will prevail over inconsistent State laws even though that instrument is not a  law of the Commonwealth  within s   of the Constitution   The relevant alleged constitutional inconsistency is between the WR Act and the State law  see Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia v Amalgamated Metal Workers  and Shipwrights  Union   HCA         CLR   at      per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ  So far as is presently material  s   applies to affect the operation of a State law where   i  that law alters  impairs or detracts from a law of the Commonwealth or the exercise of power under a Commonwealth law  or  ii  that law enters a field that the law of the Commonwealth was intended to cover exclusively or exhaustively  Contentions of Coinvest Whether a State law is inconsistent with a Federal law is the subject of principles which are  well settled  see Worthing at    In Worthing the following categories of inconsistency were discussed  Where one law authorises what the other forbids  Where it is possible to obey both laws but one imposes a greater obligation than the other   Neither of those examples is currently relevant  The State law does not authorise anything forbidden by the industrial instruments  Section   of the State Act might be thought to have that effect  but properly analysed it only deals with disputes arising under the State Act and does not bear upon the settlement of disputes arising out of matters dealt with in the industrial instruments  The Court in Worthing   said at     In Victoria v The Commonwealth   Dixon J stated two propositions which are presently material  The first was     When a State law  if valid  would alter  impair or detract from the operation of a law of the Commonwealth Parliament  then to that extent it is invalid       The second  which followed immediately in the same passage  was     Moreover  if it appears from the terms  the nature or the subject matter of a Federal enactment that it was intended as a complete statement of the law governing a particular matter or set of rights and duties  then for a State law to regulate or apply to the same matter or relation is regarded as a detraction from the full operation of the Commonwealth law and so as inconsistent       The second proposition may apply in a given case where the first does not  yet  contrary to the approach taken in the Court of Appeal  if the first proposition applies  then s   of the Constitution operates even if  and without the occasion to consider whether  the second proposition applies     i  Does the State Act  and the scheme under it  alter  impair or detract from the operation of the industrial instruments The State Act and the scheme which it provides does not alter  impair or detract from the operation of the industrial instruments  Those instruments require the Jemena companies to grant long service leave to those of its employees who qualify for it after a period of continuous service  In contrast  the State Act requires the applicants to pay long service leave charges in respect of those of the employees whom they employ in construction work  The State Act places no obligation on the applicants to pay long service leave benefits to anyone or to grant long service leave to anyone  The State Act operates in a parallel fashion to the federal industrial instruments  Those instruments reward continuous service by an employee with one employer  The State Act imposes a charge on employees in the industry to make provision for employees in the industry to enable them to receive long service leave benefits and  with the agreement of the employer  actual long service leave  Long service leave charges can be recouped by an employer if the employer pays an employee long service leave benefits under the instruments  The State law and the federal instruments co exist in harmony such that each of them may be considered supplementary to or cumulative upon the other  see Worthing at   and Ex parte McLean   HCA         CLR   at     per Dixon J  There is nothing in the State Act which denies or varies a right  or privilege conferred by the federal instruments  see Ansett Transport Industries  Operations  Pty Ltd v Wardley   HCA         CLR   at   per Wilson J   ii  Does the State Act enter a field intended
