Limited v Bunn   FCA    I am advised that Mitre   held meetings on Monday    December   and that further meetings are to be held today which may lead to the parties negotiating and seeking to agree upon an Implementation Agreement  If an agreement can be reached  the parties will need to apply to the Court and seek shareholder approvals for the schemes of arrangement which are proposed  The

status quo until trial when the rights of the parties can be determined  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   referred toCastlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at   Mason ACJ identified the principles which govern the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in both private and public law litigation  He said      In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show   that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case  in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief    that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted  and   that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction appliedAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThose principles were addressed by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   where Gummow and Hayne JJ said at       The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   This Court  Kitto  Taylor  Menzies and Owen JJ  said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued            The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case  in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the tiral of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief     The second inquiry is     whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted            By using the phrase  prima facie case  their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed  it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial  That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument  With reference to the first inquiry  the Court continued  in a statement of central importance for this appeal            How strong the probability needs to be depends  no doubt  upon the nature of the rights  the plaintiff  asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks    Footnotes omitted  referred toBeecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR

omitted  That case was concerned with a publication by the national broadcaster and a claim for defamation as a result of the material broadcast  Gleeson CJ and Crennan J agreed with the principles stated by Gummow and Hayne JJ and  in particular  that the proper principle for the grant of an interlocutory injunction was as stated in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    They said at       In the context of a defamation case  the application of those organising principles will require particular attention to the considerations which courts have identified as dictating caution  Foremost among those considerations is the public interest in free speech  This is not a case in defamation but it is a case in injurious falsehood and for a contravention of s   of the TPA  The first applicant seeks to have this Court restrain the respondent making statements about the way in which the first applicant has carried on its business and might carry on its business if the first applicant were to succeed in having Mitre   accept its proposal  It seeks an order restraining the respondent s right to freedom of speech  The status quo is sometimes difficult to establish and depends upon the viewpoint one might take  Mr Livesey QC  who appeared on the second hearing  said that the status quo was effectively identified as his client s right to make a proposal to the Mitre   shareholders franchisees uncontaminated by any misrepresentations made by the respondent to those shareholders franchisees  The respondent on the other hand would say that the status quo was his right to communicate with people  shareholders franchisees  who might be affected in the future by the way in which the applicants conduct their business
