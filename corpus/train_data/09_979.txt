Combined Gunggandji People v State of Queensland   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCommissioner of Main Roads v The North Shore Gas Company Limited     CLR  Both the huts and the slab on which they stood were improvements within this definition  as were the gardens  fences and the lavatory  The definition includes things which would normally be characterized as fixtures  usually owned by the owner of the fee simple or  in the case of Crown land  the Crown  Section  A clearly contemplates ownership of improvements by somebody other than the Crown or the holder of the fee simple title pursuant to a deed of grant  The intention cannot have been to authorize the grant of a lease to the owner of improvements who already held the fee simple title  In Commissioner of Main Roads v The North Shore Gas Company Limited     CLR   at   the majority of the High Court  Barwick CJ  McTiernan  Kitto and Taylor JJ  said    Differences of opinion from time to time have arisen concerning the true meaning and operation of the principle expressed in the maxim  quicquid solo plantatur  solo cedit      but  primarily  it is applied to determine the right of the owner of land to things affixed to or imbedded in the soil  Whatever is fixed to the freehold is said to become part of it and is subjected to the same rights of property as the land itself       The presumption is said to be rebuttable and  it seems to us  it must be so when a statute empowers someone other than the owner of land to affix to or embed things in the soil and yet retain ownership of the things so affixed or embedded  Section  A seems necessarily to contemplate such a situation  As was pointed out in argument  ss     and   of the Land Act   also seem to have contemplated somebody other than the Crown owning improvements situated on Crown land  It has not been submitted that any person other than Mr Ludwick might own improvements erected by him on the Bukki block  Since the hearing in this matter  the Minister for Lands has indicated that he is satisfied that the two sheds stood on the land at the date of the deed of grant and that Mr Ludwick owned them  The Council is also satisfied as to those matters  The State submits that although s  b  of the Land Act   continues the application of s  A to deeds of grant made prior to the commencement of that Act  it does not continue the operation of other relevant provisions of the Land Act    Further  it submits that pursuant to s   of the Land Act     references in s  A to provisions of the Land Act   are to be taken as references to the corresponding sections in the Land Act     Counsel for Mr Ludwick submit that s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Qld   the  State Interpretation Act  preserves his rights pursuant to s  A  Section  A provides that the terms of any lease are to be in accordance with  the provisions of this Division  prima facie referring to Division V  Reservations in Deeds of Grant  which is contained in Part XI  Grants  Reserves and Reservations for Public Purposes   Further  s  A expressly deprives the Minister for Lands of his capacity to refuse to approve a proposed lease pursuant to s   of the Land Act     The State submits that s   of the Land Act   now imposes the requirement for ministerial approval  the effect of which would  presumably  also be negated by s  A  The State submits that the conditions of any lease will be regulated by s   of the Land Act     and not by the  provisions of this Division   Mr Ludwick submits that s    dealing with ministerial approval  and s   of the Land Act    dealing with conditions  continue to apply for the purposes of s  A consideredAbbott v Minister for Lands   AC  The question as to whether ss   and   of the Land Act   or ss   and   of the Land Act   should be applied as imposing a requirement for ministerial approval of any lease and in fixing its term was  in argument  treated as dependent upon the nature of the entitlement derived by Mr Ludwick pursuant to s  A  Broadly speaking counsel for Mr Ludwick submit that he obtained a right to a lease upon terms to be determined in accordance with the Land Act    On that basis they submit that s  c  of the State Interpretation Act applies so as to preserve such right  That section provides that the repeal or amendment of an Act does not affect a right  privilege or liability acquired  accrued or incurred thereunder  The State submits that Mr Ludwick has no accrued right to a lease but rather a  right arising from an Act  or a  right to take advantage of an enactment  such right being the right to take action in accordance with the law as it is at the time  In support of this argument the State relies upon a line of decisions commencing with Abbott v Minister for Lands   AC   and ending with the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Australand Corporation  Qld  Pty Ltd v Johnson     Qd R    I need only make brief comments concerning those cases  In Abbott the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  on appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales  considered legislation which permitted any person to tender for the conditional purchase of unsold Crown land  Such a purchase would normally have been subject to a condition requiring three years of bona fide continuous residence prior to grant of the freehold title  However  where the purchaser already held fee simple land a purchase of adjoining land would not have been subject to the condition of residence  At some stage the relevant statute was amended to remove the advantage previously available to existing landholders  The question was whether or not a landholder could purchase adjoining land upon the previous  more favourable conditions  At   the Judicial Committee said    It may be  as Windeyer J  observes  that the power to take advantage of an enactment may without impropriety be termed a  right   But the question is whether it is a  right accrued  within the meaning of the enactment which has to be construed      Their Lordships think not  and they are confirmed in this opinion by the fact that the words relied on are found in conjunction with the words  obligations incurred or imposed   They think that the mere right  assuming it to be properly so called  existing in the members of the community or any class of them to take advantage of an enactment  without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right  cannot properly be deemed a  right accrued  within the meaning of the enactment citedAustraland Corporation  Qld  Pty Ltd v Johnson     Qd R  The question as to whether ss   and   of the Land Act   or ss   and   of the Land Act   should be applied as imposing a requirement for ministerial approval of any lease and in fixing its term was  in argument  treated as dependent upon the nature of the entitlement derived by Mr Ludwick pursuant to s  A  Broadly speaking counsel for Mr Ludwick submit that he obtained a right to a lease upon terms to be determined in accordance with the Land Act    On that basis they submit that s  c  of the State Interpretation Act applies so as

it is at the time  In support of this argument the State relies upon a line of decisions commencing with Abbott v Minister for Lands   AC   and ending with the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Australand Corporation  Qld  Pty Ltd v Johnson     Qd R    I need only make brief comments concerning those cases  There is also a particularly useful summary of the question in Resort Management Services Ltd v Noosa Shire Council     Qd R   per McPherson JA at   and per Fryberg J at      I was also referred to the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Australand   That matter concerned a statutory right to avoid a contract for the purchase of a prescribe interest in a managed investment scheme where the invitation to subscribe had been issued in contravention of a provision of the Corporations Law  now repealed   The provision was repealed with effect from   July    In certain cases  the transitional provisions continued the operation of the section until   July    On   September   the appellants purported to avoid their contracts pursuant to the section  At first instance the primary Judge held that such avoidance was of no effect  The Court of Appeal upheld that decision  I was particularly referred to a passage in the judgment of Keane JA at      That passage offers a useful commentary on the cases to which I have referred but  with great respect  it does not seem to take the matter any further consideredDirector of Public Works v Ho Po Sang   AC  In Director of Public Works v Ho Po Sang   AC   the Judicial Committee considered a matter arising under Hong Kong planning law  The law contemplated the exercise of a vice regal discretion to permit rebuilding on land occupied by tenants of the owner  Relevantly  their Lordships observed at     It may be  therefore  that under some repealed enactment a right has been given but that in respect of it some investigation or legal proceeding is necessary  The right is then unaffected and preserved  It will be preserved even if a process of quantification is necessary  But there is a manifest distinction between an investigation in respect of a right and an investigation which is to decide whether some right should or should not be given  Upon a repeal the former is preserved by the Interpretation Act  The latter is not  His Honour referred to Ho Po Sang where the relevant party was held to have had only a  hope or expectation  and continued    The rights conferred by the Aboriginal Lands Rights Act do not fall into this category  On the other hand the Act does not in terms expressly confer a right in the land on the applicant at the time the claim is made  It envisages that there will be an investigation by the Minister of the facts and if the facts establish that the conditions in the definition are satisfied the Minister is then bound to grant the claim  If the Minister refuses  the court on appeal again investigates the same matters but the onus is put on the Minister  As it seems to me  assuming the conditions were in fact satisfied  the Land Council did not merely have a right to have its claim investigated  it had a right to have the claim granted  If the Minister wrongly refused to grant it  it had the right to have the court grant it  The right might be said to be a conditional one  namely  conditional upon the relevant facts being established  but the right was nonetheless a right because it was conditional  At   his Honour said    These decisions satisfy me that a statutory right will be preserved notwithstanding the repeal or amendment of the statute even though the right can only be implemented by a non discretionary decision of an official or a court  provided that the statutory machinery for obtaining that decision has been in set in train before the repeal or amendment  The cases contemplate at least three distinct situations in which s   might be engaged  Firstly  the relevant legislation might create a right which  by force of the legislation  accrues without any qualification or requirement for further action  Such a right will survive repeal of the relevant legislation  Secondly  the legislation may confer a right upon persons having certain qualifications  Such legislation may contemplate an investigation to determine whether a particular person has the relevant qualifications  Using the language of Ho Po Sang   there may be a need for investigation to ascertain whether the requirement for such qualifications is satisfied  Such a right will also survive repeal of the relevant statute  That situation is to be distinguished from that in which an investigation is carried out for the purpose of determining whether or not a right should be granted  The former situation was considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the Land Council case where it was said that a right which could only be implemented  by a non discretionary decision of an official or a court  would survive   provided that any statutory machinery has been set in train before the repeal or amendment   The  non discretionary decision  seems to be the equivalent of the investigation contemplated in Ho Po Sang   Finally  where a particular procedure has been commenced  there may be a right to have the procedure completed in accordance with the statute in its unrepealed form  This was the case in Esber   Pursuant to s  A  the person  shown to own such improvements shall be entitled  to the grant of a lease  Much of the argument in this matter proceeded upon the basis that satisfaction of the Minister for Lands and the Council as to ownership of the improvements was a condition precedent to any right conferred upon the owner  However such an approach puts too much emphasis upon the form of the section and too little upon its clear intention  There can be no doubt that the intention was that the owner of improvements be entitled to a lease  It was necessary for the Council  as trustee  and the Minister for Lands to be satisfied that a particular person was the person entitled to a lease relating to the improvements in question  However that requirement seems to be a process of the kind contemplated in Ho Po Sang   namely an investigation necessary in order to give effect to an entitlement  rather than a condition precedent to such entitlement consideredMathieson v Burton     CLR  In Mathieson v Burton     CLR   the High Court was concerned with legislation which provided that following the death of a lessee of prescribed premises  a child of that lessee  over the age of   years  who was residing with the lessee immediately before his or her death  could  until grant of probate or letters of administration  continue to exercise the same rights of possession as the deceased lessee would have done had he or she lived  In   the legislation was amended to narrow the class of protected person  The respondent to the appeal in the High Court was the daughter of a deceased lessee who had died in    There had been no grant of probate or letters of administration  The daughter claimed the right to occupy the premises pursuant to the legislation in its unamended form  The High Court upheld her claim  In particular  at   Gibbs J said    In my opinion when the Act of   was passed the respondent had an existing right to continue in possession of the subject premises  That right had arisen out of  and had been defined by  reference to  facts that had occurred before the Act of   was passed  On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the so called right was in truth merely an immunity or protection from eviction which endured only so long as the statutory provision creating it remained in force  With all respect  this submission gives insufficient force to the words of s   A  that subsection purports to create and confer a right of the same kind as the lessee would have had if he had lived and I can see no justification for ignoring these words and refusing to recognize as a right that which the legislature has expressly described as such  It is true that the right was both personal and temporary it was not capable of assignment and endured only until representation of the estate of the deceased lessee should be granted or until a court of competent jurisdiction should make an order to putting the respondent out of possession     However  to say     that the right  is of a qualified  limited and transitory nature  is to define or explain the nature of the right but is not to deny its existence consideredNSW Aboriginal Land Council v Minister Administering The Crown Lands  Consolidation  Act and the Western Lands Act     NSWLR  In NSW Aboriginal Land Council v Minister Administering The Crown Lands  Consolidation  Act and the Western Lands Act     NSWLR   the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered the terms of Aboriginal land rights legislation  Such legislation had provided that any transfer of land to an Aboriginal Land Council should be in fee simple  In May   the Act was amended to provide that in certain circumstances  such land should be granted by way of lease in perpetuity  On   April   the Land Council had applied to the Minister for the transfer of certain land  The Minister refused the claim  The Council appealed to the Land and Environment Court  On   September   the Minister decided to approve the application to the extent of granting a lease in perpetuity under the amended legislation  In the Land and Environment Court  the Land Council sought a declaration that it was entitled to a transfer in fee simple  The Court of Appeal held that a statutory right would be preserved  notwithstanding the repeal or amendment of the statute  even if the right could only be implemented by a non discretionary decision of an official or a court  provided that the statutory machinery for obtaining that decision had been set in force before the repeal or amendment  At     Hope JA  with whom the other members of the Court agreed  said    In my opinion     the power which s   confers upon the Land and Environment Court is not a discretionary power but a power which it is bound to exercise in favour of the claimant in the circumstances specified in the subsection      What then is the nature of the right which the Land Council had after it had made its claim  when it claim was being investigated by the Minister  and when it lodged its appeal to the Land and Environment Court  It is easier first to say what it was not  It was not a mere right existing in the members of the relevant class of the community  to take an advantage of an enactment  without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right      nor was it a right to set in train an application for a grant which the Minister or on appeal  the court might  as a matter of discretion  grant or refuse      The cases contemplate at least three distinct situations in which s   might be engaged  Firstly  the relevant legislation might create a right which  by force of the legislation  accrues without any qualification or requirement for further action  Such a right will survive repeal of the relevant legislation  Secondly  the legislation may confer a right upon persons having certain qualifications  Such legislation may contemplate an investigation to determine whether a particular person has the relevant qualifications  Using the language of Ho Po Sang   there may be a need for investigation to ascertain whether the requirement for such qualifications is satisfied  Such a right will also survive repeal of the relevant statute  That situation is to be distinguished from that in which an investigation is carried out for the purpose of determining whether or not a right should be granted  The former situation was considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the Land Council case where it was said that a right which could only be implemented  by a non discretionary decision of an official or a court  would survive   provided that any statutory machinery has been set in train before the repeal or amendment   The  non discretionary decision  seems to be the equivalent of the investigation contemplated in Ho Po Sang   Finally  where a particular procedure has been commenced  there may be a right to have the procedure completed in accordance with the statute in its unrepealed form  This was the case in Esber   It is true that in the Land Council case  Hope JA added the additional requirement that any statutory mechanism have been commenced in order that the entitlement should survive repeal of the relevant statutory provision  In the present case  there is no requirement that the owner take any step for the purposes of s  A  It was assumed in argument that the owner of improvements was to undertake the task of satisfying the Minister for Lands and the Council of his or her ownership  However the section does not say that  nor does it provide for any particular mechanism to be initiated by the owner  It is possible that Parliament contemplated that the Council or the Minister for Lands would investigate the ownership of improvements with a view to regularizing the position as to ownership and occupancy  The likelihood of such a statutory intention is increased when one considers that the legislation was  as I have said  designed to remedy some of the disadvantage suffered by a severely disadvantaged group in our society  The reference in s  A  to an  application  for the Minister s approval of a lease is to an application by the Council  See s    I should also point out that use of the present tense  stands  in s  A a  suggests that the entitlement arises at the date of the deed of grant  In my view  the effect of s  A is to confer a right upon the owner of improvements  subject only to satisfactory investigation of the question of his or her ownership  The right which an owner held pursuant to s  A  prior to the repeal of the Land Act   was a right to a lease in accordance with that Act  Such right would be within either the first or second category identified above  If the entitlement were to one lease for whatever period the Council decided upon  then that right would survive pursuant to s   of the State Interpretation Act  However I consider that s  A should not be construed as authorizing the grant of only one lease  Section  A confers an entitlement upon a person who owns improvements on relevant land at a particular point in time  The section does not limit the period during which such a person holds that entitlement  If so entitled as at the date of the deed of grant  an owner will be so entitled for the rest of his or her life  This case provides an example of such an entitlement being addressed many years after the date of the deed of grant  It seems to have been assumed in argument that an owner is entitled to only one lease  Such an approach might not fulfil the apparent objective of allowing the owner of improvements to continue to enjoy the benefits of his or her improvements  The shorter the term of any lease  the less would be the capacity to enjoy such benefit  Section  C a  of the State Interpretation Act provides that words in the singular include the plural  It would be more in accordance with the intention of the section if it were read as authorizing the grant of a lease at any time during the life of a relevant person  and regardless of whether any lease had previously been granted pursuant to the section  In the event that such a lease expires during the owner s lifetime  another may be granted  The right to receive a lease is vested in the owner of improvements as at the date of the deed of grant  It cannot be transferred or pass by will or on intestacy  However  where a lease for a fixed term has been granted  and the lessee dies during the term  the right to the balance of the term will be an asset of the estate  Given that the entitlement is to receive a lease from time to time  the better view is that such lease is to be pursuant to the law as it stands at the time at which each lease is granted  and that s  A should now be read  pursuant to s   of the Land Act     as referring to the relevant provisions of that Act  Counsel for the State submits that s  A requires that the improvements be situated on the land both at the date of the deed of grant and at the date on which any lease is granted  In my view s  A should be construed as creating an entitlement to a lease as at the date of the deed of grant  and that subsequent removal of the improvements is irrelevant  The huts were still on the Bukki block as at date of the deed of grant  The foundation slab was  and remains  on the block  having been extended and incorporated into the larger hut  It is probable that there were also gardens  fences and a lavatory on the land at the date of the deed of grant  At least some of the fencing and gardens presently on the block probably pre date the deed of grant  There is no doubt that there were improvements on the land on   October   and that the slabs and  probably  some remnants of earlier fencing and gardens remain at the present time  Section  A  provides that the lease be of the land on which the improvements stand and  where the improvements involve a building or structure used as a residence  a reasonable area of land  being the immediate environs of the improvement  As to the purpose for which the land was used  the relevant time is again the date of the deed of grant  At the time that the Pollards moved on to their land at Bukki in late   or early   Mr Ludwick s niece was living in a small shed on the Bukki block  She resided there for about a year  It is more probable than not that either Mr Ludwick was living there as at   October   or that his niece was so residing  or about to commence doing so  Both Mr Ludwick and Ms Yeatman said that their relationship commenced in about    It is reasonable to infer that as at   October   the land was being used as a residence  It is possible that it was vacant for a relatively short time  but more probable that it was occupied on that date  In any event a period of temporary vacancy would not detract from the fact that the improvements were being used as a residence  This is particularly so  given that when he left  Mr Ludwick apparently intended to return to the Bukki block after his sojourn at Bilma  His plans changed when he met Ms Yeatman in   but it seems that he  and perhaps they  always intended to move to the Bukki block eventually consideredEsber v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR  In Esber v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   the High Court considered the entitlement of a former member of the Defence Force who had applied to redeem weekly payments of compensation so that he might receive a lump sum in lieu as prescribed by the relevant statute  The application was refused  The applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision  After application  but before determination  the relevant provision was repealed  The repealing Act provided that proceedings instituted under the earlier legislation  but not completed upon repeal   may be continued on and after that day and  when the proceedings are so continued  the relevant authority and the Commonwealth shall be parties to those proceedings   Reliance was placed upon s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   the  Commonwealth Interpretation Act  which was  in terms  similar to s   of the State Interpretation Act   The majority  Mason CJ  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ  held that the relevant section of the earlier Act conferred substantive rights  Their Honours said at     If it be assumed that the appellant did not have a right to redemption in the sense first discussed  he had a right to have his claim to redemption determined in his favour if the delegate had wrongly refused his claim  To borrow a sentence from the judgment of Hope JA in NSW Aboriginal Land Council v The Minister           The right might be said to be a conditional one  namely conditional upon the relevant facts being established  but the right was nonetheless a right because it was conditional       Once the appellant lodged an application to the Tribunal to review the delegate s decision  he had a right to have the decision of the delegate reconsidered and determined by the Tribunal  It was not merely  a power to take advantage of an enactment       Nor was it a mere matter of procedure       it was a substantive right       Section   of the Acts Interpretation Act protects anything that may truly be described as a right   although that right might fairly be called inchoate or contingent        This was such a right  It was a right in existence at the time the   Act was repealed  That being so  and in the absence of a contrary intention  the right was protected by s   of the Acts Interpretation Act and was not affected by the repeal of the   Act  The cases contemplate at least three distinct situations in which s   might be engaged  Firstly  the relevant legislation might create a right which  by force of the legislation  accrues without any qualification or requirement for further action  Such a right will survive repeal of the relevant legislation  Secondly  the legislation may confer a right upon persons having certain qualifications  Such legislation may contemplate an investigation to determine whether a particular person has the relevant qualifications  Using the language of Ho Po Sang   there may be a need for investigation to ascertain whether the requirement for such qualifications is satisfied  Such a right will also survive repeal of the relevant statute  That situation is to be distinguished from that in which an investigation is carried out for the purpose of determining whether or not a right should be granted  The former situation was considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the Land Council case where it was said that a right which could only be implemented  by a non discretionary decision of an official or a court  would survive   provided that any statutory machinery has been set in train before the repeal or amendment   The  non discretionary decision  seems to be the equivalent of the investigation contemplated in Ho Po Sang   Finally  where a particular procedure has been commenced  there may be a right to have the procedure completed in accordance with the statute in its unrepealed form  This
