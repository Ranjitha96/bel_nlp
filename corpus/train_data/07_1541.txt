Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAce Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The above legal principles  and others  were conveniently set out by Weinberg J in Ace Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd   FCA   at      I have concluded that APM has failed to demonstrate that it is solvent  it having the burden to the requisite civil standard to prove solvency  I have reached this conclusion for a number of reasons   In order to demonstrate solvency  reliance was finally placed by APM upon a report of James Edward Miller dated   August   an expert accountant  who prepared a Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement of APM as at   August   and provided a report as to solvency as at   August     In addition to what I have concluded above  there are other matters which demonstrate that APM has not discharged the onus of proving solvency       i  APM has failed to comply with the statutory demand of the creditors  and that of a supply creditor  T   G Welding Pty Ltd    ii  APM has been in default under mortgages over its property  and has no immediate or foreseeable capacity to service the mortgages    iii  The application for winding up was made on   March   over six months ago  On   June   in the written submissions of APM  it was stated   APM  is able to raise sufficient funds with which to pay for its short term creditors and it is anticipated that it will receive further funds in the near future from the sale of a properties  sic    It is conceded that there are other further supporting creditors   APM  will be able to use the funds that it is capable of raising and which it is anticipated of receiving in the near future with which to pay these debts    This has not eventuated despite the time lapse and there is no evidence to suggest that there will be sufficient funds to pay creditors in the near or reasonably near future  All the evidence relied upon by APM over recent months simply raised possibilities which have not eventuated     iv  APM has been involved in disputes and legal proceedings with a number of people in addition to the Supreme Court proceedings mentioned above  The proceedings instituted already do not appear to be capable of resolution in the short term     v  APM s books and records are incomplete and unsubstantiated  There have been a number of suggestions by APM since this matter was first heard to the effect that the new director Mr Fisher would take steps to put the books of accounts in order these suggestions have not been fulfilled and even Mr Miller in his report of   August   necessarily relied upon incomplete and unsubstantiated records    vi  No director can make a declaration of solvency  The then current directors of APM on   June   resolved that APM was solvent as at that date  but this is obviously not sufficient to persuade me that the company was solvent at the date of hearing of this application    vii  No cash flow statement or projections have been provided by APM despite ample opportunity to do so in these proceedings    viii  There is no material to demonstrate that the company  in its attempts to refinance or obtain sufficient funding  will succeed in the foreseeable future or at all see Crema  Vic  Pty Ltd v Land Mark Property Developments  Vic  Pty Ltd     ACLC   at   per Dodds Streeton J  Re Presha Engineering  Aust  Pty Ltd     ACLC   at   and Ace Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd   FCA    citedASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the event that I appointed a liquidator  it was submitted by the creditors that the liquidator be appointed as receiver of certain trust assets  In the appropriate case this could be ordered see ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd   FCA   citedASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd     ACSR   In my view  the appropriate approach is to appoint the liquidator who has power to administer any trust assets  at least at the early states   see Crest Realty Pty Ltd  No    in liquidation      NSWLR   and Wells v Wily   NSWSC     and the liquidator can approach the Court if any problems arise  I would not think it desirable to separate the function of the liquidator and any receiver of the trust assets in this case  and these functions should  at least initially  be fulfilled by the same person  The liquidator may apply to the Court if his appointment needs to be extended to that of receiver of the trust assets or if he needs further assistance  Equally  if any conflict arises because of the appointment of Mr McCann to other companies associated to APM  he can apply to seek directions on how to deal with that conflict  see ASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd     ACSR   at   citedBahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Woodgate v Leonard   NSWSC     Barrett J said  at     The jurisdiction discussed in these cases is an extraordinary and protective jurisdiction  It is separate from the jurisdiction involved in protection of confidential information and the enforcement of fiduciary duty  This is made clear  in particular  in the extract from the judgment of Whealy J just quoted  The concern is with the due and proper administration of justice in a proceeding before the court  The jurisdiction exists to ensure that the integrity of the proceeding is maintained  Identification of the means needed to maintain that integrity will  of course  depend on the nature of the proceeding and its likely course   See also Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria  No     FCA   citedBoucher v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   The above considerations were all matters I could take into account in considering whether it was in the interests of justice that the proceeding be re opened  see Smith v New South Wales Bar Association  No     HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan  Dawson  Toohey JJ and Gaudron JJ  Urban Transport Authority of NSW v Nweiser     NSWLR   at     per

consideredBrowne v Dunn     R   I should indicate that Mr Miller was not cross examined upon his report of   August   by any of the creditors  supporting creditors or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  ASIC   which was given leave to intervene in these proceedings   APM contended that in these circumstances  because of the rule in Browne v Dunn     R   I should ignore the criticisms made of his report  or give APM the opportunity to recall Mr Miller to address the criticisms   I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn     R   has an important function to play in the course of a trial  as recently made clear by the Full Court in Jardein Pty Ltd v Stathakis   FCAFC     at   to     Where a party intends to contradict or challenge the testimony of an opposing party s witness  the party is obliged to put that witness on notice that his or her account will be challenged  Browne v Dunn     R    This gives the witness an opportunity to respond to the allegations  The reason this is done is as a matter of basic fairness  See Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     NSWLR   per Hunt J      Adherence to the rule in Browne v Dunn also gives the party calling the witness the chance to adduce supporting evidence which might not otherwise have been led      Compliance with the rule requires only that the substance of the contrary version is put to the witness  and not every detail of the challenge  White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd v Flower   Hart  a firm      ALR   at   per Goldberg J      In a civil case the consequences of a failure to observe the rule will vary  However  they will usually be related to the central object of the rule which is to secure fairness      In Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission     NSWLR   Mahoney JA said  at              This kind of problem may arise at different times in the litigation  It may arise during the trial  Thus  where a party fails to cross examine a witness at all or on a particular matter  it may be prudent for the trial judge at the time to draw the attention of counsel in an appropriate way to the effect this may have on the later conduct of the trial  It may be that the question arises at a later stage in the trial when counsel seeks to call evidence contradicting the witness or discrediting his evidence  or seeks to address upon the basis that the witness  evidence is untrue  The trial judge may then have to determine what course should be followed  Sometimes the interests of justice may be served by having the witness recalled for cross examination  Sometimes the circumstances may be such that the only way in which justice can be achieved is by directing that  for example  it is not open to counsel  in address  to make such suggestion  What is to be done will depend  as I have said  upon the circumstances of the case           A possible consequence of a breach of the rule may be that the party in breach will be prevented from suggesting that the witness  testimony should be disbelieved  Another possible consequence will be the exclusion of evidence that challenges the witness  account with respect to those matters upon which there was no cross examination  A third possible consequence will be to permit the witness to be recalled so that the breach can be remedied  One thing is clear  The rule is not simply to be ignored      The rule in Browne v Dunn has not been abrogated under the uniform Evidence Acts  Heaton v Luczka  unreported  New South Wales Court of Appeal    March   per Beazley JA  Indeed  s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  specifically enables the recall of a witness where there has been a breach of the rule and therefore implies its continued existence   In any event  whilst I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn may apply to expert testimony  there is no rule of law requiring that evidence not challenged in cross examination be accepted  In this case  APM has an onus of proof to establish solvency  The legal approach to such a task is well established on the authorities  The real attack in this case was that Mr Miller s evidence as to solvency should not be accepted as it was based upon incomplete records and unsubstantiated source material  a mistaken approach to what needs to be shown to prove solvency  and the fact that the qualifications made to the report were such that the conclusion of  marginal  solvency could not be accepted by this Court  It seems to me that all a cross examiner would have put to Mr Miller on this basis would be the very qualifications to his report Mr Miller himself acknowledged  which in themselves show his report of   August   could not satisfy the Court as to solvency  APM and Mr Miller have not been unfairly treated  APM came to Court bearing the onus of proof as to solvency  but in my view has failed to provide the  fullest and best  evidence of its financial position citedCommissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd     ACLC   At the outset

in respect of the solvency of APM  The factors leading to its current position may be relevant if they could impact upon APM s ability to pay its creditors in the near or foreseeable near future  The  fraud  allegations would hardly impact upon that issue following upon the evidence that had been presented to me by APM  particularly through the report of Mr Miller of   August    There is also the need for finality in litigation and the particular need for prompt resolution of winding up applications putting aside the public interest  there is  as this case shows  the possibility of the evidence becoming stale or out of date  see Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb s Excavations Pty Ltd     ALR   at   followedGeelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Young J said in Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean   FCA   at       The crucial question  therefore  is whether on the evidence before me a fair minded  reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that Vogrig and WVL be restrained from acting for GSS in these proceedings  In answering this question it must be borne in mind that this is an application for a permanent injunction  Yunghanns v Elfic Ltd  unreported  Supreme Court of Victoria  Gillard J    July    It must also be borne in mind that the Court s jurisdiction is an exceptional one  it is to be exercised with appropriate caution and due weight must be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of the solicitor of its choice without due cause   The application was brought at a late stage in the proceedings  after I had reserved judgment  Even if I considered Saxbys had in some way acted improperly  in the exercise of my discretion  I would not at the stage the proceedings had reached have restrained Saxbys from future participation in the proceeding  The cost  inconvenience and practicalities of requiring lawyers to cease to act are a proper basis to refuse relief see Young J in Geelong School Supplies   FCA   at   and    Subject to a limited re opening being permitted to APM after I reserved my judgment  the hearing of the proceedings was otherwise at an end   It was suggested that this Court would need to determine  after a proper hearing  Saxbys  conduct and the effect their conduct had on a fair trial of these proceedings   No proper basis was established for such an enquiry  As I have said  Saxbys have brought the potential conflict to the attention of the relevant persons  and I do not assume that any of their alleged improper conduct has impacted upon a proper and fair trial in these proceedings  No particulars of such impact were provided to the Court even to give cause to make further enquiry citedHindmarsh Medical Clinic v Hindmarsh Family Practice Pty Ltd     IPR   The above considerations were all matters I could take into account in considering whether it was in the interests of justice that the proceeding be re opened  see Smith v New South Wales Bar Association  No     HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan  Dawson  Toohey JJ and Gaudron JJ  Urban Transport Authority of

Pty Ltd     IPR   at     per Mansfield J distinguishedHorwath Corporate Pty Ltd v Huie     ACSR   APM also contended that APM s financial position must be considered from its position as a  trustee company  APM having a right of indemnity that was equal to the value of the benefits that it provided to the trust estate and that was equivalent to the value of any liabilities that it has incurred  whilst acting as trustee of the trust  It was further contended that the indemnity ranked as a first charge upon the assets of the trust and  if the Court were not satisfied of the solvency of APM  that it should exercise its power to accede to the request of APM to be removed from the office of trustee  a request made during the course of the hearing  upon certain undertakings being made as to certain funds  In effect  APM wanted a receiver to take the place as trustee upon APM s removal as trustee  In addition  APM submitted in reliance upon comments of Young J in Horwath Corporate Pty Ltd v Huie     ACSR    at   that the courts have traditionally have been reluctant to wind up a trustee company as difficult questions of rights and entitlements are involved that would need to be determined by litigation  and there would be no useful purpose in winding up the trustee upon its removal from the office of trustee   I do not consider that the contentions of APM should be accepted  At the outset  I do not accept that the principles applied by Young J in Horwath   ACSR   which was a case concerning a trust and not a corporation  apply to APM  as was contended by APM  APM cannot be treated as a  trustee company  simply because it holds assets on trust for certain beneficiaries  In any event  unlike that before Young J  this is a case where it is necessary for a skilled insolvency practitioner to go through the books and records  having regard to their current state as accepted by Mr Miller and APM itself  Further  the liquidator once appointed will be in a good position to deal with competing claims  which may involve no litigation at all   The simple answer to the other contentions of APM is that in this case  accepting a right of indemnity exists  it is a right which has not been shown will result in the foreseeable future in the availability of funds to pay creditors  This is a case where there will be issues to be determined as to whether a right of indemnity can be exercised  assuming it exists in theory  because of the actions of APM  There is the question of whether the trustee  APM  has properly incurred liabilities in acting as trustee  only if it has done so will it be entitled to be indemnified out of the trust assets followedJardein Pty Ltd v Stathakis   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  I accept that the rule in

Presha Engineering  Aust  Pty Ltd     ACLC   In addition to what I have concluded above  there are other matters which demonstrate that APM has not discharged the onus of proving solvency       i  APM has failed to comply with the statutory demand of the creditors  and that of a supply creditor  T   G Welding Pty Ltd    ii  APM has been in default under mortgages over its property  and has no immediate or foreseeable capacity to service the mortgages    iii  The application for winding up was made on   March   over six months ago  On   June   in the written submissions of APM  it was stated   APM  is able to raise sufficient funds with which to pay for its short term creditors and it is anticipated that it will receive further funds in the near future from the sale of a properties  sic    It is conceded that there are other further supporting creditors   APM  will be able to use the funds that it is capable of raising and which it is anticipated of receiving in the near future with which to pay these debts    This has not eventuated despite the time lapse and there is no evidence to suggest that there will be sufficient funds to pay creditors in the near or reasonably near future  All the evidence relied upon by APM over recent months simply raised possibilities which have not eventuated     iv  APM has been involved in disputes and legal proceedings with a number of people in addition to the Supreme Court proceedings mentioned above  The proceedings instituted already do not appear to be capable of resolution in the short term     v  APM s books and records are incomplete and unsubstantiated  There have been a number of suggestions by APM since this matter was first heard to the effect that the new director Mr Fisher would take steps to put the books of accounts in order these suggestions have not been fulfilled and even Mr Miller in his report of   August   necessarily relied upon incomplete and unsubstantiated records    vi  No director can make a declaration of solvency  The then current directors of APM on   June   resolved that APM was solvent as at that date  but this is obviously not sufficient to persuade me that the company was solvent at the date of hearing of this application    vii  No cash flow statement or projections have been provided by APM despite ample opportunity to do so in these proceedings    viii  There is no material to demonstrate that the company  in its attempts to refinance or obtain sufficient funding  will succeed in the foreseeable future or at all see Crema  Vic  Pty Ltd v Land Mark Property Developments

ANZ Banking Group Ltd     ACLC   at     The question of solvency must be assessed at the date of the hearing  although relevant future events are not to be ignored  Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd     ACLC at     referred toRon Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar     Qd R   APM then submitted  in reliance upon the principles enunciated in Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar     Qd R   at   per McPherson JA  that there would be no benefit to the creditors in the trustee company being wound up  and it was trite law that a creditor can claim to be subrogated to the right of indemnity of the trustee company and directly enforce the debt against the trust assets or even the beneficiaries personally   The way in which these submissions were put seemed to relate both to the question of solvency and the discretion to be exercised by the Court as to whether to order a winding up  assuming I was not satisfied as to solvency  As a matter of procedure  APM moved the Court for its removal as trustee  the appointment of a receiver  and that a winding up not be ordered by the Court   As to APM s reliance on Ron Kingham Real Estate   Qd R   in that case the question of whether the trustee had properly incurred liabilities was not a matter that was or could be in contention  The defendants could not  having authorised the action of the trustee  have complained of a breach of trust   Putting aside the correctness of the decision in Ron Kingham Real Estate   Qd R   in allowing the trustee s creditor to sue trust beneficiaries directly to enforce the trustee s right of indemnity against the beneficiaries  I do not consider it appropriate where there is an issue or potential issue as to whether the right of indemnity is available in the circumstances of this case to conclude that the creditors should be left to pursue such claims individually  In any event  there is no evidence that there will be sufficient assets to pay the creditors after the secured creditors have been paid  I do not consider that APM s contentions relating to the right of indemnity demonstrate that APM is solvent  assuming that at law there is a right of indemnity in favour of APM  or that such right of indemnity is a factor in favour of exercising my discretion not to wind up the company  If a liquidator is appointed he will be well placed to consider and deal with the question of the right of indemnity  and pursue with priority claims over the beneficiaries   I now turn to other discretionary matters raised by APM and the issue of APM continuing as a trustee and the appointment of a receiver   As I have indicated above  it was contended that if I came to the conclusion that APM had not discharged the burden of proof to show it was solvent  I should not order the winding up of the company but should instead remove it as trustee and appoint a receiver over the trust assets  In support of this approach  evidence was led of a number of creditors who expressed a desire for such a course  It was argued that it would save time and costs if the appropriate person  already familiar with the company  was appointed  in this case Mr Andrew Leonard Dunner   It was further contended that with the number of actions threatened against the company a receiver would be in a better position to defend the company with the aid of the current director  that the principal director  Mr Edwards  who was responsible for the bad state of the books of accounts of the company is no longer involved with APM  and that the current director is taking steps to put the books of accounts in proper order and prepare proper financial statements   In addition  it was argued that because of the operation clause   in the Memorandum of Agreement between APM and the developer  Rocco Antonio Calderone  dated   August   in the event of the appointment of a liquidator  APM would not be able to rely upon its right of indemnity  as the developer would be released from its duties and obligations under the agreement  and the trust properties would vest in the hands of the beneficiaries   I have come to the view that I should order the winding up of APM despite these contentions  In addition to the views I have expressed in coming to the view that APM has not discharged the burden of proof upon it and my views on the report of Mr Miller of   August   I have concluded that APM should be wound up  and that the alternative course of action contended for by APM not be followed  for the following reasons     i  Whilst some creditors do not want the appointment of a liquidator  this is not the universal view of the unsecured creditors  and in any event is not a decisive factor    ii  Whilst the appointment of a receiver familiar with the company already may save some time and costs  this is not the important consideration when balanced against the important public interest of ensuring an insolvent company ceases trading even if only a presumed insolvent company    iii  Clause   does not  in my view  release the developer from any past responsibilities or liabilities it may have had under the agreement all it seems to do is to release  upon the appointment of a liquidator  the developer from any further duties and obligations under the agreement from the date of the appointment  In any event  even if clause   does have the result as contended for by APM  including the vesting of trust property in the beneficiary  the other factors I have relied upon in these reasons would indicate that it is appropriate for the company to be wind up  the public interest being a paramount consideration where APM is unable to prove its solvency and the books of accounts are incomplete and are unsubstantiated  Upon vesting of the trust property in the beneficiaries  the company will still have a beneficial interest with priority over the beneficiaries if  as trustee  it has a right of indemnity as submitted  If the debts have been incurred in the administration of the trust  the liquidator can call upon the right of indemnity    iv  I do not consider that there are now better prospects for the creditors as a whole  including the unsecured creditors  if the company  with or without a receiver  were allowed to continue to trade on citedSandell v Porter   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At the outset I set

supreme ct  html  In my view  the appropriate approach is to appoint the liquidator who has power to administer any trust assets  at least at the early states   see Crest Realty Pty Ltd  No    in liquidation      NSWLR   and Wells v Wily   NSWSC     and the liquidator can approach the Court if any problems arise  I would not think it desirable to separate the function of the liquidator and any receiver of the trust assets in this case  and these functions should  at least initially  be fulfilled by the same person  The liquidator may apply to the Court if his appointment needs to be extended to that of receiver of the trust assets or if he needs further assistance  Equally  if any conflict arises because of the appointment of Mr McCann to other companies associated to APM  he can apply to seek directions on how to deal with that conflict  see ASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd     ACSR   at   followedWoodgate v Leonard   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct
