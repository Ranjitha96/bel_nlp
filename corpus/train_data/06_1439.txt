Hume Computers Pty Ltd ACN       v Exact International BV   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBurger King Corporation v Hungry Jack s Pty Limited   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  In my opinion  there is a serious question to be tried at a final hearing as to whether Exact  and through it ESA  have breached an implied obligation of good faith to cooperate in achieving the contractual objects found in the Distributorship Agreement  The principle embodied in this implied obligation was stated by the NSW Court of Appeal in Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack s Pty Limited   NSWCA   at   and following  The obligation includes an implied covenant not to prevent the performance of the contract or to withhold its benefits   By keeping the Distributorship Agreement on foot and thereby obliging Hume to perform its obligations to locate and service customers  whilst at the same time asserting a right to entice those customers away from Hume  Exact appears to be acting in breach of its implied obligation  This is a sufficient basis to warrant the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief subject to considerations of the balance of convenience   An alternative basis available at this stage of the proceedings is that the information about customers supplied by Hume through the portal is given to Exact for a limited purpose and is otherwise confidential  Exact s assertion that it is entitled to use this information to target Hume s customers during the course of the existing Distributorship Agreement seems to me to raise a serious question of misuse of the information citedHi Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR   ESA also placed some store on the choice of law clause in Article   of the Distributorship Agreement  It was submitted for ESA that the exclusive jurisdiction clause found in Article   would point strongly against the grant of leave to serve Exact outside the jurisdiction  Leave has not yet been granted  but ESA argues at this stage that there are strong prospects that it will be refused when that application is heard  In my view  this argument fails to have regard to the decision of the Full Court in Hi Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR   at      The claims which Hume makes against Exact include claims under the Trade Practices Act which do not ordinarily fall within the purview of this type of clause followedKolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   In deciding the issue of serious question  I do not

Pty Ltd     ALR   at     citedPatrick Stevedores Operations No   Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There was debate about the form of any interlocutory relief  Counsel for Hume relied upon Patrick Stevedores Operations No   Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia No     HCA         CLR   at   for the proposition that relief in wide terms should be granted  and said that this should extend to mandatory injunctive relief if necessary  However  it seems to me that the proper exercise of my discretion is that interlocutory injunctive relief should be limited to the prevention of enticement of Hume s customers  This can be stated in sufficiently clear terms to prevent the actions which ESA has sought to achieve  in particular at the   October   marketing event  The precise steps which ESA must take to comply with the injunction will be up to it  but clearly enough ESA and Mr Urand should be restrained from soliciting the business of Hume s existing customers in the manner sought to be achieved by ESA   I will make orders in terms of paragraphs  a A  and  a B  of the notice of motion  The
