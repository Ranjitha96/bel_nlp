htmlImmediately after I made those orders and handed down the reasons for judgment  Mr Priestley made an application in each case pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   He made no submissions as to why leave should be granted other than to repeat the fact that he invoked O   r   as was  he said  his right  In applying the test set out for the grant of leave to appeal in D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR     I have concluded that neither decision was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of leave to appeal  Further  no substantial injustice would be done if leave to appeal were not granted  even assuming that the decisions were wrong  To the extent that it is relevant  the respondents say that  in each case  if the matters were to go to hearing  the same evidence would be adduced on their part although perhaps in a different form  This  however  is not conclusive of the matter citedPriestley v Godwin   FCA  http www austlii
