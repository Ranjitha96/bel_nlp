SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredSZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Federal Magistrate then dealt at length with the s  R  point  He did so pursuant to a further amended application for review that was filed on   October   and presumably stood in place of the original application for review  His Honour held that the matter was conclusively determined against the then applicant by the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCA    In that case  Jacobson J held that s  R  did not apply so as to require conduct engaged in by an applicant in Australia to be disregarded by the Minister unless the applicant relied upon such conduct to support a claim for protection  Counsel for the then applicant submitted that the decision in SZHFE was not correct and should not be followed  He put that submission somewhat boldly having regard to the fact that SZHFE had been the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court and that application had been refused   By notice of appeal filed on   March   the appellant relies upon the following grounds         The Honourable trial judge failed to consider that the Tribunal accepted that  the applicant is a member of Awami League and was involved in Dhaka city Awami League  in considering this matter trial judge made an error         The Tribunal failed to comply with the notice of  A of the Migration Act and the trial judge erred in considering this argument         The Honourable trial judge made an error not to consider the applicant s involvement in Australia   There are many difficulties with that submission  In the first place  it flies directly in the face of SZHFE  a case which has at least twice been considered and followed in this Court  see SZIMY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   and SZHTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at     SZHFE was the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court  That application was dismissed by Kirby and Callinan JJ  who expressly stated that they agreed with the analysis of Jacobson J   Counsel for the appellant submitted that his client had merely responded to questions put by the RRT  and not volunteered any statement about his connection with the local support group  He argued that this meant that this case did not fall within the principle laid down in SZHFE  I am not persuaded by that submission  Nor am I persuaded by his alternative submission that it would be unfair to the appellant to allow regard to be had to his conduct after arriving in this country for the purpose of impugning his credibility but not in support of his claim for protection  There is nothing unfair about allowing a decision maker to apply common sense when considering questions of fact while  at the same time  preventing the system of protection from abuse  The Federal Magistrate was correct to conclude that the RRT did not contravene s  R    It follows that the appeal should be dismissed  The appellant must pay the first respondent s costs   I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for
