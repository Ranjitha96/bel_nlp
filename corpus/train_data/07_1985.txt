Read  in the matter of Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd  Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd ACN        Receivers and Managers Appointed   In Liquidation    FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCorporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd     ACLC   Section  B  was enacted by the Corporate Law Reform Act    Cth  as a result of a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its General Insolvency Inquiry  Report No     known as the Harmer Report  That report proposed the removal of restrictions requiring approvals to be obtained from the Court on various matters by liquidators and trustees in bankruptcy  It also proposed  that restrictions requiring prior approvals should be placed on  inter alia   the power to enter into long term commitments such as the mortgaging or leasing of property of the insolvent   Report Vol      That purpose was reflected in the Explanatory Memorandum for the   Bill and led Austin J to conclude in Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd     ACLC    at       It appears  therefore  that the purpose of s  B  is  in the Harmer Report s words  to restrict the unfettered exercise of powers which may not be conducive to an expeditious and beneficial administration  That suggests that the role of the court  the committee of inspection or the creditors  as the case may be  is to review the liquidator s proposal by reference to those criteria  The role of the approving body  at any rate where that body is a court  is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator s proposal rather than to develop some alternative proposal which might seem to be preferable notfollowedEmpire  Aust  Nominees Pty Ltd v Vince     ACLC   In Empire  Aust  Nominees Pty Ltd v Vince     ACLC   the liquidators of the company had entered into an agreement with a litigation funder which should have had prior approval under s  B   The failure to obtain approval was innocent and based upon ignorance and oversight  Warren J said  at     I adopt a similar view to that expressed by Templeman J in Re Associated Travel   Leisure and Services Ltd  In Liquidation      WLR   that either under the statute  in this case s   of the Law or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court approval may be granted as sought by the liquidator in the present matter     Her Honour went on to refer to s  a  and added  at         I note  further  that s  d  of the Law empowers the court to order an extension of the period for doing any act  matter or thing under the Law  including an order extending a period where the period concerned ended before the application for the order was made and that the court may make such consequential or ancillary orders as it thinks fit   Re Associated

 FCA     I do not consider that s  d  can be relied upon to extend time under s  B    The general power of the Court to give directions to a liquidator under s   of the Act will  in my opinion  also allow the Court to approve the liquidator proceeding under an agreement made without the requisite prior approval under s  B   Further  and equivalent to the inherent jurisdiction of the State Supreme

a statutory court such as the Federal Court it is wise to avoid the use of the words  inherent jurisdiction   Nevertheless  a statutory court which is expressly given certain jurisdiction and powers

the leave should be granted  In view of the general attitude in the Harmer Report that  subject to the particular fetters spelt out in the legislation  liquidators should be given fairly free rein to
