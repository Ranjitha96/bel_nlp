the scheme created by Part XA of the Act  it is not appropriate to award compensation for non pecuniary loss  It said that an award of that type has yet to be made  In response the Union referred to the judgment of Madgwick J in Australian Municipal Administrative Clerical Services Union v Greater Dandenong City Council  No     FCA   at   where his Honour said  in the context of s  U e     It must be borne in mind that conduct contravening Part XA may be of many different kinds and may occur in many different circumstances  The statutory phrase is aimed at giving the Court maximum power and flexibility  to  do what it thinks appropriate in the circumstances  Further  the phrase in section  U f   any other consequential orders  in my opinion  refers to orders consequential upon any order of a kind falling within     subs  b   c  or  e   referred toCommunications  Electrical  Electronic  Energy  Information  Postal  Plumbing   Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Further  as I noted in the first judgment published in this proceeding Communications  Electrical  Electronic  Energy  Information  Postal  Plumbing   Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd   FCA   at     predecessor provisions limited the Court to an order for reimbursement of wages lost   Compensation  is a broad concept which should not be interpreted in a narrow way  In an appropriate case the Court is able to order compensation for non economic loss  There is nothing in the scheme of the Act to support the contrary view  I agree  with respect  with the views of Madgwick J as to the flexibility the Court possesses to  in effect  correct injustice by the ordering of compensation beyond the mere reimbursement of lost wages followedBurazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd     ALR   ACI submitted that if the Court held that it had the power to make an order for compensation which took into account non economic loss it should be guided by the principles for the award of non pecuniary loss which have been developed in unfair dismissal jurisprudence  It referred to the judgment of the Full Court of Industrial Relations Court of Australia in Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd     ALR   at   where the Court said     There is an element of distress in every termination  To ensure compensation is confined within reasonable limits  restraint is required  But in this case there were unusual exacerbating circumstances that make it appropriate to include in the compensation an allowance for the distress unnecessarily caused to Ms Burazin  These circumstances include Ms Burazin having to suffer the humiliating experience of being escorted from Blacktown s premises by the police  Having regard to these circumstances  the compensation assessed by the trial judge should be increased by the sum of   to     ACI observed that the only evidence of non economic loss before the Court was that contained in Mr Williams  affidavit of   October   which referred to the financial stress occasioned by his termination  It said that there was no evidence about any  unusual exacerbating circumstances  associated with the manner of his termination   The Union submitted that the passage in Burazin relied upon by ACI did not articulate a  benchmark test  but only stated why  on the facts before the Court  compensation for distress was appropriate  The Union contended that there is no warrant for limiting compensation for non economic loss to situations which are  unusual and exacerbating   The Union said that Mr Williams suffered an injury in two ways  First  it said that he was not permitted to leave his work premises in a dignified way but was pressed to leave the factory quickly with security summoned  Second  it said that Mr Williams  sudden unemployment caused him stress and tension as a result of his family losing the income of its sole breadwinner   The Union conceded that Mr Williams gave no evidence about the impact of ACI s treatment on him on the day of his termination  It further accepts that some restraint is called for but contends that  in the circumstances  some compensatory order should be made  It also submitted that some compensation should be given to Mr Williams as a result of his affidavit evidence that his termination caused him shock and emotional strain and placed his relationship with his wife under pressure   I make no order as to compensation in the circumstances of this case  To do otherwise would not be acting with restraint  In my view Burazin establishes that something more is required for compensation for non economic loss than the usual element of distress which accompanies most terminations  Whilst  unusual and exacerbating circumstances  is not necessarily the yardstick  there must be something attending a termination which justifies an order for non economic loss  Such an order may have been made in this case had Mr Williams given evidence of the effect on him of his ejection from his workplace by security personnel   Order    There be no order as to compensation   I certify that the preceding
