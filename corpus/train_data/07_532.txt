Exhibit JL  cannot be said to have been to deploy the substance of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes so as to reveal an implied inconsistency with the maintenance of confidentiality  Bennett at     I accept Mr Johnson s submission that it is extraordinary that both solicitors and counsel for Mr Boensch failed to make any or any adequate enquiry as to the extent of the materials contained in Exhibit JL   Some criticism may flow from that  But it does not preclude a finding of inadvertence   I do not accept Mr Johnson s submission that the documents in Exhibit JL  were delivered without qualification as to their status  The qualification was stated in   of the statement to which the Exhibit was attached  Although no evidence was put before his Honour to explain the mistake  the circumstances make it plain that error and inadvertence were revealed   I will make orders     and   sought in the notice of appeal filed on   February     I certify that the preceding

Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR   at     See also the review of the authorities by Allsop J in DSE  Holdings  Pty Limited v Intertan Inc   FCA     and Lombe v Pollak   FCA   at     dealing with the common law test referred toHooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority     NSWLR   Of course   a mere plea  of inadvertence may not by itself necessarily enable a party to avoid a waiver of privilege  Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority     NSWLR   at      Thus  the Court must be satisfied on the material before it that the act was in truth inadvertent   In the present case  inadvertence is established by the fact that even when cross examined on the documents  Mr Leong did not realise that the documents in Exhibit  JL  included the Extra Documents   It was only when Mr Heath realised what had happened that he drew his Honour s attention to the apparent inadvertence  This is clear  in my view from the passages of the transcript that I have reproduced above   It is true that in the last passage of the transcript that I have reproduced at   Mr Heath said that no issue of inadvertence arose  However  this was because  as Mr Heath correctly observed  the amended application before his Honour dealt only with the question of whether privilege could be maintained over Exhibit SDP    With due respect to his Honour  whose judgment was given ex tempore   an examination of the transcript shows that Mr Heath did not eschew inadvertence in relation to the maintenance of the claim over the Extra Documents   Of course  I do not criticise his Honour for delivering ex tempore reasons  It is merely that a full reading of the transcript puts in context the last passage of Counsel s remarks on the issue of inadvertence   In any event  I would add that it is difficult to see how the tender of Exhibit JL  was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality  It was tendered on an application to claim privilege and it was tendered with the express proviso in   of Mr Leong s statement that he did not intend to disclose confidential communications to which privilege may attach referred toLombe v Pollack   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

     CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant  Mr Boensch  contends that his Honour was in error in concluding that the tender was deliberate and that any claim of inadvertence had been eschewed  Mr Boensch submits that  upon the proper application of the principle stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at   there was no implied or accidental waiver of privilege in the six documents   The essential reason why this issue arises is the failure of the solicitor who produced the documents to the first respondent  Mr Pascoe  and to the Court  to make proper enquiry as to the extent of the materials comprised within the documents that were produced and tendered   In the hope of maintaining clarity in my analysis of the question  I will endeavour to distinguish between the documents produced or referred to at various stages of the proceeding   The test of implied waiver of privilege was stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at    Their Honours pointed to an intentional act of disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication   Their Honours went on to say that  w hat brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of fairness  perceive  between the conduct of the client and maintenance of confidentiality   They said the test is  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large    It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s   of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles  see Mann v Carnell at   see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton   NSWSC   at    per
