SZGPB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The test for determining whether fresh evidence should be received  pursuant to s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and Federal Court Rules Order   rule   has been considered by the High Court in CDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR   in the joint judgment of McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ   CLR         where their Honours examined the nature of the discretion to admit fresh evidence on appeal under an analogue s    Their Honours noted that one consideration in construing the section was that it was remedial in nature and its principal purpose was to give to a Full Court a discretionary power to admit further evidence where that evidence  if accepted  would demonstrate the order under appeal is erroneous  The power exists to facilitate the avoidance of errors which cannot be otherwise remedied by the application of conventional appellate procedures and that a further  but in practice subsidiary  purpose is to give the Full Court a discretion to admit further evidence to buttress the findings already made   Their Honours held that another consideration is the effect of the principle that a provision conferring judicial power upon a Court should be construed liberally and without the making of implications  or the imposition of limitations not founded in the words used by the legislature  For that reason  their Honours said that that applied to limitations which previously were to be seen in common law principles governing the grant of new trials upon proof of fresh evidence or from some other source   Significantly  for the purposes of this appeal  their Honours   CLR       pointed out that another consideration is that the discretion given to an appellate Court hearing an appeal against an order made is the exercise of original jurisdiction  in this case by the Federal Magistrates Court  Their Honours said that it was highly unlikely that the Parliament  in conferring jurisdiction on a Full Court to hear appeals  intended that the analogue to s   should be construed in a way that would have the practical effect of obliterating the distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction  and continued       Nor can the availability of further evidence relevant to the issues in the appeal be treated as equivalent to a ground of appeal  proof of which prima facie entitles the appellant to a new trial  The power to admit the further evidence exists to serve the demands of justice  Ordinarily  where it is alleged that the admission of new evidence requires a new trial  justice will not be served unless the Full Court is satisfied that the further evidence would have produced a different result if it had been available at the trial  Without that condition being satisfied  it could seldom  if ever  be in the interests of justice to deprive the respondent of the benefit of the orders made by the trial judge and put that person to the expense  inconvenience and worry of a new trial
