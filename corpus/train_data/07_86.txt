referred to her as   Lina    Ms Obieta claims that when Mr Norman apologised for calling Ms Cordova  Lina  this created hostility from other students in the class  She claims that Mr Norman s less favourable treatment of her had the effect of violating or impairing her rights on an equal footing with other students and made her feel ridiculed  As such she claims that she was subjected to harassment or bullying which is at law    being subject to any other detriment    Such conduct is alleged to be a breach of ss     and   of the RDA and s   of the SDA   Mr Norman says that he inadvertently referred to Ms Cordova as Lina  realised his mistake and apologised to Ms Cordova  He states that it was not an attempt by him to incite other students to feel contempt for Ms Obieta   Ms Obieta states that during the class discussion on   September   Mr Norman came closer to her  looked at her and said in a nasty way     Oh  I don t want to be representing a client who assaulted somebody   Ms Obieta claims that when called upon to recite something  Mr Norman referred to Ms Davis as   Lina    When Ms Obieta s name was called out  Ms Obieta alleges that Ms Davis made the noise of a duck or chicken  She claims that Ms Davis was mimicking manner of speech or her Asian accent in class and that Ms Davis made racist sounds in her presence  She claims that such conduct was harassment and constitutes   being subject to any other detriment    Ms Obieta claims that this constitutes a breach of ss      C and   of the RDA   Ms Davis states that she has no recollection of

argument or   against   it  He made a comment to the effect   my two blue eyed good friends over here would report that there is discrimination and the other group would report there is no discrimination    Ms Obieta says that Mr Norman indicated that one who would be advocating that there was no discrimination came from the Philippines  thereby indicating Ms Obieta  and the other had a history of China  thereby indicating Ms Chong  another student in the class  Ms Obieta claims that by reason of Mr Norman saying such words loudly and repeatedly on two occasions  she felt

the SDA  discrimination  harassment or victimisation based upon Ms Obieta s sex must be established on the balance of probabilities  see Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc v South Australia and Another  No      SASR   at   citedWaters and Others v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  To succeed in establishing a claim under s  A  of the RDA that there was an act involving a distinction based on  or done by reason of  her race  colour  decent or national or ethnic origin  Ms Obieta must establish that a term  condition or requirement that was not reasonable in the circumstances was imposed upon her  see s  A a   As was held by McHugh J in Waters and Others v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR   at   in reference to a similar provision in Victorian anti discrimination legislation  see s  a  Equal Opportunity Act    Vic  such term  condition or requirement would need to be identified with precision   Further  under s  A b  Ms Obieta must established that she does not or cannot comply with the term  condition or requirement and under s  A c  that the requirement has the purpose or effect of interfering with the recognition  enjoyment or exercise  on an equal footing  by persons of the same race  colour  descent or national or ethnic origin as Ms Obieta  of any relevant human right or fundamental freedom   Section   of the RDA relevantly provides for a right of equality before the law and that the laws of the Commonwealth  States and Territories are to apply generally to all people regardless of their race  colour  national or ethnic origin  Ms Obieta must show that under a particular law  she does not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race  colour or national or ethnic origin  or that she enjoys that right to a more limited extent  Once this has been established then notwithstanding the particular law in question  by force of this section  she is entitled to enjoy the right to the same extent as persons of another race  colour or national or ethnic origin   The question of causation that arises in the application of s  C a  has been considered in numerous cases  In Purvis v New South Wales  Department of Education and Training  and Another   HCA         ALR   at   the High Court explained per Gleeson CJ  at     per McHugh and Kirby JJ  at   per Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ  that the accepted test for causation in the context of anti discrimination legislation focuses on the  genuine basis  or  the true basis  or  real reason  for the act of the alleged discriminator  The question of causation was also considered in Bropho   FCR at   wherein French J referred to the description by Kiefel J in Creek v Cairns Post   FCR at   of the key causation issue as  whether anything suggests race as a factor  in the act in question  Kiefel J at   adopted the approach to the construction of statutory provisions similar to s   of the RDA taken by McHugh J in Waters   CLR at     In Toben v Jones   FCAFC         FCR   at   Carr J agreed with the adoption by Kiefel J of the approach taken by McHugh J in Waters   CLR  At   Carr J said       The authorities on the issue of causation in the context of the discrimination legislation were reviewed by Kiefel J in Cairns Post at      It seems clear from what her Honour said at   that she regarded the assessment of a reason as being an objective one  but not one which excluded any evidence of the relevant person s intention or motive  Regard was to be had to all the circumstances  I respectfully agree with that approach
