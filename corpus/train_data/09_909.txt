MZYCA v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedW A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Magistrate treated this as a complaint that the Tribunal placed too much weight on the findings of fact upon which it based its conclusion that the applicant s evidence was not credible  I think that is the correct complexion to put upon this ground  But again it is not a procedural fairness complaint  In any event  the Magistrate rejected it because the Tribunal s findings on which its conclusion on credibility were based were open to it on the evidence  After referring to a number of authorities on findings as to credibility  his Honour said at   that the Tribunal had not failed to use  or had palpably misused  the advantage it had of having heard and seen the applicant give evidence  Nor had it acted on evidence that was inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence or which was glaringly improbable  Nor were the probabilities strongly against the findings it made in rejecting the applicant s evidence  See W A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         ALR   at     In connection with this ground the applicant asserts a breach by the Tribunal of s   of the Migration Act   in not assessing her claims in the manner the section requires  Section   requires the Tribunal to review a valid application for review of an RRT reviewable decision  The Magistrate correctly rejected this complaint  He said at       the RRT performed its duty under s   to consider the claims made by the applicant and the evidence before it  The RRT considered the evidence of the applicant given to the Department and the oral evidence given at the hearing  The RRT considered and accepted her claim that  as a Hindu  the applicant genuinely cares about the welfare of cows and may have assisted her grandfather in this regard  However  the Tribunal rejected the rest of the applicant s claims  Those findings were open to it on the evidence before it         This ground is an attempt to review factual findings by the Tribunal which is not open to a Court conducting judicial review     No error has been shown in the Magistrate s rejection of reliance on s    The Tribunal carefully considered her claims and the evidence she provided in support of them  There is no doubt that it  reviewed  the Tribunal s decision as required by s    No error has been shown in the Magistrate s rejection of ground      There is no prospect that the applicant would establish this ground on an appeal  Ground   is that the Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Tribunal acted in a manifestly unreasonable manner when dealing with the applicant s claims because of its failure to consider them in accordance with Article  A  of the Refugee Convention and  ignoring the aspect of persecution or serious harm in terms of s  R of the Act   There is no substance in these complaints  The Magistrate pointed out  correctly  that at the beginning of its reasons the Tribunal set out the relevant law  the definition of refugee in Article  A  and key components of the definition  It then dealt with the applicant s claims in accordance with the relevant criteria before concluding at   that it was not satisfied that she is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations appliedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlGround   is that the Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in failing to request more information regarding the applicant s activities in the Gitaben Rambhia Trust from the Trust itself  The Magistrate dismissed this complaint  In reliance on High Court and Full Court authority he observed that there is no obligation on the Tribunal to obtain further information  Section   empowers the Tribunal to obtain information  but it does not have a duty to investigate an applicant s claims  See SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     This ground has no prospect of success  In her written submissions the applicant asserts another claim of want of procedural fairness  in that at       and     of his reasons the Magistrate  failed to address the mandatory nature of the requirements of  s   and in effect applied the test of compliance with the common law rules of natural justice to a statutory scheme   The Magistrate s reasons conclude at    None of the paragraphs relied on deal with procedural fairness  However at   his Honour stated that s  B  provides that Division   is an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule  and that no breach of that Division had been shown  The applicant s complaint that the codified natural justice scheme was not applied is baseless citedSZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn her written submission s the applicant claims that the Tribunal in failing to make specific findings failed to reach the required state of satisfaction or non satisfaction as required by s    This complaint has no basis in fact  The Tribunal made specific findings about the claims and evidence before it  As it explained at   to   of its reasons  it did not accept most of those claims and evidence  The Magistrate said  correctly in my view  that once the Tribunal had found that the applicant did not satisfy the criteria for a visa  it was not required to make findings on all other matters that may have been raised in evidence  A Tribunal is not required to refer in its reasons to every item of evidence before it  Thus a failure to refer to a particular piece of evidence does not require a conclusion that it has been overlooked  SZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     I need not pursue this matter further  because the applicant provided no particulars of the specific findings she said the Tribunal should have made citedSZJDA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn my view none of the grounds in the draft notice of appeal or the written submissions has any prospect of success  All of them are quite without merit and would be bound to fail if an extension of time within which to appeal were granted  They have been propounded without any reference to the contents of the reasons of the Magistrate from whose decision the applicant seeks leave to appeal  Accordingly I refuse to grant an extension because it would be pointless to do so  Cf SZJDA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA      I certify that the preceding fourteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
