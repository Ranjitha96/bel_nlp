Deutsche Asia Pacific Finance Inc v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredState of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commissioner concedes that the application for vacation of hearing dates is very late but submits that the taxpayer would suffer no prejudice which would not be compensated by an appropriate costs order  State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     The taxpayer disputes this on the basis that the tax in dispute  in excess of   million  was paid to the Commissioner over   months ago and is retained by him pending the outcome of these proceedings  To vacate the hearing dates would only extend the time that the taxpayer has been out of pocket   The lateness in bringing the application and the basis of the application are explained in an affidavit  sworn   May   by an officer of the Australian Taxation Office  the ATO  within the ATO s Legal Services Branch who has the carriage of the matter  He deposes         The issues raised in these proceedings are difficult and complex  involving                 a complex financial transaction between a large Australian financial institution  the Commonwealth Bank  and a U S  subsidiary of a large financial institution  Deutsche Bank   the Transaction  and         the interpretation of articles of the Convention between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income  dated   August   as amended by the Protocol signed on   September    the Convention                On   March   the Commissioner s counsel provided the Commissioner with written technical advice in relation to these proceedings             In the course of considering that advice  my colleagues and I also gave consideration to an aspect of the Convention which had not previously been taken into account by the Commissioner nor the subject of counsel s advice  namely the specific US law purpose for which Article   of the Convention is addressed             As a result  the Commissioner instructed the AGS to engage a lawyer with expertise in United States law  I am informed and verily believe that in response to the Commissioner s instructions  the AGS engaged Professor David Rosenbloom of the NYU School of Law on   May               On   May   a conference was held between representatives of the Commissioner and Professor Rosenbloom        The Commissioner now wishes to adduce evidence in these proceedings in relation to the meaning under United States law of the term  contingent interest  which is relevant to the interpretation of Article   of the Convention and the matters which a US Court would take into account in construing Article   of the Convention        The specific new matter which the Commissioner now wishes to argue may briefly be summarised as follows                  Article   of the Convention is a clause peculiar to double tax treaties to which the USA is a party  It seeks to deny the   tax rate limit otherwise in Article    the Interest Article  to certain payments which are or which would otherwise be treated as interest under the Convention          Article   together with corresponding articles in the USA s other tax treaties  derives from the notion of  contingent interest  under US domestic law  The expression  contingent interest  is used in the U S   Technical Explanation  relating to Article    That material has a status similar to extrinsic material under Australian law          The Commissioner wishes to contend that                            Article   should be construed by reference to relevant extrinsic material and consistently with US domestic law about the treatment of  contingent interest  and             The income derived by the applicant from its interest in the Industrie Limited Partnership would be considered to be  contingent interest  under US domestic law                 The Commissioner further wishes to review the evidence and his position in relation to Article  b         Following the conference held with Professor Rosenbloom  on   May   I gave instructions to the AGS to apply to this Honourable Court to have the hearing in these proceedings vacated  In giving these instructions I took into consideration the Taxation List Directions issued by the Federal Court on   April    The Commissioner is concerned that an application to vacate the hearing will result in delay in the proceedings  On the other hand  the Commissioner is also concerned to ensure that this Honourable Court has before it evidence  including expert evidence  that will be relevant and of assistance to the Court in determining the difficult and complex issues that have arisen in these proceedings             I am also instructed that our counsel put the applicant on notice of the application to have the hearing vacated  I am informed and verily believe that this occurred around  am on Friday   May     Dealing first with the lateness of the application  I do not think the explanation that has been given for that lateness justifies vacation of the hearing dates  There does not appear to have been any impediment to consideration being given  at an earlier point in time  to the matter on which the Commissioner now wishes to adduce expert evidence  the fact that it had not crossed the minds of the deponent and his colleagues until they considered counsel s  written technical advice  was certainly no impediment  Indeed  on the deponent s own admission  the matter was not even the subject of counsel s advice   That aside  there are two other considerations which are relevant to my conclusion that the explanation of the lateness of the application does not justify the vacation of the hearing dates  First  if I vacate the hearing dates to allow the Commissioner to put on expert evidence  it will be necessary to allow the taxpayer to put on expert evidence going to the same matter  and then  perhaps  evidence in reply  The consequence will be that proceedings which have already been set down for hearing for over seven months will not be heard until the first half of next year  Second  it is not as if the Commissioner is  locked out  so to speak because of an inability to plead a ground of defence not already pleaded  cf   J L Holdings Pty Ltd   It will be open to the Commissioner to frame and put submissions with respect to this particular matter supported by authority  if it exists  extrinsic material such as US Treasury explanations of the purpose underlying Article   of the Convention and  insofar as that provision is predicated on a US model tax treaty  Treasury explanations of that model  Of course  this assumes the relevance of such material to the issue in contest between the parties  It is to that matter I now turn   I am not presently persuaded that the matter on which the Commissioner wishes to adduce expert evidence  namely  that a US Court would construe Article   of the Convention as applying to interest which qualifies within the notion of  contingent interest  as that phrase is understood under US domestic tax law  has any relevance to the tasks of construction and application which this Court must undertake to resolve the dispute between the parties  There was more than a hint in the submissions of counsel for the Commissioner that the relevance of such evidence resided in the desirability for a uniform construction of Article   by the courts of each country  However desirable that outcome may be  a US domestic law concept or notion of  contingent interest  cannot control the construction of a provision of the Convention  the text of which does not use this phrase  and even if it did  in the absence of it having a meaning under Australia s domestic tax law  its meaning under US domestic tax law would not control the application of the provision by Australia  see Article   of the Convention   For these reasons  the motion  including the order to vacate the hearing dates is dismissed  with costs   I certify that the preceding ten   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds
