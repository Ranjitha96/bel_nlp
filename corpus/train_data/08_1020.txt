The University of Sydney v ResMed Ltd   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I have indicated above that in the case of some of the categories  there is a case for deciding that discovery should await the filing of evidence by the University on particular issues  The course of requiring evidence prior to discovery is not novel  see  for example  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd   FCA   esp at    As Gyles J there observed  experience shows that the filing of affidavits often brings to light many documents  I appreciate that this may prove to be an exceptional case in this respect and that it is conceivable that it would be appropriate for the University to be granted leave to file further affidavits after discovery has taken place   Another possible course is to give the parties a further opportunity to consider the category descriptions in the light of what I have said  especially at  ff above  ResMed will have to give discovery at some stage and it may be preferable that this take place now rather than later   In the course of the hearing  counsel for the University suggested two variations to the categories of documents to be discovered at this stage  The first was to limit the documents sought in categories     and   to those created before   December    category   is already limited in this respect   The second was to limit the documents sought in categories     and   by reference to the first in the series of Mirage Masks alone  being the  original  Mirage Mask referred to in para  i A  of the FASOC    Counsel also announced that category  a  is no longer pressed  referred toAveling v UBS Capital Markets Australia Holdings Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I had occasion to discuss the relationship between discovery by  categories of documents  and O   of the Rules in Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd   FCA   and Aveling v UBS Capital Markets Australia Holdings Ltd   FCA     Aveling    In Aveling   I observed  at   that the principles that should guide parties in arriving at descriptions of categories of documents for discovery are the very principles that guide the Court when ordering discovery  Those principles are found in O   r       and   of the Rules which provide             the documents required to be disclosed are any of the following documents of which the party giving discovery is  after a reasonable search  aware at the time discovery is given   a  documents on which the party relies  and   b  documents that adversely affect the party s own case  and   c  documents that adversely affect another party s case  and   d  documents that support another party s case            However  a document is not required to be disclosed if the party giving discovery reasonably believes that the document is already in the possession  custody or control of the party to whom discovery is given        For subrule   in making a reasonable search  a party may take into account       a  the nature and complexity of the proceedings  and   b  the number of documents involved  and   c  the ease and cost of retrieving a document  and   d  the significance of any document likely to be found  and   e  any other relevant matter            If the party does not search for a category or class of document  the party must include in the list of documents a statement of the category or class of document not searched for and the reason why      In Aveling   I said at   It may be appropriate for parties to describe categories in terms which do not expressly incorporate the language of O   r   but that subrule should nonetheless govern the formulation of the categories  Alternatively  of course  the categories may be defined so as to incorporate expressly the terms of the subrule  Whatever approach is taken  it is important to understand that when  as happened in the present case  the Court orders discovery by categories to be notified by one party to another  the Court does not intend that the notifying party be at liberty to widen the discovery obligation beyond the four classes of documents referred to in O   r     Any description of categories of documents to be discovered should be arrived at  whether by the Court or by the parties  in the light of the standard laid down in the rules set out above  It is not clear to me that the parties have approached the question in this way  The question for me on the present motion is whether the disputed categories satisfy the rules  It is often difficult for the Court to be certain that documents falling within a particular category description fall within the rules   It would be permissible for a category to be identified as documents that satisfy both of two conditions    a description of a class of document  and   subrules     and   of rule    the effect of which subrules could be set out in appropriate form   This approach would at least ensure that the documents sought did not exceed either the range of documents referred to in the rules  or the bounds of the category descriptions
