Corp Ltd   FCA         FCR   followedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The  public interest  claimed by the ACCC to require protection of Category III documents from disclosure was said to be to encourage  by ensuring the confidentiality of information they provide  cartel whistleblowers to come forward  In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd   FCA   at     the Court suggested in obiter dicta that such a public interest might exist  In the present case  Counsel for the ACCC put it this way      The public interest     is to induce the Amcors of this world   those who come forward early  under the immunity policy   to give the fullest possible assistance to the  ACCC  to ensure that the cartel is put at an end as quickly as possible  prosecuted  and brought to finality quickly  The more assistance that Amcor gives the  ACCC  in that regard  the better the quality of the admissions and the evidence      Counsel for the ACCC conceded that confidentiality could not be absolute  in that both the ACCC and any potential whistleblower should reasonably expect that the whistleblower might have to testify in open court  ie  the whistleblower s statements might ultimately come into the public domain   Nevertheless  counsel for the ACCC maintained that this expectation was not inconsistent with a reasonable expectation that statements provided to the ACCC will remain confidential because most cartel cases settle with the result that      it never becomes necessary for witness statements of whistleblowers to be used in court  and     the entry into the public domain of witness statements of whistleblowers is the exception rather than the rule   Without being able to rely on the confidentiality of statements not used in court  counsel for the ACCC submitted that whistleblowers might be dissuaded from coming forward and the public interest in rooting out cartel conduct correspondingly injured   Regardless of whatever theoretical merit the argument may have  which I will address shortly  the force of the ACCC s submission was undercut by the evidence of its own witness Mr Cassidy  the officer in charge of the leniency program for cartel whistleblowers  that in the present case Amcor did not seek confidentiality guarantees in its immunity application  In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd   FCA   at     the Court suggested that the force of any public interest immunity claim will be vitiated where the independent witnesses cooperating with the ACCC did not even seek confidentiality  I agree  Moreover  even the broader factual merit of the claim is suspect  as the ACCC led no evidence that any cartel whistleblower  whether in this case or otherwise  has demonstrated reluctance to come forward based on a concern that information provided might become public   The theoretical merit of the ACCC s confidentiality contentions is even more deficient  A cartel claim  by definition  involves collusion between two or more actors  In the same way that it is both inevitable and self evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against  ie  disclosed to  the non cooperating conspirators  it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows  or should know  that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties  As such  the ACCC s claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance  And without such a reasonable expectation  the ACCC s contention that non disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd     ALR   First  there is at least an equal  if not more

created in connection with the ACCC proceeding  Amcor and Visy have discovered the documents in the damages proceedings  but the ACCC seeks to prevent them from producing those documents to Cadbury on

statements   of which three were drafted by Amcor s external solicitors at the direction of the ACCC and three were drafted by ACCC staff and then forwarded to Amcor s in house counsel  Copies of the

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  With respect to advice privilege it was  until recently  uncontroversial that the proponent had to establish three elements    a confidential communication    between a lawyer and client    made for the dominant purpose of giving or receiving legal advice  see Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR        stating that a confidential lawyer client relationship is required  and Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    HCA         CLR   at    adopting the dominant purpose test   The Full Court of the Federal Court has now dispensed with the second requirement  holding that third party communications may come within the ambit of advice privilege  Pratt Holdings   FCAFC         FCR   at     and     However  the witnesses whose statements are at issue here had no express agreement or arrangement relating to confidentiality at the time the statements were made  Indeed  the ACCC s own witness in the present application confirmed that Amcor made no attempt to seek confidentiality  see   below  And it was not suggested that any implied agreement relating to confidentiality of communications between any of the witnesses and the investigators can be identified  It follows that advice privilege cannot attach to communications between the witnesses and investigators  And it also follows that no advice privilege inherently attaches to any documents  ie  the witness statements  summarizing those communications  which is not to say that privilege could never attach to copies or summaries of the communications depending on the purpose for which the copies or summaries were created  see Propend   HCA         CLR    Accordingly  a claim of advice privilege fails with respect to all three categories of disputed documents   It is at this point that the doctrinal relationship between the advice and litigation branches of the privilege becomes relevant  As McLure JA noted in Leighton   the   High Court has made numerous general statements which  on their face  are capable of applying to all categories of legal professional privilege  to the effect that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications   Leighton   WASCA   at     In fact  some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal professional privilege  For example  in remarks quoted by Brennan CJ in Propend   HCA         CLR    at     Mason J stated in O Reilly v State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR   at         But if communications in written form are to be privileged they must still be confidential communications between solicitor and client made for the purpose of advice or for the purpose of use in existing or anticipated litigation         Be that as it may  I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue  leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views   Second  the  free rider  argument fails because it is  ultimately  founded on a theory of  work product  privilege not accepted in Australia  The work product doctrine  recognized by the United States Supreme Court  states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions  strategy  or other  work product  even though not documenting lawyer client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege  may be independently protected from discovery  Hickman v Taylor     US    The problem for the ACCC  however  is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege  Commissioner of Propend   HCA         CLR   at    describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia   Gummow J  Leighton   WASCA   at    stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege   The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs  ACCC Position Paper   Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct    August   at   n   available at http www accc gov au content item phtml itemId nodeId a faa ec e f adef bf fn Leniency position paper pdf  viewed   February     For the sake of completeness  I should first note Cadbury s overall argument regarding the Category I documents  It was based on the fact that the copy witness statements retained by Amcor were just that   copies   and thus under Propend   their privilege status may differ from that of the original  To the extent that I have correctly understood the argument put by counsel  it misunderstands Propend   Propend established that the copy of a document may under some circumstances  ie depending on the dominant purpose for which it was created  be privileged even though the original is not privileged  Propend   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ      per Gaudron J  and   per McHugh J  I do not  however  consider that Propend also establishes the converse  that is  the copy of a document may be unprivileged even though the original is   Instead  I understand Propend to say that a copy of a privileged document will also be privileged unless the privilege has been expressly or impliedly waived  although it may be that allowing a copy to be made in certain circumstances is capable of being conduct constituting such a waiver  such as when a copy is made and communicated to a third party for purposes not related to legal advice or litigation  cf Spotless Group Ltd v Premier Building Pty Ltd   VSCA   at        noting that Propend left the issue open but concluding that whether a copy of a privileged document is privileged is distinct from whether privilege has been waived   As such  Cadbury s argument  notwithstanding the way in which counsel sought to frame it  may be reduced to two questions    are the documents privileged  and   has privilege been waived  Against that background  I now turn to the question of waiver  Cadbury correctly notes that there is no evidence as to how or why copies of Category I documents were made and retained by Amcor or Amcor s external solicitors  As noted earlier  Cadbury agitated this argument as a reverse Propend claim  It is  however  more properly understood as a waiver claim  That is to say  Cadbury appears to argue that although the original documents may have been created by or provided to Amcor under circumstances of confidentiality and even express claims of privilege  allowing Amcor to make or retain copies for its own use is conduct by ACCC inconsistent with its privilege claim citedComplete Technology Pty Ltd v Toshiba  Australia  Pty Ltd     FCR   On the other hand  there is also authority for the

to confidential communications   Leighton   WASCA   at     In fact  some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal

v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR     With respect to litigation privilege  on the other hand  the analysis is not so simple  It is clear that the privilege applies only to documents or

client relationship is not required  Pratt Holdings   FCAFC         FCR    However  in contrast to the settled confidentiality requirement of the advice privilege  the authorities are divided as to whether litigation privilege may attach to communications  or documents summarizing communications  between a third party  independent witness and a client even where they are not confidential  State of New South Wales v Jackson   NSWCA   at      There is some controversy over the need for confidentiality in litigation privilege at common law  and the controversy is particularly material to privilege for communications between client and third party    Leighton   WASCA   at        collecting and summarizing the conflicting authorities   The picture becomes even more complicated if one makes a further distinction  as some authorities do  based on whether such witness statements are found in the hands of the witness or in the hands of the lawyer  A Ligertwood  Australian Evidence   th ed  at     quoted in Leighton   WASCA   at      It is at this point that the doctrinal relationship between the advice and litigation branches of the privilege becomes relevant  As McLure JA noted in Leighton   the   High Court has made numerous general statements which  on their face  are capable of applying to all categories of legal professional privilege  to the effect that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications   Leighton   WASCA   at     In fact  some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal professional privilege  For example  in remarks quoted by Brennan CJ in Propend   HCA         CLR    at     Mason J stated in O Reilly v State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR   at         But if communications in written form are to be privileged they must still be confidential communications between solicitor and client made for the purpose of advice or for the purpose of use in existing or anticipated litigation         Be that as it may  I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue  leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views   That the speculation regarding witness reluctance is likely to be unfounded is further supported by the fact  acknowledged by counsel for the ACCC  that even if production of the Category III documents were barred  Cadbury would be free to undertake its own investigation  As noted by McLure JA in Leighton     Privilege in respect of  the disputed  communications would not prevent the respondent interviewing  third party  witnesses and obtaining all relevant information from them concerning the issues in the litigation   Leighton   WASCA   at     It is perhaps  therefore  unsurprising that counsel for the ACCC ultimately fell back on a  free rider  argument   that is  that Cadbury should not have the benefit of the ACCC s work precisely because it could easily do the work itself  This argument fails for two reasons   Second  the  free rider  argument fails because it is  ultimately  founded on a theory of  work product  privilege not accepted in Australia  The work product doctrine  recognized by the United States Supreme Court  states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions  strategy  or other  work product  even though not documenting lawyer client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege  may be independently protected from discovery  Hickman v Taylor     US    The problem for the ACCC  however  is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege  Commissioner of Propend   HCA         CLR   at    describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia   Gummow J  Leighton   WASCA   at    stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege   The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs  ACCC Position Paper   Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct    August   at   n   available at http www accc gov au content item phtml itemId nodeId a faa ec e f adef bf fn Leniency position paper pdf  viewed   February     In Trade Practices Commission v Sterling     FLR     Lockhart J described the litigation privilege rule as follows      Communications passing between the party and a third person  who is not the agent of the solicitor to receive the communication from the party  if they are made with reference to litigation either anticipated or commenced  and at the request or suggestion of the party s solicitor  or  even without any such request or suggestion  they are made for the purpose of being put before the solicitor with the object of obtaining his advice or enabling him to prosecute or defend an action      See also ACCC v FFE Building Services   ATPR     at     Leighton   WASCA   at     Pratt Holdings   FCAFC         FCR   at       and     In this regard  Amcor s solicitor Mr Meadows testified that his firm  Allens Arthur Robinson  was   permitted to advise Amcor  based on knowledge it obtained in witness interviews summarized in the documents now at issue  subject to any confidentiality constraints that had been agreed    He added that the firm s copies were not being retained   for the ACCC    Thus the argument might go that while Amcor may have been  and may still be  under some equitable or quasi contractual obligation of confidentiality  ie it may not be free to simply distribute the documents as it sees fit  that cannot override the obligations of compulsory court process in this case  see Leighton   WASCA   at    stating that contractual or equitable duties cannot prevail over compulsory court process    To restate the question  it comes down to this  did the ACCC  in allowing Amcor via its solicitors to make and retain copies of the Category I documents  engage in conduct impliedly waiving its privilege  To answer the question  I return to the analysis employed earlier at      In contrast to the Category II and III documents  with respect to which the ACCC ceded complete control over disclosure to Visy by filing and serving the documents  the evidence with respect to Category I was that the use to which Amcor s solicitors could put the documents was limited to one purpose and one purpose only  advising the client  Indeed  as noted earlier  the three documents drafted by Amcor s solicitors could not even be shown to Amcor  The disclosure to Amcor was for a  limited and specific purpose   advice to the client  and  applies only in relation to particular persons and materials    Amcor employees were the particular persons  The materials were the communications and documents recording them  The ACCC s conduct in allowing copies of the documents to be made and retained constitutes only a limited waiver  see   above  It follows that the Category I documents are barred from production to Cadbury   Strictly speaking  I need go no further  However  I think it appropriate before concluding to make a general observation about the ACCC s overall interest in this case and whether the courts are the appropriate forum for its resolution  The ACCC s submissions and the evidence from its witnesses demonstrated a concern that the increasing threat of private suits for damages brought by cartel victims will interfere with the ACCC s ability to obtain the cooperation from cartel participants necessary for it to bring and prosecute penalty actions  The interference was said to arise because potential cooperators will be deterred from coming forward  notwithstanding offers of leniency  by the prospect of having essentially given away the store in the inevitable damages actions  In other words  in considering whether to confess  the potential costs in damages may be seen by a cartel player to outweigh the potential savings in penalties  Distilling the point still further  one can see that the real concern of the ACCC   that is  the real deterrent to cooperation faced by the Amcors of the world   is damages exposure itself  In my view  the confidentiality and free rider arguments ostensibly advanced here by the ACCC are  at best  a proxy for that concern  and at worst a smokescreen obscuring it  To be fair  the appropriate total level of private civil liability  ie  penalties plus damages  an actor should face for cartel conduct is a valid issue  and one which was long ago recognized by authorities and commentators in the United States in the context of cooperation and leniency  see eg  Giancarlo Spagnolo   Leniency and Whistleblowers in Antitrust  Centre for Economic Policy Research Discussion Paper Series No     August   at   available at http www cepr org pubs dps DP  asp  visited   February     But to acknowledge the ACCC s concern is not to approve of its proposed method for resolving that concern  On the contrary  the ACCC s attempt to use common law privilege doctrine to protect cooperators when they are faced with private suits for damages  albeit partially successful here  appears to me to be misguided  Whether cartel whistleblowers such as Amcor or those who cooperate with the regulators after the commencement of penalty proceedings  either by settling like Visy or in some other manner  should be rewarded or encouraged by reduced exposure or enhanced protection in damages proceedings is a broad question of policy that should be addressed by the legislature  not by ad hoc judicial tinkering through the backdoor of privilege   The parties and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission may  if they wish  file and serve written submissions of not more than   pages as to    whether Visy is still bound not to produce the Category II and Category III documents by its implied undertaking in the ACCC proceedings  and   if so  whether special circumstances exist such that the Court in its discretion ought to release Visy from that undertaking  The matter will be set down for further hearing  if necessary  at a date to be fixed in

considered this conflicting authority  Although the Full Court did not formally decide the issue  it did suggest that the proper approach must recognize the distinction between legal professional privilege and the implied undertaking  with respect to the implied undertaking  see     below   The Full Court s criticism of the Smoothdale line of cases  at   was in the following terms      The difficulty with the approach in Smoothdale is highlighted by the approach of Barrett J in Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd   NSWSC   in which his Honour distinguished cases such as Smoothdale on the basis that they were concerned with use in one proceedings of a statement or an affidavit filed and served in another  Barrett J  on the other hand  was dealing with the question whether a party could tender  as an admission  parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party in the same proceeding  Barrett J said  buttressed by ample authority  that this could be done  because it was within the range of permitted use the purpose of the proceedings  Barrett J was undoubtedly correct  Thus  it is necessary to posit a limited waiver  within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings  which may bring about the result  as in Austress   that it is in the other side s power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross examining on its contents    Emphasis added  citedState of New South Wales v Jackson   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  With respect to litigation privilege

collecting and summarizing the conflicting authorities   The picture becomes even more complicated if one makes a further distinction  as some authorities do  based on whether such witness statements are found in the hands of the witness or in the hands of the lawyer  A Ligertwood  Australian Evidence   th ed  at     quoted in Leighton   WASCA   at    citedTelstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications  Information Technology and the Arts  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  To put the proposition in different terms  if   it is in the other side s power to destroy the privilege entirely    see   above  it can no longer be said that the original holder can reasonably expect any continued confidentiality  In such circumstances  the existence of the privilege cannot be made to turn on whether the other side in fact places the document into evidence or uses it for examination   either legal privilege exists or it does not  and either the client controls it or they do not  Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications  Information Technology and the Arts  No     FCA   at      If a communication qualifies for legal professional privilege  the privilege is absolute  It cannot be overridden by some supposedly greater public interest  It can be waived by the person  the client entitled to it  and it can be overridden by statute  but it is otherwise absolute     In other words  once it is found that the original holder of the privilege cannot control further dissemination of the document  the privilege is destroyed as a matter of law without further inquiry into whether the communication was in fact disseminated followedTrade Practices Commission v Sterling     FLR   In Trade Practices Commission v Sterling     FLR     Lockhart J described the litigation privilege rule as follows      Communications passing between the party and a third person  who is not the agent of the solicitor to receive the communication from the party  if they are made with reference to litigation either anticipated or commenced  and at the request or suggestion of the party s solicitor  or  even without any such request or suggestion  they are made for the purpose of being put before the solicitor with the object of obtaining his advice or enabling him to prosecute or defend an action      See also ACCC v FFE Building Services   ATPR     at     Leighton   WASCA   at     Pratt Holdings   FCAFC         FCR   at       and   citedWestgold Resources NL v St Barbara Mines Ltd   WASC  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  html  It is sufficient for present purposes to begin by stating that in order to maintain a claim of legal professional privilege  a proponent must demonstrate the communication is protected by  advice privilege  or  litigation privilege   The relationship between the two types of legal professional privilege is just one of the matters that is unclear in Australian privilege law  Some cases support the proposition that  litigation privilege is a separate category of legal professional privilege   Public Transport Authority of Western Australia v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd   WASCA   at

Corporation Ltd v West Australian Government Holdings Ltd     WAR   and Dingle v Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia     FCR    On the other hand  it is also true that the   High Court has yet to make clear whether litigation privilege has an existence and rationale distinct from the advice privilege   eg  Leighton   WASCA   at     AWB Ltd v Cole   FCA         FCR   Ingot Capital
