September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAustralian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOn what basis  then  can it be said  as ASIC contends  that the sale and lease back arrangements in question involve the client making a  financial investment  This is not an easy question to answer  The proper approach in arriving at the answer must be based on the principle that the relevant provisions should be construed broadly  Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    HCA         CLR    Adopting a broad view  it can be said that the investors  the clients  have contributed their homes for them to be used to generate benefits for themselves  The first benefit was the periodic tax free payments extending over many years  The homes were to generate this benefit as they were to be on sold to investors who would provide the necessary funds  Also  there were benefits  or potential benefits  arising out of the leases  It will be remembered that each lease was for the client s life at what appears to be less than the market rent  This gave rise to two benefits  one actual the other potential  First  there was the low rent which was an immediate benefit  Second  there was the potential benefit that would arise if the client were to live longer than expected according to the life tables  Previously I noted that the consideration for the life tenancy  the amount deducted from the purchase price for the property  was based on life tables  If the client outlived the age prescribed in those tables he would receive a benefit  effectively the right to occupy the home for the additional period at no cost  Assuming these to be relevant benefits for the purpose of the definition of  financial investment  it is still necessary to decide whether the word  gives  in the phrase  gives money or money s worth  includes a sale with a lease back  Ordinarily the word  gives  would not carry that meaning  I observe  however  that in the note to s  BAA there are examples of what acts constitute making a financial investment  One example is the subscription of money for shares in a company  In substance this is the acquisition of an asset for its exchange value in the hope of making either a capital profit or receiving income  If  gives  includes the purchase of an asset there is no reason why it should not also include a sale  To this point I have not dealt with whether the statements about the client having a  guaranteed tenancy  or a  guaranteed lifetime tenancy  are misleading  In my view they are not for the reason that the lifetime tenancy which had been granted to the client was in fact  guaranteed  in the only relevant sense  namely that it could not be defeated by MFL  MFLP or any person claiming through them appliedBurke v Dawes   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI base this conclusion on s  e  of the Transfer of Land Act    Vic  and the equivalent provision in the Torrens legislation in other States  The effect of s  e  is that the estate of a registered proprietor of land  including the proprietor of a mortgage  is subject to the rights of a tenant in possession  In this area the relevant principles are clearly established  The first is that the possession of a tenant is notice of any right of the tenant affecting the land  McMahon v Swan   VLR      The second is that  as Dixon J confirmed in Burke v Dawes   HCA         CLR       s   of the Transfer of Land Act    Vic   which is the forerunner of s   was not intended to apply merely to a tenancy as commonly understood  See also Downie v Lockwood   VR     where Smith J said  As appears from the cases the exception in s       e  is to be widely construed  and it is to be treated as producing the result that  any person in actual occupation of the land obtains as against any inconsistent registered dealing protection and priority for any equitable interest to which his occupation is incident  provided that at law his occupation is referable to a tenancy of sort  whether at will or for years   Thus  for the purposes of the section a purchaser under a contract  who is given possession by the vendor and is only a tenant at will  is protected in respect of his equitable ownership  Robertson v Keith     VLR E     So  too  is a vendor who remains in possession until the purchase price is paid  he is a tenant  whatever might be the legal denomination of the tenancy  The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v McCaskill     VLR      It has also been held that an equitable life estate will prevail over a subsequent registered interest  Black v Poole     ALT   appliedDownie v Lockwood   VR  I base this

Australia Limited v McCaskill     VLR      It has also been held that an equitable life estate will prevail over a subsequent registered interest  Black v Poole     ALT   followedFuturetronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR  Given the way in which the scheme was marketed  the provisions in the agreements by which money was promised to be paid to the clients also involved misleading or deceptive conduct  By promising to make the payments  the purchaser company was implicitly stating that it had the capacity to meet that obligation  Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR    In truth the company had no such capacity  These conclusions do not  however  establish contraventions of the relevant sections  Those sections proscribe misleading and deceptive conduct  in relation to financial services   s  DA  or in connection with the supply or possible supply of  financial services   s  DB  or in connection with the sale or grant or the possible sale or grant of a  financial product  that involves an interest in land  s  DC  or in relation to a  financial product  or a  financial service   s  H   It is therefore necessary to consider whether the conduct which I have found to be misleading concerned a  financial service  or a  financial product   As we shall see the two concepts  both of which are defined in the statutes  are interrelated  The relevant provisions in the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act are almost the same  For convenience I will refer to the ASIC Act  Section  BAB  of the ASIC Act provides that a person provides a  financial service  if they  among other things  provide  financial product advice  or deal in a  financial product   Section  BAB  defines  financial product advice  to mean a recommendation or statement of opinion or report that is intended to influence a person in making a decision in relation to a particular  financial product  or class of  financial products  citedMcMahon v Swan   VLR  I base this
