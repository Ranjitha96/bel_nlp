Lang v Comcare   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCanute v Comcare   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Lang s notice of injury and compensation claim adequately disclose the nature of his claimed injury though they may be sparse on the circumstances giving rise to that injury  It is not necessary for me to speculate as to the reason for this as it is not directly relevant to the issue that I must decide  In Canute v Comcare   HCA         ALR   the High Court considered the concept of  injury  under the SRC Act and said  at      First  the Act does not oblige Comcare to pay compensation in respect of an employee s impairment  it is liable to pay compensation in respect of  the injury   Secondly  the term  injury  is not used in the Act in the sense of  workplace accident   The definition of injury is expressed in terms of the resultant effect of an incident or ailment upon the employee s body  Thirdly  the term  injury  is not used in a global sense to describe the general condition of the employee following an incident      emphasis added citedComcare v Nichols   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for Mr Lang referred to Comcare v Nichols   FCA   in which Heerey J applied Phillips v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   in the context of the SRC Act   In the latter case the High Court held  at          the application of the same principles may well mean that in some cases the onus of proving critical facts may rest upon the Commonwealth   Such a case would be where the Commissioner has purported to terminate an employee s right to compensation under an antecedently existing determination by reason of a material change of circumstances  referred toCommonwealth of Australia v Borg   FCA         AAR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for Mr Lang submitted that although the Tribunal identified the correct test for determining whether existing benefits may be cancelled  it failed to apply this test  The Tribunal referred to the decision in Commonwealth of Australia v Borg   FCA         AAR   at   where Jenkinson J said that a decision to cancel compensation should not be made unless the decision maker  was persuaded that one of the entitling circumstances had on or before  the date of the decision  ceased to exist   According to Mr Lang  however  the Tribunal failed to do this   Despite this  however  it does not appear that in substance the Tribunal adopted a lesser standard than that mentioned in Borg   The Tribunal expressly accepted Dr Griffith s evidence that  in the absence of structural injury  of which there is no evidence  it is reasonable to expect that the aggravation would have resolved long before   November     This finding  in conjunction with the reports of Dr Andrews and Dr Kitchin clearly formed the basis for the Tribunal s decision  rather than any paucity of evidence adduced by Mr Lang  Whilst the Tribunal ostensibly applied a  balance of probabilities  standard  in light of the principle in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at   its finding in substance was that Comcare had discharged its evidentiary onus referred toFrosch v Comcare   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In support of its submission that  the injury must be the injury as identified by the notice and claim  Comcare relied on Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford   FCAFC   and Frosch v Comcare   FCA    In Frosch at     Whitlam J commented  with respect to similar requirements in s   of the SRC Act   the essential information to be imparted under s   will be the nature of an injury or ailment and its connection with the employment   I do not take issue with these comments but in my view they do not support Comcare s case   Mr Lang notified Comcare as to his injury and broadly outlined his view as to how this injury occurred  see     above  Although his description was somewhat incoherent in my view  it is sufficient to meet the test outlined in Frosch  Mr Lang s notice indicated the nature of his injury and its connection to his employment  and is consistent with the concept of injury to which the High Court referred   Comcare s determination in   that accepted liability for Mr Lang s injury made no mention of the circumstances in which the injury was incurred  save to say that it was in the course of Mr Lang s employment  Comcare described the injury as  aggravation of a pre existing condition of pain in mid thoracic region   This is the same condition symptom discussed in Dr Talbot s report  Comcare s liability was not restricted to a  nature and conditions  claim made by Mr Lang   Counsel for Comcare argued that the mere fact that Mr Lang s fall in   coincided with the date of his claim does not mean that Mr Lang s compensable injury included injuries sustained in the fall  This  of course  is correct  however Mr Lang claims  with some support from the expert medical evidence  that this fall contributed to the injury that was notified and accepted as a compensable injury and that this injury is a continuing cause of incapacity appliedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Despite this

onus referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Lang s final ground of appeal concerned the Tribunal s failure to give its reasons in respect of several material facts  including  and this was the focus of Mr Lang s submissions  the failure to give reasons for its rejection of Dr Talbot s report as relevant evidence  The Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject the respective pieces of evidence before it  or to accord certain pieces of evidence different weight  It is under no obligation to refer to all of the evidence before it  particularly where  as here  neither party made submissions on it  It would have been open for the Tribunal to reject Dr Talbot s evidence or simply to prefer the evidence of Dr Griffiths  The Tribunal is  however  obliged by s  B  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  to include in its reasons findings on all material questions of fact  As noted in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ and at     per McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  with respect to a similar requirement found in s   of the Migration Act    Cth  this is not an obligation to make a finding on every question of fact that is regarded as objectively material by a court conducting judicial review of the Tribunal s decision   Even if the Tribunal excluded consideration of the   fall at the directions hearing it still had an obligation to give reasons for rejecting evidence that was plainly central to Mr Lang s claim and crucial to a medical report that supported that claim  Mr Lang was entitled to seek review of that decision referred toPhillips v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for Mr Lang referred to Comcare v Nichols   FCA   in which Heerey J applied Phillips v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   in the context

Commonwealth   Such a case would be where the Commissioner has purported to terminate an employee s right to compensation under an antecedently existing determination by reason of a material change of circumstances  appliedTelepacific Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   If Comcare s submission about the directions hearing is incorrect  then plainly the Tribunal was required to indicate why it was that it preferred Dr Griffith s evidence  Given that the Tribunal had before it two medical reports that came to diametrically opposed conclusions it was obliged to explain why it either excluded one from its consideration or  if it considered both reports  why it preferred that of Dr Griffith  Its failure do so makes it impossible to understand the Tribunal s reasoning processes  and is itself an error of law  Telepacific Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at     For this reason Mr Lang s application must be allowed and the matter referred to the Tribunal for

requirements in s   of the SRC Act   the essential information to be imparted under s   will be the nature of an injury or ailment and its connection with the employment   I do not take issue with these comments but in my view they do not support Comcare s case referred toWard v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Mr Lang s initial claim was determined in accordance with the Compensation  Commonwealth Government Employees  Act    Cth   the   Act   That Act has been superseded by the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    Cth   SRC Act  which commenced on   June   and which governs the present application  Section   of the SRC Act provides that a person is only entitled to compensation under the Act for an injury sustained prior to its commencement if the person would have been entitled to compensation under the relevant preceding Act  in this case the   Act   The Tribunal provided a short summary of Mr Lang s medical history  It found that Mr Lang suffered from conditions which caused pain in the thoracic region of his spine prior to his alleged fall in    The clinical notes of Mr Lang s general practitioners in the relevant period  Dr Reeve and Dr Herath  supported this finding   The Tribunal also referred to a report of Dr Andrews  Consultant Neurologist  in August   which indicated that any aggravation of Mr Lang s condition due to his work for the Commonwealth would have only lasted a short period of time  a few months  and to a report of Dr Kitchin that Mr Lang s complaint  in March   was of thoracic degenerative disease   Section   of the   Act provides that no compensation is payable under the Act unless a claim in writing for the compensation was served  as prescribed  on the Commissioner within the relevant time  This provision is a procedural pre requisite to an entitlement to compensation under the Act  see Ward v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission   FCA   at   in relation to a similar provision under the   Act   Comcare submitted that the   fall had not been notified or claimed by Mr Lang and accordingly that liability for that injury had not been accepted by Comcare in    Accordingly  the fall could not have been the subject of Comcare s determination in   and therefore could not be relevant to the Tribunal s review  I accept that the Tribunal s enquiry was limited to a consideration of whether Mr Lang was  as at the date of the Tribunal s decision  entitled to compensation for the injury as claimed however it does not follow from this that any damage to Mr Lang s back that may have been caused by the   fall was necessarily outside of this enquiry
