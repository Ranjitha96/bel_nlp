Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedKowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd     ALR   The motion before me is a predictable sequel to the circumscribed leave I gave Mr Kowalski in Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd     ALR   to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim  That leave was exercised but the respondents  MMA Super and AMP Super  now seek orders either that the proceedings be summarily dismissed pursuant to s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  or that the statement of claim be struck out under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules as disclosing no reasonable cause of action  I intend taking the latter course for the reason that  while the pleading is misguided in its thrust  it cannot be said that the underlying complaint that appears to inform it may not suggest a reasonable cause of action  In their submissions the respondents  while not admitting this to be the case  have come close to identifying that cause of action  though without conceding that it is reasonably arguable or that they do not have a good defence to it   As I indicated in Kowalski  No     the actual dispute between Mr Kowalski and his past employer  Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd  MMAL  has a long history dating to before   March   when his employment with that company ceased  MMA Super  a subsidiary of MMAL  was the trustee of the MMA Staff Superannuation Fund and was brought into that dispute because of claims Mr Kowalski has asserted as to his superannuation entitlements consequent upon the cessation of his employment with MMAL  It is unnecessary for present purposes to outline the many proceedings he has brought against MMAL and MMA Super   Though his complaints in substance relate to defaults of MMA Super  AMP Super has been joined in this proceeding because by a deed of   June   the trust fund was transferred to it as trustee and MMA Super was then wound up as a superannuation entity  The relief Mr Kowalski seeks includes an order for payment of a sum of money out of the fund  hence the joinder of AMP Super citedMinehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd     ACTR   While the structure of the Trust Deed and Schedule C is such that  in the circumstances  Mr Kowalski had some entitlement to be paid a sum out of the fund  the deed did not give him any absolute entitlement to be paid a TPD Benefit as such  For such a benefit to be payable the trustee had to determine whether Mr Kowalski fell within the definition of  Total and Permanent Disablement  in cl   of the Trust Deed  Part  b  of that definition required the trustee to form an opinion as to whether Mr Kowalski was incapacitated to such an extent as to render him unlikely ever to engage or work for reward in any occupation for which he is reasonably suited by education  training or experience  The cl   determination and the opinion embedded in it were ones for the trustee not the court  see Ford and Lee  Principles of the Law of Trusts     and the cases cited therein  Accordingly  absent a favourable determination by the trustee  it cannot be said  as Mr Kowalski claims in his pleading  that he has an entitlement to a TPD Benefit  but cf Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd     ACTR   at   where the court itself executed the trust a rare event   Again the pleading alleges repeated failures by the trustee to consider any of the medical evidence that was available to it and hence whether he was entitled to a TPD Benefit  Assuming that there were times at which a duty to consider so arose  the most that Mr Kowalski could expect from a court by way of relief if any would be a direction to the trustee to consider whether  in the circumstances  a cl   determination should be made and this on the basis of an unreasonable and culpable failure to consider the matter  Mr Kowalski does not seek such relief in this proceeding   There is now a significant body of Australian case law dealing with challenges to the decisions of superannuation trustees not to provide a particular benefit to a member because the trustee has determined that the member did not fall within the relevant trust definition for that benefit  Many of these cases have involved claims for total and permanent disability benefits having criteria similar to those embodied in cl   see eg Jeffrey Guy Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd   NSWSC     Hay v Total Risk Management Pty Ltd   NSWSC     Sayseng v Kellogg

New South Wales  Bryson J    March   citedNeil v Nott   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Underlying Mr Kowalski s complaint about the trustee s omission  though  would seem to be an unformulated assertion that a determination under cl   adverse to him had been made  I put the matter this way for this reason  I earlier referred to the correspondence between Mr Kowalski and the trustee concerning his formal application for a TPD Benefit  This evidence was put on by Mr Kowalski  In the course of that correspondence the trustee s solicitors indicated on instruction that  the Trustee has previously considered and declined your claim for a TPD benefit from the Fund arising from your employment to   March   and including its cessation on that date   Mr Kowalski is unrepresented  In the distinctive circumstances of this matter where he cannot be expected fully to understand the mysteries of the law of trusts  it is proper for the court to endeavour within appropriate limits to ascertain the right that confusedly such a litigant could well be seeking to assert  cf Neil v Nott   HCA         ALR   at     In his oral submissions Mr Kowalski indicated that  though it was said in the   February   letter that the trustee had made a determination adverse to him  he has not been provided with a copy of it or  I would infer  the reasons for it  He equally says he has put on such evidence as he could to satisfy the trustee for cl   purposes citedJeffrey Guy Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu

    Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd   Vidovic v Email Superannuation Pty Ltd  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Bryson J    March     In applying these grounds it is important to have regard to the superannuation context in which the trustee s decision is to be made  As Bryson J commented in Vidovic v Email Superannuation Pty Ltd   It is a marked anomaly to use mechanisms drawn from fields of law remote from employment and relating to trusts for bounty or charity to administer important entitlements in an employment relationship  I find it difficult to understand why the entrenchment of such important rights against review is so usual  and why this kind of arrangement is so commonly found acceptable to employees in view of the economic significance of such decisions and the economic function of superannuation  not well represented in the terms of the documents  as a contracted employment benefit for which value is given  These anomalies appear particularly clearly where  as in this case  the fund out of which benefits are paid is contributory and an employee claiming benefits is claiming to be paid  at least in part  in his own coin  In an arrangement with a contractual character in which value is given in the expectation that a benefit will be available in stated circumstances  a construction in which one party has an entire and unreviewable power to determine whether that party will pay a sum of money to the other or retain it in its own funds has an element of absurdity  Language which appears to produce such a result serves to demonstrate the strength of the expectation of all concerned that the exercise of the power will be honest and reasonable  It is only on that expectation that the transaction could  as a practical matter  be expected to take place at all  and there would have to be an entirely explicit exclusion of such an expectation before language literally capable of excluding it should be given that construction  The context of the employment relationship has an influence which it is impossible to exclude from judicial scrutiny and perceptions of reasonableness of decisions under superannuation deeds   I have dealt with judicial review of discretionary decisions at some length  It probably provides the appropriate rubric which Mr Kowalski has been seeking to divine to have the propriety of his denial of a TPD Benefit tested  I do not necessarily suggest that he will be able to plead a reasonably arguable case that the MMA Super s decision miscarried  let alone that he will succeed in establishing such a case  Nor do I suggest that MMA Super and AMP Super would have no defence to such a claim were it to be made  Nonetheless  in light of the material before me  I do think that the interests of justice require that Mr Kowalski be given one last opportunity I emphasise this to file and serve a further amended application and statement of claim   For the sake of completeness  I should note that  at best  the claim for negligence Mr Kowalski has made hangs off the breach of trust he has alleged  In striking out that claim I necessarily will order that this claim be struck out  I express no view on the viability of any further negligence claim citedMaciejewski v Telstra Super Pty Ltd     NSWLR   Accepting that both under the general law and under cl   of
