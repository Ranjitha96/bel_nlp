SZEQH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredWABZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  When the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the second decision he again asserted that the decision was based upon Mrs Sun s evidence and that he had not been allowed to cross examine her  It is true that the matter was raised in a rather unorthodox way  but nonetheless it was raised  Concerning this complaint the Federal Magistrate said at   and         At particular  f  to ground one and at ground five the  appellant  complains that the Tribunal did not allow him to cross examine Ms Sun  The drafter of this document plainly understood that the Tribunal is not a court of law  see ground five  and that the Tribunal did not have an obligation to allow him to cross examine Ms Sun  As Ms Wong submits  the  appellant  does not have such an entitlement to cross examine persons appearing before the Tribunal to give evidence  Section  b  of the Act plainly provides that the applicant has no such entitlement  see Algama v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs        cited with approval in WABZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs             The Tribunal s analysis reveals that it considered the evidence provided by Ms Sun  discussed her evidence at the hearing with the  appellant  and put to the  appellant  that it was  difficult to accept  the  appellant s  evidence in light of Ms Sun s evidence  and gave him the opportunity  by way of its s  A letter  to further comment  That the Tribunal chose to give greater weight to the evidence of Ms Sun  as opposed to the evidence of the  appellant  is within the Tribunal s discharge of its duty as the finder of fact  I cannot see that the  appellant s  complaint that the Tribunal s preference for the evidence of Ms Sun to his evidence was made without  any substantial and objective evidence to support   On what was before it  it was open to the Tribunal to reject the  appellant s  evidence and to prefer that to prefer that of Ms Sun  The Tribunal gave clear reasons for this  This aspect of the complaint also does not succeed   Ground   in the notice of appeal to this Court  is  The Federal Magistrate erred in law because the Tribunal s decision has obviously included apprehension of bias  Significantly  regarding my requirements to cross examine Mrs Sun  I may understand that the Tribunal may not be a court of law  and thus the Tribunal may not have to do so  But  the key issue is that the Tribunal has given particular weight to Mrs Sun s allegation against me without any substantial and objective evidences   sic   In other words  the Tribunal preferred the evidence of Mrs Sun to my evidence and rejected my claims without any substantial and objective evidences to support   sic    Again  the language may be inelegant and the attribution of bias to the Tribunal may be misconceived  Nonetheless  the claim is sufficient to raise an assertion of lack of procedural fairness and should be understood as such  In any event  the notice of appeal was amended on   April   pursuant to order made on   April   to include a further ground of appeal as follows  The learned Federal Magistrate erred in upholding the Tribunal s error in treating s   of the Migration Act    the Act   as being determinative of the Appellant s application to cross examine Mrs Sun and as a consequence        failing to consider the merits of the Appellant s application to cross examine Ms Sun      failing to permit the Appellant to cross examine Mrs Sun      the  Alleged Errors       The learned Federal Magistrate erred in failing to hold that the Alleged Errors amounted to a failure by the Tribunal to accord the Appellant procedural fairness  The learned Federal Magistrate erred in failing to hold that the failure by the Tribunal to accord the Appellant procedural fairness precluded the Tribunal s decision from being a      decision under this Act      within the meaning of s   of the Act    Of some significance in construing s   is the decision of the Full Court in WABZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    That case concerned the entitlement to legal representation and the discretion to permit such representation  At     French and Lee JJ held that         The effect of the cases referred to is that s  a  applies to applicants for review who appear before the Tribunal to give evidence  An applicant so appearing is  not entitled     to be represented before the Tribunal by any other person   But that is a statement about entitlements  It does not exclude the rules of procedural fairness insofar as they may require representation in the circumstances of a particular case      To displace the common law agency rule is not to displace procedural fairness  although it could no doubt place a considerable obstacle in the way of any suggestion that procedural fairness requires in every case that an applicant be represented by a lawyer or other agent                        The Tribunal clearly has a discretion to allow a person to be represented before it  The question that arises is whether there may be circumstances in which a decision to disallow representation of an applicant before the Tribunal amounts to a denial of procedural fairness   Their Honours went on to conclude that in the circumstances of that case the Tribunal s refusal to permit legal representation constituted a denial of procedural fairness  Hill J reached the same conclusion  It may reasonably be inferred from that decision that had the law remained unchanged  there was  in the present case  a discretion to permit cross examination  Further  a decision not to permit cross examination might  in certain circumstances  have amounted to a failure to accord procedural fairness to the relevant applicant  There is a further question which was not addressed in WABZ   It is whether an applicant who  pursuant to s     is invited to appear to give evidence and present arguments is a person invited to give evidence for the purposes of s    Given the strict limitations upon the content of the rules of procedural fairness imposed by the enactment of s  B   there may well be justification for a strict reading of s   so as to exclude from its operation applicants who appear both to give evidence and make submissions  Such enactment occurred after the decision in WABZ    The decision in Lat is consistent with the more recent decision of the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR   at     It follows that to the extent that WABZ established that a failure to permit cross examination may constitute a denial of procedural fairness amounting to jurisdictional error  it is no longer good law  However  to the extent that the case establishes that the Tribunal has a discretion to permit cross examination  I see no reason to doubt its correctness  It also follows that neither a person attending to give evidence  nor an applicant attending to make submissions  has a right to cross examine witnesses followedMinister for Immigration

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I should refer to the decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR    In the course of considering the present appeal I became concerned by the fact that the decision made no reference to s  B   although the Tribunal hearing had apparently taken place after the commencement of that section  I wrongly assumed that as s  B is a procedural section  it would have applied to all hearings taking place after its commencement  However Mr Knackstredt has pointed out to me that the amending legislation expressly provided that it apply only in connection with applications made on  or after  its commencement   The outcome of this case is by no means satisfactory in the administration of justice  Experience suggests that it is only on rare occasions that applicants will seek to cross examine witnesses in the Tribunal  It may be said that if it is allowed in one case  it will become more common  There may be a degree of truth in that  However it is impossible to overlook the frustration and dissatisfaction which must be caused to an applicant for a protection visa where his or her claim is significantly undermined by evidence from a witness whom he or she may not even know  and whose evidence is not to be tested in any objective way  The right to face and challenge one s accuser or opponent is a fundamental aspect of the public trial process  on both the civil and the criminal sides  Although the Tribunal process may not be adversarial  the matters which it decides are of great importance for the parties  particularly for applicants  The Tribunal cannot  and should not  assume its own omniscience  It may know little or nothing about the motivation of a witness who gives damning evidence about a protection visa applicant  Experience suggests that one way of testing such evidence is to allow cross examination  I do not suggest that Mrs Sun should have been treated as being in any way a suspect witness  However one can understand why the appellant was not satisfied by the way in which the Tribunal decided to act to his detriment in reliance on her evidence   Whilst one would not like to encourage lengthy and unnecessary cross examination in connection with visa applications and review proceedings  each case must be approached on its merits  I am inclined to think that in this case the merits lay in the direction of allowing a limited degree of cross examination  It is a great pity that the appellant has been deprived of that opportunity  However  given the limited availability of judicial review  I can see no basis for intervening   In the circumstances the appeal must be dismissed  I once again thank counsel for their enthusiastic assistance in this matter  I will hear submissions as to costs   I certify that the preceding thirty eight
