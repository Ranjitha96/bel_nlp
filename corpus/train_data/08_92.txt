au au cases cth FMCA  html  Federal Magistrate Nicholls dismissed the application for review   SZDWB v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA    In dealing with the grounds of review and the matters raised in argument  his Honour considered that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons for its conclusion  at    His Honour also considered that the Tribunal s finding that the appellant s political profile was not such as to engage protection obligations pursuant to the Convention was open to the Tribunal on the material before it  at    His Honour also concluded that the distinction drawn by the Tribunal between a high profile political member of the Awami League and an  ordinary member  was not a distinction applicable to the relevant test under s  R of the Act but a distinction drawn from the factual circumstances of the appellant  at    To the extent that the appellant took issue with that finding of fact  his Honour found that it amounted to impermissible merit review which does not found jurisdictional error   As to an alleged breach of s  A of the Act  while noting that the Tribunal had not been obliged to put the information in the   June letter to the appellant  Nicholls FM found that the Tribunal had plainly had regard to the information and the appellant s response to it  at       In this appeal  the appellant appeared in person assisted by an interpreter  He provided submissions in writing that addressed each of the grounds in his notice of appeal  He also emphasised in his oral submissions that his claim was that he was a high office holder in the Awami League and had been targeted on that basis appliedSZEPZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     FCR   Fifthly  the appellant asserts that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by referring to his evidence from the original Tribunal hearing where the matters were not put to him in accordance with s  A  of the Act  Information given to the Tribunal by the appellant is an exception to the requirement in s  A  by reason of s  A b   The reference in the Act to the Tribunal does not depend on the identity of the particular member constituting the Tribunal  Until the Tribunal has made a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by valid application under s     it has a duty to perform that particular review  The Tribunal as reconstituted still has properly before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made   SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     FCR   at       This ground of appeal does not point to any particular error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in reviewing the decision of the Tribunal other than a claim that the Federal Magistrate did not consider the appellant s arguments in relation to the Tribunal s decision   In his written submissions  the appellant contends that the Tribunal did not assess his claim according to s  R of the Act because it came to an incorrect factual finding as to his political profile  Contrary to the appellant s submissions  the Federal Magistrate did consider this ground  His Honour concluded that this was not  as submitted by the appellant  an impermissible limiting of the criteria of s  R but a factual finding on the appellant s claims  at    This was evident from the elaboration of this ground by the appellant at the hearing  when he explained that his political activity was at a  high level  which attracted attack and that the Tribunal had been wrong to conclude otherwise  The factual finding by the Tribunal to the contrary was open to it and a matter for the Tribunal   The appellant has not shown that his Honour was in error in concluding that the Tribunal had properly discharged the functions conferred on it under the Act   There is no evidence to support an assertion that the appellant was misled or  confused  or  misguided  by the   June letter  He responded to it in detail and did not assert in his reply that he failed to understand it  The Federal Magistrate did observe that there was   one confusing or puzzling aspect in what the Tribunal has done in this regard    at   but that related to his Honour s observation that the Tribunal was not obliged by s  A  of the Act to invite comment in writing on the subject matter of the letter  being information given to the original Tribunal by the appellant or contained in country information  within the exceptions in s  A   While his Honour also concluded that the letter may have been sent pursuant to s   rather than s  A of the Act and was directed to the provision of additional information rather than being concerned with the opportunity to comment on information already before the Tribunal  at   this does not support this ground of appeal and does not give rise to jurisdictional error  The Tribunal noted that it had regard to the information   The appellant asserts that the Tribunal did not give any explanation regarding the letters  The Tribunal did in the   June letter indicate the relevance of the first two pieces of information  The third piece of information was country information which the Tribunal was under no obligation to explain  Further  it was apparent from the subject matter of the letter in the context of the claims that in each case the appellant was being asked to comment on information regarding aspects of his claims and the matters he had put to the Tribunal in support   It follows that the appeal should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding twenty
