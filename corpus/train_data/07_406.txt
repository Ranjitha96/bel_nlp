Fenner v Repatriation Commission   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedFenner v Repatriation Commission     ALR   Mr Fenner first claimed a disability pension under the Act as a result of those conditions  or of one or other of them  on   April    Both the Repatriation Commission in August   and then the Veterans  Review Board in September   rejected the claim  In April   the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the AAT  affirmed that decision  However  on   February   the AAT decision was set aside and the matter remitted to the AAT for rehearing  Fenner v Repatriation Commission     ALR     The AAT  differently constituted  on   September   after the rehearing  again affirmed the decision to refuse to grant a disability pension to Mr Fenner   This is an application by way of appeal from that decision  It is confined to errors of law on the part of the AAT  Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  s    Moreover  the application concerns only the AAT s decision with respect to Mr Fenner s condition of alcohol abuse  The AAT also rejected his claim based upon the condition of PTSD  but Mr Fenner does not contend that its decision in that regard involved any errors of law   Section   of the Act renders the Commonwealth liable to pay a disability pension to a veteran who has become incapacitated from a war caused injury or disease   Section   prescribes the circumstances in which an injury or disease is taken to be war caused  Relevantly  those circumstances include where the injury or disease resulted from an occurrence on  operational service   Mr Fenner s trips to Vietnam on HMAS Sydney constituted operational service  Consequently  s   of the Act was enlivened  It provides        Where a claim under Part II for a pension in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a veteran  or of the death of a veteran  relates to the operational service rendered by the veteran  the Commission shall determine that the injury was a war caused injury  that the disease was a war caused disease or that the death of the veteran was war caused  as the case may be  unless it is satisfied  beyond reasonable doubt  that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination     It obliged the Commission  and on review the Tribunal  to determine that Mr Fenner s injuries or diseases were war caused unless the decision maker was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination   It was first contended that the AAT had failed to apply s  h  in its consideration of the claim  I discussed a similar contention in Roncevich v Repatriation Commission   FCA   at       and in Fenner v Repatriation Commission   FCA   at         Section  h  informs the AAT as to how it should proceed in applying the central provisions of the Act  relevantly s   followedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   The operation of ss    A and  B was explained in an oft quoted passage in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   at       Deledio    The provisions require four steps  of which only the fourth is presently relevant  That is because the Tribunal was satisfied of the first three steps  It accepted that the material pointed to an hypothesis connecting Mr Fenner s condition with his operational service  the first step  that there was a relevant SoP  namely the AA SoP  the second step  and that applying the AA SoP it considered that the hypothesis was a reasonable one because it fitted the  template  of the AA SoP  the third step   The application therefore raises the issue as to whether the Tribunal  in addressing those provisions at the point of the fourth step in Deledio erred in law   In Deledio   the fourth step was explained as follows at       The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  or in the case of a claim for incapacity  that the incapacity did not arise from a war caused injury  If not so satisfied  the claim must succeed  If the Tribunal is so satisfied  the claim must fail  It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it  In so doing  no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved   The Tribunal s first step was to identify the condition or conditions from which Mr Fenner was suffering   There was no issue about Mr Fenner suffering from alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence   The Tribunal then proceeded to determine whether that condition was war caused by addressing the four step process described in Deledio    Clause  b  of the AA SoP required the experiencing of a severe stressor within two years of the clinical onset of alcohol abuse  The definition of  experiencing a severe stressor  is also set out above  The severe stressors ultimately relied upon  as described by the Tribunal  were the  scare charges  and the  full steam ahead incident    The  scare charges  severe stressor was identified as occasions that HMAS Sydney was in port in Vietnam when small explosive devices were detonated in the water adjacent to the vessel to deter potential underwater saboteurs  Mr Fenner  as a stoker in the boiler room  was working below the waterline on those occasions and said the explosions were extremely loud and caused the hull to vibrate  and caused him intense fear and helplessness because he did not know whether they were merely scare charges  so he did not know if the vessel was in danger and might be sunk  He particularly described an incident when HMAS Sydney was moored in Vung Tau Harbour during the Tet Offensive   It then asked  as it was required to do by the fourth Deledio step  whether it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fenner did not in fact experience a severe stressor within that two year period  and so would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fenner s condition of alcohol abuse did not arise from a war caused injury   That  as the Tribunal addressed the matter  required its consideration of Mr Fenner s reliability as a witness   It concluded  to its reasonable satisfaction  see s   of the Act  that Mr Fenner suffers from the condition known as antisocial personality disorder  It noted that deceit and manipulation are  central features  of that disorder  so there was a heightened need to consider the history provided by Mr Fenner by reference  where possible  to collateral sources   On the last matter  the AAT concluded    For reasons that we will set out more fully we do not accept the evidence that Mr Fenner has given on this aspect of the matter  We are not satisfied  on the balance of probabilities  that the traumatic events claimed by Mr Fenner involved a threat of death or serious injury nor are we satisfied that Mr Fenner had a response that involved intense fear  helplessness or horror  Our reasons for reaching that conclusion are set out below when we discuss the fourth Deledio step in the context of alcohol abuse    Hence  it was not satisfied that Mr Fenner suffered from post traumatic stress disorder   In addressing the fourth Deledio step in relation to the claim based upon the condition of alcohol abuse  the AAT first remarked upon Mr Fenner s credibility  It said that Mr Fenner was a  most unsatisfactory witness   It reached that view based on contemporary materials  objectively established facts and the apparent  logic of events  and not on  any particular perception of his demeanour   The factors particularly relied upon were as follows      that his anti social personality disorder has deceit and manipulation as central features    that there is no record of Mr Fenner having reported the scare charges or the full steam ahead incident during   and   when he was  apparently  seen by psychiatrists  psychologists  a social work student  and by parole officers  nor is any reference made in the papers in connection with his discharge    that Mr Fenner falsely claimed to a Dr Kenny in August   that he requested a discharge from the Navy on return from his first visit to Vietnam in April   whereas when he applied for a discharge in March   he is recorded as saying that he had not previously applied for discharge  and    that there are  numerous variations and inconsistencies  in the accounts  apparently  given by him from time to time  and the  sheer illogicality of much of what he says   The Tribunal went on to explain that last observation by reference to the claimed traumatic events   It accepted that scare charges were used by HMAS Sydney in Vietnam  and sometimes detonated closer to the vessel than they should have been  causing more noise and shock than expected  However  it said that  w hat is in issue is Mr Fenner s claimed response to them   Counsel for Mr Fenner contended that there were seven errors of law in the AAT s reasons  They were       i  a failure to apply the provisions of s   of the Act to the facts of the case   ii  a failure to take into account all of the evidence in examining whether the hypotheses raised had been disproved beyond any reasonable doubt   iii  a failure to recognise that the lack of credibility accorded by the AAT to Mr Fenner was not sufficient in itself to displace the factors upon which the hypotheses of connection were based    iv  a failure to appreciate that the effect of the overall evidence pointed to the reasonableness of the hypotheses raised rather than the conclusion reached by the AAT that it disproved the hypotheses beyond reasonable doubt   v  adopting the wrong methodology in determining whether Step   of Deledio had been satisfied   vi  adopting the wrong interpretation of what constituted a  severe stressor  in the Statement of Principles   vii  failing to provide adequate and sufficient reasons for its determination   Grounds two to four of the grounds of appeal all challenge the AAT s ultimate finding on the fourth Deledio step  I have come to the conclusion that the AAT erred in law in concluding that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fenner was not in fact affected by the severe stressors which he experienced  because he personally did not react to them at all  My reasons for that conclusion involve a combination of matters which reach across those grounds of appeal  so I shall not address them severally   The fifth and sixth grounds of appeal seem to suggest that  somehow  the AAT erred in its understanding of the way in which it should have gone about making its decision in the light of Deledio   In my view  it has not been shown that the AAT misunderstood the nature of the decision making process or failed to follow it appropriately   In my judgment  the only error of law which its decision exposes is the failure to properly apply s   in the manner I have referred to above  For that reason  I set aside the decision of the AAT and remit the application to the AAT for reconsideration  limited to Mr Fenner s claim in respect of his condition of alcohol abuse   I certify that the preceding sixty eight   numbered

SZEEO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   per Tamberlin J  at     and the cases cited at   citedMines v Repatriation Commission     ALD   The conclusion of the AAT that  on the balance of probabilities  Mr Fenner did not suffer from PTSD reflects the approach approved by Gray J in Mines v Repatriation Commission     ALD   at   at     Given the findings of the AAT about Mr Fenner s exposure to the scare charges and to the full steam ahead incident  it is instructive to note the conclusions of the psychiatrist whose evidence the AAT accepted about the connection between Mr Fenner s disease of alcohol abuse and his operational service  Professor Goldney said    It is a reasonable hypothesis that Mr Fenner s alcohol abuse is related to the stressors he alleges     it is pertinent that often alcohol dependence is associated with anti social personality disorders  and it is not necessary to invoke the specific stressors to explain Mr Fenner s alcohol dependence  Nevertheless  if in fact the alleged stressors did occur  then one could state it is a reasonable hypothesis that they  at the very least  contributed to his alcohol abuse   As that evidence shows  those or many of those who experienced scare charges had the concern that the ship may have been under attack and so felt frightened  In my view that evidence was relevant not just to whether the scare charges and the full ahead incident were severe stressors  but also to whether the AAT was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fenner uniquely  or almost uniquely  did not in fact react as would have been expected and as others did  It also shows that the medical evidence preferred by the AAT also recognised the potential role of the stressors in Mr Fenner s disease  The AAT has not referred to that evidence  Senior counsel for the Commission contended that it was unnecessary that it should do so  But I think  in the circumstances  the absence of any reference to that material demonstrates more than illogicality upon the part of the AAT in the respects I have mentioned  I think it demonstrates that the AAT has equated a satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fenner was not a reliable witness and that no weight could be placed on his own evidence with a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was not in fact scared by the two stressors  In my view that amounts to an error of law on the part of the AAT  I conclude that it has therefore erred in law by failing to apply the clear direction of s   to the facts  The absence of reference to relevant evidence on that topic tends to confirm that conclusion
