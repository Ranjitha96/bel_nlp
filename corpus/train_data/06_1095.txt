Tribunal in the present case did not consider whether the husband s claims  considered cumulatively   could amount to  serious harm   Whether those claims in fact rise to that level  bearing in mind that we are dealing with the future  and not the past  is a matter for the Tribunal  and not for this Court  See SZBOV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   per Jacobson J  at    Given that the point is arguable  I consider that the matter should be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law  It follows for the reasons set out above that the appeal should be allowed  The orders of the Federal Magistrate dismissing the application for review  and ordering the appellants to pay costs  should be set aside  In lieu thereof  a writ of certiorari should issue directed to the Tribunal  quashing its decision  A writ of mandamus should also issue directing that the matter be heard and determined according to law  The appellants should have their costs  if any  of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court  They are entitled also to have their costs  if any  of the appeal to this Court    I certify that the preceding eighty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg    Associate Dated    August     The First Appellant appeared in person on behalf of

 ALR    at    An act that might seem capable of innocent explanation when viewed discretely can take on a different and more sinister connotation when viewed against a broader background  It is possible that individual instances of discrimination will not of themselves amount to  serious harm  but when considered cumulatively satisfy the requirements of s  R  See  for example  VTAO   where Merkel J took a similar approach  In that case his Honour found  just as I have done  that the Tribunal s failure to consider a series of claims cumulatively gave rise to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction
