au cases cth HCA  html   On   November   the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal  a draft notice of appeal and supporting affidavit the application that is now before this Court  together the  Application        The Minister s objection to competency     Counsel for the Minister referred as a starting point to s  d  of the Federal Court Act    Cth   the FC Act  which provides that the Federal Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from judgments of the Federal Magistrates Court  Thereafter my attention was drawn to s  A  of the FC Act  which provides that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment referred to in subsection   that is an interlocutory judgment  unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal  Section  a  of the FC Act thereafter provides that applications for leave to appeal to the Court may be heard and determined by a single judge or a Full Court     The Minister next emphasised that the Federal Magistrate s decision was indeed interlocutory  referring thereby to the distinction between final and interlocutory orders  enunciated for instance in Hall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR   at   by Taylor J as follows     So an order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se  although it may  of course  conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made  is interlocutory only  On this basis an order staying proceedings against one of several defendants on the grounds that they are scandalous  vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court has been treated as interlocutory  Hind v Marquis of Hartington     TLR    The same view was taken of an order striking out a plaintiff s statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action  Jones v Insole     LT   and of an order dismissing an action as frivolous and vexatious In re Page     Ch        That dictum was more recently applied by a Full Federal Court in Dai v Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman   FCA   at    per Beaumont  Whitlam and Lehane JJ      The applicant provided no basis or reason why the course sought to be adopted should be open to him  given the history of the proceedings which speaks for itself  Plainly the plethora of decisions already made unfavourably to the applicant demonstrates that no substantial injustice would be occasioned by any refusal of the current purported further application to the Court  No matter of substance has been raised for my consideration  Nothing more is raised other than bare assertions of error  However no error is apparent on the face of the material before the Court     The application must be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding eleven   numbered paragraphs are a true
