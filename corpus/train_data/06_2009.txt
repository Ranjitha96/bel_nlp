the absence of reasons given by the learned Federal Magistrate for refusing to go behind the judgment gave rise to an error of law  He has cited as authority Petitt v Dunkley     NSWLR   a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal  However  with respect  Petitt is in no way comparable to the case which was before her Honour  or the case before me  In the present case there is a history of litigation demonstrating that there is a judgment debt upon which the bankruptcy notice  and subsequently the creditor s petition  are founded  It was clear to her Honour  as it is clear to me  that the appellant has had numerous opportunities in Court  across both Federal and State jurisdictions  through multiple actions  and through multiple levels of appeal  to establish flaws in either the

raise issues relevant to the contents of the National Personal Insolvency Index so far as applied to him  including for example details of any debt agreement in relation to the debt on which the creditor relies  The purpose of O   r   Federal Court Rules  and r     Federal Magistrates Court Rules  would seem to be to provide the court with evidence that there is no debt agreement in force which would preclude a creditor from proceeding further with a creditor s petition  and to provide evidence of any other proceedings in bankruptcy which might have a bearing on the making of a sequestration order   French v Wilcox   FCA   at   per Lee and Carr JJ   In this case the appellant did not raise any issues of this nature before her Honour and accordingly her Honour was entitled to make the findings she did  A similar issue was raised in French v Wilcox where an affidavit under O   r   was sworn on   July   and  after the matter came before the court on that date  the hearing of the creditor s petition was adjourned to   August   when the primary judge made a sequestration order  On appeal Lee and Carr JJ said       Likewise  his Honour had an index search sworn on   July    In the absence of any suggestion from the appellant that any proceedings in bankruptcy had taken place between   July   and   August   he was  in our opinion  entitled to assume that no such proceedings  including the making of any debt agreement  had taken place    at  These grounds of appeal are referable to O   r   Federal Court Rules   mirrored in r     Federal Magistrates Court Rules  As pointed out by Lee and Carr JJ in French v Wilcox   FCA   at          The evident purpose of rule   is to provide a means of proving what is required by s  c  of the Act  ie the fact that the debt or debts on which the petitioning creditor relies is or are still owing  In written submissions  the appellant claims that the respondents failed to file an affidavit of final debt sworn as soon as practicable before the hearing date stating that the debt relied upon is still owing and the amount of the debt  In the absence of that affidavit  there was no material before the Court to justify a finding of a final debt or the making of a sequestration order  The circumstances of this case bear interesting similarities to those in French v Wilcox   In the absence of any real indication that the debt had been paid when the matter was before her Honour on   August   it was open to her Honour to infer that the debt was still owing  The appellant has not brought any evidence before me which would in any way negate that finding  I reject the submission by the appellant that there was no material before Rimmer FM to justify a finding of a final debt or the making of a sequestration order

not spent and will only be spent when leave to appeal is refused by the High Court  and orders are settled  Accordingly  the respondents could not produce an affidavit verifying par   of the creditors  petition as required by r     of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules    as they were prior to amendment  until an order is settled  As authority for this proposition  the appellant relies on Guss v Johnstone     ALR    In Guss a bankruptcy notice was issued in respect of a judgment of the Magistrates Court which was eventually appealed  unsuccessfully  to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria  The debtor filed an affidavit pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   with the result that time for compliance with the notice was extended until the Federal Court determined whether it was satisfied that the appellant had a counter claim  set off or cross demand such as referred to in s  g  of the Act  Sundberg J held that he was not satisfied that the appellant had such a counter claim  set off or cross demand  the debtor did not comply with the requirements of the bankruptcy notice  and as a result the debtor committed an act of bankruptcy  The debtor appealed unsuccessfully to the Full Court of the Federal Court  and then to the High Court  Rimmer FM considered this issue in the course of her decision  Her Honour noted that the appellant applied to have the bankruptcy notice set aside  the application was heard on   May   by Deputy District Registrar Baldwin and dismissed  the appellant was then served with the creditor s petition  as of the date of the hearing of the matter by Rimmer FM the appellant had not paid the debt owing to the respondents  and clearly he had committed an act of bankruptcy  Turning to the submissions of the appellant  it is difficult to see how the appellant is assisted by his reliance on Guss   The only relevance of Guss is that the debtor in that case  like the debtor in the case before me  also sought to raise issues as to the validity of the debt upon which the bankruptcy notice was founded  In that case  as has also been the case here as evidenced by the history of litigation involving the appellant and the respondents  the debtor was unsuccessful  In my view it is incorrect for the appellant to assert that the issue is not  finally decided  until all avenues of appeal in the matter are exhausted  This is for at least two reasons  First  the plain reading of r     is that  once a bankruptcy notice is issued by the Official Receiver  it is open to the debtor to make an application to have the bankruptcy notice set aside by a court  In this case  the courts having jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act are the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court  s   Bankruptcy Act    The application by the appellant to have the bankruptcy notice set aside was heard in the Federal Court before Deputy District Registrar Baldwin  In relation to matters before the Federal Court  it is open to either a Judge or a Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia to deal with an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice  this is clear from s  A h  Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and O   r   and Sch   Federal Court Rules     Decided  in this context bears the plain meaning of the court having entertained an application  and making an order on the basis of that application  In this case  the appellant s application to have the bankruptcy notice set aside was decided by Deputy District Registrar Baldwin on   May   when the application was dismissed citedHall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe second issue is that it is very clear that the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was finally decided by the Deputy District Registrar on   May    In the context of r     Federal Magistrates Court Rules   the concept of finality is referable to whether the decision in relation to the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice finally determined the rights of the applicant or the respondent in favour of either of them  A similar test applies in a number of contexts  for example    interpreting the meaning of  final judgment or final order  in s  g  Bankruptcy Act  see  for example  the test articulated by Lord Esher MR in In re Riddell ex parte Earl of Strathmore     QBD   at   and   distinguishing a  final judgment  from an  interlocutory judgment   see  for example  Hall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR   per Taylor J at   and Windeyer J at   citedIn re Riddell ex parte Earl of Strathmore     QBD

sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success  In the case before me although the appellant was not legally represented  I understand that he is in fact a solicitor and therefore at somewhat less of a disadvantage in conducting a case before a court than self represented litigants without legal qualifications  No explanation was provided by the appellant as to why this ground of appeal was not raised before her Honour indeed that hearing would have been a timely opportunity to do so other than the fact that the appellant considered that he was entitled to raise new issues by way of appeal before this Court  Finally  the fact that this ground of appeal is but one of a number involving issues which were not raised before her Honour suggests  to paraphrase Gyles J in Iyer v MIMIA   FCA   at   that the appellant is asking this Court to permit this appeal to proceed on the basis that the judgment below is simply put to one side and ignored  In my view the Court should not permit the proper process to be so ignored  In any event  a brief consideration of this ground of appeal indicates that it is without merit  The respondents had satisfied their obligations by conducting a search and filing the required affidavit the day before the nominated date for the hearing of the petition  namely the date on which the matter came before District Registrar Ramsey and was adjourned to be heard before a Federal Magistrate  This is clear because    section   Federal Magistrates Act    Cth  contemplates registrars of the court hearing  continuing to hear  or not hearing  applications which come before them  To find otherwise would in my view impose unnecessary additional burdens on creditors in such circumstances citedKleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOn the evidence  her Honour was satisfied of all the matters in s     and noted that the appellant had not in his evidence or submissions to the court put a case that he was solvent  par    Accordingly in her Honour s view the matter turned on the question whether there was other sufficient cause within the meaning of s   why a sequestration order ought not to be made  and whether her Honour should exercise her discretion to dismiss the petition  In deciding whether to exercise her discretion her Honour considered    A potential counter claim  set off or cross demand of the appellant related to the original litigation between the parties  but which her Honour considered continued to suffer from all the deficits identified by Cooper J in Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA      A potential counter claim  set off or cross demand in the appellant in that he claimed the respondents had committed contempt of court  but which her Honour considered was unlikely to have any prospects of success  and which was not a proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s      A potential counter claim  set off or cross demand in the appellant in that he claimed that the judgment of Cooper J had been obtained by fraud or collusion or mistake  but which her Honour considered was not supported by the evidence before her nor by the decision of Cooper J  and which was not a proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s      A claim described by her Honour as being essentially that an act of bankruptcy had not been committed by the appellant  Her Honour summarised this claim of the appellant as being that he should have been successful before Cooper J  the order for costs should not have been made  the appellant should not be indebted to pay those costs to the respondents  and  as a result  in not paying the debt the appellant has not committed an act of bankruptcy  Her Honour considered that the appellant had committed an act of bankruptcy  and that this was not a proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s      A claim by the appellant that the bill of costs produced for taxation following the decision of Cooper J included items which did not relate to the proceedings under Pt  A Trade Practices Act    Cth   In her Honour s view  these matters should have been addressed by the appellant in the taxation process in the Federal Court of Australia  and there was no evidence before her to establish that they were raised nor what the outcome was of it being raised at the taxation    A claim by the appellant that there were defects in the petition and or bankruptcy notice  Her Honour considered this claim in detail  including reviewing Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   and The Australian Steel Company  Operations  Pty Ltd v Lewis   FCA         FCR   which are the leading authorities in this area  Her Honour summarised this claim as follows         In this matter the debtor contends that par   of the petition states that the creditors are owed an amount due under the order of the Federal Court and that the bankruptcy notice fails to contain the judgment or certificate of taxation  He says that where in par   it says that the creditor does not hold security over the property of the debtor  that this leaves doubt as to whether the one or the other holds security over the property of the debtor  Further he contends that the petition refers to the words  creditor  and  creditors  including reference to the agent for the Petitioner which creates a doubt as to who the Petitioner is and whether or not there are two joint petitioners and whether or not the agent holds instructions to act on behalf of both petitioners  He says that par   of the Petition fails to state the date of the act of bankruptcy    at        Her Honour was satisfied that the creditors  petition was overall compliant and in all respects clear and unequivocal  that the appellant s submissions concerning the reference to  creditor  and  creditors  was a spurious argument without merit  and that par   was compliant with the formal requirements of the prescribed Form appliedMetwally v

absence of reasons given by the learned Federal Magistrate for refusing to go behind the judgment gave rise to an error of law  He has cited as authority Petitt v Dunkley     NSWLR   a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal  However  with respect  Petitt is in no way comparable to the case which was before her Honour  or the case before me  In the present case there is a history of litigation demonstrating that there is a judgment debt upon which the bankruptcy notice  and subsequently the creditor s petition  are founded  It was clear to her Honour  as it is clear to me  that the appellant has had numerous opportunities in Court  across both Federal and State jurisdictions  through multiple actions  and through multiple levels of appeal  to establish flaws in either the judgment debt or the process which has resulted in the judgment debt being enforceable against him  He has been consistently unsuccessful  While as a general rule it is desirable to give reasons for a decision  to paraphrase Cussen ACJ in Brittingham v Williams   VLR   at   a case may  be so conducted that the reason or reasons for the decision is or are obvious to any intelligent person   In my view  this is such a case with respect to this ground of appeal citedRe Agrillo  ex parte The Bankrupt     ALR  The appellant also submits that the respondents must provide an affidavit

matters in s     and noted that the appellant had not in his evidence or submissions to the court put a case that he was solvent  par    Accordingly in her Honour s view the matter turned on the question whether there was other sufficient cause within the meaning of s   why a sequestration order ought not to be made  and whether her Honour should exercise her discretion to dismiss the petition  In deciding whether to exercise her discretion her Honour considered    A potential counter claim  set off or cross demand of the appellant related to the original litigation between the parties  but which her Honour considered continued to suffer from all the deficits identified by Cooper J in Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA      A potential counter claim  set off

proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s      A potential counter claim  set off or cross demand in the appellant in that he claimed that the judgment of Cooper J had been obtained by fraud or collusion or mistake  but which her Honour considered was not supported by the evidence before her nor by the decision of Cooper J  and which was not a proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s      A claim described by her Honour as being essentially that an act of bankruptcy had not been committed by the appellant  Her Honour summarised this claim of the appellant as being that he should have been successful before Cooper J  the order for costs should not have been made  the appellant should not be indebted to pay those costs to the respondents  and  as a result  in not paying the debt the appellant has not committed an act of bankruptcy  Her Honour considered that the appellant had committed an act of bankruptcy  and that this was not a proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s      A claim by the appellant that the bill of costs produced for taxation following the decision of Cooper J included items which did not relate to the proceedings under Pt  A Trade Practices Act    Cth   In her Honour s view  these matters should have been addressed by the appellant in the taxation process in the Federal Court of Australia  and there was no evidence before her to establish that they were raised nor what the outcome was of it being raised at the taxation    A claim by the appellant that there were defects in the petition and or bankruptcy notice  Her Honour considered this claim in detail  including reviewing Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   and The Australian Steel Company  Operations  Pty Ltd v Lewis   FCA         FCR   which are the leading authorities in this area  Her Honour summarised this claim as follows         In this matter the debtor contends that par   of the petition states that the creditors are owed an amount due under the order of the Federal Court and that the bankruptcy notice fails to contain the judgment or certificate of taxation  He says that where in par   it says that the creditor does not hold security over the property of the debtor  that this leaves doubt as to whether the one or the other holds security over the property of the debtor  Further he contends that the petition refers to the words  creditor  and  creditors  including reference to the agent for the Petitioner which creates a doubt as to who the Petitioner is and whether or not there are two joint petitioners and whether or not the agent holds instructions to act on behalf of both petitioners  He says that par   of the Petition fails to state the date of the act of bankruptcy    at        Her Honour was satisfied that the creditors  petition was overall compliant and in all respects clear and unequivocal  that the appellant s submissions concerning the reference to  creditor  and  creditors  was a spurious argument without merit  and that par   was compliant with the formal requirements of the prescribed Form affirmedThe Drink Nightclub   Anor v Worchild   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe matter before me is an appeal from a decision of Rimmer FM delivered on   October     The Drink Nightclub   Anor v Worchild   FMCA    In that case the respondents successfully presented a creditor s petition seeking a sequestration order against the appellant  and were awarded costs by her Honour  The appellant seeks the following orders from this Court     The appeal be allowed     The orders of the Federal Magistrate of   October   be set aside     The application for a sequestration order be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for reconsideration     Costs  Mr Cross is a director of The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd  In this judgment I shall refer to Mr Worchild as  the appellant  and The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd and Mr Cross as  the respondents  citedThompson v Metham   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlFurther  the appellant claimed in ground   of the supplementary notice of appeal that Rimmer FM erred in finding that the creditor s petition did not require a copy of the judgment and or certificate of taxation to be attached to the petition  In his submissions on this point  I note that the appellant  in relying on Thompson v Metham   FCA     actually addressed the issue whether a copy of the judgment and or a copy of the certificate of taxation ought be attached to the bankruptcy notice   However in any event this ground of appeal fails for the reason that her Honour made no such finding as claimed by the appellant  Indeed  after considering the appellant s submission at par   of her judgment  her Honour went on to state       In relation to paragraph   the petition is compliant and the Bankruptcy Notice contains the order made on   November     Similar arguments were put by the debtor in his application to have the Bankruptcy Notice set aside and that application has been determined and dismissed with an order being made against the debtor for costs     emphasis added       The appellant submits that paragraph   of the petition  states that the applicant creditor does not hold security of the property of the debtor this leaves doubt as to whether the one or the other holds security over the property of the debtor   This issue was dealt with by her Honour at par   of her judgment where her Honour said       Paragraph   of the petition to  sic  also clear and unequivocal  It is a requirement of the standard form for such a statement to be made in those terns as to the holding of any security over any property of the debtor by the creditors  There is no uncertainty raised to a reasonable person with the knowledge of the debtor  There is no defect in the making of this statement  There is no  weight of evidence  indicating that the respondents do hold such security  or even raising doubt as to whether they hold such security  contrary to her Honour s finding  In my view  no error in her Honour s judgment is demonstrated by this submission of the appellant  This also answers the seventh ground of appeal in the original notice of appeal  which accordingly fails     The appellant submits that the  petition refers to creditor and creditors including reference to the agent for the Petitioner  This creates doubt as to who the Petitioner is and whether or not there is two joint petitioners and whether or not the agent holds instruction to act on behalf of both petitioners   In the judgment of Rimmer FM  her Honour dealt with this issue at par   as follows       Following his Honour s reasoning with which I agree the fact that an  s is left off the word creditor on one occasion does not create any confusion and is not a matter which would properly give rise to a substantive defect in the notice as required to set the Petition aside  I am satisfied that the debtor is fully aware that there are two creditors  one a company and one the director of that company  He is also well aware that the solicitors Hynes Lawyers act for both of the creditors  This is a spurious argument without merit  appliedWater Board v Moustakos   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe principle was again applied by the High Court in Water Board v Moustakos   HCA         CLR   at   where Mason CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Dawson JJ said       More than once it has been held by this court that a point cannot be raised for the first time upon appeal when it could possibly have been met by calling evidence below  Where all the facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or of law  then a court of appeal may find it expedient and in the interests of justice to entertain the point  but otherwise the rule is strictly applied

bill of costs arising out of the decision of Cooper J was made pursuant to the provisions of O   r   Federal Court Rules and allowed in the sum of       for which sum a Certificate of Taxation was

of    The appellant unsuccessfully appealed this decision of the Deputy District Registrar   Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd ACN       in the matter of Worchild   FCA   per Dowsett J  and then again unsuccessfully to the Full Court of the Federal Court   Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCAFC    As at the date of the hearing the appellant had sought special leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Full Court   I understand that special leave to appeal was refused  Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   HCA Trans        On   June   the respondents filed a creditor s petition in the Federal Magistrates Court applying for a sequestration order under s   Bankruptcy Act    Cth    Bankruptcy Act   against the estate of the appellant in respect of the debt of       owing to them under the order of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court of   November    The document was accompanied by an affidavit of the second respondent sworn   May   deposing that he had access to the books and records of the first respondent  and that the appellant had not paid  nor made arrangements to the satisfaction of the respondents for the settlement of the debt claimed in the bankruptcy notice     On   June   the appellant filed and served a Notice of Intention to Oppose the Petition in the Federal Magistrates Court     The petition came before District Registrar Ramsey in the Federal Magistrates Court on   June   however the Registrar directed that the matter be adjourned for hearing before a Federal Magistrate at     am on   August    The matter then came before Rimmer FM  In the original notice of appeal  the appellant claimed as his third ground of appeal that there had yet to be a final determination of the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice as required under s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Specifically  the appellant submits that in an affidavit of   June   filed by Mr Bisson  a solicitor acting for the respondents  in accordance with r     of the Federal Magistrates Rules  Mr Bisson deposed that an application was made for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice and that the application had been finally decided by Deputy District Registrar Baldwin on   May    However  the appellant submitted that no affidavit was filed before the creditor s petition was heard by Rimmer FM to the effect that the decision of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin had been appealed to Dowsett J  and an appeal from the decision of Dowsett J was pending before the Full Court   The decision of Dowsett J was subsequently upheld  Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCAFC     The appellant submits further that as at the date of the hearing before me there was an application for special leave to appeal the decision of the Full Court to the High Court of Australia  Principally  it appears that the issue of whether the order of the Deputy District Registrar was in the nature of a final order has already been raised by the appellant in other litigation  and dealt with by the Full Court in that context  Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCAFC    In particular I note par   of the joint judgment of Kiefel  Jacobson and Greenwood JJ where their Honours said        In our view the order of   November   is a final order within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act   one in which the respondents  rights were ascertained and given effect to  Unlike a mere Certificate of Taxation  an order made under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules directs the payment of money  This was a feature absent in Re Walker  Ex parte Noble Einsiedel Pty Ltd   FCA     a decision of Northrop J of   April   at p    A purpose of the rule is to permit enforcement and execution under the order  The latter is an important element in determining whether an order is final or not  Pepper v McNiece   HCA         CLR   at    In Re Draper  Ex parte Australian Society of Accountants  an unreported decision of   February   von Doussa J held that an order made under the rule was final  within the meaning of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act   In his Honour s view  if there be any doubt about that  it is removed by the provisions of s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act   as the orders are ones which can be enforced as final judgments  See also Re Luckins  Ex parte Columbia Pictures Industries   Anor     FCR   a decision of Beaumont J at p    The nature of the  weight of evidence  against her Honour s finding in relation to par   of the petition is unclear  As I have already noted  none of the facts to which par   refers appeared to be in dispute before her Honour  Indeed  I note this same issue has been raised by the appellant before the Full Court in other proceedings  and the Full Court found that it was not necessary that a certificate of taxation be attached to the bankruptcy notice  and that the relevant order of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin was as required by the Bankruptcy Act attached to the bankruptcy notice   Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at      The appellant has sought to rely on the decision of the Full Court  see TS ll     however he appears to have misread the judgment of their Honours  No error in the reasoning of Rimmer FM is demonstrated by this submission  I note that the Full Court in Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at par   explained to the appellant that there was no uncertainty as to the amount he should pay to satisfy the relevant debt  nor to whom he should make payment  It is concerning that the appellant continues to raise this putative  doubt  as to the identity of the petitioners as an issue  There is no  weight of evidence  against her Honour s finding  In my view  no error in her Honour s judgment is demonstrated by this submission of the appellant     The appellant submits that  paragraph   of the Petition fails to state the date of act of bankruptcy   In respect of this point  her Honour at par   of her judgment held that she was satisfied that the petition was compliant with the formal requirements of the prescribed Form  I find no error in the finding of her Honour in relation to this issue  The fifth ground of appeal in the appellant s original notice of appeal fails  Rimmer FM in her judgment considered in some detail the application of s  b  Bankruptcy Act to this case  Section   provides       If the Court is not satisfied with the proof of any of those matters  or is satisfied by the debtor         a  that he or she is able to pay his or her debts  or    b  that for other sufficient cause a sequestration order ought not to be made        it may dismiss the petition  This ground of appeal fails for the following reasons     This issue was raised by the appellant in related litigation before the Full Court  and dismissed by the Full Court   Worchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at         It is incorrect to claim that the learned Federal Magistrate  failed to appreciate  that security for costs was required to contest a bill of costs in the Federal Court  it does not appear that the issue was actually raised before her Honour     On the basis of the principles I explained earlier  I do not consider there are exceptional circumstances which entitle the appellant to raise this new issue on appeal  This ground of appeal is founded in a claim that Rimmer FM failed to investigate the appellant s allegations in circumstances where there was sufficient cause to doubt the judgment debt  In my view this ground of appeal  and the appellant s submissions in support  are misconceived  At the hearing  the appellant submitted that there was a  real and relevant issue of fact  namely that there were grounds for the learned Federal Magistrate to  go behind the judgment in circumstances where there was no other material before the court   TS p   ll     citedWorchild v The Drink Nightclub  Qld  Pty Ltd   HCA Trans  This

one needs to file security for costs   if a party cannot provide security for costs because of impecuniosity  then ostensibly the provision is a statutory abrogation of the right to a hearing  a denial of natural justice or a right to be heard
