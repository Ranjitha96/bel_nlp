 at     Aktiebolaget H ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR   at      Professors Banwell and Davies In Minnesota v Beiersdorf at     and in Aktiebolaget H ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Astra   at   it was held in relation to s  e  of the   Act that publications are not to be taken into account unless their content was part of common general knowledge at the priority date  Accordingly  the issue is not whether it was obvious to conduct a literature search of a particular kind with a view to acquiring information  but whether the information that would have been obtained from the search had already entered the body of common general knowledge  Minnesota v Beiersdorf at   Astra at    No question arises in this case regarding the results of a routine literature search  Alphapharm submits             Professor Montgomery articulates a series of opinions regarding the efficacy of citalopram vs   citalopram on the basis of his interpretation of reports or articles  which in turn report the results of certain clinical studies  most of which were conducted by or on behalf of Lundbeck              No person has given evidence regarding the conduct of those studies  the underlying data concerning the studies has not been provided and there has been no disclosure of primary documents that might reveal  for instance  the aims  objectives or methodology of those studies  The authors of the Journal Articles relied upon have not given evidence  As submitted above  Alphapharm was able to call the pooled studies seriously into question  on the basis of limited material             The Journal Articles themselves constitute reports of selected information taken from and summarized as the results from clinical studies  Further  there is no evidence as to the existence of other unpublished studies the results of which may be unhelpful to the Lundbeck arguments  Professor Montgomery does not refer to the underlying data  but relies on the results as reported in the Articles             The Journal Articles themselves are at times opaque as to the studies upon which their conclusions are based     Further  not all of the studies upon which the Montgomery expert evidence is based were published             Accordingly  the basis upon which Professor Montgomery has expressed his opinions is hearsay evidence which cannot be admitted as evidence of the truth of its contents             Alphapharm submits that  in the absence of proof of that factual basis  the evidence of Professor Montgomery in this regard is inadmissible citedAngiotech Pharmaceuticals v Conor   EWCA Civ       RPC  I am aware of the observations made by the English Court of Appeal in relation to the High Court s judgment in Astra in Angiotech Pharmaceuticals v Conor   EWCA Civ       RPC   at     which were quoted by Kitchin J in Generics v Lundbeck at    Those observations are of no relevance to my task  Astra also stands as authority for the following propositions While the evidence that was before Kitchin J in Generics v Lundbeck was clearly different from that which was before me  I assume that the evidence of the course of experimentation that was followed at Lundbeck was similar  In any event  his Lordship s summary  at   accords with my findings on the evidence in the present case      Assuming the skilled person decided to embark upon the task of trying to obtain the individual enantiomers there was no real dispute between the parties that he would initially choose to attempt to resolve the final molecules  Only if this failed might he then consider alternative methods such as using enantiomerically pure precursors  But here his anxiety would be that subsequent reaction steps might result in the production of an enantiomerically impure final product  As I shall explain  scientists at Lundbeck attempted to resolve citalopram by classical resolution techniques using diastereoisomers  by using new resolving agents  by attempting to resolve derivatives and by using techniques of asymmetric synthesis  all over the period   to    In addition  they attempted to resolve citalopram using analytical chiral HPLC from   to    None of these techniques were successful  The claimants accepted that citalopram is not easily resolved by making diastereoisomers  However  they submitted the skilled addressee would not regard failure in relation to this molecule as the end of road  I accept that this was so  But the work Lundbeck undertook illustrates that the road to which the claimants referred was long and uncertain      The Product Claims The word  routine  that has become a common feature in formulations of the obviousness test in Australia  see   above  is more comfortably applicable to discussions of methods than products  However  the  matter of routine  test can be applied to product claims  The question to be asked is whether it would have been a matter of routine for those skilled in the art to adopt the goal of obtaining the enantiomers of citalopram for use of one of them as a drug for the treatment of depression  In Astra   the High Court described  at   the reformulation of the  Cripps question  by Graham J in Olin at      Their Honours stated that that approach should be accepted  Adapting that test to the circumstances of the present product claims  I would state the test as follows      Would the hypothetical addressee or team as at   June   equipped with the Australian Citalopram Patent and possessed of the common general knowledge within the field at that time  adopt as a matter of routine the aim of obtaining the   enantiomer of citalopram in the expectation that it might well produce a useful alternative to  or a better drug than  citalopram       While I think that the hypothetical addressee or team in   would have recognised the possibility of an advantage in obtaining the enantiomers because of the possibility of the therapeutic benefits of the racemate being found to reside in one of them  I do not think that the goal of obtaining the enantiomers would have been adopted as a matter of routine  as is required for the Australian test of obviousness to be satisfied   The Joint Report Again  a convenient starting point is the Joint Report  Professors Banwell and Davies were asked   What were the motivations  chemically and academically  but excluding regulatory  for obtaining the enantiomers of a known racemate distinguishedAtlantis Corporation Pty Ltd v Schindler     IPR  Alphapharm submits that it is no more permissible to read in the word  pure  than it was to read the qualifier  drainage  into the claims in the patent specification in Atlantis Corporation Pty Ltd v Schindler     IPR     Atlantis    The invention in that case was entitled in the complete specification  Drainage Cell  and was stated to relate to  the provision of adequate drainage by artificial means  and to have particular application in the area of landscape gardening   However  the claims simply described a rigid cell structure  A Full Court of this Court held that the claims were unambiguous and were simply in respect of the rigid structure without any limitation by reference to the purpose of  drainage   In my view  the facts in Atlantis are distinguishable  There was no question in Atlantis of whether the object was claimed an object in its own right  Quite apart from  the expert evidence that  where no purity is specified in relation to a compound  chemists read in a   purity criterion  and the references to  individual   pure  separated  and  isolated  elsewhere in the Patent   I would have understood an unqualified reference to   citalopram  whether in the open literature or in a patent  to refer to that compound when other than merely part of the unresolved racemate  Alphapharm draws attention to the fact that both Professors Banwell and Davies said that from the formula for the racemic mixture  citalopram  they could deduce the formulae for the   enantiomer and the     enantiomer  I do not think this fact to be persuasive as to how claim   is properly to be construed  Alphapharm draws attention to the Patent s title as it existed prior to amendment and to the terms of overseas Escitalopram Patents referred toBeecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Ltd    B IPR  In Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Ltd    B IPR     Beecham    the plaintiff alleged infringement of patents for a pharmaceutical compound by the importation  offering for sale and sale in the United Kingdom of the antibiotic  Hetacillin  The plaintiff held four patents relating to a new class of semi synthetic penicillins and to methods for their manufacture  One such penicillin was Ampicillin  a valuable antibiotic  The clinical effectiveness of Hetacillin was due entirely to Ampicillin  of which it was an acetone derivative  In the presence of water  as and when administered as an antibiotic  Hetacillin would revert into Ampicillin by a reversible chemical reaction  The Lundbecks rely on a passage from the speech of Lord Diplock  the whole of the paragraph being as follows  p       I have already expressed my opinion that the pith and marrow doctrine is applicable to claims for new products as well as to new processes  and I agree with the Court of Appeal that the relationship of hetacillin to ampicillin provides a clear case for its application  It was argued that what is claimed in the patents as an essential feature of the class of products to which ampicillin belongs is the presence of an amino group in the alpha position  and that this feature is absent in hetacillin  This is literally true at the time of importation and sale but it ceases to be true as soon as hetacillin is put to use for the only purpose for which it is intended  The substitution for the postulated amino group of the variant incorporated in hetacillin is evanescent and reversible and for all practical purposes of use can be regarded as the equivalent of the amino group in ampicillin  In the apt phrase used by the Court of Appeal  it is the reproduction of the substance ampicillin  albeit temporarily masked     His Lordship was addressing a product claim  In the imported hetacillin  there was a substituent for the amino group in the alpha position  but the substitution of the variant was  evanescent and reversible  and could be regarded as the equivalent of the amino group in the alpha position in the patented drug ampicillin  The Lundbecks draw an analogy with the bromo diol s performance of the function of the cyano diol  Wootten J was of the view  at   that a proper and convenient way to test the matter was to ask whether the sale of monensin sodium in Australia by another person would be an infringement of the patent  After referring to Beecham   his Honour held  at   that  the mere conversion of monensic acid to monensin sodium with the retention of substantially the same molecular structure and the same therapeutic effects  and involving only the use of a simple and well understood process  would fall within the  pith and marrow  doctrine  discussedBoehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlLundbeck refers to three authorities as being relevant to the construction of the expression  pharmaceutical substance per se   Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         FCR     Boehringer   Prejay Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCAFC         IPR     Prejay   and Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd     IPR     Pharmacia    Boehringer is not entirely on point  The patent claims were for a container comprising an aerosol or spray composition for nasal administration  The composition comprised as its active ingredient a certain pharmaceutical substance  The primary Judge  Heerey J  held that s  a  was not satisfied because the pharmaceutical substance itself   per se   was not disclosed in the complete specification and did not fall within the scope of a claim of the patent specification   Boehringer Ingelheim International v Commissioner of Patents   AIPC      His Honour examined the legislative history behind ss     and concluded that patents for new and inventive processes or new and inventive modes of treatment of old or known products are not the subject of s   it is only patents for new and inventive products that are  Accordingly  the expression per se showed that an extension of term is to be available only where the claim is for a pharmaceutical substance as such  not a substance forming part of a method or process  The Full Court in Boehringer agreed  at    Their Honours noted  at   that the Second Reading Speech relating to the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill    Cth  which inserted the relevant sections into the Act  spoke of  development of a new drug  and of the research and testing required before a  product  could enter the market  Their Honours also noted  at   that the Explanatory Memorandum relating to that Bill spoke of the expression  pharmaceutical substance per se   as being usually restricted to  new and inventive substances   They considered that the expression  fall within the scope of the claim or claims of that specification  in s  a  means  b e included amongst the things claimed    at    The decision in Boehringer does not govern the present case because claims   to   are indisputably product claims  and the pharmaceutical substance per se in question is indisputably the   enantiomer of citalopram  In my view  Lundbeck seeks to draw more from the expression   per se   than was necessary in Boehringer   In Boehringer   the Court was concerned only to distinguish between a pharmaceutical substance that is the subject of a product claim  which they held to be within s  a  and a substance that forms part of a method or process claim  which they held not to be within s  a   The Court was not concerned  as I am  with a competition between two arguable  first regulatory approval dates  and with the question whether the substance the subject of a product claim in a later patent was contained in goods previously included in the ARTG  In Prejay a Full Court of this Court followed Boehringer   All of the claims were method claims  not product claims  The Commissioner s delegate refused an application for an extension  The Full Court agreed with the delegate that a substance that is mentioned in the context of a method claim does not meet the requirement of s  a  that the substance per se fall within the scope of a claim  at     per Wilcox and Cooper JJ    per Allsop J   In Pharmacia   Weinberg J accepted the distinction drawn in Boehringer   but held  at   that claim   of the patent before him did state  a claim to a new and inventive substance  and not to a novel process or method   Weinberg J was also not concerned with rival first regulatory approval dates or with the associated questions that are before me citedBorowski v Quayle   VR  The starting point for resolution of Alphapharm s General Relevance Objection is a particular group of exceptions to the hearsay rule that were recognised under the general law as being dictated by necessity  In the Law Reform Commission s Interim Report on Evidence  ALRC No     the Commission described these exceptions as  a  the expert s accumulated knowledge   b  the reported data of fellow scientists  and  c  information commonly relied upon in an industry  trade or calling  ALRC No   vol   at   vol   at    The Commission cited in support  English Exporters  London  Ltd v Eldonwall Ltd     Ch     R v

  LR   Exch     Dickins v Randerson     KB     R v Perryman     CCC Sess Pap    Lawrence J   There is some overlap between the three categories  The Commission referred  as an illustration of  b  to Borowski   in which the following passage from Wigmore on Evidence  Chadbourn JH  ed   Little  Brown   Co  Boston    vol   at  b  was cited with approval      The data of every science are enormous in scope and variety  No one professional man can know from personal observation more than a minute fraction of the data which he must every day treat as working truths  Hence a reliance on the reported data of fellow scientists  learned by perusing their reports in books and journals  The law must and does accept this kind of knowledge from scientific men    T o reject a professional physician or mathematician because the fact or some facts to which he testifies are known to him only upon the authority of others would be to ignore the accepted methods of professional work and to insist on finical and impossible standards     In general  the considerations which define the  professional  are  a  a proper source of information   b  an extent of personal observation in the general subject  enabling him to estimate the general plausibility  or probability of soundness  of the views expressed  and  c  the impossibility of obtaining information on the particular technical detail except through reported data in part or entirely  The true solution must be to trust the discretion of the trial judge  exercised in the light of the nature of the subject and the witness  equipments  The decisions show in general a liberal attitude in receiving technical testimony based on professional reading       In Borowski   his Honour found  at   that evidence given by the expert in that case           would have been directed to matter travelling outside opinion and dependent to a degree upon knowledge based upon hearsay  But this is an area where the hearsay rule does not apply and the matter dealt with in the evidence would clearly have been admissible  The same judge made exception to the hearsay rule was recognised in the standard texts on evidence at that time  see  for example  D Byrne QC and JD Heydon  Cross on Evidence   rd Australian Edition  Butterworths    at         citing  in addition to Borowski and Schering Chemicals   See v Milner    A Crim R    FCA  Holt v Auckland City Council     NZLR   Cuthill v State Electricity Commissioner of Victoria   VR   at    FC  Baker v Australian Asbestos Insulations Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at    The Law Reform Commission dealt with the present issue under the heading  Evidence Admissible for a Non hearsay Purpose   ALRC No   Vol   at   stating  footnotes omitted      Under existing law hearsay evidence that is admissible for a non hearsay purpose is not excluded  but may not be used by the court as evidence of the facts stated  This involves the drawing of unrealistic distinctions  The issue is resolved by defining the hearsay rule as preventing the admissibility of hearsay evidence where it is relevant by reason only that it would affect the court s assessment of the facts intended to be asserted  This would have the effect that evidence relevant for a non hearsay purpose eg to prove a prior consistent or inconsistent statement  or to prove the basis of the expert s opinion will be admissible also of evidence of the facts stated          Tender of Prior Consistent and Inconsistent Statements                           Expert s evidence of Basis of Opinion   Reference has been made above to the uncertainties that exist as to the admissibility of such evidence and to the unclear exceptions which have had to be created to meet the problems created by the hearsay rule  Under the proposal  evidence by an expert of the facts on which his opinion is based will be admissible as evidence of those facts  Potential dangers have been raised  First  there is the danger that false evidence may be placed before the court  However  the expert will usually form a judgment about the accuracy of what he is told  In addition the tactical pressure on the parties to verify the facts relied upon by the expert should ensure that problems of assessment of the evidence will not arise  They will either call more direct evidence or have to face adverse comment  When assessment problems do arise  the exclusionary discretions may be used  This is similar to the present approach  Another danger suggested is that it could result in an increase in evidence adduced particularly that which is adduced in the Family Court and is of marginal relevance  As at present  the expert will do no more than adduce evidence of the basis of his opinion what he was told will be relevant to that opinion and the assessment of it  However  the relevance proposal and relevance discretion will apply and give the courts express control where now that control and its extent is unclear  It has also been suggested that parties will want to answer the allegations of marginal relevance and this will give rise to an increase in the evidence given  However  this should not occur  First the party against whom the evidence is led can object to the relevance of the facts related by the expert only those affecting his opinion will be relevant  As to such facts  that party will have to decide  as at present  whether he accepts those facts or wishes to challenge them  He would have to do this whether the evidence was admitted as the basis of the expert s opinion or to prove the facts asserted it would be a foolish party who relied on that distinction in relation to key factual elements and did not call rebutting evidence  The proposal in fact has the potential to save time and costs  At present  the party leading the expert evidence should lead non hearsay evidence to confirm all the statements made to and relied upon by the court  If he does not  it will be open to the opposing party to argue that the opinion should be rejected the hearsay rile will lie in wait  Under the proposal he can call witnesses to confirm the key material  and leave it up to the opposing party to cross examine the witness to raise the matters in issue  If he does not and leads evidence in rebuttal  it will be possible for the first party to call further evidence  The result of the Commission s deliberations was s   of the Evidence Act   The hearsay rule itself is set out in s   of that Act  Section   provides      Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation  In their joint report  Uniform Evidence Law  Report of December   the Australian  New South Wales and Victorian Law Reform Commissions have recognised that s   had the effect of excluding from the hearsay rule an expert s statement of the factual basis of his or her opinion  see     ff   The Commissions recognised  at     that an expert relies on  statements made to him or her by others about their observations of events which are facts in issue  together with a wide range of factual information from more remote sources   The Commissions gave as illustrations  knowledge acquired by experts from reading the work of other experts and from discussion with them  the reported data of fellow experts relied upon by such persons as scientists and technical experts in giving expert opinion evidence  factual material commonly relied upon in a particular industry or trade or calling    The Commissions also recognised that  through necessity  there existed those judge made exceptions to the hearsay rule referred to at   above  In addition to Borowski   they cited PQ v Australian Red Cross Society     VR

  The proposal that became s   was formulated with these exceptions in mind  with the intention that s   would perform the role the miscellaneous common law exceptions had performed and the complication of specific exceptions for these kinds of evidence avoided              Section   also applies to representations of fact unique to the particular case upon which the expert bases his or her opinion  Such evidence is hearsay at common law  but s   lifts the statutory hearsay rule in that situation citedBristol Myers Squibb Co v FH Faulding   Co Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii

inventor s publication will inevitably result in something being made or done which  if the patentee s patent were valid  would constitute an infringement of the patentee s claim  this circumstance demonstrates that the patentee s claim has in fact been anticipated   If  on the other hand  the prior publication contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner which would infringe the patentee s claim  but would be at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not do so  the patentee s claim will not have been anticipated  although it may fail on the ground of obviousness  To anticipate the patentee s claim the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakeable directions to do what the patentee claims to have invented   Flour Oxidising Co Ltd v Carr

demonstrated that there is a field of  specialised knowledge  there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training  study or experience  the witness has become an expert  the opinion proffered must be  wholly or substantially based on the witness s expert knowledge  so far as the opinion is based on facts  observed  by the expert  they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert  and so far as the opinion is based on  assumed  or  accepted  facts  they must be identified and proved in some other way  it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it  and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached  that is  the expert s evidence must explain how the field of  specialised knowledge  in which the witness is expert by reason of  training  study or experience  and on which the opinion is  wholly or substantially based  applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded  If all these matters are not made explicit  it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert s specialised knowledge  If the court cannot be sure of that  the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible  and  so

of Wilcox J in Merck   Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd   FCA         IPR     Merck   governed the issue before him  As Dr Barker understood the position  Merck produced the result that it did not matter that escitalopram was a new chemical entity having properties different from those of the racemate  citalopram  or that the registration of citalopram under its brand name Cipramil on the ARTG did not give the right to market escitalopram except as part of the racemate  All that mattered was that Cipramil did in fact  contain  escitalopram  or put another way  that escitalopram was present  to some extent  in Cipramil  and that Cipramil was included in the ARTG  It was also immaterial  according to Dr Barker  that escitalopram was not responsible for all of the activity of Cipramil  Dr Barker concluded that since citalopram hydrobromide  marketed under the brand name Cipramil and containing escitalopram  was first registered on the ARTG on   December   the Commissioner was required by reg     to amend the relevant entry in the Register to reflect the correct extension of the term of the Patent as expiring on   December    see   above   Lundbeck complains that the Dr Barker erred in finding that the first regulatory approval date was the date on which Cipramil was registered on the ARTG  and that Dr Barker ought to have found that it was the date on which Lexapro was so registered  see   above   Which legislative r gime applies For its part  Alphapharm relies on Merck   Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd     IPR     Merck    A patentee  Merck   Co Inc  Merck  appealed against the Commissioner s delegate s refusal of an extension  The appeal was undefended  the respondent having withdrawn from the proceeding  Wilcox J allowed the appeal  Sankyo Company Pty Ltd  Sankyo  had held a patent that claimed a compound of a particular formula  commonly referred to as Lovastatin  Lovastatin was entered on the ARTG  It was used for the control of cholesterol levels  Sankyo s patent expired on   February   and no extension was sought in respect of it  Merck applied for a patent on   June   with priority dates in   and    The patent was granted on the basis of the exclusion of certain claims which related to Lovastatin  On appeal  Wilcox J disagreed  saying  at   that Merck s LHA argument was  irrefutable  and that  if only on that ground  the delegate s decision must be reversed  His Honour stated  at   that LHA was a pharmaceutical substance per se disclosed in the complete specification of the patent and falling within its claims  and that the undisputed evidence was that Mevacor contained LHA  Wilcox J considered that it was irrelevant whether or not LHA itself was included in the ARTG  that for s  a  purposes it was enough that it was contained in some other good  Mevacor  that was included in the ARTG  at    His Honour thought that it did not matter that LHA was present in Mevacor only in minute quantities  at    Having regard to his conclusions supporting Merck s LHA argument  his Honour did not need to address its argument concerning Lovastatin  although he expressed the view that it seemed to him that the delegate had been right to reject that argument  In Merck   as in the other cases referred to above  the question before the Court did not concern a competition between two arguable first regulatory approval dates  However  Wilcox J s construction of  containing  in s   must be applicable to the word  contain  in s    If I were to follow Wilcox J  I would hold that Cipramil  contained    citalopram    Consideration of Lundbeck s  pharmaceutical substance per se   submission The Latin expression  per se  means  by or in itself  intrinsically  Opposed to PER ACCIDENS  defined relevantly to mean  By virtue of some non essential circumstance  contingently  indirectly  Oxford Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases  OUP     It is not every disclosure of every substance falling within the definition of  pharmaceutical substance  to which s  a  refers  A non essential or incidental disclosure of a pharmaceutical substance will not satisfy s  a   The pharmaceutical substance must be of the essence of a disclosure made in the specification  This construction is consistent with the requirement that it fall within the scope of the claim or claims  The racemate  citalopram  is the pharmaceutical substance per se disclosed in the specification of the Australian Citalopram Patent  whereas the   enantiomer of that racemate is the pharmaceutical substance per se disclosed in the specification of the Patent  in each case for the purpose of s  a   Moreover  the inclusion in the ARTG of Cipramil on   December   clearly signified the inclusion in the ARTG of goods that consisted of or contained the pharmaceutical substance citalopram  and the inclusion of Lexapro in the ARTG on   September   clearly signified the inclusion in the ARTG of goods that consisted of or contained the pharmaceutical substance   citalopram  in each case for the purpose of s  a   The precise question before the Court  however  is whether Cipramil was goods that contained the pharmaceutical substance   citalopram for the latter purpose referred toMerck Frosst Canada Inc v Canada  Minister of National Health and Welfare      CPR   th    In the Canadian case Pfizer Canada Inc v Apotex Inc     CPR  d    the court stated that the doctrine of equivalents applies to compositions where there is equivalence between chemical ingredients  That approach was followed in the Canadian case Merck Frosst Canada Inc v Canada  Minister of National Health and Welfare      CPR   th      In the later case  the court stated  quoting from the earlier one  that  basically  there is equivalence when the substituting ingredient or device  performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result   Accordingly  the court accepted expert evidence that the chemical properties and activities of the substituted ingredient were similar to those of the ingredient that it replaced  That evidence showed that both compounds were electron withdrawing groups and would therefore allow a particular reaction to occur  resulting in the same products  Importantly  the court accepted expert evidence that  a person reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the inter changeability of that ingredient not contained in the patent with the one that was   Accordingly  the court found infringement proved  The evidencecitedMeyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt is common ground that the basic test for lack of novelty in Australia is the  reverse infringement test  which was enunciated by Aickin J in the following well known passage in Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       The basic test for anticipation or want of novelty is the same as that for infringement and generally one can properly ask oneself whether the alleged anticipation would  if the patent were valid  constitute an infringement          This rule is stated in Blanco White TA  Patents for Inventions and the Protection of Industrial Design   th ed  Stephens  London    at     as follows      The test for lack of novelty is essentially the same as the test for infringement  that is to say  a prior use will invalidate a claim if it was such that it would infringe that claim if carried out after the grant of the patent concerned  while a prior disclosure will invalidate if it contains a clear description of  or clear instructions to do or make  something that would infringe if carried out after grant  Lundbeck submits that there are two elements of the reverse infringement test  first  that the alleged anticipation must disclose all of the essential features of the particular claim it is said to anticipate  and  second  that the alleged anticipation must have enabled the addressee to carry out the invention  Alphapharm submits   The submissions of Lundbeck misapplied the doctrine of enabling disclosure  even assuming it applies in Australia   Alphapharm submits  however  that the applicability of the doctrine need not be decided because there is no dispute that the Australian Citalopram Patent  enabled  the racemate  that is  the positive enantiomer  but only with the negative enantiomer in equal proportions  Clearly  the issue of the proper construction of claim   discussed above directly arises appliedMinnesota Mining and

Supp  d  My construction  independently arrived at  accords with that of District Judge Keeley in Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc v Mylan Laboratories Inc   F Supp  d    Her Honour had to construe a claim of  An S    pyridobenzoxazine compound represented by  a certain formula   Her Honour said  at       Thus  while it is certainly necessary to distinguish a new invention over the prior art  there is no indication that an inventor must use a plain English purity limitation  as Mylan contends  Instead  an inventor may use anything that a person skilled in the relevant art would understand to limit the claim  In this case  the term  S    clearly and plainly limits the claim language to the levorotatory enantiomer  Those skilled in the art clearly understand the term  S    to affirmatively denote only the levorotatory enantiomer of a racemic compound  and not the racemic compound itself       Later  at     Keeley J said that those skilled in the art would have understood the claim to cover  levofloxacin with a purity that was highly  but less than   optically pure   Her Honour s observations apply mutatis mutandis to the present case  While my construction would leave unanswered the question how much  impurity  would prevent a compound from meeting the formula in claim    see below  it does establish that when the compound is present only as   of a racemate  it does not meet the description in claim    The construction outlined above is also supported by the body of the specification and a certain convention in the way in which chemists understand references to compounds  both discussed below  but does not depend on those two additional considerations  I rely on them as alternative bases for my construction if I am wrong in thinking that claim   is unambiguous  Rules of construction There is a series of decisions of the various courts of the United States in which it has been accepted that unexpected superiority in effectiveness is probative of non obviousness  see  for example  Sterling Drug Inc v Watson   F Supp     at     In re Gershon     F  d     at   In re Skoner     F  d     at   Ex parte Sohda   WL   at     In re Chupp     F  d     at     Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc v Mylan Laboratories Inc   F Supp  d   at      In some of these cases it has been said that the evidence of unexpected superior clinical benefits has been

that the steps of the A process were different from the integers of Claim  b   Another defence raised by Alphapharm concerns the definition of  exploit  in Schedule   to the Act  Section   of the Act provides that  subject to the Act  a patent gives the patentee the exclusive rights  during the term of the patent  to exploit the invention and to authorise another person to do so  Section   provides that a patent  has effect throughout the patent area   The definition of  exploit  in the Dictionary in Schedule   is as follows      exploit   in relation to an invention includes   a  where the invention is a product make  hire  sell or otherwise dispose of the product  offer to make  sell  hire or otherwise dispose of it  use or import it  or keep it for the purpose of doing any of those things  or   b  where the invention is a method or process use the method or process or do any act mentioned in paragraph  a  in respect of a product resulting from such use       Alphapharm submits that para  b  of the definition requires that the use of the method or process be in the  patent area   The  patent area  is defined in the Dictionary in Schedule   and may  for convenience

Professor Montgomery can be dealt with  In this respect  I note the statement made by Cooke J in Seyfang v G D Searle   Co   QB   at       It does appear to me with the greatest respect that a system

knowledge as at the priority date  would have taken steps towards the invention  as a matter of routine  in the expectation that they might well produce the invention or some other useful result  endorsing statements in Wellcome Foundation Ltd v V R  Laboratories  Aust  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Wellcome   at   and Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v Biorex Laboratories Limited   RPC     Olin   at      The High Court has therefore insisted on the two elements    being led as a matter of routine to the desired result  and   having a reasonable expectation of achieving that result  Evidence of the patentee s own lack of success in earlier attempts is probative of the inventive nature of a successful solution to a problem   Wellcome at   the question of what weight is to be given to that evidence will depend on all the circumstances including the patentee s qualifications and experience in the field of the invention  Inventions that reveal an  unfelt want or need  are as likely or sometimes more likely to involve an inventive step as those that fulfil a  long felt want    Wellcome at   Astra at    Obviousness in relation to the product claims and the method claim Obviousness means different things in relation to the product claims  claims     and the method claim  claim    Alphapharm criticises Lundbeck for failing to make that distinction  In the case of the method claim  the question of obviousness assumes as the starting point the goal of obtaining the   enantiomer  In relation to the product claims  on the other hand  the question is whether that goal was itself an obvious one to pursue  Common general knowledge of methods available to resolve racemates may  however  be relevant to the obviousness of the product claims  It is relevant to the question whether it was obvious to want to obtain   citalopram to ask whether it was part of common general knowledge that there were or were not available straightforward  inexpensive methods of doing so that were expected to succeed  While evidence of the efforts of the inventor and of the efforts  or absence of them  of the patentee s opponent and others is admissible as relevant to the issue of obviousness  see  for example  Wellcome at   the question is an objective one requiring the creation of a hypothetical person  skilled but non inventive in the art  or a hypothetical team of such persons  The concept of common general knowledge at the priority date must be proved by evidence  and the assumption made that the hypothetical person or team was possessed of that common general knowledge  In Wellcome  Aickin J  with whom the other members of the High Court agreed  stated  at           not all inventions are to be classified as fulfilling a long felt want  Those which reveal an  unfelt want  are as likely  or sometimes more likely  to involve an inventive step       In Astra at   Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ approved of this passage  However  neither Aickin J in Wellcome nor their Honours in Astra were saying that evidence of unexpected benefits is admissible  Rather  the point they were making was that evidence of previous unsuccessful attempts to satisfy a long felt want  while admissible  might not be entitled to much weight since inventive step can be present  not only in the presence of a long felt want and associated motivation  but also in their absence  It seems to me that Lundbeck has set up a  straw man  to knock down  In the light of the nature of the case that Lundbeck had to counter  it was only evidence of what was commonly known and expected at the priority date that it was entitled to seek to prove  Evidence of post priority date surprises did not fall within that description followedWm Wrigley Jr Company v Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd     IPR  There is a principle that all that is within the scope of a claim must be useful if the claim is not to fail for inutility  or  to express the matter differently  a claim is bad if it

cited  Alphapharm relies on the testimony of Professor Montgomery who was asked what the highest therapeutically useful unit dose of escitalopram was  He said that it was   mg of escitalopram  but that in treating obsessive compulsive disorder  OCD  clinicians normally use above that level  and that unit dosages of   mg and   mg are often used in the treatment of resistant OCD  Professor Montgomery was also asked what would be the minimum useful dose  He said that   mg was found to be effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in a very large study  but that that amount was found to be ineffective in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder  He said that there is a general notion that one should use lower doses in the case of the elderly  and that the   mg dose is used for the treatment of them
