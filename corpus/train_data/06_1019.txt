au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Tribunal was not obliged to make the case for the appellant   Saliba v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at    The appellant s main claim before the Tribunal was to a well founded fear of persecution because he was a member of the Bihari community in Bangladesh  Although there was no direct claim of persecution for political opinion  that is not the end of the matter  A claim   not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal     NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         FCR   at       In short  the appellant did not raise matters to the Tribunal which articulated or raised a claim to persecution based on political opinion  No such claim was expressly made nor did it arise clearly on the material before the Tribunal   NABE at    There was no error on the part of the Tribunal in failing to consider such a claim  The Tribunal dealt with the matters raised by the appellant in the context of the claim made by him to the Tribunal  Not only was the Tribunal unaware that such a claim arose from the factual matters raised by the appellant  but so also was counsel who appeared before the Federal Magistrate and her Honour   The appellant told the Tribunal that if he returns to Bangladesh the hooligans will try to kill him  He also said that Biharis have no human rights in Bangladesh and no protection  However  he made no claim that he had sought protection from any person  The Tribunal expressed some doubts about whether the appellant had confrontations with the hooligans  but accepted that he had objected to their illegal activities within the camp  The Tribunal expressed the view that if they had wished to harm the appellant they would have already done so  The appellant claimed no harm to himself   The appellant does not challenge the Tribunal s factual conclusions but contends that the Tribunal was obliged to and did not consider whether the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution on return to Bangladesh  Mr Karp  who appears for the appellant  pointed to matters such as the sincerity of the opinion held by the appellant and whether he would be expected to re engage in his activities on his return to Bangladesh  However  the Tribunal concluded that there was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the appellant has suffered treatment amounting to persecution in the past and nothing in the evidence to indicate that there is a real chance that the appellant would face treatment amounting to persecution if he returns to Bangladesh citedSaliba v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   The Tribunal was not

explanation for the failure to raise the new ground below was given by the appellant other than the briefing of new counsel  I accept that there is no detriment to the first respondent other than costs and that the potential consequences to the appellant are serious  I also take into account the integrity of the appellate process as discussed in VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at   and     There is  in my view  little or no prospect of the proposed ground of appeal succeeding for the reasons I have given  Accordingly  the application for leave to file the amended notice of appeal is refused  There being no other ground of appeal pressed it also follows that the appeal is dismissed  The appellant is to
