Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Edison Mission Operations and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The CEPU contests the allegations against it  On   April   I ordered that the contested proceeding between the ACCC and the CEPU concerning the CEPU s liability under ss   and   of the TPA be heard prior to the penalty hearing as between the ACCC and Edison  see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Edison Mission Operations and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd   FCA    There was no appearance for Edison at the hearing of the contested proceeding between the ACCC and the CEPU   The hearing proceeded by viva voce evidence  The ACCC called five witnesses  Four of the witnesses  Colin Sutherland  Sutherland  Paul Burns  Burns  Wayne Buckley  Buckley  and Mark Pearson  Pearson  were employees of Edison or a related company at all relevant times  Sutherland was a general manager of Edison Mission Energy Australia Pty Ltd  EME  and a director of Edison and certain of its related entities including Valley Power Pty Ltd  Valley Power   Burns was the manager of community and employee relations for EME and was stationed at Loy Yang B  Sutherland and Burns had the principal carriage of discussions between Edison and the CEPU in August    Pearson was the maintenance manager of EME s plant at Loy Yang B  Buckley held the position of maintenance coordinator for EME at Loy Yang B and reported directly to Pearson  Nothing in this case turns on any distinction between the various corporate entities within the Edison group of companies and  where the context permits  I refer to them simply as  Edison   The other witness was David Nabulsi  Nabulsi  the sole director of a company called DJN Electrical   Instrumentation Pty Ltd  DJN   Prior to August   DJN regularly supplied services to Edison at Loy Yang B in its capacity as an electrical contractor   In addition  the ACCC relied on an affidavit of Rodney McKemmish  McKemmish  sworn   September    Exhibit RMCK   to McKemmish s affidavit is his expert forensic report in relation to the authenticity and source of certain emails which were discovered by Edison and which are relevant to the ACCC s case against the CEPU  The affidavit was received in evidence subject to the CEPU s objection to those parts of the affidavit in which McKemmish purported to express an opinion identifying the author of certain emails  The objection is a good one and I uphold it  McKemmish is not in a position to give admissible evidence concerning the authorship of the emails  His evidence is only admissible to the extent to which he addresses the authenticity and technical source of the emails  Apart from this objection  the CEPU did not dispute McKemmish s evidence   The CEPU did not call any witnesses or rely on any affidavit material in support of its case   There are two main issues in this proceeding  The first concerns the nature  scope and terms of the contract  arrangement or understanding that was made or arrived at between the respondents  The ACCC submitted that the true nature  scope and terms of the contract  arrangement or understanding can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding a written heads of agreement between Edison and the CEPU  which was signed on behalf of Edison on   August    the heads of agreement   The ACCC s primary argument was that the contract  arrangement or understanding was not confined to the literal terms of the heads of agreement  and that it prevented or hindered Edison from acquiring services from electrical contractors including DJN because they did not have a certified agreement with the CEPU  Further  the ACCC argued that the contract  arrangement or understanding was given effect by Edison  Alternatively  the ACCC argued that the same consequences follow even if the contract  arrangement or understanding is entirely embodied in the heads of agreement approvedGibbins v Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union     FCR   Section  E was originally introduced into the TPA by the Trade Practices  Boycotts  Amendment Act    Cth   While there are minor differences in the drafting of that section in comparison to the current s  E  it had essentially the same objects and a similar operation  see Gibbins v Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union     FCR     Gibbins     The original s  E was repealed by the Industrial Relations Reform Act    Cth   In   s  E was re enacted it its current form by the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act    Cth   Section  EA was

Society of Australia  ACT  Ltd     FCR     My conclusion regarding the scope of the contract  arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU is similar to the conclusion reached by Smithers J in Gibbins   a case concerning the original form of s  E  In Gibbins   the second respondent  Borthwicks  entered into an agreement with the Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union  AMIEU  as a result of conciliation proceedings under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act    Cth   Essentially  the agreement provided that the Borthwicks would not  invite or engage  carriers of livestock who were banned by the AMIEU to come onto its abattoir works to deliver stock  Smithers J observed at      It is clear that the immediate purpose of including the provisions in the agreement was  with the consent of Borthwicks  to lessen the likelihood that banned carriers would come upon the abattoir and to ensure  again with Borthwicks  consent  that if they did the stock were not to be unloaded or killed by Borthwicks  Union employees  But it went further than that  It obviously was designed to prevent Borthwicks from engaging banned carriers for carrying services    Smithers J held that the exclusionary purpose was part of a wider understanding between the parties  at        It is clear that the conciliation agreement not only governs by its own strength but has given rise to an understanding of a slightly wider nature  namely by the exclusion from an invitation to come onto the works or from being engaged to come onto the works  not only of carriers who have passed the picket lines but to those who according to Union judgment have done so or have done the equivalent    Smithers J found that the wider understanding arose out of the conciliation agreement and in connection with its implementation  at     The CEPU submitted that the existence of an agreement or arrangement in the week of   August would render the subsequent heads of agreement a sham  The CEPU s submissions on this point are misguided  To adapt the words of Smithers J in Gibbins   the heads of agreement was expressed in its own terms  but it implemented a wider arrangement or understanding  In my opinion  Edison and the CEPU intended that the heads of agreement should be controlled by  and operate in accordance with  the arrangement that had been agreed upon by the parties and put into place in the week of   August   The CEPU also argued that DJN s continued presence on site at Loy Yang B gives rise to an inference that the agreement was not intended to exclude DJN from continuing to supply services at Loy Yang B  The fact that DJN continued to perform some work on site at Loy Yang B in August and September   under pre existing contractual arrangements and as a subcontractor  does not affect my conclusion that the arrangement rendered DJN ineligible from continuing to supply services to Edison  Rather  as Burns  file note of the   August meeting shows  Edison implemented a process of  grandfathering  DJN s existing contracts   In Gibbins   Smithers J imposed liability on the union under s   of the TPA  His Honour found at   that it was  beyond question  that the AMIEU  which was a party to a contract  arrangement or understanding which contravened s  E  had aided  abetted  counselled and procured Borthwicks  contraventions  Then  as now  a union could not contravene

Authority   HCA         CLR   at              In closing submissions  senior counsel for the CEPU appeared to present an alternative argument that the second person must be  in contemplation  of the parties at the time of making the agreement  He relied on Corke   where Finkelstein J refused to grant an interlocutory injunction in relation to an agreement that allegedly contravened s  E  In my opinion  Corke does not provide any support for the argument  The provision in question in Corke obliged one of the respondents  Corke Instrument Engineering  Aust  Pty Ltd  Corke  to negotiate a specific site agreement with the union for each construction project  and provided that the site agreement must be agreed before work commences on the project  His Honour observed that it was entirely by chance that the deed containing the provision was made after Corke had entered into a particular supply agreement  His Honour said that the purpose for the inclusion of the provision in the deed was no different from the purpose for its inclusion in an earlier certified agreement and it was not included for the purpose of interfering with the supply of services from Corke  In this context  his Honour observed that it was inherently unlikely that the plant owner who contracted with Corke for its services was even in the contemplation of the CEPU or Corke when the certified agreement was negotiated  at      The present case is very different  The parties clearly had in contemplation that the provision would prevent or hinder a defined class of electrical contractors from performing work at Loy Yang B   In any event  I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the parties knew that DJN  in particular  would be prevented from supplying services to Edison under the arrangement  Nabulsi gave evidence that he had discussions with Mooney over the years about the possibility of DJN signing an EBA with the CEPU  Burns gave evidence that from time to time he and Mooney discussed which contractors were being engaged by Edison to carry out particular work at Loy Yang B  and whether those contractors had an EBA with the CEPU  The evidence clearly establishes that Mooney was in close discussion with Sutherland and Burns during the period between   August and   August    I infer from this evidence that the CEPU was aware that DJN performed work at Loy Yang B  that it did not have an EBA with the CEPU  and that the provision would exclude DJN from working at Loy Yang B if it did not enter into an EBA with the CEPU   There was some debate in the course of argument as to whether the purpose of the provision  as alleged by the ACCC  would fall within para  a  or para  b  of s  E   The ACCC relied on both paragraphs  In my opinion  the purpose of the provision that I have found to exist falls within the scope of both paras  a  and  b   It is therefore unnecessary for me to resolve the question of which paragraph applies citedProject Blue Sky Inc v

contravening s   of the TPA  In that case  the ACCC brought proceedings against eight corporations and eight individuals  A number of the respondents admitted to contraventions of the TPA  The remaining respondents did not seriously challenge the ACCC s case against the admitting respondents  but rather they sought to distinguish their actions from those of the admitting respondents  The contesting respondents submitted that  unlike the other respondents  they had not initiated any of the price increases in the pricing  cycle  at the heart of the ACCC s case  While the contesting respondents did not dispute that price increases were communicated amongst competitors in the Ballarat petrol market  they argued that their price increases were the result of competitive market forces and not made pursuant to an understanding to increase petrol prices in the event of a  price increase call  by the initiating respondents  His Honour stated at        It is well established

his evidence  Burns said that Sutherland outlined what had happened at the   August meeting and proposed that the issues be settled  There was then general discussion about the two issues that the CEPU had asked the company to address concerning site access and the requirement that contractors have a certified EBA in place with the CEPU  By the end of the meeting  Burns said that agreement was reached as to what Edison was going to do       We in essence agreed that we would only employ electrical contractors that had a certified EBA in place and that the one contractor that the only contractor that seemed to be impacted which was DJN  would continue the work which it had been commissioned to do until that had concluded    Burns recollected that Pearson or Buckley mentioned during the teleconference that the only contractor who appeared to be affected by this agreement was DJN  Burns also gave evidence that the reference to  Grandfather existing contracts  in his handwritten note referred to the fact that DJN would be permitted to continue work it had already been commissioned to do until that work was concluded   Pearson s understanding of what was discussed in the teleconference was that Edison was minded to proceed down the path of entering into an agreement with the CEPU that would put a limitation on Loy Yang B maintenance  such that only electrical contractors who had certified agreements with the CEPU would be engaged  Pearson said it was explained that Edison was proceeding down this path in order to get the Simon Engineering site agreement for the peaker plant signed  so that construction of the plant could commence  Pearson also said that towards the end of the meeting  or just afterwards  Warrillow instructed him  and Buckley  that they were not to engage electrical contractors who did not have a certified agreement with the CEPU and that they should look at putting that instruction into place   The cases on s   of the TPA make

see also TNT at      Prior to   s  D referred to  particular persons  as the target of the proscribed provision  In Bullock  the Full Court left open the question whether Gray J had been correct in limiting the words  particular persons  in s  D to  persons whose identity is known or can be ascertained  at    In apparent response to the decisions in Bullock and TNT  the words  or classes of

Pty Ltd   HCATrans   On appeal  in Apco   the Full Court of this Court  Heerey  Hely and Gyles JJ  considered whether an understanding necessarily involves the making of a commitment to a particular course of action  as opposed to giving rise to a mere expectation or hope that a party will act in a certain way  After considering Merkel J s findings in Leahy   their Honours said at          Whilst the appellants attacked the factual finding that the parties arrived at the price fixing understanding outlined in   of the reasons for judgment  they did not dispute that the primary judge had enunciated the correct legal principles which are applicable in determining whether parties have entered into an understanding  In particular  the primary judge referred to the following observations of Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CC  NSW  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at    emphasis in original  which were specifically endorsed by the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at              The cases require that at least one party  assume an obligation  or give an  assurance  or  undertaking  that it will act in a certain way  A mere expectation that as a matter of fact a party will act in a certain way is not enough  even if it has been engendered by that party  In the present case  for example  each individual who attended the meeting may have expected that as a matter of fact the others would return to their respective offices by car  or  to express the matter differently  each may have been expected by the others to act in that way  Each may even have  aroused  that expectation by things he said at the meeting  But these factual expectations do not found an  understanding  in the sense in which the word is used in ss   and  A   The conjunction of the word  understanding  with the words  agreement  and  arrangement  and the nature of the provisions show that something more is required         The primary judge s inference at   that Anderson  the Director and General Manager of one of the respondent companies  expected that his competitors would hold their increased price for a time whilst he was deciding whether or not to match their prices represents Anderson s assessment of what was likely to occur  without any assurance being given to him that the competitors would act in that way  It is no more than what Lindgren J described as a  factual expectation  which falls short of an  understanding     Special leave to appeal the Full Court s decision was refused by the

email to Mighell on   August said     Dean Attached is the draft agreement as prepared by our solicitors  Please call me on Tuesday  if you can      Regards     Col   The terms of this email indicate Sutherland had previously discussed the question of a draft agreement with Mighell and that Mighell was aware that a draft agreement between Edison and the CEPU dealing with contract labour was being prepared by Edison s solicitors   It is clear that Sutherland was in direct discussion with CEPU officers about the heads of agreement  In addition to the suggestion in the   August email that Mighell should call Sutherland on Tuesday  the CEPU s email of   August shows that Sutherland was in direct discussion with Mooney about the heads of agreement  Between   August and   August  most probably on   August  Sutherland told Burns that the way the draft heads of agreement was worded was not satisfactory to the CEPU because it did not give the union anything  This exchange confirms that Sutherland was in direct discussion with Mooney  and perhaps other CEPU officers  about the heads of agreement   In my opinion  the fact that Edison sought and obtained Corrs  assistance in drafting the heads of agreement in the week of   August does not alter the probability that the   August letter was dispatched by Sutherland on   August  It is not uncommon for those charged with finding a solution to a commercial problem to arrange a solution and then seek legal advice in relation to the documentation of that solution  especially when the matter is urgent followedJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR

also David Jones at     Senior counsel for the ACCC urged me to apply the principles enunciated by the High Court in Jones v Dunkel to support the inference that Edison and the CEPU made an arrangement to the effect alleged by the ACCC  While it is clearly open to me to infer from the CEPU s failure to call evidence from key players at the CEPU who would have direct knowledge of the events in question that those witnesses would not assist the CEPU s case  there are limits to the Jones v Dunkel principle  The principle allows me to draw inferences that are open on the evidence more confidently than might otherwise be the case  but it cannot be used to make up for gaps in the evidence  In this case  the inferences that I have drawn from the evidence are so clear that I do not need to rely upon Jones v Dunkel   It is  nonetheless  correct that the absence of evidence adduced by the CEPU from Mighell and Mooney allows me to infer with greater confidence that the CEPU received the letter of   August from Sutherland and that it did so before Mooney signed the Simon Engineering MOU on   August  More generally  the absence of evidence from the CEPU allows me to conclude  more confidently  that Edison had communicated to the CEPU by   August the fact that Edison agreed to the CEPU s requirement that electrical contractors not be permitted to perform work at Loy Yang B unless they had a current certified agreement with the CEPU   The CEPU advanced a series of reasons why I should infer that the   August letter was not sent to the CEPU   First  it argued that to infer that the   August letter was sent is inconsistent with the fact that Burns and Sutherland agreed to seek advice from Corrs on   August or in the week of   August  Sutherland gave evidence that he recalled having some discussions by telephone with Burns at Loy Yang B and arising from those discussions they thought that Edison should get some advice from Corrs  He said that Burns agreed to approach Corrs to get the advice  He also said that he believed his discussion with Burns by telephone took place on   August and that the proposed legal advice was to relate to both the site access issue and the electrical contractors issue  Sutherland said that Burns made the contact with Corrs  although Sutherland was involved in an initial meeting with Corrs  Sutherland confirmed that Corrs drafted the heads of agreement  On the other hand  Burns said he was not involved in giving any instructions to Corrs to prepare the draft heads of agreement appliedNews Ltd v

I accept the view that it is the subjective purpose of those engaging in the relevant conduct with which the court is concerned  All other considerations aside  the use in s   of  purpose  and  effect

to satisfy s  E  Like s  E  s  D  is outside the ambit of s  F and does not contain any explicit requirement that the purpose be a  substantial  purpose  The High Court has construed s  D  as requiring that the purpose be an operative subjective purpose  Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union     ALR   at     per Deane J  In my opinion  s  E  should be

www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The issue of  purpose  was investigated by the High Court in South Sydney in the context of s   and s  D of the TPA  The case concerned a sporting club  South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd  Souths  which alleged that News Ltd and the Australian Rugby Football League Ltd  ARL  had entered into a contract  arrangement or understanding in contravention of s   of the TPA  The alleged agreement between News Ltd and ARL was for the merger of two rugby league competitions  It provided for a unified rugby league competition to be conducted between  ultimately  fourteen teams only  The trial judge held that although the fourteen team term was part of a contract  arrangement or understanding made between News Ltd and ARL  it did not have the purpose of preventing  restricting or limiting the supply or acquisition of services from particular persons or classes of persons  The Full Court overturned the trial judge s decision  Merkel and Moore JJ  Heerey J dissenting  see South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd   FCA         FCR    Merkel J found that the trial judge had conflated the purpose of the merger  joint venture and regional participation provisions of the agreement  with the purpose of the fourteen team term provision  at        Merkel J held at     that the agreement had the purpose of preventing the supply or acquisition of services from a particular class of persons by restricting or limiting supply or acquisition to or from the clubs or entities selected to be included in the merged competition  Moore J found that by operation of the fourteen team term  the services supplied by Souths and other affected clubs would be limited and restricted  at        In dissent  Heerey J held that the exclusion of clubs from the merged competition was not a purpose at all  at      Heerey J agreed with the trial judge that while the fourteen team term limited  and was intended to limit  the number of clubs in the competition  it did not follow that the provision was included for the purpose of preventing the supply of services to  or the acquisition of services from  clubs in excess of the fourteen  at       The High Court overturned the Full Court s decision  Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ  Kirby J dissenting   Each of their Honours  separate reasons for judgment considered the proper approach to assessing the  purpose  of a provision in a contract  arrangement or understanding for the purposes of ss   and  D of the TPA  Gleeson CJ stressed the distinction between the purpose and the motive for including a provision in a contract  arrangement or understanding at            Purpose is to be distinguished from motive  The purpose of conduct is the end sought to be accomplished by the conduct  The motive for conduct is the reason for seeking that end  The appropriate description or characterisation of the end sought to be accomplished  purpose  as distinct from the reason for seeking that end  motive  may depend upon the legislative or other context in which the task is undertaken     I n the context of competition law  it is necessary to identify purpose by describing what is sought to be achieved by reference to what is relevant in market terms  The purpose of the fourteen team term was the objective  in relation to the nature of their business arrangements  that News and ARL sought to achieve  not the reason why they sought to achieve that objective  They may have had different  and multiple  reasons for their conduct  The manifest effect of a provision in an agreement  in a given case  may be the clearest indication of its purpose  In other cases  it may be difficult  or even impossible  to determine the purpose  of a kind relevant to the operation of the Act  of a provision in a written contract merely by reading the document  And  of course  the legislation deals with contracts  arrangements or understandings    His Honour found that  in the circumstances of the case  it was necessary for the agreement to state how many clubs would participate in the merged competition  and by selecting fourteen as the number News Ltd and ARL did not have a purpose of excluding any particular club or clubs  at     and at       While the manifest effect of the provision may provide  as Gleeson CJ said  the clearest indication of subjective purpose  care must be taken that evidence of the effect of a provision does not render the test an objective one  Gummow J warned against this danger at      It must be kept in mind that the effect that the parties sought to achieve through inclusion of the provision in a contract  arrangement or understanding is crucial to the test of subjective purpose   Both McHugh and Gummow JJ expressed some hesitation about determining purpose under s  D by reference to the subjective purpose of the makers of the provision  but in the end they both accepted the correctness of the subjective interpretation of the section  at       per McHugh J and at       per Gummow J  cf Kirby J at      McHugh J agreed with Gummow J that the trial judge applied a subjective test of purpose and his findings should be upheld  at       Section  E  requires consideration of the subjective purpose for inclusion of the provision in a contract  arrangement or understanding  not the purpose of the contract  arrangement or understanding as a whole  As Callinan J said in South Sydney at     in relation to purpose under s      It is the purpose of the provision that is important  The discovery of that purpose is by no means necessarily to be gained by an examination of the provision itself only  As with any term of an agreement or arrangement  a provision may  sometimes must  be read with  and seen for its true meaning  effect and purpose  the relevant agreement or arrangement as a whole    Gummow J agreed with Callinan J on this point  see at     appliedASX Operations Pty

Australia Pty Ltd  No       FCR      Pont Data    at       In Pont Data   the Full Court considered the approach to the determination of purpose under s  F which  like s  E  operates where a particular provision was included in a contract  arrangement or understanding for a proscribed purpose  Their Honours said at      In its operation upon provisions stated to have a particular purpose  s  F uses the words  the provision was included in the contract     for that purpose or for purposes that included or include that purpose   This indicates that s  F  in this operation  requires one

expression  The application of a subjective test does not exclude a consideration of the circumstances surrounding the reaching of the understanding   On the facts in Pont Data   the relevant provisions were included in the agreements because one of the parties  ASX Operations Pty Ltd  had insisted upon their inclusion  The other party  Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd  had objected to the inclusion of the provisions  In those circumstances  the Court considered that it was appropriate to look to the purposes of the party as a result of whose efforts the provisions were included  at    In the present case  the CEPU instigated the requirement that resulted in the provision  but neither party submitted that either Edison or the CEPU objected to its inclusion  Thus  in my view  it is appropriate to consider the subjective purposes of both Edison and the CEPU in determining whether the provision was included for the proscribed purpose   I reject the CEPU s submission that s  E requires consideration of the subjective purposes of Edison  to the exclusion of the CEPU s purposes  The language of the section does not suggest that the inquiry as to purpose is limited to a consideration of the purpose of the party to the contract  arrangement or understanding upon which liability is directly imposed  In my opinion  the subjective purposes of each of the parties to a contract  arrangement or understanding are relevant to the determination of the purpose for which that provision was included  I doubt that s  E requires the Court to search  perhaps vainly  for a common purpose  Pont Data at   see also South Sydney per McHugh J at      However  I do not need to express any final view on this issue because I have concluded on the evidence that there was no relevant disparity between the CEPU s purpose and Edison s purpose for including the provision   In any event  in Pont Data   the Full Court considered the phrase  particular persons or classes of persons  in the context of s  D  The Court found that the phrase allowed for the identification of persons by reference to a negative characterisation  namely  persons who may not be supplied with information unless they accepted and became bound by the restraints imposed by the agreements at issue  The Full Court said at      It was said  by the appellants  that the persons or classes excluded must still be  identified  if s  D is to apply  That may be conceded  but they are identified  in the present case  by the characteristic that they may not be supplied with the information in question  unless they accept and become bound by the restraints imposed by the Dynamic Agreement  Such persons come within a particular category or description defined by a collective formula  cf Pearks v Moseley  Re Moseley s Trusts     App Case   at    They ordinarily would be treated as constituting a particular class  even though at any one time the identity of all the members of the class might not readily be ascertainable  What distinguishes the class and makes it particular is that its members are objects of an anti competitive purpose  with which s  D is concerned   In Rural Press   the High Court did not find any error in the Full Court s conclusion in Pont Data that a particular class can be defined by its exclusion from supply or acquisition  at       per Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ  see also Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at     and Gummow J in South Sydney at       It follows that  if and to the extent that s  E requires the second person to be particularly or specifically identified  that requirement can be satisfied by the use of a negative or exclusionary formula  as in Pont Data    It was not in dispute that there was a contract  arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU in relation to Edison s engagement of electrical contractors to perform work at the Loy Yang B site  The parties differed about the nature  scope and content of that contract  arrangement or understanding   As I have already noted  the ACCC put its case in essentially two ways  Its primary case was that prior to   August   Edison and the CEPU made a contract or arrangement  or arrived at an understanding  that all electrical contractors performing work at Loy Yang B must have a current certified agreement with the CEPU prior to commencing work at the site  The ACCC contended that this contract  arrangement or understanding was broader than  and overshadowed and controlled  the provision that was subsequently inserted in the heads of agreement   Section  E does not require that the provision be included for the purpose of preventing or hindering a person who is particularly or specifically identified  It is sufficient for the purposes of s  E that the  second person  be identified by reference to a group of persons who possess a particular characteristic  Pont Data at    Here  the relevant group of persons comprised electrical contractors performing  or who wished to perform  work at Loy Yang B who did not have a current certified agreement with the CEPU  The provision in question here specifically identifies and defines the particular group of

Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at              The cases require that at least one party  assume an obligation  or give an  assurance  or  undertaking  that it will act in a certain way  A mere expectation that as a matter of fact a party will act in a certain way is not enough  even if it has been engendered by that party  In the present case  for example  each individual who attended the meeting may have expected that as a matter of fact the others would return to their respective offices by car  or  to express the matter differently  each may have been expected by the others to act in that way  Each may even have  aroused  that expectation by things he said at the meeting  But these factual expectations do not found an  understanding  in the sense in which the word is used in ss   and  A   The conjunction of the word  understanding  with the words  agreement  and  arrangement  and the nature of the provisions show that something more is required         The primary judge s inference at   that Anderson  the Director and General Manager of one of the respondent companies  expected that his competitors would hold their increased price for a time whilst he was deciding whether or not to match their prices represents Anderson s assessment of what was likely to occur  without any assurance being given to him that the competitors would act in that way  It is no more than what Lindgren J described as a  factual expectation  which falls short of an  understanding     Special leave to appeal the Full Court s decision was refused by the High Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v APCO Service Stations Pty Ltd   HCATrans     In Rural Press   the High Court did not find any error in the Full Court s conclusion in Pont Data that a particular class can be defined by its exclusion from supply or acquisition  at       per Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ  see also Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at     and Gummow J in South Sydney at       There is utility in making a declaration of the kind sought by the ACCC  see Rural Press at      It will record the consequences of the Court s findings in a legally binding way  and will mark the Court s disapproval of the CEPU s conduct  However  it is essential that the terms of the declaration are tied to the proven facts  see Rural Press at     cf Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd   HCA         CLR   and Electricity Supply Association of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR    I propose to vary the terms of the declarations sought by the ACCC to ensure that they accord with and are sufficiently tied to the factual findings I have made followedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The High Court s enunciation of the civil standard of proof in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   is frequently cited  but Dixon J s statement at     bears repeating     Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution  it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal  But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved  The seriousness of an allegation made  the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description  or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal  In such matters  reasonable satisfaction  should not be produced by inexact proofs  indefinite testimony  or indirect inferences    I have applied these principles to the determination of the issues in this case   Based on the factual findings and applying the legal principles which I have set out above  I am satisfied that prior to   August   Edison and the CEPU made or entered into an arrangement that included a provision that Edison would not engage electrical contractors to perform work at Loy Yang B unless they have a current certified agreement with the CEPU prior to commencing work at the site  The arrangement involved a commitment on Edison s part not to permit electrical contractors who did not have a certified agreement with the CEPU to work at Loy Yang B  In exchange  the CEPU committed to signing the Simon Engineering site agreement  The evidence establishes  in my view  that Edison and the CEPU made or entered into this arrangement prior to   August    The heads of agreement was entered into in accordance with  and was controlled by  this arrangement  I will elaborate my reasons for these findings in the course of considering the arguments advanced by the CEPU   The CEPU submitted that the evidence showed only one  meeting of the minds  between Edison and the CEPU that is  the heads of agreement of   August    The CEPU contended that the communications and events surrounding the making of the heads of agreement are insufficient to prove that there was a meeting of the minds between Edison and the CEPU  rather  they are evidence of the negotiations and canvassing of proposals which ultimately culminated in the heads of agreement on   August  In my view  these submissions do not grapple with the overall force and effect of the evidence that is before the Court   In his reasons for judgment  Dixon J explained why Mallan could not be held liable as an accessory to the principal offence  at        On the interpretation I have given to s      for more than one reason s    of the Crimes Act cannot apply to a public officer so as to make him an accessory to the offence of the company  In the first place  the public officer s act on behalf of the company making it an offender ipso facto amounts to a substantive offence on his part under s       In the second place  the sub section makes him the actor  the principal  for whose guilty conduct the company is responsible vicariously  It would be an inversion of the conceptions on which the degrees of offending are founded to make the person actually committing the forbidden acts an accessory to the offence consisting in the vicarious responsibility for his acts      But if the interpretation were placed on s      opposed to that which I have adopted  I should think it would equally follow that s    of the Crimes Act could not be applied to make the public officer liable under that provision  For it would mean that by s      the legislature had made the company responsible as an offender for the knowing and wilful understatement of income by the public officer to the exclusion of any such liability of the public officer  If that conclusion were reached it would be impossible to make him liable for the same conduct under a provision dealing with accessories  There is a number of cases which show that the application of sections dealing with aiding and abetting may be excluded by the nature of the substantive offence or the general tenor or policy of the provisions by which it is created  cf  R  v  Tyrrell   Morris v  Tolman   Ellis v  Guerin   distinguishedCodelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The CEPU submitted that  as the heads of agreement is a binding contract  the Court s task is to interpret the words of the contract  without regard to negotiations which transpired beforehand  so long as the words of the contract are clear  Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority  NSW    HCA         CLR     Codelfa     It said that cl     of the heads of agreement merely obliged Edison to  request  that electrical contractors have acceptable industrial arrangements  On the CEPU s preferred reading  cl     simply provided that having a current certified agreement with the CEPU was one way  but not the mandated way  that an electrical contractor could have acceptable industrial arrangements for the purposes of the heads of agreement citedL Grollo   Co Pty Ltd v Nu Statt Decorating Pty Ltd     FLR   In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lutovi Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Lutovi    the meaning of an  arrangement  was considered in the context of s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   Gibbs and Mason JJ  Murphy J agreeing  said at      In the context of s   an arrangement is something less than a binding contract or agreement  something in the nature of an understanding which may not be enforceable at law   Newton v Federal Commissioner of Taxation       It is  however  necessary that an arrangement should be consensual  and that there should be some adoption of it  But in our view it is not essential that the parties are committed to it or are bound to support it  An arrangement may be informal as well as unenforceable and the parties may be free to withdraw from it or to act inconsistently with it  notwithstanding their adoption of it    The High Court s formulation in Lutovi has been applied in the context of  arrangement or understanding  under s   of the TPA  see  eg  Email at   and David Jones at      In Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Ltd     FCR     TNT    Franki J referred to the above passage from Lutovi and said at      I lean with respect to the views expressed by Smithers J in L Grollo   Co Pty Ltd v Nu Statt Decorating Pty Ltd     at     where he said           I have to remember that the concept of an understanding is broad and flexible  It may arise merely where the minds of the parties are at one that a proposed transaction proceeds on the basis of the maintenance of a particular state of affairs or the adoption of a particular course of conduct   In David Jones at     Fisher J agreed with Franki J s comments in TNT and also favoured the views expressed by Smithers J in L Grollo   Co Pty Ltd v Nu Statt Decorating Pty Ltd     FLR     Under s  E of the TPA  I am not limited to an examination of the words of cl      This is not a proceeding to enforce a contract  Section  E is not concerned only with written agreements  it is also concerned with the making of an  arrangement  or arriving at an  understanding   An arrangement or understanding may be informal and unenforceable  Lutovi at    The concept of an  understanding  is a broad and flexible one  L Grollo   Co Pty Ltd v Nu Statt Decorating Pty Ltd   supra  at   TNT at   and David Jones at      For the reasons explained above  I am satisfied that there was a broader arrangement between the parties which overshadowed and controlled the language used in the heads of agreement  It was understood and agreed between the CEPU and Edison that the heads of agreement imposed an obligation on Edison not to retain electrical contractors at the Loy Yang B site if they did not have a current certified agreement with the CEPU  and that this is the way in which Edison would implement it  Nothing in cl     prevented Edison implementing its arrangement with the CEPU in this way consideredAustralian Workers  Union v John Holland Pty Ltd     IR   The CEPU submitted that the surrounding circumstances show that the provision was included for the purpose of securing the signing of the Simon Engineering site agreement  Senior counsel for the CEPU submitted that the present case is analogous to Australian Workers  Union v John Holland Pty Ltd     IR    That case involved a prohibition under s  K of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth  on dismissing an employee for  a prohibited reason  or for reasons that include a prohibited reason   The applicants claimed that the employer had terminated the employment of the second applicant for a  prohibited reason  namely  because the second applicant was a member of Australian Workers  Union  In determining the reason for the employer s termination of the second applicant s employment  Goldberg J had regard to a broader industrial crisis created by another entity that was affecting the employer  Goldberg J concluded that the second applicant s membership of the union was not the reason for the employer s termination of his employment  the major reason was to solve the broader industrial relations problem that the employer faced  at     and at      So too here  the CEPU submitted  the operative reason or purpose for including the provision was to secure the CEPU s signing of the Simon Engineering site agreement   This argument faces insurmountable difficulties  Edison s reason for entering into an agreement with the CEPU may have been to secure the signing of the Simon Engineering site agreement and to ensure that construction work on the peaker plant commenced without further delay  But that was the motive for the agreement  not the purpose of including the provision  South Sydney at      The purpose of the provision is the end that it seeks to achieve  Here  Edison s operative purpose for including the provision was to restrict the electrical contractors it could engage at Loy Yang B to those who had a current certified agreement with the CEPU  conformably with the request from the CEPU  That was also the manifest effect of the provision  Notably  the CEPU s argument does not address its own purpose for including the provision in its arrangement with Edison  On any view of the evidence  the CEPU s purpose for including the provision was to limit the electrical contractors who could be engaged to work at Loy Yang B to those who had a current certified agreement with the CEPU  The CEPU did not include the provision in order to get the Simon Engineering site agreement signed  that was the leverage that the CEPU used to get Edison to agree to include the provision consideredMallan v Lee   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The principles of accessorial liability were discussed by the High Court in Mallan v Lee   HCA         CLR     Mallan     The case involved a complaint laid against a company and its public officer  Mallan  for understating the company s income for the purposes of its income tax return   The company was charged pursuant to s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act with the principal offence  Mallan was charged as an accessory to the company s offence under s   of the Crimes Act    Cth   Section   of the Income Tax Assessment Act provided     Any person who  or any company on whose behalf the public officer  or a director  servant or agent of the company  in any return knowingly and wilfully understates the amount of any income or makes any misstatement affecting the liability of any person to tax or the amount of tax shall be guilty of an offence    The Court held that s   imposed liability for the offence on Mallan as a principal  and on the company vicariously for Mallan s acts  Thus  Mallan could not be held liable as an accessory to the principal offence   Mason J considered the application of Mallan and the exclusion of the doctrine of secondary participation at common law  His Honour identified a number of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to exclude liability for secondary participation  In particular  his Honour stated that the doctrine of secondary participation may be inapplicable  to a class of persons whom the substantive offence was designed to protect  or  where the substantive offence itself involves some element of secondary participation   Mason J continued at        It is inherent in the concept of secondary participation  however  that a person may be convicted on the basis of aiding  abetting  counselling or procuring the commission of a statutory offence although the statute creating the offence deals only with the liability of the principal offender  So much was stated by Coke and Hale   Co  Inst      P C         And it has been settled at common law at least since R  v  Potts   This is also the case even where the offence is of such a nature that the person could not have committed it as a principal offender  cf  R  v  Goldie   Ex parte Picklum   at pp      Mallan v  Lee   Reg  v  Australian Industrial Court   Ex parte C  L  M  Holdings Pty  Ltd     at pp         A similar view was expressed by Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ at      The application of that section  section   may be excluded by necessary implication  see Mallan v Lee  per Dixon J   Morris v Tolman   Ellis v Guerin   and it would be excluded if it appeared that the offence of culpable driving created by the legislature was intended to apply only to the driver of the vehicle involved and not to a secondary participant  The mere absence in the section of any reference to secondary participation does not  however  show any intention to exclude it  see Hale s Pleas of the Crown   vol   p   R v Potts    Mason J held at   that the mere description of the offender under s  A of the Crimes Act    NSW  as the driver of a motor vehicle cannot be seen as evidencing a legislative intention to exclude the operation of the common law with respect to secondary participation  Nor  his Honour opined  could such an intention be otherwise extracted from the nature of the offence or the terms of the section by which it was created  Accordingly  the applicant was liable to conviction on the basis that he aided  abetted  counselled or procured the commission of the offence of culpable driving by his employee  The same conclusion was reached by Gibbs CJ at   see also Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ at     In reliance on Dixon J s approach in Mallan   as affirmed in Giorgianni   the CEPU submitted that the question whether a statutory provision excludes accessorial liability is to be determined by having regard to the way in which a section is structured and the purposes for which it was enacted  If such an approach is applied in the present case  the CEPU argued  there is a strong inference that the legislature did not intend a union  as a necessary party to a contravention of ss  E and  EA  to be caught by the accessorial liability provisions of the TPA   It is important to note that the statutory provisions at issue in Giorgianni and Mallan differed in material respects from the provisions of the TPA in the present case  In Mallan   the Income Tax Assessment Act provided that the company on whose behalf the alleged accessory had acted was vicariously liable for his acts  In Giorgianni   the legislation deemed an accessory  who was not a  driver  to be liable as a principal for the offence of culpable driving  Nevertheless  Mallan and Giorgianni recognise that accessorial liability can be excluded by a sufficiently clear expression of a contrary legislative intention   Insofar as it is possible to discern the policy of the legislation  it is unlikely that the legislature intended to exclude a union from liability in relation to a contravention of ss  E and or  EA  Unions are not a class of persons whom the legislation is designed to protect  see Mallan v Lee   cf R v Tyrell     QB    Quite the opposite  ss  E and  EA were designed to prohibit certain types of industrial action by unions  Although liability is imposed on a union as principal for the purposes of some provisions of Pt IV of the TPA  the fact that this course is not taken in relation to ss  E and  EA does not  of itself  evidence a legislative intention to exclude a union from liability under ss   and   consideredGiorgianni v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Giorgianni v The Queen   HCA         CLR      Giorgianni    the High Court considered the circumstances in which the doctrine of secondary participation may be excluded  In that case  the applicant was charged with culpable driving under s  A of the Crimes Act    NSW  in reliance on s    Section   enabled an accessory to be convicted as a principal offender  The applicant was the lessee of a truck that suffered a brake failure and collided with two motor vehicles while being driven by the applicant s employee  An issue before the Court was whether the applicant could be convicted of the offence of culpable driving as a principal by reason that he had aided  abetted  counselled or procured the commission of the offence by his employee   In reliance on Dixon J s approach in Mallan   as affirmed in Giorgianni   the CEPU submitted that the question whether a statutory provision excludes accessorial liability is to be determined by having regard to the way in which a section is structured and the purposes for which it was enacted  If such an approach is applied in the present case  the CEPU argued  there is a strong inference that the legislature did not

driving  Nevertheless  Mallan and Giorgianni recognise that accessorial liability can be excluded by a sufficiently clear expression of a contrary legislative intention   It is also worth noting that ss   and   of the TPA catch accessorial conduct of the kinds falling within paras  d   e  or  f  which includes persons who are directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in  or party to  a contravention  cf Giorgianni   The application of accessorial liability to persons who are parties to a contravention indicates that the legislature intended that accessorial liability would attach to parties to a contract  arrangement or understanding which contravenes the principal provision   I am satisfied that ss   and   apply to a union which is a party to a contract  arrangement or understanding which contravenes ss  E and  EA  It follows that the CEPU is not excluded from accessorial liability under ss   and   of the TPA in relation to contraventions of ss  E and  EA   The next question is whether the CEPU s conduct attracts liability under ss   and    The principles of accessorial liability applicable to the present case can be shortly stated  It is necessary to prove

       FCR    I propose to vary the terms of the declarations sought by the ACCC to ensure that they accord with and are sufficiently tied to the factual findings I have made   In the present case  the ACCC sought injunctive relief against the CEPU in extremely wide terms  Effectively  the first order seeks to restrain the CEPU from aiding  abetting  counselling  procuring  inducing or attempting to induce  or being knowingly concerned in or party to Edison making a contract  arrangement or understanding with the CEPU where the contract  arrangement or understanding contains a provision that was included for the purposes described in s  E   The second order goes further and seeks to restrain the CEPU from aiding  abetting  etc any person making a contract  arrangement or understanding with the CEPU that contains a provision contravening s  E   The third order seeks to restrain the CEPU from counselling  procuring  inducing or attempting to induce Edison to give effect to a provision of a contract  arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU where the provision was included for a purpose proscribed by s  E   The fourth order is similar to the third except that it seeks to restrain the CEPU from counselling etc any person to give effect to a provision of a contract  arrangement or understanding between that person and the CEPU which contains a provision included for a proscribed purpose  None of the proposed injunctions are confined to the particular contract  arrangement or understanding which gave rise to Edison s contraventions in this case  and none are limited in time  In my opinion  the injunctions are cast far too widely   The first question is whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant any injunction against the CEPU or its officers in the circumstances which now prevail  The arrangement between Edison and the CEPU came to an end in late November    DJN resumed work at Loy Yang B in early    There is no suggestion in the evidence that the accessorial conduct on the part of the CEPU has recurred  or that it is likely to recur  On the other hand it is relevant to take into account the deliberate nature of the conduct that the CEPU engaged in during August     The terms of the injunctive orders proposed by the ACCC raise questions as to the appropriateness of granting any injunctive relief  In an attempt to keep the injunctions within proper bounds  the ACCC s proposed orders are replete with definitional provisions that attempt to mirror the requirements of s  E    and    Despite these extensive definitions  the ACCC s draft orders do not capture the exception which appears in s  E   The extensive definitional clauses that are attached to the draft orders mean that each order takes on a rather abstract appearance that largely restates the requirements of s  E    and   of the TPA  Two of the proposed orders refer specifically to a contract  arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU  but even those orders are not aimed at the August   arrangement because that ended long ago  The other two orders are directed to conduct that  inter alia  procures or induces any person to make  or to give effect to  any arrangement between that person and the CEPU where it contains a provision that would satisfy the requirements of s  E    and    As a result  these orders very much have the appearance of orders that attempt to restate the general prohibition that appears in s  E of the TPA   In my opinion  the terms of the injunctive orders proposed by the ACCC are plainly inappropriate  On the authorities  any injunction must have a clear and sufficient connection with the proven conduct that attracts the jurisdiction of the Court  Any injunction must also be capable of being expressed clearly and in a manner which can be understood by those required to comply with it  I would not contemplate an injunction that operates indefinitely  Where an injunctive order is sought in respect of a class of conduct  similar to proven conduct that has come to an end  I consider that it should only operate for a limited period of time  This is a course commonly taken in the authorities   On balance  I am persuaded that this is a case in which it is appropriate to grant an injunction for a limited period  and in quite specific terms  that will operate by way of deterrence and mark the Court s disapproval of the CEPU s conduct  In my view  the injunction must have a close nexus with the proven conduct that attracts the jurisdiction of the Court  I consider that it should operate for a period of three years and no longer citedElectricity Supply Association of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii

Practices Commission     FCR   The principles governing the grant of final injunctive relief under s   of the TPA  in a case such as this  are not in doubt  Section   confers a wide power on the Court to grant an injunction where it is satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute conduct of the description in paras  a   f   It has been described as a  widely drawn remedial provision available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon  the  public interest by contraventions of the provisions of the Act in Part IV and Part V  per French J in ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission     FCR      ICI    at    The breadth of the Court s discretion is underscored by s   which permits the Court to grant injunctive relief whether or not the person intends to engage in conduct of the kind restrained  or the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind  or there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the conduct is repeated or continued   In ICI  the Full Court at     and     rejected a submission that s   creates a presumption in favour of a grant of a final injunction where a contravention or proposed contravention of the TPA is made out  Lockhart J said at     that the public interest character of s   and the breadth and flexibility of its statutory provisions  do not mean that traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant  It remains relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct  whether it has ever occurred before  or whether imminent substantial damage is likely  although the absence of any one or more of those elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction  Equally  the public interest character of s   means that deterrence is a relevant consideration  French J said that there is room within the statutory framework and its underlying policy for an injunction which is not intended to restrain an apprehended

Consumer Commission v Z Tek Computer Pty Ltd     FCR   There are at least three limitations on the Court s power under s    They were summarised by Merkel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z Tek Computer Pty Ltd     FCR   at     in these terms     First  the power is confined by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA and in particular s    It is within the scope and purpose of s   to grant injunctive relief which is designed to prevent a repetition of the conduct for which the relief is sought      Secondly there is a contextual limitation within s   itself  As the jurisdiction to grant an injunction is enlivened by an alleged or actual contravention of a provision of Pt IV  IVA or V of the TPA  there must be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the contravention and the injunction granted  It is that nexus or relationship that enables determination by the Court of whether the injunction sought is  appropriate       Thirdly  there is the constitutional limitation which requires that the injunction granted be related to the case or controversy the subject of the proceeding  citedTrade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd     FCR   In ICI  the Full Court at     and     rejected a submission that s   creates a presumption in favour of a grant of a final injunction where a contravention or proposed contravention of the TPA is made out  Lockhart J said at     that the public interest character of s   and the breadth and flexibility of its statutory provisions  do not mean that traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant  It remains relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct  whether it has ever occurred before  or whether imminent substantial damage is likely  although the absence of any one or more of those elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction  Equally  the public interest character of s   means that deterrence is a relevant consideration  French J said that there is room within the statutory framework and its underlying policy for an injunction which is not intended to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct  but to deter an offender from repeating
