FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   March   Mrs Codd made a third claim for a war widow s pension under the Repatriation Act  A delegate of the Commission decided that the veteran s death was not war caused  On   October   the VRB affirmed the Commission s decision that the death of the veteran was not war caused  On   December   pursuant to s   of the VE Act   Mrs Codd applied to the Tribunal for review of the VRB s decision of   October    On   August   the Tribunal decided that the death of the veteran was war caused  On   June   the Federal Court allowed an appeal by the Commission from the decision of the Tribunal  on the basis that material before the Tribunal could not support the Tribunal s diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder  GAD  and that if the veteran had been suffering from GAD  the Tribunal had failed to consider whether a hypothesis of connection between that disease and the veteran s operational service was upheld by the relevant Statement of Principles  SoP  Repatriation Commission v Codd   FCA   at       and    The Court remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law   On   October   the Tribunal decided again  on different grounds  that the death of the veteran was war caused  On   November   the Commission appealed from the Tribunal s decision  It is the Tribunal s decision of   October   which is the subject of this appeal   Section   of the VE Act renders the Commonwealth liable to pay a pension to the dependents of a veteran whose death was war caused  Section   of the VE Act sets out the circumstances in which a veteran s death is taken to be war caused  They include if       b  the death of the veteran arose out of  or was attributable to   any eligible war service rendered by the veteran                           d  in the opinion of the Commission  the death of the veteran was due to an accident that would not have occurred  or to a disease that would not have been contracted  but for his or her having rendered eligible war service or but for changes in the veteran s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered eligible war service          Emphasis added  appliedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   Section  A  of the VE Act relevantly provides that a hypothesis connecting the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force a SoP or a determination by the Commission that upholds the hypothesis  The second basis  a determination by the Commission  is not relevant to the circumstances of this case  That is  the hypothesis raised  that is  pointed to  by the material will only be reasonable if the hypothesis is consistent with  or fits the template of  a SoP  see Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   at   endorsing the observations of Heerey J at first instance  Deledio v Repatriation Commission     ALD   at     The method by which ss         and  A   are applied was explained in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   at      The Full Court set out the course which the Tribunal is to take in a case such as the present in the following terms           The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person  No question of fact finding arises at this stage  If no such hypothesis arises  the application must fail         If the material does raise such a hypothesis  the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s  B  or    If no such SoP is in force  the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and  in consequence  the application must fail         If an SoP is in force  the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one  It will do so if the hypothesis fits  that is to say  is consistent with the  template  to be found in the SoP  The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist  and be related to the person s service  as required by ss  B d  and  e   If the hypothesis does contain these factors  it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts  nor otherwise fanciful  If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template  it will be deemed not to be  reasonable  and the claim will fail         The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  or in the case of a claim for incapacity  that the incapacity did not arise from a war caused injury  If not so satisfied  the claim must succeed  If the Tribunal is so satisfied  the claim must fail  It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it  In so doing  no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved   In McKenna   the Commission had determined that ischaemic heart disease and atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease suffered by Mr McKenna were each a war caused disease within the VE Act   The effect of the decision of Goldberg J at first instance was to reach a contrary conclusion  Goldberg J said   AAR   at        For the purposes of s  A  of the  VE  Act the hypothesis which has to be upheld by a  SoP  is the hypothesis which connects the disease suffered by a veteran with the circumstances of his service  So stated  the hypothesis has to point to a connection which starts with the disease in respect of which the application is made and ends with the service  That connection will comprise a number of links or factors each of which must be upheld by a  SoP  and  if need be  by more than one  SofP   In the instant case the relevant links are     diseases listed    When the hypothesis is identified this way it is then necessary  consistently with the course identified by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio   to ask and answer the question in accordance with s  A a  of the Act is there in force a SoP that upholds the hypothesis  that is to say the hypothesis connecting each of the diseases contracted by the respondent with the circumstances of his operational service  It is therefore necessary to identify whether there is in force a  SoP  which upholds the whole  and not just part  of this hypothesis      The Full Court endorsed the approach of Goldberg J and said at      Since the Authority had determined  SoP  in respect of the kinds of diseases suffered by Mr McKenna  s  A b  the next step which the Tribunal was required to take was to form an opinion whether the hypotheses pointed to by the material before the Tribunal were reasonable  It was only entitled to form the opinion that they were reasonable if they were upheld by  in the sense of consistent with  the relevant  SoP   In our view  for either of the hypotheses to be upheld by a  SoP  as required by s  A  of the Act  each of its sub hypotheses would have to be so upheld   A complex hypothesis  that is  one comprising more than one element or part  can be no stronger than each of its elements or parts      Emphasis added   In the present case  the Tribunal was bound to apply the McKenna principle  It explicitly rejected that approach  That was an error of law  On any view  one of the sub hypotheses was that the effects of the veteran s  service related alcohol habit      had  impaired his concentration and contributed to the fatal collision    As the Tribunal failed to ask the question about the alcohol related sub hypothesis  it failed to consider whether there was a SoP which upheld that sub hypothesis   Mr Green SC  counsel for the respondent  contended that even if the Tribunal had applied the McKenna principle to the SoP  it would have reached the same conclusion on the basis that there was no SoP which covered the hypothesis  and one assumes the sub hypothesis  that the veteran was a heavy drinker  In particular  Mr Green relied upon the following findings of the Tribunal     Contrary to submissions of the Respondent  there is evidence of the deceased being drunk on the evening prior to his death and hung over on the following morning        Whilst I am satisfied that on the evening prior to the fatal collision the deceased having regard to the evidence of Mrs Codd had been drinking heavily I am satisfied that he metabolised the alcohol during the period between arriving at home at approximately    pm and the collision at approximately    am  In those circumstances any alcohol residue at the time of the collision would have been so minuscule to safely permit a finding that at the time of the collision the deceased was not under the influence of alcohol  appliedRepatriation Commission v Hancock     AAR   Thirdly  as Selway J said in Repatriation Commission v Hancock     AAR   at   there are at least two additional steps before step one in the Deledio analysis  The steps were described by Selway J in Hancock as being       First  the AAT was required to determine  on balance of probabilities  whether the pre conditions other than causation  had been made out        Next  the AAT was required to determine on balance of probabilities what  kind of death   the veteran  had suffered  This involved the identification  on balance of probabilities  of any and all  SoP  and or determinations under s  A  of the Act and any other  kinds of death  which were applicable to that death      If one or more SoP were applicable  then the methodology in Deledio is applicable in relation to those  kinds of death      In the present matter then  it was necessary        to establish the pre conditions for the claim other than causation on the balance of probabilities   For example  in the present case  it was necessary for Mrs Codd to show that her husband was a veteran  that Mr Codd had died and that Mrs Codd was a widow  None of these pre conditions was in dispute here  and    in order to ascertain whether a SoP applies  to determine on the balance of probabilities the   kind of death   suffered by the veteran  s  A  and   of the VE Act    It is the second of these additional steps which is the subject of this appeal  It will be necessary to return to consider the phrase   kind of death met by the  veteran    in s  A  of the VE Act    The Tribunal decided that the death of the veteran was war caused  The hypothesis of connection between the veteran s death and his operational service was articulated by Dr Epstein in the following terms       The veteran s  drinking habits were probably war caused and there is a reasonable hypothesis pointing to the effects of alcohol impairing his concentration and contributing to the collision   The hypothesis was summarised   as the late veteran developing a service related alcohol habit the effects of which impaired his concentration and contributed to the fatal collision   It was that hypothesis the Tribunal accepted as a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran s death with the circumstances of his war service   The Tribunal declared that the   kind of death   met by the veteran was death by road accident  The Commission contends that on a proper construction of ss   and  A of the VE Act   the Tribunal s finding that the kind of death met by the veteran was  death by road accident  was not open to the Tribunal   As a result of the Tribunal s declaration of the   kind of death   as death by road accident  the Tribunal        found that there was no SoP which applied to that kind of death and proceeded on the basis that the application was to be determined by the law prevailing before the introduction of the regime of SoPs  and    not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were sufficient grounds to determine that the death was not war caused  set aside the decision under review and decided that the death was war caused appliedRepatriation Commission v McKenna     AAR   The Commission contends that the Tribunal s reasons for decision contain two errors of law and therefore  on appeal  raise two questions of law        the proper construction of ss      A   and  A   of the VE Act and  in particular  the meaning of the phrase   kind of death   in s  A  of the VE Act    even if the Tribunal had properly construed ss      A   and  A   of the VE Act and  in particular  the meaning of the phrase   kind of death   in s  A  of the VE Act in finding that the kind of death met by the veteran was   death by road accident   whether the Tribunal erred in failing to determine the application of pension by applying the reasoning of Goldberg J in Repatriation Commission v McKenna     AAR   at     which was endorsed by the Full Court in McKenna v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR   at      I will describe this as the   McKenna principle  referred toRepatriation Commission v Owens     ALJR   As the language of s

whole of the material before the decision maker  see also Repatriation Commission v Bey     FCR   at    A reasonable hypothesis within s   of the VE Act is a hypothesis that is pointed to by the

introduced by the Veterans  Affairs     Budget Measures  Legislation Amendment Act    Cth   The intent behind the introduction of s  A  and s  B  of the VE Act was explained in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill  an extract of which was set out by the Full Court in Woodward v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at        Sections  A  and   of the VE Act provide        For the purposes of subsection   a hypothesis connecting     the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force             a  a Statement of Principles determined under subsection  B  or   or            b  a determination of the Commission under subsection  A        that upholds the hypothesis             Subsection   does not apply in relation to a claim in respect of     the incapacity from injury or disease  or the death  of a person if the Authority has neither determined a Statement of Principles under subsection  B  nor declared that it does not propose to make such a Statement of Principles  in respect of         a  the kind of injury suffered by the person  or    b  the kind of disease contracted by the person  or    c  the kind of death met by the person    as the case may be   Secondly  as was pointed out by the Full Court in Woodward v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at   at   the observation at step   of the Deledio analysis that if no SoP is in force the application must fail  must be qualified by reference to s  A  of the VE Act which provides that s  A  does not apply in certain circumstances   Mr Green s submission that there is no SoP relevant to the veteran s alcohol habit because there is a difference between  a heavy drinker  and a person who suffered from  alcohol abuse  or  alcohol dependence  as defined in the SoP should be rejected on at least two bases  First  it is well established that a SoP covers the field  see Woodward v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at   and the Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans  Affairs     Budget Measures  Legislation Amendment Bill    Cth  which provided that the RMA will prepare SoPs based on   sound medical scientific evidence   that will exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases  injuries or death and service   Secondly  the threshold question posed by s   is whether the whole of the material before the decision maker raises a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran s death with the circumstances of his service  This branch of the respondent s argument seeks to rely on only part of the material before the Tribunal   The evidence before the Tribunal was that the diagnosis of Dr Epstein was that the veteran was a  chronic alcoholic   Dr Epstein s criteria for an alcoholic was   a person whose drinking interfered with their health  with the family life and their working capacity    Dr Epstein s evidence was that there was   certainly no doubt that  the alcohol habit  interfered with his family life    That view was consistent with the respondent s own evidence to the Tribunal that there was disharmony in the marriage because of the veteran s alcohol consumption  Having regard to diagnostic criteria A  and   for alcohol abuse in the SoP for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence  the whole of the material before the decision maker would appear to suggest that at least some of the diagnostic criteria were satisfied  That however is a question of fact for the Tribunal
