FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlConcerning Wednesbury unreasonableness  Weinberg J in Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia   FCA         FCR   at     referred to Aronson  Dyer and Groves  in Judicial Review of Administrative Decisions    th Ed  view that the courts  regard this ground as representing a safety net  designed to catch the rare and totally absurd decision which has somehow managed to survive the application of all other grounds of review   His Honour quoted comments by Aronson  Dyer and Groves  at   that      Confined to extreme cases       Wednesbury unreasonableness  amounts to the sort of low level quality control which most management systems should maintain in any event     there would be serious credibility costs to the system if demonstrably absurd decisions were allowed to go unchecked  So too  in my judgment  would there be serious credibility costs to the system if decisions  not made bona fide  but contrived to reach a preordained result  were allowed to go unchecked  It is now necessary to say with some particularity why  in my view  the judgment of the third Tribunal was not made bona fide  There are  in particular  two aspects of the evidence which were relied on by the Tribunal which lead me to conclude the Tribunal was concerned  not to find the facts truly  but to arrive at a predetermined conclusion  namely that the appellants were not homosexuals referred toAppellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI am satisfied that the finding of the third Tribunal that the two appellants are not  and were not  homosexuals was not made in the exercise of honest fact finding  but was deliberately calculated to  get around  difficulties in the factual circumstances of the appellants  case  thrown up by the judgment of the High Court in Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR     Appellant S     The appellants are Bangladeshi nationals  They came to Australia  arriving on   February    They sought protection visas on   March   claiming that they were homosexuals who had lived together as a couple since   and that they had been subjected to persecution in Bangladesh because of their homosexuality  A delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship found  on   April   that the applicant born on   July    NAOX  or the younger Bangladeshi  was a  citizen of Bangladesh  accepted  as plausible the applicant s claim that he is a homosexual  but was  unable to accept there is a real chance that he will be persecuted on that ground in Bangladesh   The delegate said      In his circumstances  if he believes that his homosexuality  and his relationship  would not be acceptable to the community in which he is living  it is only reasonable to believe that he should be discreet about such matters  It is important to have regard to the issues before the High Court in Appellant S        The  first  Tribunal accepted that the appellants were homosexual  and that homosexual men in Bangladesh are a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees   as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees   as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees    However  the Tribunal rejected most of the claims made by the appellants as to the persecution they had suffered in Bangladesh  including claims that they had experienced threats and violence over many years  It found that they had not in the past suffered serious harm by reason of their homosexuality  observing that they had  clearly conducted themselves in a discreet manner and there is no reason to suppose that they would not continue to do so if they returned home now   Further      The  Tribunal  rejected their claim to have a well founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh by reason of their homosexuality  The Tribunal rejected most of their individual claims  but accepted that it was not possible to live openly as a homosexual in Bangladesh  It found  however  that the applicants had  clearly conducted themselves in a discreet manner and there is no reason to suppose that they would not continue to do so if they returned home now   The applicants contended that the Tribunal had erred in law by imposing upon them a requirement that they live discreetly in order to avoid persecution  All the members of the High Court held that the  first  Tribunal          had not imposed a requirement that the applicants live discreetly if they returned to Bangladesh  It had made a finding of fact that they would live discreetly  That finding did not itself involve error citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang     CLR  It is plain

FCAFC  htmlThe decision of the third Tribunal manifests  an apprehension of predisposition  tendency or propensity towards a given result  NADH v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR   at     That apprehension is  in my judgment  well founded  In NADH   Allsop J  with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed  said  at       Criticisms were     made of how the tribunal reached a large body of factual findings  It was said that the approach to finding the facts  and the facts as found  demonstrated a lack of impartiality  No particular interest  affection  enmity or prejudice was identified which might have occasioned or contributed to the impugned conduct or approach  Thus formulated  the criticism of lack of impartiality is one which amounts to a complaint of an apprehension of predisposition  tendency or propensity towards a given result  cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia     CLR       ALR       HCA   at   per Hayne J  I am satisfied that the decision of the third Tribunal has been moulded to support a particular conclusion  namely  that the appellants were not homosexual  I am satisfied that this was done  not as a genuine exercise of administrative fact finding to which Courts  and in particular this Court  should  and must  defer  but in an attempt to insulate the finding from judicial examination  because it was expressed as being based on credibility referred toRe Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlMcHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA         ALR   said  at           a finding as to whether the prosecutor should be believed in his claim a finding on credibility      is  the function of the primary decision maker par excellence  If the primary decision maker has stated that he or she does not believe a particular witness  no detailed reasons need to be given as to why that particular witness was not believed  The tribunal must give the reasons for its decision  not the sub set of reasons why it accepted or rejected individual pieces of evidence citedTCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     ALD  However  I find that the decision was perverse to such an extent as to exhibit a serious failure in the decision making process  with the consequences that the decision was so unreasonable that it was beyond power  see TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     ALD   at   relied onWAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD  While the facts were quite different  Lee  Hill and Marshall JJ in WAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   said  at             To make a bare assertion that the document was not genuine  that is to say  a forgery  would have been an arbitrary and unreasoned conclusion by the RRT unsupported by a scintilla of material  If the RRT had acted in such a manner it would have raised the perception that the findings made by the RRT in that regard had been moulded to support a particular conclusion   see  Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission   HCA         CLR   at       It is a temptation  into which  in my opinion  the third Tribunal fell  to state a finding  however improbable or extraordinary  as based on an assessment of credibility  as a means of attempting to  bullet proof  the administrative decision from judicial review referred toWaterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBrennan J  as he then was  said in Waterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     at       There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact  A finding  which purports to be a finding of fact  is not rendered immune from judicial examination  if it is not made in good faith  but for an ulterior purpose  in this case  in the light of the remittal to the Tribunal by the High Court  to  get around  the factual findings that had earlier been made  in the enquiry as to whether the appellants were entitled to the issue of protection visas  Whether the decision of the third Tribunal be regarded as unreasonable in the Wednesbury corporation sense  or on the basis that the decision was not made in good faith  or on the basis that there was a lack of impartiality in the fact finding process  the decision of the third Tribunal has to be set aside
