Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd   VR   at   per Gowans J   Before proceeding  however  I pause here to note that care must be taken in using such loaded terms as  novel  in this context  The parties proceeded in this case as if it were a patent matter  presenting expert testimony regarding prior art  common general knowledge  and so forth  That is to say  they implicitly proceeded as if the Krueger design had to be patentable in order to be confidential  No doubt this approach was influenced at least in part by the ongoing patent application by Krueger in respect of the design at issue and the fact that the same experts were retained by the parties in both proceedings  Camerons  expert gave candid evidence that he was unaware of any distinction between patent  copyright  and breach of confidence litigation  and that he and Krueger s expert approached this case as if it were a patent dispute  Unfortunately  this is a fundamentally wrong approach in breach of confidence litigation  As Megarry J said in Coco  at   one should not get caught up by particular adjectives such as novel   whether it is described as originality or novelty or ingenuity or otherwise  I think there must be some product of the human brain which suffices to confer a confidential nature upon the information   To put it more plainly  information need not be patentable  copyrightable  or otherwise protected by the intellectual property laws in order to be confidential  Common examples of commercial information that may be considered confidential even if not novel in the patent law sense include customer lists  price lists  business proposals  and marketing strategies  In this regard  I would draw the parties  attention to the concise definition of confidentiality provided by IP Toolbox in its handy reference page   The concept of legal confidentiality   available at http www iptoolbox gov au default asp print true action article ID  Confidential information need not be entirely composed of information that is not available publicly  Public information can also be considered as confidential  This depends on the way a business uses the information  A customer list  for example  can be protected as having the necessary legal confidentiality where it has been developed and treated as confidential  even though it is drawn from information which is publicly known  ie  telephone records  trade journals  public registers etc   Legal confidentiality can be distinguished from the requirements for patent or design registration  The latter require that the concept be inventive and novel  or in the case of a design  an advance on the  prior art  base   Legal confidentiality can protect uninventive information as long as it is not in the public domain   Emphasis added   Notwithstanding that definition  the obligation of the Court is to decide the case that has been put  not the case that should have been put  Accordingly  I will approach the issue of confidentiality as it was argued   that for the Krueger Concept to be protected it must not have been routine or otherwise a minor variation of common general knowledge  In that respect  Krueger submitted that there were at least two bases on which its design could be seen as novel as compared to existing load restraint systems  I turn to consider those bases now   Camerons accepted that an ability for gates to overlap or stack would have set the Krueger Concept apart from pre existing load restraint systems so that the Krueger Concept would not have been routine or already publicly known  Camerons submitted  however  that the ability of the gates to overlap or stack was  in fact  not conveyed by the confidential information   The concession of Mr Cameron does not end the inquiry  however  because not everything that is confidential in business is necessarily deemed confidential in law  What is important for information to attract a legal obligation of confidence is that  the preservation of its confidentiality or secrecy is of substantial concern to the plaintiff  Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd  No     HCA         CLR   at    In Moorgate   the High Court found that information relating to a new cigarette brand was not confidential in part because it comprised merely standard marketing materials that would be shown to any prospective licensees  not just the defendant  Here  on the other hand  it is clear that Krueger created the information and communicated it to Camerons so that Krueger  and only Krueger  would win the business with Camerons  It is thus objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this case that the preservation of the information s confidentiality and secrecy  specifically  its non disclosure to competitors such as Vawdrey  was of substantial concern to Krueger  Accordingly  I conclude that the information in   attracted an obligation of confidentiality under the  reasonable man  test propounded by Megarry J in Coco at     Analysis of this third element requires what Megarry J in Coco  at   describes as both a strict and broad approach  The strict approach  which Megarry J suggested should be applied in commercial cases such as this  requires some detriment suffered by the provider of the confidential information for equity to intervene  In contrast  under the broad approach  unauthorised use does not necessarily need to be accompanied by detriment  In the years since Coco   however  the cases have cast considerable doubt on whether detriment should be considered part of the cause of action even in commercial cases  see L Tsaknis    The Jurisdictional Basis  Elements and Remedies in the Action for Breach of Confidence Uncertainty Abounds       Bond University Review        collecting the cases and stating   It is not clear whether the confider must suffer any detriment as a result of the unauthorised disclosure  though the balance of the authority suggests that the better view is that detriment is not required   I do not consider the point further  however  because Krueger did not raise it  relying instead principally on Coco   In any event  nothing much turns on detriment in the present case because detriment is not an issue if Krueger is successful in establishing the other elements  detriment was clearly suffered by Krueger in that it lost the contract with Camerons in respect of the Amcor Tender   Krueger provided its information to Camerons for the limited purpose of winning a contract with Camerons for the manufacture of approximately   truck trailers  In order to advance this purpose  it allowed Camerons to include part of that information  the Subsequent Krueger Drawings  in the tender Camerons submitted to Amcor  As noted earlier  it was not submitted that the authorised disclosure of the Subsequent Krueger Drawing to Amcor robbed that drawing of its confidential character or released Camerons from its otherwise general obligation to maintain it in confidence  Camerons had asked for permission to disclose it to Amcor  It had not asked for permission to disclose it more generally   That leaves the issue of unauthorised use of the confidential information  If it is shown that Camerons provided Krueger s information  or part of it  to Vawdrey  allowing Vawdrey to eventually win the work with Camerons  Krueger suffered detriment from that unauthorised use  As noted earlier in these reasons  see   to   I concluded that Camerons  knowing the Krueger Concept to contain information confidential to Krueger  made unauthorised use of it by disclosing it to Vawdrey without the consent of Krueger citedDesktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra   FCAFC         FCR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In assessing whether

subsists and the allegedly infringing work  Nine Network Australia Pty Limited v IceTV Pty Limited   FCAFC   at     Francis  Day   Hunter at   SW Hart at   per Gibbs CJ  Although inferences from facts can be drawn to substantiate a causal connection  see eg Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR       LED Builders at   there must still be established facts from which to infer that the allegedly infringing party had access to the copyright material   Here  the facts established by the objective evidence provide a basis for inferring that Vawdrey had indirect access to the substance of the Krueger Drawings as a result of disclosure by Camerons  see     above  Particularly relevant is my conclusion that shortly after winning the Tender  Camerons requested that Vawdrey increase the size of the gates in its design and change the number of posts from six to seven in order to conform to the design shown in the Krueger Subsequent Drawing included in the Tender proposal  Those facts put this case on all fours with LED Builders   where the court found  at   indirect copying based on the giving of oral instructions by an intermediary to bring the infringing design plans into line with the copyright holder s  I am satisfied that the same thing occurred here   The next question is to determine whether Vawdrey copied a substantial part of the Krueger Drawings  When one compares the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings  being the drawings from which the trailers were constructed  with the Subsequent Krueger Drawings  that question must be answered  yes   However  in answering that question  it is necessary to exclude from that analysis those elements that are unprotected by copyright  There was nothing in the unprotected concept that dictated the number of posts or the size of the gates  Here both the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings and the Subsequent Krueger Drawings featured seven posts with gates attached of nearly identical size and shape  Vawdrey submitted that these similarities were an inevitable result of the fixed parameters of a  ft trailer  I reject that submission  The content of the First Vawdrey Drawing  see Annexure   demonstrates the error in that submission  In that drawing  the same concept was expressed using only six sliding posts with gates that were smaller and in the shape of a hoop  In addition  Krueger s expert  Dr Hart  gave evidence that the Krueger Concept could be expressed in numerous ways  In light of this evidence  I am satisfied that there were multiple ways in which the same concept was capable of expression but the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings used substantially the same form of expression as the Subsequent Krueger Drawings appliedMaggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Where parties enter into written or verbal confidentiality agreements prior to commercial negotiations  the terms of the agreement usually govern the rights and obligations of the parties to that agreement  This is so even in relation to information that may not truly be confidential  for example because it has lost its confidentiality by reason of being in the public domain  Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Nonetheless  the High Court found that the agreement in question in Maggbury was an unreasonable restraint of trade because the information the agreement sought to protect was in the public domain and had been put there by Maggbury itself   Krueger submitted there was a contractual obligation arising out of an express agreement to keep certain information confidential between Krueger and Camerons at the Cameron   Krueger meeting  The evidence of John Krueger and Grant Krueger was that at the beginning of the meeting with Camerons  John Krueger specifically requested that all information discussed in the meeting be kept private and confidential  Mr Cameron denies that confidentiality was discussed at any point during the meeting and denies that there was any express agreement as to confidentiality  He said that if the issue had been raised  he would have been offended  Initially  Tindal denied that confidentiality was discussed but later accepted he could not recall whether confidentiality was discussed at the meeting   Both Grant and John Krueger asserted that Krueger had good reason to demand a confidentiality agreement from Camerons on the basis that Camerons rarely bought trucks from Krueger and he had the impression that Camerons was not seriously considering contracting with Krueger  but instead trying to keep Vawdrey competitive  It is true Camerons had not purchased many new Krueger trucks directly from Krueger for some years  though they did own a number of Krueger trucks they had purchased on the second hand market   In this respect  as in others  I prefer the evidence of the Krueger witnesses to that of Camerons  witnesses  That is  I find that there was an oral agreement between Krueger and Camerons that  any quotation  drawings and technical and pricing information provided by Krueger  including the Krueger Concept  would be kept confidential   The consideration for that agreement was an exchange of promises   a promise of confidentiality in consideration for a promise to proceed with the negotiations and submit a design proposal   Moreover  that agreement was a reasonable restraint of trade because  unlike in Maggbury   the Krueger Concept was not already in the public domain  Finally  for the reasons given earlier  see     Camerons breached that agreement   Camerons submitted that  even if it breached an equitable or contractual obligation of confidentiality to Krueger  it was nevertheless not liable in damages because Krueger lost the contract with Camerons for reasons unrelated to disclosure of the confidential design information  Specifically  it argued that Vawdrey won the contract for reasons of delivery time  price  difficulties with hire trailers  and reliability of supply   Having carefully reviewed those submissions  I find that the evidence does not support them  In that regard  I need not rely on the principle that I should more readily infer that the wrongdoer achieved its desired objective  eg omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem   Instead  I find as a matter of fact that  but for the disclosure of Krueger s confidential information by Camerons to Vawdrey  Krueger would have won the contract with Camerons  Further  I find that it was reasonably foreseeable to Camerons at the time it disclosed the confidential information that Vawdrey would use the information to improve its design solution and win the contract to the detriment of Krueger citedMoorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd  No     HCA         CLR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The concession of Mr Cameron does not end the inquiry  however  because not everything that is confidential in business is necessarily deemed confidential in law  What is important for information to attract a legal obligation of confidence is that  the preservation of its confidentiality or secrecy is of substantial concern to the plaintiff  Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd  No     HCA         CLR   at    In Moorgate   the High Court found that information relating to a new cigarette brand

that Krueger created the information and communicated it to Camerons so that Krueger  and only Krueger  would win the business with Camerons  It is thus objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this case that the preservation of the information s confidentiality and secrecy  specifically  its non disclosure to competitors such as Vawdrey  was of substantial concern to Krueger  Accordingly  I

what transpired at the meeting  Those notes record  in part      POSTS AS COVERAGE ON    Paul Vawdrey s evidence was that the note recorded that a load restraint proposal was discussed by Vawdrey and Cameron that he  Paul Vawdrey  proposed  He said that he proposed to use a post per pallet space and that Mr Cameron and Mr Tindal liked the idea  Significantly  the notes do not describe anything  hanging off  or  extending from  each post  nor do they otherwise suggest that at this meeting there was any discussion of such a load restraint system   Paul Vawdrey s evidence at trial was substantially different from and inconsistent with the account he had previously provided to the Patents Office of the same events on   March   in the context of a patent application by Krueger for what became known as the  Slide A Gate  system  In his statutory declaration to the Patents Office  Paul Vawdrey described the meeting in the following terms      On the morning of   December   I visited a customer of my company  being Glen Cameron Nominees Pty Ltd  hereinafter GCN  and met with Mr Glen Cameron and Mr Martyn Tindal  GCN were seeking to purchase   curtain sided semi trailers for transporting double loaded pallets  I recall a discussion in the meeting about restraining the load and I recall the suggestion   I do not recall by whom   of using existing  knee joint  sliding side posts at each pallet space to restrain the load  In other words the posts would be spaced along the sides of the trailer mid way between the ends of each pair of double loaded pallets to prevent the pallets  and hence the goods on the pallets  from moving off the sides of the trailer  I further recall some concern being expressed at the meeting  as to whether a single post at each pallet space would be sufficient to restrain the load  or whether some additional restraint should be provided on each post        Emphasis added       This account of events does not support his evidence in this case that he was the author of the proposal to use sliding side posts to restrain the load  Further  there was no reference in the statutory declaration to anything  hanging off  or  extending  from each post  Taken at its highest  the account of events given in the statutory declaration spoke only of a concern being expressed that  some additional restraint should be provided on each post   Whether there would need to be additional restraint and  if so  what it might be  was not said to have been discussed   What is not now in dispute is that during the Cameron   Vawdrey meeting Paul Vawdrey drew hand sketches of the load restraint proposals discussed during the meeting  The hand sketches are entitled  respectively    CARGO NET INNER CURTAIN TRACK   which has been crossed through  consistent with the rejection of that proposal by Mr Cameron during the meeting  see   below  and     POST PER PALLET SPACING    A copy of each of the sketches is in Annexure    The latter sketch was not crossed through  Mr Cameron recalls Paul Vawdrey drawing sketches during the meeting but does not recall what they looked like  Tindal recalls Paul Vawdrey drawing   Post Per Pallet Spacing   He also recalls that Paul Vawdrey  drew some other sketches  but does not recall what they looked like  Tindal was also in the habit of making handwritten notes about the proposals  Tindal s handwritten notes on Camerons  copy of the Second Vawdrey Quote include    Two  sliding posts per side   These contemporaneous documents thus record that during the course of the Cameron   Vawdrey meeting the idea of a  post per pallet  was discussed  The contemporaneous documents do not suggest  however  that there was any discussion of anything  hanging off  or  extending from  each post   Mr Cameron reiterated the substance of that evidence before me  What then did Tindal s affidavit say  So far as is relevant  his evidence was that it was he  Martyn Tindal  not Paul Vawdrey  who raised the issue of a load restraint system that would  restrain double stacked pallets and prevent them from falling out when the curtains on the side of the trailer were opened   Tindal recalled that Paul Vawdrey suggested using cargo nets but that was immediately dismissed because the nets would have caught on the pallets  That is consistent with Paul Vawdrey having drawn the sketch labelled  CARGO NET INNER CURTAIN TRACK  and then crossing it through  see   above    According to Tindal  it was after the rejection of the cargo net idea that Mr Cameron asked Paul Vawdrey if they could use conventional sliding posts located at each pallet space along the side of the trailer with  something hanging off or extending from each post to act as a load restraint  which was smaller and lighter than most traditional gates     but  big enough to restrain double stacked pallets and not allow them to slip through    What then is said to have occurred  at least according to Tindal  and by him adopting it  Mr Cameron  is that Mr Cameron also said  it would not be practical to have one post per pallet space because it would be laborious to remove all the posts   emphasis added   One post per pallet space would have required   posts on each side of a  ft trailer  Paul Vawdrey is also said to have indicated that he would submit a drawing and a cost estimate   Secondly  Grant Krueger met with Gerges and drew another hand sketch of the Krueger Concept  A copy of that sketch is at Annexure    In his presence  Gerges drew a further hand sketch of the Krueger Concept  A copy of that sketch is at Annexure    These events demonstrate that as early as the afternoon of   December   Grant Krueger  who had no relevant engineering experience  was aware of and understood the Krueger Concept so that he was able to sketch the Krueger Concept and explain it to Gerges  the Krueger engineer   Armed with these two explanations  Gerges was able to prepare his own sketch and then direct the preparation of appropriate engineering layouts depicting the Krueger Concept  This series of events is significant as will become obvious later in these reasons for decision   The next day    December   Gerges asked another Krueger employee  Stephen Hunt  to prepare engineering layouts depicting the Krueger Concept  On   December   Gerges approved the engineering layouts prepared by Hunt and asked Hunt to convert them into sales drawings   On   December   Hunt prepared the sales drawings  depicting respectively  a  ft dropdeck curtain sided trailer with eight sliding side gates and a  ft dropdeck curtain sided trailer with nine sliding side gates  but without Krueger s standard copyright and confidentiality notice  the Initial Krueger Drawings   The drawings did  however  contain a prominent copyright symbol with the word  Copyright  immediately beneath it  Hunt provided them to Grant Krueger  The Initial Krueger Drawings are part of Annexure    The Initial Krueger Drawings bear the date   December    Those drawings show at least eight posts along each side of the truck  Each post has attached to or  hanging off  from it a gate which  because of the gate s size and shape  acted as a load restraint for two pallets   Mr Michael Vawdrey gave evidence that his son Paul told him about the Cameron quote in the afternoon of   December    Michael Vawdrey s evidence was that Paul told him that he   Paul  had suggested to Camerons that they use a post per pallet but that Camerons were concerned that this might not be sufficient and upon hearing this  he  Michael  suggested the hoops idea  There is no independent objective evidence that the conversation took place on that date  It is more probable than not that the conversation actually took place in the afternoon of   December  given the lack of any corroborating oral or documentary evidence to suggest that Vawdrey started working on a hoop design on that date and the affirmative evidence that Vawdrey was still proposing a non hoop design as late as the afternoon of   December  see    However  even taking Vawdrey s evidence at face value  ie that it was Michael Vawdrey who first suggested using hoops and that the suggestion originated on   December  it still undermines the Camerons and Vawdrey evidence that Paul Vawdrey  Cameron or Tindal had already suggested the Krueger Concept or even that there should be anything  attached to or  hanging off  each post at the Cameron   Vawdrey meeting earlier that day   On   December   at    pm  Mr Tindal sent to Mr Cameron a spreadsheet entitled  FLEETSPEC xls   That document included a reference to Vawdrey s load restraint proposal of eleven posts comprising  Sliding Side Posts    of   in addition to the  Side Posts    Per Side Sliding    The spreadsheet did not include any details of the Second Krueger Quote because that second quote was not sent by Krueger to Camerons until it was included with the facsimile of    pm on   December     Again  contrary to the evidence of Mr Cameron and Mr Tindal that they had already discussed with Vawdrey that the side posts would have something hanging off them  the spreadsheet did not describe anything hanging off the side posts   The events of   December   are important  At about    am  after speaking with his engineering group about the feasibility of the Krueger Concept  John Krueger telephoned Tindal on his mobile phone  The call lasted for approximately five minutes  Neither Tindal nor John Krueger was cross examined about the content of this conversation  According to John Krueger  he told Tindal that Krueger was confident that the concept would work and that a quotation and sales drawing would be sent to Camerons later that day  John Krueger s evidence was that he then asked Tindal whether any other manufacturer had provided Camerons with a concept that Camerons believed would work and Tindal told him that none had done so  Tindal did  not recall what was discussed during  this  telephone conversation with John Krueger   He did not deny the contents of the conversation as deposed to by John Krueger   An  artistic work  includes a  drawing     whether  the drawing  is of artistic quality or not  s   of the Act   Each of the Krueger Sketch and the Krueger Drawings falls within the inclusive definition of a drawing  as each  is a two dimensional work in which shapes and images are depicted by lines  often without colouring    Woodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng     IPR     at   performing a visual rather than  semiotic  function  Anacon Corporation Ltd v Environmental Research
