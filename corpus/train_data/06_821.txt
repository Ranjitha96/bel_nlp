the second part of Cascade s submission   Cascade also sought to derive support from Clean Investments   which concerned a concession for goods  of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes   What was in question was coin operated washing machines  Lindgren J  with whom Lee and Cooper JJ agreed  said at        I respectfully agree with Hill J in Diethelm  at       that it is preferable to pose the statutory question as a single composite question      In some cases it may be misleading to address separately the question of identification of the  genus  to which the particular goods in question belong  and the question whether that genus meets the description  ordinarily used for household purposes   The problem can be indicated by the question  What kind of kind of goods is the Item speaking of  Answering the genus question separately as a threshold one will assume  without making explicit  an answer to this question      Goods and purposes can be equally correctly described in different ways  in particular  broadly or narrowly  yet the description selected may dictate the answer to the statutory question  For example  an architect s stool  an office chair and a kitchen stool or chair may be described as  stools  or  chairs  and their purpose as being  to provide seating   Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the architect s stool or the office chair is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes for no other reason than that  like the kitchen chair  it is ordinarily used for the purpose of providing seating      Emphasis in original   Nor do I think the passage in Clean Investments relied on by Cascade  set out at   discloses any departure from Hygienic Lily   After an elaborate examination of the earlier cases  especially Hygienic Lily  which had not been drawn to the primary judge s attention  Lindgren J distilled the propositions he derived from them  The one preceding the proposition set out at   is     The statutory question is not whether those goods of the taxpayer will in fact be used for household purposes but whether they are goods  of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes   Chubb per Hill J  with whom Tamberlin J agreed  at   Diethelm per Hill J at        Further  in the second paragraph set out at   his Honour identified the existence of two questions  He was not saying there was not two questions  but that in some cases it may be misleading to address them separately consideredAir International Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In support of the submission at   Cascade placed reliance on the observations of Tamberlin J  with whom O Loughlin J agreed  in Air International Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs   FCA         FCR   at     Speaking of the words pumps and compressors  of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles  his Honour said     It is helpful to look at actual use  if any  when deciding whether goods are of a kind used as replacement components  Where they are so used  then that points to a conclusion that they are  of a kind  so used  The words  of a kind  add a further level of generality to the expression  used  so that even if  to use the Tribunal s expression  the goods are not so used but are within a range of goods of a type which are used  then they satisfy the required description      This treats the words  of a kind  in item   as words of expansion rather than limitation  Air International is a  use  and not a  marketed as  case  However it was said there was no reason why that should make the above passage inapplicable to item     In Air International Hill J  dissenting  quoted with approval the decision of the Court of Appeal in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services  Trailer Engineers  Ltd     WLR   to which Gummow J had referred in Hygienic Lily   The question in the English case was whether couplings and winches were to be classified for value added tax purposes as  Goods of a kind suitable for use as parts of goods within item   or item    Hill J said at      Brown LJ held that the words  goods of a kind  referred to some class or category or genus of goods which had characteristics in common  That holding is generally consistent with the Australian sales tax cases referred to in Clean Investments      Hill J then quoted with approval this passage from Megaw LJ s judgment  at        It is not  the goods  the particular articles  here the couplings and the winch which have to be suitable for use as parts  It is the kind of goods to which these particular articles belong  their genus  which has to be thus suitable  The addition of  of a kind  would be meaningless if goods which are themselves suitable are necessarily also goods of a kind which is suitable  The question is  first  what is the relevant  kind of goods  of which they are members  and  secondly  is that kind of goods generically  suitable for use as parts of the goods comprised in items   and   of Group     I doubt that there is any real difference between the cases upon which the parties based their respective approaches to the construction of item    In Air International   before the passage set out at   Tamberlin J quoted at   from Hygienic Lily the passage appearing at   introducing it at     with the words     In answering the question  whether the fans etc are goods  of a kind used as replacement components  it is necessary to construe the quoted expression as a whole  The intent or purpose of the manufacturer or importer is not the criterion to be applied  Nor is it necessary that the goods should in fact have been used or be used as replacement components  It is sufficient if they are  of a kind  which can be so used  That is to say  if they come within the genus of  goods used as replacement components       In order to determine whether the goods are within that genus  it is necessary to examine the  nature quality and adaptation of the goods in the class  see Gummow J in Hygienic Lily          When Tamberlin J went on to say  in the passage relied on by Cascade  set out at   that it is helpful to look at actual use when deciding whether goods are  of a kind  used in a particular way  because when they are so used  that points to a conclusion that they are  of a kind  so used  his Honour was not  in my view  intending to depart from the approach mandated by the words of item   or that appearing in Hygienic Lily   He was simply saying that the answer to whether goods are of a kind used in a particular way may  depending on the circumstances  be assisted by looking at how they have in fact been used   It will be apparent from what I have said at   to   that I have initially approached the  of a kind  issue in accordance with Cascade s submission recorded at    The submission derives support from what two members of the Full Court said in Air International   See    On this approach Ultra C was not principally marketed  in the sense of mainly  chiefly  predominantly or preponderantly  as food for infants  giving that word the meaning appearing at     Obviously Cascade s  of a kind  formulation is more advantageous to it than the Commissioner s  because it focuses on its own marketing of Ultra C  On the Commissioner s approach  Cascade s case more clearly fails  The genus to which Ultra C belongs is in my view either cordials or blackcurrant concentrated syrups  including in either case Ribena and Bickford s  That group of products does not fall within item    findings  p   q  and  r   Accordingly  nor does Ultra C  If  contrary to my view  Cascade s fall back genus submission is sound namely that Ultra C is a genus of its own its case fails because of what I have said at     On the approach I have suggested at   Cascade s marketing of Ultra C shows that the product is not of a kind marketed principally as food for infants consideredHygienic Lily Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   The Commissioner sought to derive support for his contention from Hygienic Lily Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR    The question there was whether waxed paper cups used by McDonald s Restaurants were  goods     of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes   Gummow J at   said     the setting in which the phrase  goods of a kind  appears suggests it is directed not to the use for which the particular goods in question were designed or manufactured  nor to the purpose to which it is intended these particular goods shall be put  but rather to the nature  quality and adaptation of goods in the class or genus in question  Thus  goods are  of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes  if they are to be recognised as members of a class or genus which commonly or regularly  albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally  is used for household purposes  cf Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services  Trailer Engineers  Ltd     WLR   at                At   his Honour pointed out that other items in the Schedule there in question directed attention not to goods identified by the purposes for which goods of that kind are ordinarily used  but to the goods in question themselves or to the identity or character of a particular user  He concluded that the cups were of a kind

that the word  infants  in item   is to be given its ordinary meaning  That meaning is to be determined by considering the word in its context with the assistance of dictionaries and other books  and not by expert evidence  Telstra Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at     Cascade s submission is that in item   the ordinary meaning of infant includes any child up to seven years of age  It relies on several dictionary definitions  Australian Oxford       a  a child during the earliest period of its life  b  a schoolchild in the first years of school       The Oxford English Dictionary         a  A child during the earliest period of life  or still unborn  now most usually applied to a child in arms  a babe  but often extended to include any child under seven years of age

as it may  the passages cited all stand for the following unexceptionable proposition  Where Parliament has enacted legislation to encourage a particular activity  for example legislation which gives particular concessions to the mining industry  the legislation must be construed so as to promote Parliament s purpose and not so as to detract from that purpose      Some items contained in Schedule   to the Exemptions and Classifications Act may fall within this rule in that the government has granted exemptions from sales tax in the course of seeking to encourage a specific industry     But it can hardly be said that an item such as Item   is there to encourage any particular activity so that a construction should be given to it consonant with its purpose to promote that activity  Item   merely confers exemptions upon a particular kind of body  namely an Australian government or a statutory authority meeting certain tests  Parliament s purpose was to exempt from sales tax goods for use by these bodies  But Parliament s purpose is promoted by construing the exemption item in accordance with its ordinary meaning  not by seeking to give it a particular meaning favourable to the

of the government providing an exemption was to afford encouragement to a particular industry or activity      His Honour then referred to a passage in Diethelm at   in which French J  recognised the significance of the purpose of the relevant exempting item in applying this principle    Cascade contends that unlike the exemption in Totalizator   item   is not directed at a particular body or person  but provides an exemption from GST to particular beverages which are marketed principally as food for infants  It should therefore be implied that item   is intended to protect those products  so that the liberal construction principle should apply   The reason for the qualified exemption of food from GST is well known  and was common ground  It was the political compromise reached in order that the GST scheme might become law  The distinction drawn in Totalizator between an exemption directed at a particular person or body and one that encourages a particular activity is applicable here  It is true  as Cascade says  that item   is not directed at a particular person or body  But nor is it concerned to encourage any particular activity  It is not intended to encourage the production of beverages or ingredients of any kind  It was the result of a political deal that gave partial exemption to food  In the case of the beverage component of food  the result was that the beverage or an ingredient therefore would be exempt if it was of a kind marketed principally as food for infants or invalids  In accordance with Totalizator   there is no occasion to approach the meaning of  infant  or  invalids  in any manner other than by according the words their ordinary meaning   Cascade pointed out that item   of Sch   to the Sales Tax  Exemptions and Classifications  Act   exempted food for human consumption  Beverages were excluded from the exemption except for  amongst others     b               i  beverages of a kind marketed principally as food for infants or invalids                     c  goods of a kind marketed principally as ingredients for beverages covered by paragraph  b    Cascade also relied on the exemption in item   of  inter alia   booster seats     designed for use exclusively for carrying infants   In this connection it drew attention to Victorian Sales Tax Office Ruling No      We had some doubts whether the booster seats are designed for use in carrying infants or older children but in view of the broad dictionary meaning of infant eg children under seven years of age  this condition is considered to be satisfied
