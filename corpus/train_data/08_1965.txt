   ATPR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes   FCA       ATPR     Tamberlin J described the rationale behind the power to punish for contempt as follows     Ultimately  in the case of mandatory or prohibitory orders made by it  the sanction which the Court has in order to enforce its decisions is the power to punish for contempt  This is the way in which the Court preserves respect for its role and the rule of law  Without the enforcement of court orders the whole process of adjudication becomes a hollow exercise  If a losing party can defy the orders of the Court then such disobedience renders futile  in the perception of the community  the remedy secured by the successful party  Orders are not made simply to suggest or advise persons that they ought to keep to the law as proclaimed but to ensure that the law is carried out as determined by the decision pursuant to which the order is made  Defiance of court orders diminishes the authority of courts and removes the incentive of parties  if such conduct is left unpunished  to comply with the requirements of the courts   Having regard to these principles I turn to the determination of the appropriate penalty referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v INFO PC com Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases

Energy Union   FCA     Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dynacast  Int  Pty Ltd   ATPR       Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR   referred toTextile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   September   I found that the respondent  Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd  Morrison Clothing  and Mr Brian Morrison had committed contempt of Court by failing to comply with paragraph   of the orders I made on   September    the Order  see Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd   FCA    These reasons should be read in conjunction with those in Morrison    Mr Morrison is the sole director  company secretary and sole shareholder of Morrison Clothing  The Order required Mr Morrison  both on his own behalf and on behalf of Morrison Clothing  to give discovery of the documents requested by the applicant  in its Request for Categories of Documents to be Discovered dated   August   by serving a list of documents required to be disclosed and an affidavit verifying the list of documents on or before   October    I concluded that the brief affidavit filed by Mr Morrison did not comply with the Order and that Mr Morrison s conduct was not merely casual  accidental or unintentional but constituted wilful disobedience of the Court s order   The applicant seeks an order that Mr Morrison be fined     for his contempt  No penalty is sought against Morrison Clothing  which is now in liquidation referred toTextile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In the principal proceeding  the applicant sought the imposition of penalties against Morrison Clothing pursuant to s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the WR Act   for breaches of clauses   and   of the Clothing Trades Award     Clauses   and   regulate the terms and conditions of outworkers  The Award is intended to regulate the use of outworkers in the clothing industry to ensure that outworkers receive their minimum entitlements  The relevant provisions of the Award were specifically designed to remedy the exploitation of this vulnerable group of workers  see Clothing Trades Award   Print R  and cf the observations of Marshall J in Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd   FCA      The applicant claimed  inter alia  that Morrison Clothing had utilised outworkers but had not provided the minimum wages and conditions provided for in the Award or kept all of the requisite work records  The work records of Morrison Clothing are essential for the applicant to prove its case  The failure of Mr Morrison to provide discovery of the work records has severely limited the ability of the applicant to continue the proceedings  As the applicant submits  if Mr Morrison is permitted to ignore the Order he is able to circumvent the outworkers  regulatory regime  In those circumstances  and particularly in light of the objectives of that regime  the amount of the penalty should be sufficient to deter Mr Morrison and others from conduct designed to circumvent the legislative protections which are provided for outworkers   For the forgoing reasons  I consider that it is appropriate that Mr Morrison be fined     referred toWelfare v Birdon Sands Pty Ltd     FCR   As the principal proceeding was a matter arising under the WR Act it is necessary to consider whether the contempt proceeding was also a matter arising under that Act  in which case s   would prevent the Court from ordering Mr Morrison and or Morrison Clothing from paying the applicant s costs of the motion  It is well established that a motion for contempt is separate and distinct from the principal proceeding  see Real Tech Systems Integration Pty Ltd v Meuross     FCR   at   referring to O Shea v O Shea     PD    In National Union of Workers v Davids Distribution Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   the National Union of Workers appealed against a finding of contempt by Smart J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales  A Full Court of this Court said  at     that the contempt proceeding was not a matter arising under the WR Act   and therefore s    the predecessor of s   did not stand in the way of a costs order  See also Welfare v Birdon Sands Pty Ltd     FCR   at   and Gregory v Philip Morris Ltd     ALR   at    It is clear on the authorities that s   of the WR Act does not apply to contempt proceedings
