   BPR   at     The formulation of the content of that contract however requires some attention  People do not always conduct their business dealings in classic text book terms of offer and acceptance  In Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp  Aust  Pty Ltd     BPR   at     McHugh JA  Hope and Mahoney JJA concurring  said         in an ongoing relationship  it is not always easy to point to the precise moment when the legal criteria of a contract have been fulfilled  Agreements concerning terms and conditions which might be too uncertain or too illusory to enforce at a particular time in the relationship may by reason of the parties  subsequent conduct become sufficiently specific to give rise to legal rights and duties  In a dynamic commercial relationship new terms will be added or will supersede older terms  It is necessary therefore to look at the whole relationship and not only at what was said and done when the relationship was first formed      His Honour also remarked  ibid        it is an error to suppose that merely because something has been done then there is therefore some contract in existence which has thereby been executed     Nevertheless  a contract may be inferred from the acts and conduct of parties as well as or in the absence of their words  The question in this class of case is whether the conduct of the parties  viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances  shows a tacit understanding or agreement  The conduct of the parties  however  must be capable of proving all the essential elements of an express

citedCodelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at    http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Applying those principles  in my opinion the Work Trial Agreement in the form sent by Mr Mihelcic to Mr Sutczak on   December   including cl   set out in   above  formed part of the contract which was in force at the time Mr Fowle suffered his injury  The Commonwealth and Comcare by their subsequent conduct  and in particular by meeting all Mr Fowle s wages notwithstanding that he was doing work for the Hydro  impliedly accepted the terms in the Work Trial Agreement  Pre contractual conduct can cast light on the genesis of the contract and its objective aim  Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at       Brambles at    Here the essence of the term appeared in the original Work Trial Agreement   above  which had been prepared by the Commonwealth  Subsequently the Hydro  through Mr Sutczak  emphasised the importance of indemnity   above   The potential for workplace injury  and liability there for  was an obvious matter of concern for a substantial industrial employer like the Hydro   The  liability  in question  a potential liability which might arise at some time in the future  must be the liability of the host employer  the Hydro   Liability  means any legal liability of the Hydro  Obviously  any injury  does not mean literally any injury suffered by Mr Fowle  An injury which he suffered at home and unconnected with his work would not involve any liability of the Hydro   The expression  liability for any injury  cannot be limited  as the defendants argued  to exclude common law liability  The words are not qualified in any way  It would have been open to Comcare and or APS  as the preparer of the document  to limit it to accord with their particular circumstances  It is not to the point that entitlement of a Commonwealth employee to sue the Commonwealth for damages at common law is limited in scope and amount by s   of the SRC Act  At all relevant times the potential liability of the Hydro included liability at common law for negligence  The Hydro enjoyed no statutory protection comparable to that in s   of the Commonwealth Act citedCoghlan v S H Lock  Australia  Ltd     NSWLR   at   Counsel for the defendants submitted that the term in question  being an indemnity  should be construed strictly against the Hydro  However  this principle of construction is bound up with another rule  that documents should be construed contra proferentem  against the interest of the party which prepared or drafted the document  Coghlan v S H Lock  Australia  Ltd     NSWLR   at   Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Halford v Price   HCA         CLR   at          However  in the present case it is the Commonwealth which was the drafter or presenter of the document  One can infer that seeking to have a Commonwealth employee placed with an outside employer for the purposes of rehabilitation is a common occurrence  Since this is a benefit to Comcare and the Commonwealth  successful rehabilitation will lessen their financial burden  it is hardly surprising that the Commonwealth and or Comcare would adopt a standard form of contract in which the outside employer is indemnified against the obvious possibility of liability for workplace injury  The present case is the reverse of the stereotypical situation where the party in the stronger bargaining position imposes a standard term on the weaker party  see Andar at   per Kirby J citedAndar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for the defendants submitted that the term
