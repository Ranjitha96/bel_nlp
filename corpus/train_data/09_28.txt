Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ascot Four Pty Ltd  No     FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedTrade Practices Commission v CSR Limited   ATPR     It is necessary to note these facts because the prosecutor has urged that the factors relevant to penalty are those outlined by French J  as he then was  in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited   ATPR     at     TPC v CSR Limited    The defendant contended that those factors should be applied with some caution  because  it was argued  TPC v CSR Limited was decided before the introduction of Pt  B of the Crimes Act and involved a civil pecuniary penalty imposed for contraventions of ss   and    misuse of market power and exclusive dealing  in Pt IV of the TP Act for restrictive trade practices  rather than for contravention of a consumer protection provision of the TP Act in Pt V  or for present purposes now Pt VC  Part VC Offences was introduced into the TP Act by the Treasury Legislation Amendment  Application of Criminal Code   Act  No      Cth    The judgment in TPC v CSR Limited was given on   December   but concerned conduct engaged in from   May   and until   September   when consent injunctive orders were made  It is clear that the penalty imposed in that case was imposed in respect of contraventions of Pt IV of the TP Act  and was determined under s   of the TP Act as a civil pecuniary penalty  That does not make the observations of French J in that case irrelevant  but I accept the submission on behalf of the defendant that they should not be the starting point for determining the appropriate penalty in this matter  In any event  I do not think that the factors identified by French J in TPC v CSR Limited in any significant respect are different from those now specified in s  A  of the Crimes Act   Section  A a  of the Crimes Act directs attention to the nature and circumstances of the offence  That encompasses certain of the factors identified by French J  Section  A  of the Crimes Act directs attention to the injury  loss or damage resulting from the offence  That too is a matter to which French J referred  Sections  A f     g  and  h  of the Crimes Act direct attention to the contrition of the offender  the cooperation with the law enforcement agency  and whether there has been a plea of guilty to the charge in respect of the offence  That  in general terms  is encompassed also within the factors mentioned by French J  Sections  A k  and  m  of the Crimes Act direct attention to the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished and to the personal elements of the offence  I think those factors are also encompassed within the factors identified by French J where he refers to the size of the contravening company and its degree of power in the market  not a matter directly relevant to a contravention of s  AZC g  of the TP Act   Section  A j  of the Crimes Act directs attention to the deterrent effect of the sentence upon the offender  That too was noted by French J  In certain circumstances  the matters referred to by French J will in fact fall into subsets of the matters listed in s  A  of the Crimes Act    I propose first to consider the factors specifically mentioned in s  A  of the Crimes Act which are relevant in the circumstances  There is another relevant matter  namely  deterrence  Deterrence has two elements  namely specific deterrence of the offender and general deterrence in the community  It is also necessary to impose a penalty of sufficient magnitude to signal to the community the significance of the offending and to ensure that those who operate in a like commercial environment would be reminded of the consequences of contravention of the like provisions  The object of the TP Act is  to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection   The defendant s conduct  as it acknowledged  was both serious and inconsistent with that object  The penalty imposed must be such as to reinforce in the mind of the community the consequences of non compliance with the relevant legislative prescription as to how that object is to be achieved citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ascot Four   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   August   I found the defendant guilty of   counts of making a false or misleading representation about the price of goods  contrary to s  AZC g  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TP Act  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ascot Four   FCA    The question of the appropriate penalty to be imposed for those contraventions was then deferred  That matter has now been addressed   Each contravention related to the advertising of the price of jewellery items in the defendant s   Christmas Sale Catalogue  the catalogue   There were some     million copies of the catalogue  Generally there was a depiction of the jewellery item  a printed description of the item  a printed price in black print which had been struck through  the strike through price  and a different and highlighted price printed in red and in a larger print  the sale price   I found that by that conduct the defendant represented to consumers or potential purchasers of the   jewellery items that  during the sale period from   November   to   December   the consumer would be saving the difference between the sale price and the strike through price  or that there was a group of ordinary and reasonable members amongst prospective purchasers of those items who would understand the sale catalogue in that way in respect of the jewellery items   In fact  none of the   jewellery items had been sold at the strike through price  All but the Count   item had been offered for sale at least from   July   and the Count   item had been offered for sale only from   November    In each instance  the jewellery item had been ticketed at the strike through price  at least for the period from   July    apart from the Count   item  but the highest price at which each of those items of jewellery had been sold over that period was significantly less than the ticketed price  The explanation given by the defendant is that the defendant operates in a  discount jewellery market  and its staff are encouraged to offer competitive price discounts to customers if that is required to secure a sale  At least in respect of the   jewellery items  there had been  over the period covered by the evidence  no sales at the ticketed price  and as noted all sales had been at a substantial reduction from the ticketed price referred toLowe v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I have also had my attention drawn to some other cases involving imposition of penalty relating to comparative price advertising where the TP Act has been contravened  I accept that I should be cautious in drawing too much from such cases  Necessarily  the contravening conduct will differ in nature  quality and effect  as will the circumstances of the individual contravention from one case to another  Although consistency in penalty is clearly important and is desirable to ensure a rational and fair system of justice  see Lowe v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at     it is necessary to consider the individual circumstances of the contraventions and of the contravener  Nevertheless  in the manner described below  I have derived some assistance by looking at cases in which the TP Act has been contravened by comparative price advertising representations and the penalty applied in those cases   I referred to the nature and circumstances of the offence in the primary judgment  and briefly above  I will not repeat that  save to note that at material times  the defendant was a proprietor of a chain of retail jewellery stores operating under the name of  Zamel s   It operated   retail stores throughout South Australia  Victoria  Western Australia  Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory  The   Christmas Sale Catalogue was distributed across each of those regions   The catalogue was issued centrally  that is  through the defendant s head office  It  and the elements of it which contravened s  AZC g  of the TP Act  were not the consequence of some local or store based conduct  In fact  two of the defendant s directors were responsible for authorising the price of the jewellery items offered and advertised for sale  and for the issue of the catalogue   Although parity of penalty should be achieved  so that similar contraventions of the TP Act attract similar penalties  that of course depends upon the individual circumstances of each case  Consistency is desirable  as it flows from a rational and fair system of justice  Lowe v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason J   I was referred by senior counsel for the prosecutor and senior counsel for the defendant to a number of cases in which penalties were imposed for misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to comparative price advertising discussedSest v Copperart Pty Ltd   ATPR     Sest v Copperart Pty Ltd   ATPR     concerned nine offences by three related defendants contrary to s  e  of the TP Act  There was  in three sales campaigns  comparative price advertising in a television advertisement one advertisement during each sales campaign where the  was  price was either an artificially inflated recommended retail price or a fictitious regular price  so the claimed savings were significantly overstated  The sentencing judge found the defendants were aware of the falsity of each of the representations  The defendants pleaded guilty  Section   of the TP Act did not apply  so separate penalties were imposed  On the three counts against the principal offender  it was fined     and    a total of   and ordered to pay the costs of the prosecutor  The maximum fine for each offence at the time was    The principal points of difference from the present circumstances are clear from the recital of those matters  although there were of course other factual differences of degree  The sentencing judge also was satisfied that  in applying the totality principle  the overall penalty imposed was not so high as to be oppressive discussedTrade Practices Commission v Cue Design Ltd     A Crim R       Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Ltd     A Crim R   concerned   offences contrary to s  e  of the TP Act to which the defendants had pleaded guilty  A large retail chain had offered certain garments for sale by dual priced swing tags  with the higher price crossed out  the higher price had not been one at which the garment had been offered for sale  There was no widespread advertising campaign  the contravening conduct occurred only by the in store price tags  The contraventions attracted one penalty only  by reason of s   of the TP Act and s  K  of the Crimes Act   The sentencing judge regarded the sales strategy as widespread  and the contraventions as serious  The maximum penalty was    A penalty of   was imposed against each of the defendants  making a total of    As the two defendants were related  the Court treated the contraventions as being by one offender  and imposed on each defendant a penalty equal to half of the whole intended penalty  Again  these are obviously points of difference from the present circumstances  some of which are evident from the above brief description discussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Pty Ltd   FCA   also concerned a prosecution under s  e  of the TP Act  The defendant pleaded guilty to nine charges  and cooperated fully in the inquiry into the contraventions  The defendant was a retailer of musical instruments and associated products  The contravening conduct occurred through a Christmas sale catalogue  of which there were   copies distributed in areas relevant to the defendant s six stores in Melbourne   Sydney  Brisbane  Adelaide and Ballarat  The catalogue offered the items the subject of the nine charges for sale at a  was now  price  but had not sold any of the six items at the  was  price  The defendant  since the offending conduct  had implemented a detailed trade practices compliance program  The sentencing judge imposed one penalty of   pursuant to s   of the TP Act  At the time the maximum penalty was    As appears  there are significant similarities at a general level between the circumstances of that case  and the present circumstances  By contrast with the position of the present defendant is the level of cooperation with the ACCC and the guilty plea  whereas here the cooperation was somewhat later in coming and there was no guilty plea although the defendant cooperated in the presentation of evidence and confined its defence to  in effect  legal contentions based on the uncontested facts  That defendant also acted perhaps in a little more structured a way to ensure ongoing compliance with the TP Act  but I do not consider that difference is of much moment  as the present defendant agreed to abandon the  then potentially  impugned conduct and has since ceased to trade as a jeweller  having sold its business  There are obvious factual differences  the relative number of stores  the relative number of catalogues  the relative number of sales of the items the subject of the offending conduct  the relative cost of the advertised items  as overall  and not surprisingly  the cost of the jewellery items was much less than of musical instruments  and  as the prosecutor pointed out  the relative difference between the strike through price and the sale price and so the suggested saving as a percentage of the strike through price discussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd   FCA   concerned six counts of contraventions of s  AZC g  of the TP Act by six separate newspaper advertisements in a daily newspaper circulating in Melbourne  Sydney   Perth   and Adelaide  Those advertisements offered in all   items of diamond jewellery at a  usual mark   price  and a  crazy price   The defendant did not retail its products from established stores in those cities  During the trial  that defendant pleaded guilty to those charges  acknowledging that none of those items had previously been offered for sale at the  usual mark   price   A multiplier was used to the wholesale or acquisition price to arrive at the  usual mark   price  and the sentencing judge accepted as a mitigating factor that comparable items were in fact retailed at two locations at comparable prices to the  usual mark   price   A penalty of   was imposed  under s  K  of the Crimes Act   having regard to what his Honour described as a  uniqueness about this case   The maximum penalty for a contravention was the same as that presently applicable referred toWong v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Wong v The Queen   HCA         CLR     Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at     re affirmed the need for a sentencing judge to balance many different and conflicting elements to reach an appropriate sentence  The balancing exercise must take account of all of the circumstances of the offence and of the offender  I have undertaken that process   In the result  in my view  the appropriate penalty to be imposed on the defendant on the counts  in respect of which as I indicated earlier I would impose a conviction  is the total sum of    I also order the defendant to pay the costs of the prosecutor   There will be recorded a conviction against the defendant on each count  On the   counts collectively the defendant is ordered to pay a penalty of    The defendant is to pay that penalty within two calendar months of the date of these orders  Leave is given to the defendant within   days to apply to vary that period  The defendant is also ordered to pay the prosecutor s costs of the
