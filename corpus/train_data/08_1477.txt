 D Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustin v Deputy Secretary  Attorney General s Department     FCR   I would add that even if I had come to the contrary view on the denial of procedural fairness ground  with the consequence that the Tribunal s decision was infected with error of law  I would nevertheless have dismissed the appeal because I consider that the Tribunal s decision in respect of  D s application was clearly correct on the material before it  see Austin v Deputy Secretary  Attorney General

provide no foundation to sustain this appeal  For a start  they do not raise pure questions of law and that is what is required to found an appeal to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal pursuant to s   of the AAT Act  Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   FCAFC         ALD   at   per Branson and Stone JJ  At best  they are mixed questions of fact and law  at worst  pure questions of fact   Second  even if these grounds of appeal did raise pure questions of law  they are ill conceived  There are no errors of the kind alleged  During the course of argument  Senior Counsel for  D conceded  contrary to  D s written submissions at   that the identity of the payee of an outgoing could be relevant  if not determinative  to whether the outgoing was an allowable deduction to the payer  For example  in the facts of the present case  without knowing the identity of the payee  one would have no way of testing whether the outgoings were being made to the owner of the equipment  that would be relevant to a determination of the proper characterisation of the outgoings  in other words  what they were paid for   Third  having regard to the way in which  D advanced its case in the Tribunal  namely  that the outgoings were paid to Mr Borg for the hire purchase of equipment from MSH  and in the complete absence of any evidence that such equipment was hired purchased from any other person  the Tribunal s findings that neither MSH nor Mr Borg existed is determinative of the s     issue  As the Tribunal concluded   D failed to discharge the onus it carried   The Tribunal was said to have erred in law in taking into account a number of allegations assertions made by the Commissioner in his submissions  which are Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons  as to the integrity of the Price Spreadsheets and related documentation where those assertions allegations were not put to Mrs Lynette Montgomery  Mrs Montgomery  or any other witness in cross examination by the Commissioner  This  it is said  involved the Tribunal in failing to accord procedural fairness to Mrs Montgomery and the other witnesses for  D consideredBrowne v Dunn     R    HL  The submissions made on behalf of  D in this regard were to the following effect    To the extent that assertions were made by the Commissioner against  D  those accusations had to be squarely put to the relevant witnesses     As certain accusations were not put to the witnesses for  D  the Tribunal fell into serious error by taking those assertions into account in making its determination  Not only did the Tribunal take those assertions into account but made findings of fact  and findings on credit  based upon matters never put to witnesses  in particular Mrs Montgomery      In this regard the Tribunal must apply notions of procedural fairness  Kioa v West   HCA         CLR     Jagelman v FCT   ATC     Fletcher   Ors v FCT     FCR     Commissioner of Taxation v Metaskills Pty Ltd

statutory recognition of these principles  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR        The integrity of the Price Spreadsheets was of fundamental importance to the case sought to be put by  D  The Price Spreadsheets were recognised by the Commissioner as  the central plank in the Applicants  case      In the course of the hearing  counsel for the Commissioner put to Mrs Montgomery in respect of the Price Spreadsheets that     the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with      Counsel for  D strenuously objected to such a question on the following basis   Mr McGovern  I object to that  because it is quite important  That proposition may be an ultimate submission  but in fairness to the witness and she is here now my friend should take her directly to each of the figures which he asserts to have been massaged  each of which has been fiddled with  so that we all know  rather than put it globally  Its unfair to the witness to do it otherwise    Later   Mr Fagan  I don t purport to be able to put a positive to this witness about which number has been adjusted in which respect  I submit that it s quite appropriate to put  in this sort of circumstance  to this witness that the whole thing has been an adjustment and fiddling of numbers to reach a number to correspond with a cheque that as  sic  cashed  The Deputy President  I can see no reason why it can t be put  She can deny it if she likes    Later   Mr McGovern      But at this point  and this is not just forensic flourish  this is really a question for the decision maker at the end of the day to have to make a grave determination about this lady s credibility and whether you accept her or not  and  in those circumstances  to just put a rolled up general proposition which is  now we know  unsupportable by as he frankly confesses he can t ascribe any particularity to any massaged figures or numbers  at least what should be done         Mr Fagan      I am entitled to put this general proposition that they have been fabricated  by its very nature I wouldn t know how     As counsel for  D feared  and as ultimately eventuated both in the Commissioner s written and oral submissions  counsel for the Commissioner proceeded to make submissions with some particularity as to discrepancies within the Price Spreadsheets  The alleged discrepancies  being the basis for the Commissioner s submissions  were not put to the witness  particularly Mrs Montgomery  Accordingly she was denied an opportunity to be heard on the matter in response     In this regard  the Commissioner s submissions  both written and oral  asserted with some particularity the manner in which the Price Spreadsheets were allegedly manipulated  and these submissions were both taken into account  and adopted by the Tribunal  without demur  in finding against  D     For the Tribunal to accept submissions on such matters not put to the witness was an error in law  being a clear failure to provide procedural fairness to  D on a crucial part of  D s case     In such circumstances it is difficult to resist the conclusion that an acceptance of the Commissioner s submissions by the Tribunal amounted to gross unfairness     Mrs Montgomery in particular was confronted in the witness box with an imprecise  generalised and unspecified assertion about  fudging and fiddling  the contemporaneous records  but the final submissions  which she was not offered opportunity to address in evidence  then contained detailed allegations never put to her  This was a clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn     R    HL  and that rule has been treated as an aspect of procedural fairness  and if breached will give rise to a vitiation of the decision of the Tribunal  see Hoskins v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR   at     The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect    There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal for the following reasons       a  It was squarely put to Mrs Montgomery who had reconstructed the Price Spreadsheets that she had  fabricated  or  massaged  or  fiddled  the figures in the Price Spreadsheets    b  The Tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case  In those circumstances  the rule in Browne v Dunn has no application    c  The Tribunal was entitled to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions where it was obvious that information had been omitted or falsely inserted  in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn    d  In relation to one subject matter   D was invited by the Tribunal during closing submissions to re open its case and call further evidence  It was clearly open to  D to seek leave to recall Mrs Montgomery in order to overcome any perceived deficiency in the opportunity she had been afforded  when first cross examined  to explain discrepancies in the relevant documents   D did not seek such leave      The substance of the fabrication was put to Mrs Montgomery      D has submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because it is alleged the specific detail of the Commissioner s analysis of the Price Spreadsheets  which forms Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons for decision  was not put to Mrs Montgomery  The Tribunal referred to this submission but found it to be without substance     From the commencement of the audit and in the hearing before the Tribunal  the Commissioner had directly challenged the story put forward as to the existence of MSH and Mr Borg  It was manifest that any documentation put forward by the taxpayer in support of that story was also under challenge     The Commissioner s challenge to the Price Spreadsheets was also fully appreciated by  D  So much is clear from paras   and   of the Submissions of the Applicant dated   June   which were provided to the Tribunal before the Commissioner made the submissions of which  D presently complains     It is significant that notwithstanding the opportunity to do so in submissions in reply   D made no submissions about the fabrications in the Price Spreadsheets  but merely confined its complaint to what was said to be a denial of procedural fairness  Indeed   D could not possibly have had an answer to the fabrications  which were apparent on the face of the Price Spreadsheets when they were compared with the Job Balance record      In any event  an evaluation of the Price Spreadsheets was not necessary to the Tribunal s decision  Once it found that Mr Borg did not exist  the  elaborate arrangements alleged as to how he     was paid may be of limited relevance   For that reason  the Tribunal took the view that the submissions made by the Commissioner concerning the Price Spreadsheets were of  peripheral relevance       It is clear that an immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal  Even though it was perhaps not necessary to do so once it found that Mr Borg did not exist  the Tribunal for the sake of completeness annexed the Commissioner s analysis of the Price Spreadsheets to its reasons  and held that it correctly summarised the evidence given in this regard     The evidence showed that Mrs Montgomery  having prepared the Price Spreadsheets  was the person who was most familiar with those documents and may be taken to have intimately known the content of them  She must also be taken to have been aware that the figures in those documents had been manipulated in order to reach the totals on the cheques  as the Commissioner has demonstrated in Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons      It was also an incontrovertible fact that Mrs Montgomery had also managed to create a Price Spreadsheet in respect of items which proved not to be for hire at all but for sale  demonstrating the fact of its fabrication  Mrs Montgomery was cross examined about this and it was directly put to her in the following terms   Really  Ms Montgomery  what this shows is that your documents at tab   are a fabrication  aren t they    No  they re not  They came out of the computer program  You have told us that the starting point of one of them  the first one behind tab   for the week ending   December  is a real document from the time  haven t you    That s right  It s nothing of the kind  is it    Yes  it is  It s something that you have put together to try to substantiate numbers    No  I took it out of off the job balance generals  And then you have told us that you have extrapolated back  and  lo and behold  you have been able to extrapolate for the week ending   December by adding and subtracting advices and receipts to page   a number of   which you purport would explain another entry in the bank statements and on Mr Borg s statements of account    These were all these all came out of the computer program  These  being tab     These were all worked out of the computer program  They have been massaged the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with       No     and put together by you       Clearly Mrs Montgomery  as the author of the recreated Price Spreadsheets  was only too aware of what the cross examiner was putting to her when he suggested that she had massaged and fiddled the numbers  If there was an answer to be made by her   D was on notice of the need to elicit that explanation in re examination or by seeking leave to adduce further evidence in chief      Application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn     Section  b  of the AAT Act stipulates that a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality as the legislation and a proper consideration of the matters permits  Consistent with that legislative approach  s  c  provides that the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence       D  before the Tribunal  had suggested that there was a  clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn    In Re Ruddock  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  and Another  Ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR     the High Court held that the rule in Browne v Dunn had no application to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal  Section   of the Migration Act    Cth   an equivalent provision to s   of the AAT Act  was relevant to that conclusion  The High Court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the Tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law      In any event  even assuming the rule was to apply  there was no breach of that rule  Where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged  failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule     In Jagelman v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC     it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant  Justice Hill observed at    However  it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case  Where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made  there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and  in consequence  there will have been no denial of procedural fairness  see Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission  unreported  Court of Appeal  NSW    June   discussed by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT     NSWLR   at      In the latter case  Hunt J said  at        In many cases  of course  counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness  and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief         It was open to the Tribunal to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions     Section   of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decision maker and stands in the shoes of the Commissioner  The Tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decision maker      The Price Spreadsheets and the Job Balance General were  D s documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them   D s written submissions in chief to the Tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents  independent of any testimony about them from which  D asserted that their authenticity was self evident  The Commissioner was entitled to  and did  respond on the same basis  It was open to the Tribunal to draw the conclusions which the Commissioner invited  simply by looking at the documents  In particular  that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn      Opportunity to Re open     Section   of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case  This section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice  Section  c  has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing  That requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved  It has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course  so stringent a test does not apply in AAT hearings      In Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR     a party was afforded an opportunity by the Tribunal to call further evidence  Justice Deane said as follows   In the context of the express invitation to the appellant  at the conclusion of the evidence  to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned  the failure of the Tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not  in my view  constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice     After the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of  D s submissions below  the Tribunal indicated that it would afford  D an opportunity to reopen its case if Mr Borg could be found  The Tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times  that  D should  go and find Mr Borg  for the reason that he was  either crucial or important in this equation        D acknowledged that it was open to it to re open its case  It was open to  D to have recalled Mrs Montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the Price Spreadsheets  the authenticity of which the Commissioner had challenged  first in cross examination of Mrs Montgomery and subsequently in written submissions  It did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the Commissioner  other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated      The Tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to  D to call further evidence and by providing a further opportunity to be heard  Thereafter  any potential lack of procedural fairness arising from the level of detail of the original cross examination  the Commissioner does not accept that there was any  was averted   D did not avail itself of the opportunity   Despite the provisions of subs   of the AAT Act  I am not persuaded that everything that was said by Gummow and Heydon JJ  with whom Gleeson CJ agreed  in Applicant S  concerning the non applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn to proceedings in the Refugee Review Tribunal can be transported  so to speak  to proceedings in the Tribunal  At   and   their Honours said    On occasion the submissions advanced for the prosecutrix were couched in the language of a contention that the rule in Browne v Dunn had not been complied with  Where a complaint is made about the failure of a questioner to put to a person giving oral answers a particular question  it is natural for a lawyer s mind to turn to the rule in Browne v Dunn  In essence  and subject to numerous qualifications and exceptions  that rule requires the cross examiner of a witness in adversarial litigation to put to that witness the nature of the case on which the cross examiner s client proposes to rely in contradiction of that witness    However  the rule has no application to proceedings in the tribunal  Section   of the Act states      The Tribunal  in reviewing a decision       a  is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence  and    b  must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case      The purpose of a provision such as s   is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate  Further  as was emphasised in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at   administrative decision making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures  There  the court has to decide where  on the balance of probabilities  the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial   However  at   their Honours said    Accordingly  the rule in Browne v Dunn has no application to proceedings in the tribunal  Those proceedings are not adversarial  but inquisitorial  the tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of the case being advanced by the applicant  The tribunal member conducting the inquiry is not an adversarial cross examiner  but an inquisitor obliged to be fair  The tribunal member has no  client  and has no  case  to put against the applicant  Cross examiners must not only comply with Browne v Dunn by putting their client s cases to the witnesses  if they want to be as sure as possible of success  they have to damage the testimony of the witnesses by means which are sometimes confrontational and aggressive  namely means of a kind which an inquisitorial tribunal member could not employ without running a risk of bias being inferred  Here  on the other hand  it was for the prosecutrix to advance whatever evidence or argument she wished to advance  and for the tribunal to decide whether her claim had been made out  it was not part of the function of the tribunal to seek to damage the credibility of the prosecutrix s story in the manner a cross examiner might seek to damage the credibility of a witness being cross examined in adversarial litigation   The proceedings in the Tribunal are adversarial  there is a contradictor of the case being advanced by the taxpayer applicant in the form of the Commissioner  The Commissioner does have a  case  to put against the applicant  even if it is only that the taxpayer applicant has not discharged the onus it carries   I incline to the view of Hill J in Jagelman at   that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend on the circumstances of the case  see the relevant part of his Honour s judgment extracted in   above  Where the Tribunal makes a finding contrary to the evidence of a witness in circumstances where the matter found was not put to the witness  this will generally involve a denial of procedural fairness and would be a denial of natural justice on the part of the Tribunal to do so  But this all depends on the circumstances of the particular case  In the present case  it was put to Mrs Montgomery that she had  fabricated  or  fiddled  the figures in the Price Spreadsheets she had reconstructed  The real complaint of  D is the general or holistic way this was put to Mrs Montgomery  rather than it being put with the particularity of the discrepancies manifest in the Commissioner s submissions which are Annexure A referred toBTR Plc v Westinghouse Brake and Signal Co  Australia  Ltd     ALD   The Commissioner submitted that  while it is true that if the Tribunal finds facts for which there is no evidence  its decision will be subject to error  in the present circumstances  the error could not have affected the outcome  That is  where the Tribunal has made an error of law  but the error is immaterial  its decision will not be set aside for that reason  Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at     Reliance was placed on what was said by Lockhart and Hill JJ in BTR Plc v Westinghouse Brake and Signal Co  Australia  Ltd     ALD   at   that   I t will not be enough for an applicant to demonstrate that the Tribunal mis stated the law in the course of its reasons  if that mis statement could not have affected its decision  The task of the court on an appeal under s   is essentially to undertake judicial review of the tribunal s decision  An immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the tribunal     citedCommission v Hayes   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The submissions made

been treated as an aspect of procedural fairness  and if breached will give rise to a vitiation of the decision of the Tribunal  see Hoskins v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR   at     The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect    There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal for the following reasons       a  It was squarely put to Mrs Montgomery who had reconstructed the Price Spreadsheets that she had  fabricated  or  massaged  or  fiddled  the figures in the Price Spreadsheets    b  The Tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case  In those circumstances  the rule in Browne v Dunn has no application    c  The Tribunal was entitled to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions where it was obvious that information had been omitted or falsely inserted  in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn    d  In relation to one subject matter   D was invited by the Tribunal during closing submissions to re open its case and call further evidence  It was clearly open to  D to seek leave to recall Mrs Montgomery in order to overcome any perceived deficiency in the opportunity she had been afforded  when first cross examined  to explain discrepancies in the relevant documents   D did not seek such leave      The substance of the fabrication was put to Mrs Montgomery      D has submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because it is alleged the specific detail of the Commissioner s analysis of the Price Spreadsheets  which forms Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons for decision  was not put to Mrs Montgomery  The Tribunal referred to this submission but found it to be without substance     From the commencement of the audit and in the hearing before the Tribunal  the Commissioner had directly challenged the story put forward as to the existence of MSH and Mr Borg  It was manifest that any documentation put forward by the taxpayer in support of that story was also under challenge     The Commissioner s challenge to the Price Spreadsheets was also fully appreciated by  D  So much is clear from paras   and   of the Submissions of the Applicant dated   June   which were provided to the Tribunal before the Commissioner made the submissions of which  D presently complains     It is significant that notwithstanding the opportunity to do so in submissions in reply   D made no submissions about the fabrications in the Price Spreadsheets  but merely confined its complaint to what was said to be a denial of procedural fairness  Indeed   D could not possibly have had an answer to the fabrications  which were apparent on the face of the Price Spreadsheets when they were compared with the Job Balance record      In any event  an evaluation of the Price Spreadsheets was not necessary to the Tribunal s decision  Once it found that Mr Borg did not exist  the  elaborate arrangements alleged as to how he     was paid may be of limited relevance   For that reason  the Tribunal took the view that the submissions made by the Commissioner concerning the Price Spreadsheets were of  peripheral relevance       It is clear that an immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal  Even though it was perhaps not necessary to do so once it found that Mr Borg did not exist  the Tribunal for the sake of completeness annexed the Commissioner s analysis of the Price Spreadsheets to its reasons  and held that it correctly summarised the evidence given in this regard     The evidence showed that Mrs Montgomery  having prepared the Price Spreadsheets  was the person who was most familiar with those documents and may be taken to have intimately known the content of them  She must also be taken to have been aware that the figures in those documents had been manipulated in order to reach the totals on the cheques  as the Commissioner has demonstrated in Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons      It was also an incontrovertible fact that Mrs Montgomery had also managed to create a Price Spreadsheet in respect of items which proved not to be for hire at all but for sale  demonstrating the fact of its fabrication  Mrs Montgomery was cross examined about this and it was directly put to her in the following terms   Really  Ms Montgomery  what this shows is that your documents at tab   are a fabrication  aren t they    No  they re not  They came out of the computer program  You have told us that the starting point of one of them  the first one behind tab   for the week ending   December  is a real document from the time  haven t you    That s right  It s nothing of the kind  is it    Yes  it is  It s something that you have put together to try to substantiate numbers    No  I took it out of off the job balance generals  And then you have told us that you have extrapolated back  and  lo and behold  you have been able to extrapolate for the week ending   December by adding and subtracting advices and receipts to page   a number of   which you purport would explain another entry in the bank statements and on Mr Borg s statements of account    These were all these all came out of the computer program  These  being tab     These were all worked out of the computer program  They have been massaged the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with       No     and put together by you       Clearly Mrs Montgomery  as the author of the recreated Price Spreadsheets  was only too aware of what the cross examiner was putting to her when he suggested that she had massaged and fiddled the numbers  If there was an answer to be made by her   D was on notice of the need to elicit that explanation in re examination or by seeking leave to adduce further evidence in chief      Application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn     Section  b  of the AAT Act stipulates that a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality as the legislation and a proper consideration of the matters permits  Consistent with that legislative approach  s  c  provides that the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence       D  before the Tribunal  had suggested that there was a  clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn    In Re Ruddock  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  and Another  Ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR     the High Court held that the rule in Browne v Dunn had no application to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal  Section   of the Migration Act    Cth   an equivalent provision to s   of the AAT Act  was relevant to that conclusion  The High Court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the Tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law      In any event  even assuming the rule was to apply  there was no breach of that rule  Where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged  failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule     In Jagelman v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC     it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant  Justice Hill observed at    However  it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case  Where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made  there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and  in consequence  there will have been no denial of procedural fairness  see Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission  unreported  Court of Appeal  NSW    June   discussed by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT     NSWLR   at      In the latter case  Hunt J said  at        In many cases  of course  counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness  and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief         It was open to the Tribunal to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions     Section   of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decision maker and stands in the shoes of the Commissioner  The Tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decision maker      The Price Spreadsheets and the Job Balance General were  D s documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them   D s written submissions in chief to the Tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents  independent of any testimony about them from which  D asserted that their authenticity was self evident  The Commissioner was entitled to  and did  respond on the same basis  It was open to the Tribunal to draw the conclusions which the Commissioner invited  simply by looking at the documents  In particular  that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn      Opportunity to Re open     Section   of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case  This section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice  Section  c  has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing  That requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved  It has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course  so stringent a test does not apply in AAT hearings      In Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR     a party was afforded an opportunity by the Tribunal to call further evidence  Justice Deane said as follows   In the context of the express invitation to the appellant  at the conclusion of the evidence  to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned  the failure of the Tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not  in my view  constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice     After the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of  D s submissions below  the Tribunal indicated that it would afford  D an opportunity to reopen its case if Mr Borg could be found  The Tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times  that  D should  go and find Mr Borg  for the reason that he was  either crucial or important in this equation        D acknowledged that it was open to it to re open its case  It was open to  D to have recalled Mrs Montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the Price Spreadsheets  the authenticity of which the Commissioner had challenged  first in cross examination of Mrs Montgomery and subsequently in written submissions  It did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the Commissioner  other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated      The Tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to  D to call further evidence and by providing a further opportunity to be heard  Thereafter  any potential lack of procedural fairness arising from the level of detail of the original cross examination  the Commissioner does not accept that there was any  was averted   D did not avail itself of the opportunity   I incline to the view of Hill J in Jagelman at   that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend on the circumstances of the case  see the relevant part of his Honour s judgment extracted in   above  Where the Tribunal makes a finding contrary to the evidence of a witness in circumstances where the matter found was not put to the witness  this will generally involve a denial of procedural fairness and would be a denial of natural justice on the part of the Tribunal to do so  But this all depends on the circumstances of the particular case  In the present case  it was put to Mrs Montgomery that she had  fabricated  or  fiddled  the figures in the Price Spreadsheets she had reconstructed  The real complaint of  D is the general or holistic way this was put to Mrs Montgomery  rather than it being put with the particularity of the discrepancies manifest in the Commissioner s submissions which are Annexure A referred toJones v Dunkel     CLR   The Tribunal found  at   that Div  A of the ITAA   should apply  In arriving at that conclusion  the Tribunal found as follows    Mr Docherty was Mr Borg and the payments were made to him     Mr Docherty had made admissions to Ms Hird  the Commissioner s auditor  that it was he who had cashed the cheques       Mr Docherty was the last person holding the cash     Mr Docherty and another brother  Charlie Docherty  were the shareholders during the relevant years     Mr Docherty treated  D as his own entity   D did exactly as he directed and Mr Docherty did not need or seek the consent of Charlie Docherty   D was controlled by Mr Docherty who took its money for his own use and plainly considered that he could do what he pleased in relation to  D       On the evidence it cannot be accepted that Mr Docherty stole the money from  D or that there was any relevant misfeasance     There was no evidence that Charlie Docherty played a part in running  D     In any event  a Jones v Dunkel     CLR   inference should be drawn as to the failure to call the other shareholder  Charlie Docherty  that is  if he was a shareholder and if he did play a part in running  D  although there was no evidence of this  he should have been called to give evidence   citedKioa v West   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The submissions made on behalf of  D in this

accusations were not put to the witnesses for  D  the Tribunal fell into serious error by taking those assertions into account in making its determination  Not only did the Tribunal take those

this Court in MacFarlane v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   in relation to a similar argument with respect to s   of the ITAA   the predecessor to Div  A   The assessments were challenged by the appellant on a number of grounds  In the first place  the appellant contended that the amounts paid to him were not  payments     made by the company     for the individual benefit of  one  of its shareholders  within the meaning of s    It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the situation should be characterised as an appropriation  perhaps a misappropriation  of the company s property on his part rather than a payment made by the company for his individual benefit  as s   requires  A similar question arose in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Blakely   HCA         CLR    There  in a  de facto  liquidation  the assets of a company were appropriated by its shareholders  Latham CJ  in dissenting on the point  held that such an appropriation was not a distribution by the company and thus  not a  dividend  as then defined in s   of the Act  But Fullagar J  Dixon J agreeing  held that there was a distribution by the company  see also the discussion in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Slater Holdings Ltd   HCA         ALJR   per Gibbs CJ at    In my opinion  the reasoning of Fullagar J is applicable here  The income in question was the property of the company  That income was applied for the benefit of one of the company s shareholders with the acquiescence of the controllers of the company  The application of funds in this way may well have constituted a breach of the director s fiduciary duties at least so far as the company s creditors were concerned  see Walker v Wimborne   HCA         CLR   per Mason J at    But whether the conduct of the company s directors was liable to be challenged as a misfeasance is a different question  Payments were made by the company out of its funds which were for the individual benefit of one of its shareholders  That is sufficient to satisfy the opening words of s   whatever significance the conduct of those involved may have in other legal contexts   I agree with the Commissioner s submission that there was ample evidence to support the conclusion of the Tribunal that Mr Docherty controlled  D and that  when he caused payments out to himself  they were payments by  D and not a misappropriation of its moneys  The Tribunal s incorrect finding that Mr Docherty was the sole director was not necessary or relevant to the decision of the Tribunal that there had been payments made by  D and Div  A should apply   It follows  in my view  that this appeal should also be dismissed   I certify that the preceding thirty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect    There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal for the following reasons       a  It was squarely put to Mrs Montgomery who had reconstructed the Price Spreadsheets that she had  fabricated  or  massaged  or  fiddled  the figures in the Price Spreadsheets    b  The Tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case  In those circumstances  the rule in Browne v Dunn has no application    c  The Tribunal was entitled to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions where it was obvious that information had been omitted or falsely inserted  in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn    d  In relation to one subject matter   D was invited by the Tribunal during closing submissions to re open its case and call further evidence  It was clearly open to  D to seek leave to recall Mrs Montgomery in order to overcome any perceived deficiency in the opportunity she had been afforded  when first cross examined  to explain discrepancies in the relevant documents   D did not seek such leave      The substance of the fabrication was put to Mrs Montgomery      D has submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because it is alleged the specific detail of the Commissioner s analysis of the Price Spreadsheets  which forms Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons for decision  was not put to Mrs Montgomery  The Tribunal referred to this submission but found it to be without substance     From the commencement of the audit and in the hearing before the Tribunal  the Commissioner had directly challenged the story put forward as to the existence of MSH and Mr Borg  It was manifest that any documentation put forward by the taxpayer in support of that story was also under challenge     The Commissioner s challenge to the Price Spreadsheets was also fully appreciated by  D  So much is clear from paras   and   of the Submissions of the Applicant dated   June   which were provided to the Tribunal before the Commissioner made the submissions of which  D presently complains     It is significant that notwithstanding the opportunity to do so in submissions in reply   D made no submissions about the fabrications in the Price Spreadsheets  but merely confined its complaint to what was said to be a denial of procedural fairness  Indeed   D could not possibly have had an answer to the fabrications  which were apparent on the face of the Price Spreadsheets when they were compared with the Job Balance record      In any event  an evaluation of the Price Spreadsheets was not necessary to the Tribunal s decision  Once it found that Mr Borg did not exist  the  elaborate arrangements alleged as to how he     was paid may be of limited relevance   For that reason  the Tribunal took the view that the submissions made by the Commissioner concerning the Price Spreadsheets were of  peripheral relevance       It is clear that an immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal  Even though it was perhaps not necessary to do so once it found that Mr Borg did not exist  the Tribunal for the sake of completeness annexed the Commissioner s analysis of the Price Spreadsheets to its reasons  and held that it correctly summarised the evidence given in this regard     The evidence showed that Mrs Montgomery  having prepared the Price Spreadsheets  was the person who was most familiar with those documents and may be taken to have intimately known the content of them  She must also be taken to have been aware that the figures in those documents had been manipulated in order to reach the totals on the cheques  as the Commissioner has demonstrated in Annexure A to the Tribunal s reasons      It was also an incontrovertible fact that Mrs Montgomery had also managed to create a Price Spreadsheet in respect of items which proved not to be for hire at all but for sale  demonstrating the fact of its fabrication  Mrs Montgomery was cross examined about this and it was directly put to her in the following terms   Really  Ms Montgomery  what this shows is that your documents at tab   are a fabrication  aren t they    No  they re not  They came out of the computer program  You have told us that the starting point of one of them  the first one behind tab   for the week ending   December  is a real document from the time  haven t you    That s right  It s nothing of the kind  is it    Yes  it is  It s something that you have put together to try to substantiate numbers    No  I took it out of off the job balance generals  And then you have told us that you have extrapolated back  and  lo and behold  you have been able to extrapolate for the week ending   December by adding and subtracting advices and receipts to page   a number of   which you purport would explain another entry in the bank statements and on Mr Borg s statements of account    These were all these all came out of the computer program  These  being tab     These were all worked out of the computer program  They have been massaged the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with       No     and put together by you       Clearly Mrs Montgomery  as the author of the recreated Price Spreadsheets  was only too aware of what the cross examiner was putting to her when he suggested that she had massaged and fiddled the numbers  If there was an answer to be made by her   D was on notice of the need to elicit that explanation in re examination or by seeking leave to adduce further evidence in chief      Application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn     Section  b  of the AAT Act stipulates that a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality as the legislation and a proper consideration of the matters permits  Consistent with that legislative approach  s  c  provides that the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence       D  before the Tribunal  had suggested that there was a  clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn    In Re Ruddock  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  and Another  Ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR     the High Court held that the rule in Browne v Dunn had no application to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal  Section   of the Migration Act    Cth   an equivalent provision to s   of the AAT Act  was relevant to that conclusion  The High Court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the Tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law      In any event  even assuming the rule was to apply  there was no breach of that rule  Where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged  failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule     In Jagelman v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC     it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant  Justice Hill observed at    However  it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case  Where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made  there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and  in consequence  there will have been no denial of procedural fairness  see Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission  unreported  Court of Appeal  NSW    June   discussed by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT     NSWLR   at      In the latter case  Hunt J said  at        In many cases  of course  counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness  and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief         It was open to the Tribunal to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions     Section   of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decision maker and stands in the shoes of the Commissioner  The Tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decision maker      The Price Spreadsheets and the Job Balance General were  D s documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them   D s written submissions in chief to the Tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents  independent of any testimony about them from which  D asserted that their authenticity was self evident  The Commissioner was entitled to  and did  respond on the same basis  It was open to the Tribunal to draw the conclusions which the Commissioner invited  simply by looking at the documents  In particular  that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn      Opportunity to Re open     Section   of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case  This section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice  Section  c  has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing  That requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved  It has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course  so stringent a test does not apply in AAT hearings      In Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR     a party was afforded an opportunity by the Tribunal to call further evidence  Justice Deane said as follows   In the context of the express invitation to the appellant  at the conclusion of the evidence  to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned  the failure of the Tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not  in my view  constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice     After the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of  D s submissions below  the Tribunal indicated that it would afford  D an opportunity to reopen its case if Mr Borg could be found  The Tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times  that  D should  go and find Mr Borg  for the reason that he was  either crucial or important in this equation        D acknowledged that it was open to it to re open its case  It was open to  D to have recalled Mrs Montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the Price Spreadsheets  the authenticity of which the Commissioner had challenged  first in cross examination of Mrs Montgomery and subsequently in written submissions  It did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the Commissioner  other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated      The Tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to  D to call further evidence and by providing a further opportunity to be heard  Thereafter  any potential lack of procedural fairness arising from the level of detail of the original cross examination  the Commissioner does not accept that there was any  was averted   D did not avail itself of the opportunity   Despite the provisions of subs   of the AAT Act  I am not persuaded that everything that was said by Gummow and Heydon JJ  with whom Gleeson CJ agreed  in Applicant S  concerning the non applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn to proceedings in the Refugee Review Tribunal can be transported  so to speak  to proceedings in the Tribunal  At   and   their Honours said    On occasion the submissions advanced for the prosecutrix were couched in the language of a contention that the rule in Browne v Dunn had not been complied with  Where a complaint is made about the failure of a questioner to put to a person giving oral answers a particular question  it is natural for a lawyer s mind to turn to the rule in Browne v Dunn  In essence  and subject to numerous qualifications and exceptions  that rule requires the cross examiner of a witness in adversarial litigation to put to that witness the nature of the case on which the cross examiner s client proposes to rely in contradiction of that witness    However  the rule has no application to proceedings in the tribunal  Section   of the Act states      The Tribunal  in reviewing a decision       a  is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence  and    b  must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case      The purpose of a provision such as s   is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate  Further  as was emphasised in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at   administrative decision making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures  There  the court has to decide where  on the balance of probabilities  the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial  referred toState Rail Authority of New South Wales v Collector of Customs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I would add that even if I had come to the contrary view on the denial of procedural fairness ground  with the consequence that the Tribunal s decision was infected with error of law  I would nevertheless have dismissed the appeal because I consider that the Tribunal s decision in respect of  D s application was clearly correct on the material before it  see Austin v Deputy Secretary  Attorney General s Department     FCR   at     McAuliffe v Secretary

remit matters for reconsideration where it is futile to do so  Morales v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at     per Sackville J  Tankey v Adams   FCA         FCR   at   distinguishedStephens v T Pittas Ltd     TC   Implicit in Mr Docherty s argument is that the Tribunal was required to take into account the fact that Mr Docherty was not the sole director of  D during the relevant years in deciding whether  D had  paid an amount  for the purposes of s  C and Div  A of the ITAA    Underlying this argument is the proposition that for there to be a payment there had to be a consensus between  D and Mr Docherty and in the face of the reality that Mr Docherty was only one of two directors  there could be no such consensus  Reliance was placed on what was said by the Special Commissioners in Stephens v T Pittas Ltd     TC   in particular at   namely  that in the absence of consensus between the company and Mr Pittas in that case  it was not possible to regard the relevant sums as loans or advances by the company  and what was said by Goulding J on appeal at   and   namely  that an outright misappropriation of the company s money could not be treated as the act of the company  except possibly if all the corporators of a solvent company consent to it   Section  C of Div  A is in the following terms   Payments treated as dividends When private company is taken to pay a dividend       A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company s year of income if the private company pays an amount to the entity during the year and either             a  the payment is made when the entity is a shareholder in the private company or an associate of such a shareholder  or                      b  a reasonable person would conclude  having regard to all the circumstances  that the payment is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time        Note   Some payments do not give rise to dividends  See Subdivision D  Note   A private company is treated as making a payment to a shareholder or shareholder s associate if an interposed entity makes a payment to the shareholder or associate  See Subdivision E  Amount of dividend       The dividend is taken to equal the amount paid  subject to section  Y      Note  Section  Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company s distributable surplus   It is to be noted that subs  C  contains no requirement that the payment be by way of loan or advance  In other words  a bare payment having no legal or commercial character will suffice provided the other requirements of the subsection are satisfied  This stands in contrast to the consensus requirement referred to by the Special Commissioners in T Pittas Ltd   There the Special Commissioners were referring to the need for consensus for it to be possible to regard the relevant amounts  as loans or advances by the company to Mr Pittas   Subsection  C  contains no such requirement  any payment will suffice  Moreover  the appeal judge s observation that an outright misappropriation of the company s money cannot be treated as the act of the company is answered by the Tribunal s finding in   above citedSullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   The submissions made on behalf of  D in this regard were to the following effect    To the extent that assertions were made by the Commissioner against  D  those accusations had to be squarely put to the relevant witnesses     As certain accusations were not put to the witnesses for  D  the Tribunal fell into serious error by taking those assertions into account in making its determination  Not only did the Tribunal take those assertions into account but made findings of fact  and findings on credit  based upon matters never put to witnesses  in particular Mrs Montgomery      In this regard the Tribunal must apply notions of procedural fairness  Kioa v West   HCA         CLR     Jagelman v FCT   ATC     Fletcher   Ors v FCT     FCR     Commissioner of Taxation v Metaskills Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    A breach of these principles constitutes an error of law  Australian Postal Commission v Hayes   FCA         FCR   at   per Wilcox J  The first part of s   of the AAT Act provides statutory recognition of these principles  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR        The integrity of the Price Spreadsheets was of fundamental importance to the case sought to be put by  D  The Price Spreadsheets were recognised by the Commissioner as  the central plank in the Applicants  case      In the course of the hearing  counsel for the Commissioner put to Mrs Montgomery in respect of the Price Spreadsheets that     the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with      Counsel for  D strenuously objected to such a question on the following basis   Mr McGovern  I object to that  because it is quite important  That proposition may be an ultimate submission  but in fairness to the witness and she is here now my friend should take her directly to each of the figures which he asserts to have been massaged  each of which has been fiddled with  so that we all know  rather than put it globally  Its unfair to the witness to do it otherwise    Later   Mr Fagan  I don t purport to be able to put a positive to this witness about which number has been adjusted in which respect  I submit that it s quite appropriate to put  in this sort of circumstance  to this witness that the whole thing has been an adjustment and fiddling of numbers to reach a number to correspond with a cheque that as  sic  cashed  The Deputy President  I can see no reason why it can t be put  She can deny it if she likes    Later   Mr McGovern      But at this point  and this is not just forensic flourish  this is really a question for the decision maker at the end of the day to have to make a grave determination about this lady s credibility and whether you accept her or not  and  in those circumstances  to just put a rolled up general proposition which is  now we know  unsupportable by as he frankly confesses he can t ascribe any particularity to any massaged figures or numbers  at least what should be done         Mr Fagan      I am entitled to put this general proposition that they have been fabricated  by its very nature I wouldn t know how     As counsel for  D feared  and as ultimately eventuated both in the Commissioner s written and oral submissions  counsel for the Commissioner proceeded to make submissions with some particularity as to discrepancies within the Price Spreadsheets  The alleged discrepancies  being the basis for the Commissioner s submissions  were not put to the witness  particularly Mrs Montgomery  Accordingly she was denied an opportunity to be heard on the matter in response     In this regard  the Commissioner s submissions  both written and oral  asserted with some particularity the manner in which the Price Spreadsheets were allegedly manipulated  and these submissions were both taken into account  and adopted by the Tribunal  without demur  in finding against  D     For the Tribunal to accept submissions on such matters not put to the witness was an error in law  being a clear failure to provide procedural fairness to  D on a crucial part of  D s case     In such circumstances it is difficult to resist the conclusion that an acceptance of the Commissioner s submissions by the Tribunal amounted to gross unfairness     Mrs Montgomery in particular was confronted in the witness box with an imprecise  generalised and unspecified assertion about  fudging and fiddling  the contemporaneous records  but the final submissions  which she was not offered opportunity to address in evidence  then contained detailed allegations never put to her  This was a clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn     R    HL  and that rule has been treated as an aspect of procedural fairness  and if breached will give rise to a vitiation of the decision of the Tribunal  see Hoskins v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR   at     The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect    There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal for the following reasons       a  It was squarely put to Mrs Montgomery who had reconstructed the Price Spreadsheets that she had  fabricated  or  massaged  or  fiddled  the figures in the Price Spreadsheets    b  The Tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by

Dunn had no application to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal  Section   of the Migration Act    Cth   an equivalent provision to s   of the AAT Act  was relevant to that conclusion  The High Court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the Tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law      In any event  even assuming the rule was to apply  there was no breach of that rule  Where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged  failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule     In Jagelman v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC     it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant  Justice Hill observed at    However  it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case  Where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made  there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and  in consequence  there will have been no denial of procedural fairness  see Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission  unreported  Court of Appeal  NSW    June   discussed by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT     NSWLR   at      In the latter case  Hunt J said  at        In many cases  of course  counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness  and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief         It was open to the Tribunal to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions     Section   of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decision maker and stands in the shoes of the Commissioner  The Tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decision maker      The Price Spreadsheets and the Job Balance General were  D s documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them   D s written submissions in chief to the Tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents  independent of any testimony about them from which  D asserted that their authenticity was self evident  The Commissioner was entitled to  and did  respond on the same basis  It was open to the Tribunal to draw the conclusions which the Commissioner invited  simply by looking at the documents  In particular  that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn      Opportunity to Re open     Section   of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case  This section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice  Section  c  has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing  That requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved  It has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course  so stringent a test does not apply in AAT hearings      In Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR     a party was afforded an opportunity by the Tribunal to call further evidence  Justice Deane said as follows   In the context of the express invitation to the appellant  at the conclusion of the evidence  to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned  the failure of the Tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not  in my view  constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice     After the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of  D s submissions below  the Tribunal indicated that it would afford  D an opportunity to reopen its case if Mr Borg could be found  The Tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times  that  D should  go and find Mr Borg  for the reason that he was  either crucial or important in this equation        D acknowledged that it was open to it to re open its case  It was open to  D to have recalled Mrs Montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the Price Spreadsheets  the authenticity of which the Commissioner had challenged  first in cross examination of Mrs Montgomery and subsequently in written submissions  It did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the Commissioner  other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated      The Tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to  D to call further evidence and by providing a further opportunity to be heard  Thereafter  any potential lack of procedural fairness arising from the level of detail of the original cross examination  the Commissioner does not accept that there was any  was averted   D did not avail itself of the opportunity referred toTankey v Adams   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I would add that even if I had come to the contrary view on the denial of procedural fairness ground  with the consequence that the Tribunal s decision was infected with error of law  I would nevertheless have dismissed the appeal because I consider that the Tribunal s decision in respect of  D s application was clearly correct on the material before it  see Austin v Deputy Secretary  Attorney General s Department     FCR   at     McAuliffe v Secretary  Department
