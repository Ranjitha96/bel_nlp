Todd v Repatriation Commission   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedRepatriation Commission v Warren     ALD   One finds in the joint judgment of Lindgren and Bennett JJ  with whom in this regard I concurred  in Repatriation Commission v Warren     ALD   at   para   a very helpful summary of principles of arising from that case and earlier authority in respect of the obligations which attend the exercise by the Tribunal of its jurisdiction in circumstances where the parties have taken  or at least promoted  a particular way in which the issues ought to be identified or determined    The following principles  which we take to be established  must be understood against the background that the tribunal under consideration  like the Tribunal here  is required to  review  a primary decision  is given all the powers and discretions that were conferred on the original decision maker  is not bound by the rules of evidence  is required to proceed with little formality and technicality  and is  of course  bound to apply the provisions of the relevant statute  even if there is no challenge by the parties      The general rule that a litigant is bound by  and accordingly is entitled to act on  admissions and concessions does not automatically apply  although cases concerned with the exercise of judicial power may be of assistance   Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at   per Bowen CJ      A party to the proceeding is not necessarily precluded from arguing on  appeal  matters that were conceded before the tribunal  Whether the party is so precluded depends on the nature of the matter conceded  its conduct of its case  whether the concession represented an agreement by the parties as to the facts to be decided and other relevant circumstances   Kuswardana at   per Bowen CJ and at   per Fox J      Where a concession is made  there must be some difficulty in finding an  error of law  when the contrary of the concession is raised for the first time in this Court   Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Raptis   FCA         ATR   at   per Gummow J      A tribunal does not err in law in failing to regard as material a fact which counsel failed in submissions to contend was material   Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Perkins     ATR   at   per Davies J      There is a difference between factual matters not canvassed before the tribunal and a new issue relating to the validity of a regulation   Tefonu Pty Ltd v Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner   FCA         FCR   at   per Beazley J      Even though the parties may be   able  in practical terms  to narrow the issues by concession     even a concession does not permit the  t ribunal to avoid its duty as an administrative decision maker to make the correct or preferable decision     on all relevant aspects of the matter before it     Peacock v Repatriation Commission     FCR   at     A concession   does  however  permit the decision maker to reach the correct or preferable decision by reference to the concession as well as to its findings on disputed questions     Peacock at   and see Comcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR   at         The Court will more readily permit a matter to be raised for the first time in this Court on an appeal from a tribunal where             a  the matter is a pure question of law  such as a question as to the validity of a regulation   Kuswardana at   Tefonu at   or a question as to whether the tribunal had applied the correct standard of proof on the true construction and application of legislation   Ferriday at     per Lee J     b  the matter goes to a misapprehension that was shared by the parties before the tribunal and therefore by the tribunal itself   Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd v Commissioner for ACT Revenue   FCA         FCR   at     per Wilcox J  such as a shared misapprehension as to the applicable law  cf Thomas at   per Beazley J  or      c  the matter goes to a condition precedent to the availability of a power  the exercise of which will have a serious impact on the individual   Kuswardana      Of particular interest in the context of this case  having regard to the submissions that came to be made on behalf of Mr Todd  is the question of whether  though the parties did narrow the issues by concession  the Tribunal was nonetheless obliged in the discharge of its duty to make the correct or preferable decision in respect of the review application  to look beyond the issues that were identified for it   The argument in that regard was developed  on behalf of Mr Todd  by reference to a report which Dr Stephenson gave  Dr Stephenson s report  which formed the basis of the submission  is one dated   June    It must be said that there is some reference to the fact of this report in the statements of facts and contentions that were exchanged before the hearing in the Tribunal  It must also be said though that nothing was made of the opinions expressed in Dr Stephenson s report of   June   even though  strictly speaking  it was a report before the Tribunal   In the report of   June   Dr Stephenson rehearses a number of events as related to her by Mr Todd that occurred in the course of his regular naval service  Of this and other events related by Mr Todd  Dr Stephenson stated  As to how much of this is due to his naval service  it is very hard to assess  Certainly  his perception is that he changed appreciably and from the time he went into the navy  compared with before  when he coped with a number of very efficient work situations without becoming unduly stressed  On the other hand  there have been other factors  at least in the last decade  that have preyed on his nerves   She continued in the final paragraph of her report  It would appear that despite Mr Todd s self perception of being entirely stable prior to his naval service  that he probably is susceptible to stress  and from his account of his attitude to work at his navy days  probably a bit perfectionistic and hard on himself
