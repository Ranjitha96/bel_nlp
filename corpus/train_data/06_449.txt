SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v Sun   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Against this  s  B  and s  B b  each provide that where no period is prescribed  the information or comments are to be given within a reasonable period  Mr Potts drew attention to the power of the RRT to extend the period to respond to an invitation contained in s  B   It may well be that this power can be exercised after the initial prescribed period has expired  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v Sun   FCAFC   at      A difficult question of construction and reconciliation of the provisions of Div   of Part   with the privative clause in s   of the Act would arise if the RRT were to specify in its s   or  A invitation a period of   days to respond  and  in the absence of a response within that period  the RRT proceeded to make a decision on the review without further action  as apparently authorised by s  C and s  c    However  I am relieved from answering that question because of the circumstances in which the apparent breach of s  B  occurred in the present case  What I have to determine is whether the breach complained of gave rise to jurisdictional error  That cannot be answered by simply posing the question of breach or no breach  it is necessary to consider whether in the particular circumstances the breach had that result   I do not see how  having regard to the language of s  B  or the scope of Div   a breach which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to  could be thought to render invalid a decision given after the breach  This must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s     It follows that the appeal must be dismissed referred toNACI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  A failure to give the additional information requested under s     or to give the comments pursuant to an invitation given under s  A   before the time specified  or any extended period  authorises the RRT to make a decision on the review without taking any further action  see s  C and s  C    see also NACI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     Moreover  a failure to give the information or the comments before the specified time relieves the RRT of its obligation to invite an applicant to give evidence and present arguments at an oral hearing  see s  c   Indeed  failure to give the information or to provide the comments removes any entitlement of an applicant to appear before the RRT  see s   referred toNAWR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It might be thought therefore that the time limits fixed by the Act and the Regulations must be adhered to strictly  Further support for this view is to be found in the observation of Sackville J in NAWR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   and   that no period other than the period of   days for the initial prescribed period or   days for the further prescribed period can be specified citedProject Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The question of whether a breach of s  B  gives rise to jurisdictional error is to be answered by having regard to the language of the section and the scope and object of the whole statute  the question is whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid  Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at       see also SAAP at     citedRe

invalidity of the decision or where an applicant has suffered no injustice  see Re Refugee Review Tribunal   ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   at         see also SAAP at   referred toSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Federal Magistrate Lloyd Jones considered at some length the effect of the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR     SAAP    His Honour came to the view that the purpose and legislative context of s  B was to be contrasted with that of s  A   such that the legislative intention was not to be that a breach of the time provision in s  B  would lead to the invalidation of a decision made following a breach of the section   As I have said  the Minister conceded that the RRT s s   letter breached s  B  of the Act by specifying a date for response which was outside the prescribed period  It may seem curious that what would appear to be an indulgence extended to an applicant could nonetheless constitute a breach  However  I do not suggest that the concession was wrongly made   The question of whether a breach of s  B  gives rise to jurisdictional error is to be answered by having regard to the language of the section and the scope and object of the whole statute  the question is whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid  Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at       see also SAAP at       In SAAP   a majority of the Court held that a breach of s  A was jurisdictional in nature so that a decision handed down after the breach was rendered invalid by it   Their Honours pointed to the mandatory language of s  A and to the purpose of the provision which McHugh J described at   as  one of the centrepieces of     the  regime of statutory procedural fairness   see also at       per Kirby J  and at     per Hayne J   Relief may be refused inter alia  where there has been waiver or acquiescence in the invalidity of the decision or where an applicant has suffered no injustice  see Re Refugee Review Tribunal   ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   at         see also SAAP at   referred toSZDQL v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The question of whether a breach of s  B b  of the Act resulted in jurisdictional error was raised in SZDQL v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     SZDQL    However  Sackville J found that the provision was not breached  It was therefore unnecessary to decide whether a contravention of s  B  constituted jurisdictional error  His Honour said that the issue should be left to a case in which the court had the benefit of full argument  see at       I have been much assisted by the written and oral submissions of both Counsel  I am indebted to Mr Zipser for accepting the brief for the appellant pro bono pursuant to an order I made under Order   of the Federal Court Rules    Mr Zipser submitted that the language of s  B  though not using the imperative  must  was nonetheless mandatory in nature  He also pointed to the object of the section as a part of the statutory procedural fairness regime which is codified in Div   of Part   of the Act    Support for the view I have expressed as to the object of the provision may be found in Sackville J s observation in SZDQL at   as to the statutory purpose of s  B b   His Honour said that its object is to ensure that the required interview takes place within a reasonably short period of the invitation   Section  B b  operates in a slightly different way from s  B   The effect of s  B b  is that the RRT may stipulate a time for the interview at any time within the prescribed period  There is an outer time limit within which the interview may take place but the RRT may appoint any date within the period  indeed  at the very hearing at which the invitation is extended  SZDQL at     By contrast  s  B  is directed to the provision of information and comments by an applicant and when read with Reg     it sets an opening and closing period of   days after receipt of the invitation  It would be open to the invitee to provide the information or comments within that   day period but it is not open to the RRT to specify a date before the closing of that period by which the information or comments must be provided   I do not consider that this difference in the operation of the two subsections leads to a different view of their objects  It seems to me that what Sackville J said in SZDQL as to the object of s  B b  applies equally to s  B    However  it seems to me that there is a further aspect of the statutory purpose of those subsections which must be borne in mind when answering the question of whether a breach is jurisdictional in nature  This appears from a consideration of the part which those subsections play in the codified regime of procedural fairness contained in Div   of Part   of the Act
