Indigenous   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  This is an appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate given on   January   dismissing the appellant s application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  see SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous   FMCA    The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the respondent s delegate to refuse the appellant a protection visa  class XA    According to the Tribunal  the appellant is a citizen of India and from a Hindu family  His parents are participants in religious activities and supporters of a Hindu political party  The appellant arrived in Australia on   December    While in Australia the appellant converted to Islam  On   March   the appellant applied for a protection visa claiming to have a well founded fear of persecution if he returned to India for reasons of religion   In his protection visa application  the appellant gave details of his education and work history  Information as to his education took the form of a list of the institutions he had attended and the dates of his attendance  The institutions listed were the appellant s high school  the National Institute of Sales and Marketing in Delhi and the Sydney International College of Business  He also listed his employers  dates of employment and salaries referred toS  v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Before the Federal Magistrate  the appellant s primary argument was that the Tribunal  by considering the possibility of relocation and concealing his whereabouts from relatives  was requiring him to avoid harm by acting discreetly in the practise of his religion  The appellant argued this was an error of law as identified by the High Court in S  v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR     The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal s decision was not based on a finding that the appellant would be required to modify his behaviour  Rather  his Honour held that the Tribunal had determined that wherever the appellant chose to live in India he could continue the normal practice of his religion without fear of persecution  Also  the Federal Magistrate concluded that the Tribunal s finding about relocation was an alternate ground relating to the appellant s fear of coming to serious harm on account of his conversion  On this view  the Tribunal had independently concluded that the appellant s fears of persecution relating to his conversion were not well founded  The Federal Magistrate concluded that while  i t may be possible to interpret the Tribunal s question  that he could move and not tell his relatives  as involving the proposition that the appellant could modify his behaviour  it was not the basis of the tribunal s findings in its reasons    The first respondent also argued before the Federal Magistrate that the appeal was barred by Anshun estoppel  Having found on other grounds that the appeal should be dismissed  the Federal Magistrate did not need to consider this ground   In a notice of appeal dated   February   the appellant submitted two grounds of appeal  The first ground challenged the Federal Magistrate s finding that Tribunal s decision did not necessitate any change of behaviour by the appellant in the normal practice of his new religion  particularly   in circumstances where the change in location would require the appellant to be discreet in terms of his religious and family history   The second ground of appeal was that the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the relocation finding was not the primary basis of the Tribunal s decision  At the hearing of the appeal  counsel for the appellant abandoned both these grounds of appeal and relied instead on a new ground set out in an amended notice of appeal filed on   May     This new ground was that the Tribunal breached s  A of the Act  The appellant now claims that the Tribunal erred when it  did not disclose certain adverse information as required by s  A  and that this information was      t he educational history of the  appellant  provided in his application for a protection visa  discussedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant submitted that a breach of s  A is jurisdictional error whenever the Tribunal fails to disclose information that forms part of its reasons  Citing SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     SZEEU   at   per Weinberg J and   per Allsop J  the appellant argued that there is error even where the information concerned only a minor and subsidiary part of the reasons   The appellant argued that the education information provided in the original protection visa application was not subject to the exception in s  b  of the Act  Moreover  the appellant submitted that the mere adoption at the hearing of any information contained in the visa application would not bring that information within the s  b  exception   The appellant relied on SZEEU at   and   per Moore J and NAZY v MIMIA   FCA   at   per Jacobson J for the proposition that information does not fall within the exception of s  A b  unless it is put forward as evidence in chief and the applicant is aware of the significance of the information  Thus  in the appellant s view  his brief responses to leading questions regarding his education in India did not mean this was information given for the purpose of the application for review under s  A b    In support of his application to amend his notice of appeal the appellant noted that SZEEU had not been delivered at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrate  The appellant suggested that it is unlikely that any further evidence would have been led below if the new ground had been argued there  Moreover  the appellant suggested that any prejudice to the first respondent could be cured by allowing her to tender a transcript of the Tribunal hearing   The first respondent submitted that the Court should not grant leave to amend the notice of appeal  The first respondent noted that although SZEEU had not been decided at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrate  SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   and Al Shamry had been decided at that time  Further  the first respondent argued that leave to amend should be refused because the new ground of appeal was futile   The first respondent contrasted this case to the facts of SZEEU   In SZEEU   the Court had considered the case of SZBMI who  in an airport interview upon arrival  had provided information concerning his flight from his home country  Before the Tribunal  he had affirmed that this statement was accurate  The Court  at   per Moore J and   per Weinberg J  held that the adoption of the earlier statement at the hearing before the Tribunal did not render it information provided by him in his application for review  The first respondent argued that this case is different because  rather than adopting a large statement in which a specific item of information was contained  the appellant had specifically discussed his educational background with the Tribunal  According to the first respondent  it followed that the information fell within the exception of s  A b    Although it was discussed before the Federal Magistrate  neither party raised the issue of Anshun estoppel in this Court   The Court in SZEEU accepted that the word  information  in s  A refers to  knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal  see SZEEU at     per Moore J  at       per Weinberg J and   per Allsop J  I accept that the Tribunal s knowledge of the educational institutions and dates of attendance and employment history set out in the appellant s visa application  referred to below as educational information  could constitute knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal and therefore  information  for the purposes of s  A of the Act  It was not suggested that the Tribunal had given the applicant particulars of such information as s  A  would require if it applied   SZEEU contains various discussions of the expression  a part of the reason  in s  A  see   per Weinberg J and     per Allsop J  As Allsop J said at    i t is only necessary that the information be a part of the reason   In this case  however  the appellant has not established that the educational information set out in his visa application was  a part of the reason  for the Tribunal s decision  because other detailed information on the same subject was specifically provided to the Tribunal at the Tribunal hearing  The information given at the Tribunal hearing fell within the exclusion in s  A b  of the Act   For present purposes  I accept that the Tribunal s finding that it was reasonable for the appellant to relocate because he  is well educated and has demonstrated sufficient personal resourcefulness to enable him to settle here  was a part of the reason for the Tribunal s decision  However  consideration of the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal makes it clear that the appellant specifically gave his educational and employment history to the Tribunal at that hearing   At the hearing before the Tribunal  the Tribunal member asked questions regarding the appellant s educational and employment history  In response to the question  You came as a student did you  the appellant explained that he had been studying business management at Sydney International College and that he had completed his studies there  He was then asked what he was studying at the time of the hearing  The appellant answered that he was studying commercial cookery at the Australian College of Hospitality   It is clear that the appellant specifically provided the Tribunal with his educational details  I reject the appellant s submission that the information does not fall within s  A b  because it was given in response to questions in the nature of  cross examination   The Tribunal s questions were specific and arose  naturally enough  from the appellant s visa application  The appellant gave direct answers  The relevant information was simple and could be easily given in response to such questions  Further  SZEEU provides support for the proposition that where an applicant affirms a specific fact before the Tribunal that information will be covered by the exclusion in s  A b   At   Moore J  with whom Weinberg J at   and Allsop J at   agreed on this issue  said     While it appears that the Tribunal originally came to know that the appellant entered Australia on a business visa from sources other than the appellant  an inference which could be drawn from the way the letter of   February   was framed  it is tolerably clear from the Tribunal s reasons that it discussed this fact  that the appellant had entered Australia on a business visa  with the appellant and he affirmed he had  Thus it was information comprehended by s  A b  even though it was information also derived from an alternative source    Similar reasoning applies in this case  The appellant gave the Tribunal information concerning his educational and employment history at the Tribunal hearing  although the Tribunal had reference to the appellant s visa application in discussing some aspects of his history with him   I reject the appellant s submission that at the Tribunal hearing he merely adopted the education information in his visa application  This was not a case where an applicant merely adopted the contents of a document as a whole and in so doing was said to have conceded the correctness of items of information within it  contrast SZEEU at   and   per Moore J  It may be recalled that in SZEEU the Full Court held that the applicant s global adoption of an earlier statement  which contained the  flight information  did not bring the flight information before the Tribunal for the purposes of s  A b  of the Act  The present case is entirely different from the  flight information  in SZEEU   It is plain enough from the transcript of the Tribunal hearing that the appellant separately and specifically gave detailed information concerning his education and employment to the Tribunal  It was open to the Tribunal on the basis of this information  which clearly fell within s  A b  to find that the appellant was well educated and resourceful so as to make relocation reasonable  Accordingly  the appellant s proposed new ground  which asserts breach of s  A  of the Act  is untenable   I would refuse leave to amend the notice of appeal and  since the appellant advanced no other ground that requires consideration  I would dismiss the appeal instanter      I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable

Tribunal  he had done more than simply adopt information concerning his educational experiences in Australia  This was because  in response to the Tribunal s questioning  the appellant had actively given details of his education in Australia  However  the appellant distinguished information about his education in India from that about his education in this country  In the appellant s submission  in relation to his Indian education  he did no more than adopt the information provided earlier in his protection visa application  The appellant noted that his answers regarding his education in India were in response to leading questions from the Tribunal where  in effect  he was asked to do no more than confirm the details in his original application in March    Further  the appellant noted that the Tribunal had not told him of the potential significance of this information for its decision making  In this connection  he referred to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
