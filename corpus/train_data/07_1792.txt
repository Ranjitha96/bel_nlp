assert that it has not had a proper opportunity either to address the applications for further security for costs or  those orders having been made  to address the applications that the proceeding be dismissed for it having failed to pay the further security for costs ordered  That it did not participate in the hearing on   May   was a matter for it  Even in respect of that hearing  it does not profess inadvertence or ignorance  although Ms Watson herself may not have known of that hearing  see e g  Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR   at   Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal

applicant s second and third contentions  I am not persuaded that it should be granted a further extension of time within which to appeal from the further security for costs orders made on   February    In brief  it has not explained the delay satisfactorily at all  It has not demonstrated any relevant significant change in circumstances  even if the Deumer Asia letter of   July   were to be permitted to be adduced in evidence on the appeal  as to which see e g  Council of the City of Greater Wollongong v Cowan   HCA         CLR   at    It has not explained  in any event  why that letter could not have been procured much earlier  It has not sought to have the security for costs orders discharged  It is clearly  and admittedly  unable to pay the further security for costs orders and will be unable to meet any costs of the respondents if the matter proceeds to hearing and the applicant is unsuccessful   Nor has any reason been identified of any substance as to why the orders of   February   for further security for costs might be set aside on appeal  There is no draft notice of appeal  nor anything identifying error   The second matter argued by the applicant relates to matters taken into account when the further security for costs orders were made  It is not a new argument  It is discussed in Cosdean  No     FCA   at     citedHouse v The King   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my view  the second and third matters raised by the applicant may be seen as errors asserted by the applicant in the making of the further security for costs orders on   February    Otherwise  they are simply an attempt to re argue matters which have already been argued  I shall also therefore consider whether those matters might demonstrate some arguable prospect of success if an extension of time to appeal from those orders were granted  I do not think these matters demonstrate a relevant mistake of fact in considering the potential award of damages  in considering the capacity of the applicant to fund the second tranche of key rings as discussed in Cosdean  No     FCA  at      Nor do I think that they otherwise provide an arguable basis for error from the discretionary judgment to impose the further security for costs orders upon the applicant  See House v The King   HCA         CLR   at       For those reasons  I do not consider that the applicant should be granted a further extension of time within which to appeal from the further security for costs orders made on   February   or from the order presently staying the proceeding until the further security for costs was paid  made on   February     I am further of the view  having regard to the conclusion I have reached that there should be no extension of time within which to appeal from the further security for costs orders  and having regard to the accepted inability of the applicant to comply with those orders by providing further security for costs  that the orders made on   May   should not be discharged  The applicant is faced with further orders for security for costs  It cannot satisfy them  It acknowledges that  The proceedings have been permanently stayed  In those circumstances  nothing has been shown to indicate that the orders dismissing the proceedings against each of the respondents were inappropriate in the first place  or should now be discharged
