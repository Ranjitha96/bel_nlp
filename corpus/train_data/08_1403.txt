Court unquestionably has a discretionary power to direct that a trial be by jury  The relevant source of that power is said by the Applicant to be ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act   Those sections relevantly provide as follows    General powers of Courts in bankruptcy       If in a proceeding before the Federal Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have tried before a jury  the Federal Court may  if it thinks fit  direct the trial of that question to be had before a jury  and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trial of an issue of fact in an action        Exercise of jurisdiction   In exercising jurisdiction under this Act  the Court shall hear and determine the following matters in open Court       i  applications for the trial of questions of fact with a jury and the trial of those questions        All other matters under this Act may  in the discretion of the Court  be heard in open Court or in Chambers    Section   is a provision which   specifically provides for a discretion to order trial by jury in a bankruptcy matter     Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Rigg   FCA   at   per Beaumont J   Also to be noted  however  are ss   and   of the Federal Court of Australia Act   which provide as follows    Trial without jury In every suit in the Court  unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders  the trial shall be by a Judge without a jury    Power of Court to direct trial of issues with a jury The Court or a Judge may  in any suit in which the ends of justice appear to render it expedient to do so  direct the trial with a jury of the suit or of an issue of fact  and may for that purpose make all such orders  issue all such writs and cause all such proceedings to be had and taken as the Court or Judge thinks necessary  and upon the finding of the jury the Court may give such decision and pronounce such judgment as the case requires   It was understood that Counsel for the Applicant quite properly did not contend that the Applicant had any entitlement to a trial by jury    whichever Act was invoked  It was understood that Counsel for the Applicant accepted that the question as to whether or not there should be a trial with a jury was ultimately a matter    not of entitlement    but a matter for the discretion of this Court   Moreover  and although there may be trial by jury in bankruptcy proceedings  it is the exception rather than the rule  Re Shields  Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     FCR    Einfeld J there observed  at       in bankruptcy proceedings jury trials will be the exception rather than the rule      A jury trial involves a great deal of expense and time both to the parties and the Court  as well as considerable inconvenience to the members of the community who constitute the jury  The use of juries in civil matters has steadily declined during this century and is now largely reserved for those areas where serious imputations are to be made against the character of a party  Like divorce  bankruptcy is no longer regarded as such a matter  In the absence of some very compelling special circumstance  the intention of Parliament is clearly that bankruptcy proceedings be heard by a judge   See also  Re Allen     SR  NSW    at   Draper v Official Receiver   FCA   at   per Mansfield J  Some   special reason   must

High Court Procedure Act    Cth   Those latter provisions were considered by Fullagar J in McDermott v Collien   HCA         CLR    His Honour there formulated the   general policy   as follows  at   Two things     seem clear enough  The first is that with the merits and demerits of trial by jury as a means of determining civil causes I have nothing whatever to do       S o far as any question of general policy is involved  it is settled for me by the High Court Procedure Act  Trial without a jury is the normal mode of trial of actions in this Court  and some special reason must be shown for a departure in any particular case from that normal mode  The second thing that seems clear is that it is not enough to show that the cause of action is of a kind which could quite properly be tried with a jury and which was normally tried with a jury in England before the Judicature Act         Vict  c     The decisions of Hodges J  and of Isaacs J  perhaps suggest that the nature of the cause of action is not even a relevant consideration  I would not be prepared to assent to that as a general proposition  indeed I would rather have thought that it might in some cases be a potent consideration  But it is clear that it is not enough to say   This is a kind of action which is quite suitable for trial with a jury  and I would like to have it tried with a jury    Appl d  Dinnison

Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Albeit in a different context  applications made pursuant to the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth  may allege in an appropriate case that statutory powers have been exercised for an   improper purpose    Indeed  the   Act expressly contemplates that a ground upon which an administrative decision may be sought to be impugned is   bad faith   s  d   It may be considered that an allegation of   bad faith   is a more serious allegation than one of pursuing an   improper purpose    Both are serious allegations  But such applications have long been heard and determined by Judges of this Court without a jury  Although it must readily be recognised that an allegation of   bad faith   is a   very serious allegation   to make  it is an allegation that has in fact been made in other proceedings against both a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  eg  Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at       FCA       ATR   and against others exercising statutory power  eg  SCAS v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       ALR      Fraud   or   equitable fraud   is likewise a very serious allegation  Public confidence in the administration of justice by this Court  it is considered  has only been enhanced by this Court entertaining and resolving such   serious   allegations  Such allegations have been made in the past and presumably will continue to be made  And when made they will be resolved  It may be that a case will arise where a Judge of this Court orders a jury  But this proceeding is not that case

CLR   followedLi Chia Hsing v Rankin   HCA         CLR       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The difficulty  however  which would have inevitably confronted the Applicant    even had it not been abandoned    is the simple fact that s   is confined to a   trial on indictment    It is Parliament  and not this Court or the High Court  which determines whether proceedings are to be commenced by way of indictment  It is not for this Court to determine that proceedings are sufficiently   serious   that they should be commenced by indictment  Li Chia Hsing v Rankin   HCA         CLR   at      Barwick CJ there concluded    Further  if in truth from s   you could derive the conclusion that  constitutionally  all  serious  offences must be tried on indictment by a jury  it would be for the Court and not for the Parliament to determine whether any given offence was relevantly a  serious  offence  The limited submission of the applicant that  for the reasons given on his behalf  the present offence was a  serious  offence  in my opinion  fails      Further  to so reduce the universality of the language of the section would be insufficient to create a constitutional guarantee that those offences must be treated as indictable offences  The applicant s submission in reality is that s   postulates that some offences are of their nature  or of their nature and circumstances   indictable  offences  ie offences which may not be prosecuted except on indictment  The applicant describes these offences as  serious  offences  Section     however  only operates on indictment  Its language was chosen in the knowledge of Art   of the Constitution of the United States and of the experience of that country with the construction and operation of that article over the considerable period of time which had elapsed before the terms of s   were accepted       I t is  in my opinion  not possible to conclude  apart of course from the expressed intention of the Parliament in the relevant statute  that an offence is of its nature  indictable   Summary prosecution for a wide variety of offences has a long history  though punishment upon summary conviction is generally limited so far as imprisonment is provided to a term of twelve months or less  It was unanimously decided in R v Archdall and Roskruge  Ex parte Carrigan and Brown   HCA         CLR   that the section placed

proceedings  it is the exception rather than the rule  Re Shields  Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     FCR    Einfeld J there observed  at       in bankruptcy proceedings jury trials will be the exception rather than the rule      A jury trial involves a great deal of expense and time both to the parties and the Court  as well as considerable inconvenience to the members of the community who constitute the jury  The use of juries in civil matters has steadily declined during this century and is now largely reserved for those areas where serious imputations are to be made against the character of a party  Like divorce  bankruptcy is no longer regarded as such a matter  In the absence of some very compelling special circumstance  the intention of Parliament is clearly that bankruptcy proceedings be heard by a judge   See also  Re Allen     SR  NSW    at   Draper v Official Receiver   FCA   at   per Mansfield J  Some   special reason   must be shown for a departure

      ATC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Each application for a trial by jury must necessarily depend on the facts upon which such an order is sought and the individual judgment of the legal practitioners making the application  Subject to that qualification  the decision of the Full Court in Taylor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATC   provides some limited assistance  The Deputy Commissioner had there obtained judgment  a bankruptcy notice and a sequestration order  The trial judge had declined to appoint a jury  As in the present case  Constitutional rights were there also sought to be invoked  unlike the present case  the scope for disputed facts was apparently more confined  Cooper  Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ there concluded    The appellants advance an additional argument on the appeal as to their entitlement to have a jury trial on the hearing of the petitions  They submit that the power to make a sequestration order is a power to acquire property of a person which falls within s xxxi  of the Constitution   The constitutional guarantee that the power may only be exercised upon the provision of just terms to the person from whom the property is acquired gives rise  they submit  to the jury issue of whether the taking of their property is upon just terms  The submission misunderstands the administration of the property of a bankrupt for the benefit of the bankrupt s creditors  There is no acquisition of property within the operation of s xxxi  of the Constitution when the property of a bankrupt is sequestrated and vested in a trustee in bankruptcy  S xxxi  has no bearing on the matter  Re Dohnert Muller Schmidt and Co  Attorney General of the Commonwealth v Schmidt   HCA         CLR   at      The appellants  submission as to the right to trial by jury on a trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth  s  of the Constitution   and to the requirements of full faith and credit being given to the laws of every State  s  of the Constitution   do not advance their case to a right to a trial by jury on the hearing of the bankruptcy petitions    In these circumstances there were no issues of fact in dispute on the hearing of the bankruptcy petitions or on the hearing of the review of the District Registrar s decisions  which were capable of  or appropriate for  resolution by the verdict of a jury       As in the present case  it is not considered that any such questions of fact which may require resolution are appropriate for resolution by the verdict of a jury   A submission that public confidence in this Court would be affected if a jury were not appointed in this case is  with respect  without substance   The manner in which provisions such as ss   and   of the Federal Court of Australia Act have been interpreted and applied was  presumably  the reason why the Applicant placed greater    if not exclusive    reliance upon ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act  consideredThurecht v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     FCR       ATC       ATR   Proceedings against a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation are not relevantly different for present purposes to proceedings against other Commonwealth office holders or decision makers  But Deputy Commissioners have attracted in the past allegations of serious wrongdoing  Thus  for example  in Thurecht v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     FCR       ATC       ATR   there was an allegation that a statutory power had been exercised in   bad faith   by reason of the Deputy Commissioner seeking to make an example of the applicants  Sheppard J referred to the evidence and summarised the allegations as follows  at       it is capable of suggesting that there had in fact been decided upon at a high level in Canberra  a policy designed to disadvantage    really to punish    those who had had the temerity to force the Commissioner s hand by making applications for writs of mandamus  That policy was designed to ensure that anybody else minded to make such an application would be discouraged from doing so  That is the applicants  case  The question is whether I should accept it   The allegation was rejected  There was no suggestion  however  in that case that public confidence in this Court would have been enhanced if those facts relevant to the resolution of such an allegation had been resolved by a jury   The conferral by the Commonwealth legislature of such jurisdiction as that conferred by the   Act upon this Court is only consistent with a legislative recognition that this Court will impartially and independently determine each case which comes before it  including litigation in which the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities may be respondents  No submission was advanced  nor could it be advanced  that there is any lack of public confidence in the manner in which this Court resolves contentious disputes involving allegations of misconduct or the pursuit of improper purposes by the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities  nor is it considered that public confidence in the administration of justice by this Court would be enhanced if such applications were to be
