Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toReview   Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Review Australia Pty Ltd  Review  is the owner of Design Registration No    the Review Design  under the Designs Act    Cth   the Designs Act    As explained in Review   Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd   FCA     Redberry    Review acquired the Review Design from Review   Pty Ltd  in liquidation   Review   on   February   as part of a corporate restructure   This is an action for design infringement and a cross claim for design invalidity  For the reasons stated below  I would uphold the claim for design infringement and dismiss the cross claim for invalidity   In its statement of claim  Review alleges that the respondents New Cover Group Pty Ltd  New Cover  Maco Collection Pty Ltd  Maco  and or Biguang Pan have made  imported and sold garments in infringement of the Review Design  Since Mr Pan has never been served with the initiating process  or any other document in the proceeding  Review now seeks no relief against him  Various forms of relief are sought against New Cover and Maco  including declaratory and injunctive relief  and damages  As in Redberry   there are three principal questions    have the respondents infringed the Review Design    Is the Review Design valid    If yes to these two questions  how should damages be assessed  In accordance with orders made on   December   the evidence in proceeding VID   of     Redberry   in so far as it relates to the Review Design is also evidence in this proceeding  The trials in Redberry and that part of the present proceeding that concerns the Review Design took place together  This leaves for the future the trial in this proceeding with respect to the alleged infringement of registered design No     New Cover and Maco were unrepresented at trial  The Court gave Ms Yasemin Dolcel leave to tender on their behalf the affidavits  with exhibits  that had already been filed  subject to Review s objections as to admissibility   These affidavits were the affidavit of Ms Dolcel sworn on   November   and the affidavits of Wei Hong Meng  also known as Jim Meng  sworn on   November     September   and   February    The following were not relevant in this part of the proceeding  paragraphs   and   and parts of paragraphs   to   of Mr Meng  s   September   affidavit  paragraphs   to   of Mr Meng  s   November   affidavit  and paragraphs   and   of Mr Meng  s   February   affidavit  The following paragraphs were inadmissible  paragraphs      parts    and   of Mr Meng  s   September   affidavit  paragraphs   to   of Mr Meng  s   November   affidavit  and paragraphs       and   of Mr Meng  s   February    Notwithstanding that Review gave notice that Mr Meng was required for cross examination  Mr Meng did not attend Court  I bear this in mind in determining the weight to be given to his affidavit evidence   As depicted on the Register and in the Certificate of Registration  the Review Design is for a sleeveless  cross over  or fixed wrap  dress  having        a V Neck made by a cross over from left to right over a right to left cross over    a left to right cross over from shoulder to the left side of the waist with gathering on the left side of the waist    some gathering on both shoulders    figure hugging effect to the waist with a brown ribbon sash tying around a fixed waist    a square high back    a panelled skirt   panels in the front and panels in the back    a hem knee length or below the knee    a figure hugging skirt for over half the way to the hem  when it sharply expands  so that the dress at the hem has a ruffled effect  and    a patterned fabric in natural tones with orange  brown and blue fine  fronds leaf  pattern  with an African or tropical look   The business operations of New Cover and Maco are evidently intertwined to such an extent as to justify the two companies being treated in the same way in this proceeding  The labels under which New Cover and Maco sold their garments were evidently the same or virtually the same  including Spicy Sugar  Rose Burg  Tea Berry  Tea Berry Gold and New Cover  compare Ms Dolcel s affidavit of   October    filed in Redberry   and Mr Meng s affidavit of   September    filed in this proceeding   Ms Dolcel described herself as the business development manager for Maco   October   affidavit  and as New Cover s full time business development manager   November   affidavit   In evidence in chief  Ms Dolcel described herself as  b usiness development manager for the New Cover Group  aka Maco Collection Group  having the same identity  This was consistent with Mr Meng s affidavit of   September    par    Ms Dolcel s evidence was that she promoted New Cover Maco styles to New Cover and Maco customers  These clients included  other fashion boutique retailers  fashion agents and major chain retailers   Ms Dolcel did not suggest that New Cover s customers were different from Maco s customers   The solicitors for Review wrote to New Cover about the sale and purchase of the Spicy Sugar garments on   September   and   January   before this proceeding was begun  They also wrote to Maco on   December   and   January    In a statement of claim dated   April   Review specifically alleged that New Cover and Maco had  without its licence or authority  made  imported and sold garments embodying a design that was substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design   The Spicy Sugar garments are sleeveless fixed wrap or cross over dresses  The fabric from which they are made crosses over at the neckline  creating a V neck  in the same way as the Review Design and falls down to the left side of the waist  where the fabric is gathered  The dresses have gathering at the shoulders just like the Review Design  The Spicy Sugar dresses each have a fitted waist and a square high back  Each has a satin ribbon as a waist tie  The Spicy Sugar dresses all have the same skirt  This skirt has three panels at the front and back and is figure hugging for over half the way to the hem  when it expands  so that the dress at the hem has a ruffled effect  The skirt is to or just below the knee  The Spicy Sugar garments differ in two respects only  Style    SS is in a black  sunflower  on white background fabric  with a black satin ribbon waist tie  Style  SS is all black  with a red satin ribbon waist tie   Review alleges  and New Cover Maco denies  that New Cover Maco made  imported and sold the Spicy Sugar garments  The respondents  position was that New Cover Maco imported and sold women s clothing  As noted in Redberry   the question whether New Cover Maco made Spicy Sugar garments  as opposed to importing and selling them  does not affect the outcome of Review s principal allegation that New Cover Maco has infringed the Review Design  It affects the discussion of s   of the Designs Act  below   The Spicy Sugar garments will infringe the Review Design if they embody a design that is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design  compare the Designs Act  s  a   In determining whether a design is substantially similar in overall impression to a registered design  the factors in s   fall for consideration  see s    Section   provides        If a person is required by this Act to decide whether a design is substantially similar in overall impression to another design  the person making the decision is to give more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them       The person must also             a  have regard to the state of development of the prior art base for the design  and   b  if the design application in which the design was disclosed included a statement  a statement of newness and distinctiveness  identifying particular visual features of the design as new and distinctive   i  have particular regard to those features  and      ii  if those features relate to only part of the design have particular regard to that part of the design  but in the context of the design as a whole  and        c  if only part of the design is substantially similar to another design  have regard to the amount  quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole  and   d  have regard to the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate              If the design application in which the design was disclosed did not include a statement of newness and distinctiveness in respect of particular visual features of the design  the person must have regard to the appearance of the design as a whole     In applying subsections     and   the person must apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates  or products similar to the product to which the design relates  the standard of the informed user      In this section  a reference to a person includes a reference to a court     Since there was no statement of newness and distinctiveness in the Review Design application  s   of the Designs Act applies  In considering whether a design embodied in the Spicy Sugar garments is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design  the Court is therefore obliged to consider the appearance of the Review Design as a whole  considered by reference to the standard of the informed user   I refer to my discussion of the standard of the informed user in Redberry   As stated in Redberry   the informed user must be a person who is familiar with the product to which the design in question relates  The informed user must also be a user of the class of product in question  in this case  ladies  garments  or perhaps  more narrowly  ladies  dresses  A designer or manufacturer of such garments is not an informed user merely because he or she designs or manufactures them  Further  this user is not simply an ordinary consumer  the user must be an informed user   As also noted in Redberry   the Australian Law Reform Commission s Report No     Designs  Sydney     ALRC Report No   and the Designs Act which implemented it  see Explanatory Memorandum to the Designs Bill   at   borrowed the concept of the informed user from the European Community design law  see ALRC Report No   at               and      ALRC Report No   at     described the informed user as  a person who is reasonably familiar with the nature  appearance and use of products of the relevant kind   I refer to but do not repeat the other parts of the Report s discussion of the informed user standard  which are set out in Redberry   see ALRC Report No   at             and       Since the informed user standard has been adopted by the Registered Designs Act    UK  the explanation of the standard by courts in the UK provides some guidance  In Redberry   I referred to the exposition of the informed user standard in Woodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems   RPC     Architectural Lighting    In this case  his Honour Judge Fysh QC  at   defined the concept of an informed user as follows  First  this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design and I would think  a regular user at that  He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say  through use at work  The quality smacks of practical considerations  In my view the informed user is first  a person to whom the design is directed  Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of  the man in the street    Informed  to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer  it imports the notion of  what s about in the market  and  what has been about in the recent past   I do not think it requires an archival mind  or eye  or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations  if any   In connection with the latter  one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things  as Mr Davis reminded me  these are not petty patents  Therefore  focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology  if any   I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the  man skilled in the art  whose  nerd like   and other  attributes seem too technical  Technip France SA s Patent   EWCA Civ       R P C    at      CA    Emphasis original    The properly informed eye of the court must make its decision as a matter of degree as a matter of overall impression  see Architectural Lighting at     As noted in Redberry   in Proctor   Gamble Co v Reckitt Benckiser  UK  Ltd   EWHC       FSR     Proctor   Gamble Co v Reckitt Benckiser   at   et seq  where Lewison J  Chancery Division Patents Court  considered and approved the Architectural Lighting observations  as did the Court of Appeal  see Proctor   Gamble Company v Reckitt Benckiser  UK  Ltd   EWCACIV         IPR     Proctor   Gamble   at       per Jacob LJ  with whom May and Dyson LJJ agreed  Jacob LJ noted  at    the informed user is alert to design issues and is better informed than the average consumer in trade mark law    As also noted in Redberry   in January   the Design Registrar of the UK Intellectual Property Office had cited and applied the Architectural Lighting  informed user  analysis in ruling on the validity of a clothing design registration  see Application by Pauline Ann Walton to invalidate UK Registered Design in the name of Zap Ltd  UK IPO          January     Walton     As noted in Redberry   the Australian Designs Office  ADO  considered the informed user standard in Re Application in the name of Apple Computer Inc     IPR     Apple   and Icon Plastics Pty Ltd   ADO     July     Icon   see Icon at     and Apple at      I refer to  but do not repeat  the more detailed discussion of Apple and Icon in Redberry    As noted in Redberry   there may be a difference in the discussion to date as to what is needed to have the requisite product familiarity  On one view  this familiarity is greater than the information possessed by the average user  on another view  this familiarity is that which is possessed by the ordinary user  compare Architectural Lighting at   with Apple at    I indicated in Redberry   for the reasons stated there  that I preferred the former approach  I doubt that  generally  the ordinary user will be appropriately regarded as an informed user   Review s claim that the Spicy Sugar garments  see PS   and PS   to the affidavit of Peter Strain of   September   are substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design should be upheld  In reaching this conclusion  I have had regard to the evidence of Ms Ellis  particularly that referred to in Redberry at      As noted in Redberry   as a designer rather than an informed user  Ms Ellis s evidence assists in identifying the basis of Review s claim on infringement and  to a limited extent  the similarities and differences between the Review Design and the design embodied in each of the Spicy Sugar garments although  in this case especially  a great deal is self evident  For present purposes  however  I disregard her evidence about points of construction and interior similarities and differences as not relevant to the issue of infringement   In this connection too  I have also had regard to the evidence of Ms Ella Mudie  since this was  pursuant to order  also to be treated as evidence in this proceeding  see Redberry at      As stated in Redberry   Ms Mudie was in the nature of an informed user and was a careful and truthful witness  As explained in Redberry   I found her evidence helpful  notwithstanding the criticisms leveled at it by the applicants in that case  Although some of Ms Mudie s evidence was specifically directed to an analysis of the Redberry garment as compared with the Review Design  and this is plainly not relevant here  other parts of her evidence assist in placing the Court in the shoes of the informed user  Thus  Ms Mudie s evidence was that  from her perspective  the overall appearance of a dress was principally determined by style  cut  fit  colour print  and materials  This led Ms Mudie to identify two distinct differences between the Review Dress  and indirectly the design that it embodied  and Redberry dress  being their skirts  and the patterns and colours  Of course  as I stated in Redberry   the Court does not simply adopt Ms Mudie s assessment as its own  but makes its own objective determination  The Court must  of course  make the same sort of assessment in this case   Considered by reference to the standard of the informed user  in deciding whether the design embodied in each of the Spicy Sugar garments is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design  the Court must    give more weight to similarities between the designs in question than to differences  s     have regard to the state of development of the prior art base for the Review Design  s  a  and   have regard to the freedom of the designer to innovate  s  d   There are  plainly enough  differences between the patterns as depicted in the design as compared with the two styles of the Spicy Sugar garments  Hence  only part of the design embodied in each style of the Spicy Sugar garments is substantially similar to the Review Design  with the consequence that the Court must have regard to the amount  quality and importance of that part in the context of the design considered as a whole  s  c   Furthermore  since the design application for the Review Design did not include a statement of newness and distinctiveness  the Court must have regard to the appearance of the Review Design as a whole  s     The similarities between the Review Design and the design embodied in each of the two styles of the Spicy Sugar garments are self evident  The cross over bodice and V neck is identical  or virtually identical  All have a fixed waist  with a satin ribbon tie  All have the same high back  In this case too  the Review Design skirt and the skirts in the designs embodied in the Spicy Sugar garments are identical  or virtually so  The Review Design and the designs embodied in the Spicy Sugar garments differ only as to pattern  including colour    Similarities between the designs are to be given greater weight than the differences  s    As noted in Redberry   however  in deciding whether the design embodied in each style of the Spicy Sugar garments is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design  the Court must also have regard to the prior art base  considered by reference to the standard of the informed user  That is  the significance of the similarities and differences between designs falls to be considered in light of the prior art  as discussed in Redberry   In that case  I concluded that  having regard to the prior art and the freedom of the designer to innovate  what gave the Review Design its different overall impression from the prior art  from the perspective of the informed user  was the shape and configuration of the skirt  combined with differences in pattern and ornamentation   Redberry stated that this conclusion was significant for the question of infringement  more particularly as the Court  by reference to the informed user standard  reaches its conclusion on infringement having regard to the amount  quality and importance of that part of the challenged design that is substantially similar to the Review Design in the context of the Review Design as a whole  As noted above  in this case in contrast to Redberry   save for the pattern  and colour  each of the styles of the Spicy Sugar garments embodies a design that is substantially similar  if not identical  to the Review Design  In this case  having regard to the directions in ss    a   c  and  d    and   the informed user would conclude that the design embodied in each style of the Spicy Sugar garments is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design considered as a whole  principally because of the identity in the shape  configuration and ornamentation  Whilst  for the reasons explained in Redberry   differences in pattern  including colour  cannot be ignored  having regard to the statutory directions  these differences are insufficient in this case to create a different overall impression  Review s case on infringement therefore succeeds   As I said in Redberry   the fact that a design is registered in colour through the use of colour photographs  unaccompanied by a statement of newness and distinctiveness  is relevant to determining the extent of the monopoly sought and given  Everything that is shown in the registered design  unless disclaimed in some way  forms part of the subject matter protected by registration  The pattern  including colour  that is shown on the Review Design as registered is thus part of what is protected  and is to be accorded some weight  In this regard  I refer to my discussion in Redberry at      How much weight is to be given to pattern  and colour  will depend on the nature of the product and the relative importance of the different visual features of the registered design  as viewed by the informed user standard  having regard to the prior art  and the freedom of the designer to innovate  If colour is important  it will be so because the factors relevant to the registered design lead to this conclusion  As indicated in Redberry   pattern  including colour  is a feature that an informed user would consider important in creating the overall impression of the Review Design  a conclusion borne out by the use of colour photographs to depict the design in the registration application  In the case of the two styles of the Spicy Sugar garments  however  the differences as regards this feature are overborne by the identity of other visual features  with the result that the design embodied in each style is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design   For the reasons stated in Redberry at     I reject the proposition advanced by New Cover Maco that the Review Design was invalidly registered because it was not new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base as it existed before the priority date of the Design   In Review s Outline of Submissions dated   February   Review sought   a  general damages for loss of profits in the sum of      b  general damages for damage to reputation of   and  c  additional damages of     Damages or an account of profits may  at the plaintiff s option  be granted for infringement  see s  b  of the Designs Act  Subsections   to   further provide        The court may refuse to award damages  reduce the damages that would otherwise be awarded  or refuse to make an order for an account of profits  if the defendant satisfies the court   a  in the case of primary infringement             i  that at the time of the infringement  the defendant was not aware that the design was registered  and   ii  that before that time  the defendant had taken all reasonable steps to ascertain whether the design was registered  or              b  in the case of secondary infringement that at the time of the infringement  the defendant was not aware  and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware  that the design was registered              The court may award such additional damages as it considers appropriate  having regard to the flagrancy of the infringement and all other relevant matters     It is prima facie evidence that the defendant was aware that the design was registered if the product embodying the registered design to which the infringement proceedings relate  or the packaging of the product  is marked so as to indicate registration of the design     In this section  primary infringement means infringement of a kind mentioned in paragraph  a    secondary infringement means infringement of a kind mentioned in paragraph  b   c   d  or  e    Review claimed general damages in an amount of     upon the basis of lost sales  As in Redberry   Review invited the Court to calculate general damages on the assumption that every sale by New Cover Maco should be treated as if it had been a sale by Review of the Review Dress  and on the assumption that New Cover Maco sold all   imported Spicy Sugar garments in style    SS   If the Court were to assess damages on this simple assumption  then the ultimate figure would need to be discounted to reflect the likelihood that Review would have made the additional sales had the New Cover Maco garments not entered the market  Mr Meng and Ms Dolcel said that New Cover Maco sold garments to  boutique fashion shop buyers  and  exclusive development customers   That is  New Cover Maco made wholesale sales to retailers in probable competition with Review  Mr Meng also said that New Cover Maco customers made retail sales at  a mark up of anything between   to   on top of a garments wholesale price   If this were true  then the Spicy Sugar garments sold at substantially less than the Review Dress  In weighing this latter statement  I bear in mind that Mr Meng failed to attend for cross examination  The result is that I find that the likelihood of a retailer buying the New Cover Maco garments and the garments being purchased by a retail customer instead of the Review Dress  if available  see below  relatively high  If I assessed damages on the assumption that Review invited me to make  I would discount the figure of     by about   to reflect this  resulting in the amount of       As it happens  however  Review s analysis does not withstand scrutiny  This is because there is no evidence of lost sales  Review fails to establish any lost opportunity for sale  As stated in Redberry at   there is evidence of sales of the Review Dress in August   but  whilst there is evidence of repeats of the garment being made and presumably sold  there is no evidence that the Review Dress was on sale a year later  when New Cover Maco imported the Spicy Sugar garments from China  There is  therefore  simply no evidence that sales by Review   and or Review were in any way adversely affected by the availability of the Spicy Sugar garments  The assumptions that Review invites the Court to make cannot overcome the fundamental difficulty that there is no evidence that  at the relevant time  the Review Dress was available for retail sale to customers  Furthermore  since Review did not acquire the business of Review   until February   it might be thought that  as at August   Review could not in any event have suffered any lost opportunity for sale   For present purposes  I accept that the public was unable to view representations of the Review Design on the Australian Designs Data Searching facility prior to   July   see Redberry at    For present purposes  I also accept that  as Mr Meng deposed  no one at New Cover Maco knew that the Review Design had been registered until so advised by Review s solicitors  The infringing Spicy Sugar garments in style    SS were imported into Australia over a month later and presumably sold afterwards  As noted earlier  both this style and style  SS were being sold by New Cover Maco on   September   when an employee of Review purchased both styles of the Spicy Sugar garments  I reject the proposition that New Cover Maco could not reasonably have been expected to have been aware that the Review Design was registered  given the lack of any evidence from New Cover Maco to the contrary and the passage of time following the posting of the Review Design on the data searching facility  In these circumstances  New Cover Maco failed to establish that they could not reasonably have been expected to be aware that the Review Design was registered  as required by s  b  of the Designs Act   If  contrary to the conclusion stated here  they were to be regarded as primary infringers  they could not satisfy s  a  because there is no evidence that  before the time of the infringement  they took any steps  let alone any reasonable steps  to ascertain whether the design was registered   Review also sought additional damages under s   of the Designs Act  which permits the Court to award such additional damages as it considers appropriate  having regard to the flagrancy of the infringement and all other relevant matters  Additional damages are not therefore confined to cases of flagrancy   I am not satisfied that the infringement was flagrant  In the circumstances discussed above  I am inclined to accept that  at the time of the infringement  no one at New Cover Maco knew that the Review Design was a registered design  Further  for the reasons stated in Redberry at   I reject the applicants  submission that a swing tag on the Review Dress provided notice to persons such as New Cover Maco that the Review Dress embodied a registered design and attracted s   of the Designs Act  New Cover Maco did not  therefore  deliberately infringe Review s design rights  see Microsoft Corporation v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd     IPR   at   per Branson J  Further  Review did not contest the claim made by New Cover Maco that they ceased their infringing conduct in October November   after becoming aware of Review s claim   Review s case on additional damages was similar to its case for additional damages in Redberry   It rested largely on  the closeness of copying  and allegations that it was the apparent business practice of New Cover Maco to engage in copying the garment designs of other designers  The similarity of the Spicy Sugar garments to the Review Design and the Review Dress that embodied it is self evident  The closeness of the similarity makes it more probable than not that someone on the  p reparation  styling and research  side of the respondents  business copied the design embodied in the Review Dress in order to make the Spicy Sugar garments  Ms Dolcel s explanation that the similarity was mere  coincidence  was unconvincing  Furthermore  Ms Dolcel s evidence was to the effect that New Cover Maco bought other designers  garments and incorporated aspects of them in their own garments  In response to the proposition that New Cover Maco did not originate designs but merely copied them  Ms Dolcel accepted that  t hat s what fashion is   On the basis of Ms Dolcel s evidence  I accept that New Cover Maco created garments by copying the designs of others  to a greater or lesser extent  depending on the garment in question  In the designs context  copying per se is not  however  unlawful and does not establish a design infringement  There is nothing relevantly reprehensible in this business practice providing it does not result in design infringement  Accordingly  copying alone does not attract additional damages  Copying resulting in design infringement can  of course  justify an award of general damages  but  in general  such copying must be flagrant to justify additional damages  I have found  however  that the copying in this case was not flagrant  see   above   Review also relied on the affidavit of Keith Richards of   January   which was filed shortly before the trial  Mr Richards  affidavit amounted to an allegation of copyright infringement against New Cover  based on the facts to which he deposed  Ultimately  for the reasons stated in Redberry   I would regard this evidence as irrelevant and  therefore  inadmissible  Furthermore  in contrast to Redberry   at best this evidence amounted to one instance of suspected copying  On its own  it could not amount to evidence of relevant propensity  and could not satisfy s   of the Evidence Act    Cth    Review also referred me to its infringement allegations with respect to registered design No    These allegations are the subject of the second part of this proceeding  At this stage  they can rise no higher than this   I would  however  award additional damages upon the following basis  The affidavit evidence of Mr Meng  together with the evidence of Ms Dolcel  established that the fashion business conducted by New Cover Maco was a substantial operation  Having regard to this evidence and to Mr Meng s failure to attend for cross examination  I give little weight in this connection to the proposition that New Cover Maco was unable to afford legal representation  Neither of Mr Meng s nor Ms Dolcel s statements in this regard was corroborated by any evidence  As noted above  New Cover Maco discovered no relevant documents concerning the manufacture  importation and sale of Spicy Sugar style  SS  This omission was not satisfactorily explained  I did not find Ms Dolcel s evidence in this regard credible  Further  Ms Dolcel s explanation about New Cover Maco s inadequate response to Review s notice to produce was also unsatisfactory and not credible  As already noted  Mr Meng did not attend Court in answer to a notice for cross examination followedWoodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems   RPC   Since the informed user standard has been adopted by the Registered Designs Act    UK  the explanation of the standard by courts in the UK provides some guidance  In Redberry   I referred to the exposition of the informed user standard in Woodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems   RPC     Architectural Lighting    In this case  his Honour Judge Fysh QC  at   defined the concept of an informed user as follows  First  this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design and I would think  a regular user at that  He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say  through use at work  The quality smacks of practical considerations  In my view the informed user is first  a person to whom the design is directed  Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of  the man in the street    Informed  to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer  it imports the notion of  what s about in the market  and  what has been about in the recent past   I do not think it requires an archival mind  or eye  or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations  if any   In connection with the latter  one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things  as Mr Davis reminded me  these are not petty patents  Therefore  focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology  if any   I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the  man skilled in the art  whose  nerd like   and other  attributes seem too

Meng and Ms Dolcel was that New Cover Maco prepared the companies  clothing range in Australia and carried out sampling  grading and manufacturing in China  after which they imported the garments into

Corporation v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd     IPR   I am not satisfied that the infringement was flagrant  In the circumstances discussed above  I am inclined to accept that  at the time of the infringement  no one at New Cover Maco knew that the Review Design was a registered design  Further  for the reasons stated in Redberry at   I reject the applicants  submission that a swing tag on the Review Dress provided notice to persons such as New Cover Maco that the Review Dress embodied a registered design and attracted s   of the Designs Act  New Cover Maco did not  therefore  deliberately infringe Review s design rights  see Microsoft Corporation v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd     IPR   at   per Branson J  Further  Review did not contest the claim made by New Cover Maco that they ceased their infringing conduct in October November   after becoming aware of Review s claim citedJones v Dunkel     CLR   New Cover Maco might also readily have given evidence as to the commercial benefit that they obtained in selling the infringing garments  but they did not choose to do so  In its absence  I assume that this evidence would not have advanced their case  see Jones v Dunkel

infringers are not encouraged to think that by ignoring court proceedings they can escape the consequences of     infringements of the rights of others in the pursuit of profits    In these
