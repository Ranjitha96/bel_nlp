Ainsworth v Hanrahan     NSWLR   at          The undertaking has been held to apply to witness statements and affidavits  Central Queensland Cement Pty Ltd v Hardy     Qd R     That conclusion is  with respect  a corollary of the proposition that a court will not release or modify the implied undertaking save in special circumstances and where the release or modification will not occasion injustice to the person providing the documents or information in question  see Crest Homes plc v Marks     AC   at   per Lord Oliver and the authorities referred to by Gzell J in Moage at    The conclusion referred to in   supra also informs the obligation of a party applying for a modification or release of the undertaking to specify the documents in respect of which the modification or release is sought  In Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Marshall Bell Hawkins Limited   FCA   at     Merkel J stated in this regard       The requirements of specificity in respect of the documents to be used and the purpose for which they are to be used is appropriate because the implied undertaking should only be modified or released to the extent that it is in the interests of the administration of justice or in the public interest to do so  see Springfield Nominees at   and Moage Ltd  in liq  v Jagelman     ACSR   at    Thus  the modification or release should be no greater than is necessary or appropriate to meet the interests of the administration of justice or the public interest  Further  in determining whether to exercise its discretion to grant the modification or release sought  it will usually be necessary for the Court to identify with precision the documents to be released and the purpose of that release  There are no other special circumstances  or at least none which have been identified  which would warrant a grant of leave  There are  however  other reasons which impel one to a conclusion as to why leave should not be granted           The documents  IAM  to  IAM  were produced in response to the compulsory processes of the Court  the maintenance of any implied undertaking is all the more stronger in such circumstances  Moage   supra  at   per Gzell J             The claim of public interest or policy    supra  is fully answered by what Santow J said in Wilson Marketing Research   supra  at    The public interest in bringing insolvent companies to winding up can be pursued by others  in particular  the Australian Securities Commission  see s  P f   and note also s  P  g                    The alternative remedies available to Mr Loughnan to recover his debt other than by recourse to a winding up of ThoughtWeb Systems cannot be ignored  In the circumstances  the motion must be dismissed  While it forms no part of the reasons underlying my conclusion on the issues raised by the motion  at the time of the hearing I formed the preliminary view that the motion was brought as a strategy which  if it succeeded by having ThoughtWeb Systems wound up  would enable Mr Loughnan to exert greater influence over the ultimate outcome of the mainstream proceedings by way of settlement  compromise or otherwise than he could possibly exert by recourse to the means otherwise available to him  Because I initially thought this might impact on my conclusion  I decided to put consideration of the motion to one side and revisit it at a later date  I have to say that this has not helped  I have not changed the preliminary view I formed at the time of the hearing although  as my conclusion in no way depends on this preliminary view  the delay it has occasioned is to be regretted    I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for

cth HCA  htmlIt is now well established that the release or modification of the implied undertaking will not be lightly given  In Esso Australia Resources Limited v Plowman   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J stated       That dispensing power is not freely exercised  but it will be exercised when special circumstances appear  In the Federal Court  special circumstances have been held to exist where  there is a special feature of the case which affords a reason for modifying or releasing the undertaking and  the feature  is not usually present   It is unnecessary to consider whether the dispensing power should be so broadly defined  It is relevant to note only that the obligation enforceable as an undertaking to the Court in the case of a curial order is not unqualified  referred toHalcon International Inc v Shell Transport   Trading Co     RPC  In Halcon International Inc v Shell Transport   Trading Co     RPC   Whitford J stated  at     that       However  these authorities to my mind  lead to this conclusion  that the use of a document disclosed in a proceeding in some other context  or even in another proceeding between the same parties in the same jurisdiction  is an abuse of process unless there are very strong grounds for making an exception to the general rule  It does  I think  emerge that some overriding public interest might be a good example  but not the mere furtherance of some private interest even where that private interest arises directly out of or is brought to light as a result of the discovery made  consideredMinister for Education v Bailey     WAR  These authorities were considered exhaustively by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Minister for Education v Bailey     WAR     WASCA    At     Steytler J  with whom Parker J concurred  stated       More recently  in Prudential Assurance Co Limited v Fountain Page Limited     WLR   at   Hobhouse J  while acknowledging that the Court has the power wholly or partially to release the recipient of discovered documents from the duty  or undertakings  and to permit use to be made of the documents  said that circumstances under which the relaxation would be allowed without the consent of the serving party were  hard to visualise  particularly where there was any risk that the statement might be used directly or indirectly to the prejudice of the serving party  subject to any overriding principle of public policy  Steytler J then turned to consider a number of Australian authorities  One of those was Holpitt Pty Limited v Varimu Pty Limited     FCR   where  at   Burchett J stated       As far as the expression  special circumstances  is concerned  it is an expression which is liable to be misunderstood unless care is taken to ask and answer the question  special in relation to what   Special  is one of those words which derive almost all their meaning from the context     if all that is required is that  among the great number of cases in the court in which documents have been discovered  this one must evince some special feature which affords a reason for releasing or modifying the undertaking  there will be no difficulty  Circumstances in which there is a legitimate reason why documents discovered in one proceeding should be made available in another will  viewed in this way  be rare  In the ordinary course  the ordinary rule should apply  there being no special circumstance to suggest otherwise  After reviewing that case and others  Steytler J stated at        It is against this background that the courts have concluded that the implied undertaking or obligation will only be waived or relaxed when special circumstances are present  While I would not  with great respect  have thought that circumstances of that kind would be quite so hard to visualise as Hobhouse J expressed them to be in Prudential Assurance   the fact remains that it will ordinarily be no easy matter to secure the court s indulgence  appliedSpringfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Limited     FCR  In Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Limited     FCR   Wilcox J explained what is meant by the term  special circumstances  in these terms  at        For  special circumstances  to exist it is enough that there is a special feature of the case which affords a reason for modifying or releasing the undertaking and is not usually present  The matter then becomes one of the proper exercise of the court s discretion  many factors being relevant  It is neither possible nor desirable to propound an exhaustive list of those factors  But plainly they include the nature of the document  the circumstances under which it came into existence  the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain  whether the document pre existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain  the nature of the information in the document  in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information  the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant for leave and  perhaps most important of all  the likely contribution of the document to achieving justice in the second proceeding  If that be right then his case that he needs the use of the documents for which leave is sought to prove that ThoughtWeb Systems is insolvent has a hollow ring about it  Even if that be wrong  I am not persuaded that the documents  in respect of which leave is sought to use in winding up proceedings against ThoughtWeb Systems  are likely to contribute to achieve justice in such proceedings       perhaps  the  most important of all  of the special circumstances to be considered  Wilcox J in Springfield Nominees   supra  at   referred toAustralian Securities and Investment Commission v Marshall Bell Hawkins Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe conclusion referred to in   supra also informs the obligation of a party applying for a modification or release of the undertaking to specify the documents in respect of which the modification or release is sought  In Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Marshall Bell Hawkins Limited   FCA   at     Merkel J stated in this regard       The requirements of

it is in the interests of the administration of justice or in the public interest to do so  see Springfield Nominees at   and Moage Ltd  in liq  v Jagelman     ACSR   at    Thus  the modification or

to grant the modification or release sought  it will usually be necessary for the Court to identify with precision the documents to be released and the purpose of that release  appliedWilson Market Research Pty Ltd and the Corporations Law  Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd v Wilson Market Research Pty Ltd     NSWLR  Thus it is submitted by counsel for ThoughtWeb Systems that Mr Loughnan has a threshold problem that even if he were granted leave to use the documents he seeks to rely on to prove the insolvency of ThoughtWeb Systems  the Court would be reluctant to hear the matter where there is a disputed debt involved  In this regard  I was referred to what was said by Santow J in Wilson Market Research Pty Ltd and the Corporations Law  Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd v Wilson Market Research Pty Ltd     NSWLR   first at   at            Section  P of the Corporations Law     provides that amongst those with standing to apply to have a company wound up are its creditors  even if they be prospective or contingent creditors  Indeed all the predecessors of s  P   here and in the United Kingdom  similarly so provided  This followed the recommendations to the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom Amendment Committee of   see at par below  By virtue of s  P   such an applicant is required to establish a debt  in order to have standing to bring the winding up proceedings  However  where there is a bona fide dispute of substance as to the existence of the debt  it cannot be said that the claimant is a creditor who has the right to bring proceedings  Thus Ungoed Thomas J said  in Mann v Goldstein     WLR   at     in a frequently quoted passage             I would prefer to rest the jurisdiction directly on the comparatively simple propositions that a creditor s petition can only be presented by a creditor  that the winding up jurisdiction is not for the purpose of deciding a disputed debt  that is  disputed on substantial and not insubstantial grounds  since  until a creditor is established as a creditor he is not entitled to present the petition and has no locus standi in the Companies Court  and that  therefore  to invoke the winding up jurisdiction when the debt is disputed  that is  on substantial grounds  or after it has become clear that it is so disputed is an abuse of process of the court      And then at   and   at          In CVC Investments Pty Ltd v P   T Aviation Pty Ltd     NSWLR   however  Cohen J came to a different conclusion  He did so in a case of some complexity  It appears that the winding up applications were made on the basis of presumed insolvency  However  the question of actual insolvency was also considered  at   and   though without concluding there was a situation of actual insolvency  Thus his statements of principle were not limited to a context where the only basis of the plaintiff s application was presumed insolvency  though actual insolvency was not found  His Honour concluded  at    agreeing with Smart J in Ron Pritchard Pty Ltd v Horwitz Grahame Pty Ltd     ACLC   that         The authorities seem almost unanimously to agree that where a claimed debt is bona fide disputed on substantial grounds and there is no basis for regarding the claimant as a contingent or prospective creditor then that claimant has no standing to bring proceedings to wind up the company  and if he does so the bringing of those proceedings is an abuse of process  The fact that there is a ground for winding up in existence does not give that claimant any greater standing         His Honour said  at   that he did not regard the decision of McPherson J in National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd v Oasis Developments   upon which Young J relied  as establishing that where there is a bona fide dispute as to the whole of the debt and this dispute is based on substantial grounds  then the petitioner can still proceed with the status of a creditor    Importantly  Cohen J goes on to say  at   that             if it is established that the petitioner or plaintiff has or would have no standing to obtain a winding up order then there is no justification for proceedings being commenced or continued  If the company is insolvent then it is a matter for a creditor  established as such  or one of the other persons designated under s   of the Code  to bring the matter to the court  It is necessary for the court to make a careful scrutiny of the evidence in order to establish the genuineness of the alleged dispute and the substance of the defence or cross claim  If there is a likelihood that the debt may be owing even in part then the question of the solvency of the company may become relevant in the consideration of the court s discretion                I prefer the view of Cohen J in CVC Investments  I therefore conclude that an applicant to wind up a company claiming standing as a creditor but who fails to establish that standing  thereby commits an abuse of process of the court  which is not avoided by demonstrating that the company is actually insolvent  The court only has to consider the question of solvency after the initial threshold of standing has been passed  Before that  it is irrelevant    Both in later considering the threshold of standing  and in presently making that choice between conflicting authorities  a powerful factor remains the importance of not giving the trigger for the potentially fatal step of winding up to someone who is unable with sufficient certainty to establish that status of a creditor  As illustrated here  the mere application to wind up can have devastating commercial consequences  reinforcing the need for not making an exception for general insolvency without warrant from the words of the statute  There is the ever present danger of an unqualified claimant using the winding up procedure as a threat to force concessions from the company concerning a claimed debt  Such a result is quite contrary to the fundamental basis of bankruptcy legislation  This basis denies preference to one creditor over another  a fortiori where the first may not have that status of creditor in reality  The public interest in bringing insolvent companies to winding up can be pursued by others  in particular the Australian Securities Commission  see s  P l f   and note also s  P g   The legislature s proper concern with premature triggering is reinforced by the fact that where a contingent or prospective creditor applies  as compared to an ordinary creditor  the application requires leave of the court and that in turn requires a prima facie case of insolvency  s  P  and    On the evidence before me  I am not satisfied that Mr Loughnan has standing as a creditor of ThoughtWeb Systems sufficient to bring proceedings to wind it up or  if he does have such standing  that that standing would survive disputation on the part of ThoughtWeb Systems
