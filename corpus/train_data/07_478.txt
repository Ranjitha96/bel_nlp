Hume Computers Pty Ltd ACN       v Exact International BV   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBallas v Theophilos  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Applying this approach  in my opinion the letter conveyed clearly and unequivocally that the Distributorship Agreement is to terminate with effect on and from   March    If authority is needed for this proposition  it may be found in Ballas v Theophilos  No     HCA         CLR   at     see also Young v Lamb at   citedCIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas     It is also to be considered in light of the plain fact that Home Wilkinson Lowry are acting as solicitors for the Hume companies in the present proceedings  notwithstanding that no costs agreement has been produced relating to any such retainer  Thus it may be thought that the solicitors would have authority to deal with all issues which reasonably arise in the pursuit of the proceedings  CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas     at    Kirby P    The observations of Kirby P in CIC Insurance were directed toward ostensible authority  However  here  particularly in light of Mr Leathem s affidavit and the failure to produce a current written retainer  I would infer the existence of actual authority   That termination of the Distributorship under Article   was part of the subject matter of the proceedings may be seen from my remarks in   of my earlier judgment citedCommercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd     NSWLR   In addition  I can be more comfortable in drawing an inference that the solicitors had actual authority by the failure of the Hume companies to call evidence  I am entitled to infer that the testimony would not have been favourable to Hume s case  Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at      Handley JA    The only other submission which I need to address under this subheading is not concerned with the question of authority  It is whether the email of   December   attaching a copy of the letter of the same date  constituted written notice   Counsel for Hume submitted it did not because an email is an electronic representation of writing and therefore does not constitute writing itself as required by Article    I reject that submission citedDTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my view neither of these statements constituted a repudiation because they do not evince an intention not to comply with the contract as correctly interpreted  DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      Stephen  Mason   Jacobs JJ    In my opinion there is no warrant for the imposition of a condition that Exact pay the compensation required by Article     In my earlier judgment at   I said that the meaning of Article  a  is not entirely clear  although it plainly enough entitles Hume to substantial compensation on termination of the Distributorship Agreement citedFinishing Services Pty Ltd v Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au

agreement the law favours a  commercially sensible construction   It is hostile to technical interpretations and undue emphasis on niceties of language  see also Finishing Services Pty Ltd v Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at    Kiefel  Sundberg   Edmonds JJ  citedIVI Pty Ltd v Baycrown Pty Ltd   QCA  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QCA  html  It is true  as counsel for Hume submitted  that in general a solicitor does not have implied or ostensible authority to accept contractual notices on behalf of a client  particularly where that amounts to the exercise of a substantive right  see IVI Pty Ltd v Baycrown Pty Ltd   QCA   at   and   see especially the helpful review of the authorities by Keane JA at       However  I do not need to consider the questions of implied or ostensible authority because in my opinion Messrs Home Wilkinson Lowry had actual authority to receive the notice   This is to be inferred from two pieces of evidence  First  on   January   Home Wilkinson Lowry wrote to Exact Software Australia  The letter stated     We shall be dealing with matters arising under the Distributorship Agreement directly with Exact on behalf of our client  referred toMannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd   UKHL       AC   In Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd   UKHL       AC   at   Lord Steyn observed that in determining the meaning of the language of a commercial agreement the law favours a  commercially sensible construction   It is hostile to technical interpretations and undue emphasis on niceties of language  see also Finishing Services Pty Ltd v Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at    Kiefel  Sundberg   Edmonds JJ  citedMcGuren v Simpson   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The requirement of written notice is to be construed in light of the fact that this is a commercial agreement made between two companies engaged in the computer software business  I would be blinding myself to commercial and technological realities to find that an email communication in the present circumstances was not written notice  McGuren v Simpson   NSWSC   at       There was no suggestion that the email was not received   Hume submitted that the letter of   December   was ineffective to terminate the Distributorship Agreement because it did not convey an unequivocal election  This submission focussed upon the use of the words  intention to terminate   This was said to amount to an indication of an intention to send a further notice  at a future date  actually terminating the agreement referred toTownsend Carriers Ltd v Pzifer Ltd     Prop   Comp R   I should add that it is unnecessary for such a notice to disclose the agency  Townsend Carriers at    In any event  the letter of   December   stated that the solicitors acted for Exact and that  our client  notifies its intention to terminate   For reasons stated under Issue   Article   did not preclude the giving of notice to an agent  provided of course that the agent had authority to receive it   The same principles of agency apply to the giving and receipt of a notice  Megarry VC said in Townsend Carriers at   that he did not  think that the principle it is more blessed to give than to receive is part of the law of landlord and tenant   Nor in my opinion is it part of the principles that apply to the exercise of a contractual power of termination of a commercial contract   Before turning to the principles of agency  it is necessary to deal with the circumstances in which the letter was physically delivered to Hume s solicitors   I am satisfied by the evidence of Ms Naylor  a paralegal employed by Bakers  that she delivered the letter to the offices of the Hume companies  solicitors  Messrs Home Wilkinson Lowry  shortly before noon on   December    I am also satisfied that the receptionist accepted service even though the solicitor on the record  Mr Webeck  was not in the office  The affidavit of Ms Cameron does not establish the contrary position citedYoung v Lamb     BPR   Townsend Carriers Ltd v Pfizer Ltd       Prop   Comp R   is authority for the proposition that where an agreement does not preclude the giving of notice by an agent  the notice can be given by the agent in its own name  at   per Megarry VC  See also Young v Lamb     BPR   at     per Stein JA  Mason P   Hodgson JA agreeing    Counsel for Hume sought to advance an argument that the right of  either party  to terminate under Article   precluded notice by an agent  This submission was based upon the distinction drawn in Article   between  the Distributor  and its  employees  agents and advisors    However  in my opinion  Article   must be read in its own context  It provides for the obligations of confidentiality contained in Article   to apply to Hume s agents  Its basis may be thought to be that Hume may not have absolute control of an agent s use of confidential information   Applying this approach  in my opinion the letter conveyed clearly and unequivocally that the Distributorship Agreement is to terminate with effect on and from   March    If authority is needed for this proposition  it may be found in Ballas v Theophilos  No     HCA         CLR   at     see also Young v Lamb at
