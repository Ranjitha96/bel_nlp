they are not particularised and the appellant did not advance any before me  I am satisfied that the Tribunal fully considered the appellant s claims and the material before it  I find that they are without merit  As to bias the applicant has not met the requirement that such an allegation be firmly and distinctly made and clearly proved  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Le Geng     HCA       CLR    No jurisdictional error has been made out   In the fourth ground the appellant alleges that the Tribunal s decision was not based on rational and logical foundation  The Federal Magistrate correctly found that the Tribunal s decision was based on the paucity of detail and information  such that the Tribunal was unable to be satisfied that the appellant has a well founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention  This ground is not made out   Lastly  the appellant contends that the Federal Magistrate did not fully consider the information provided  Again no particulars are provided  A reading of his Honour s reasons dispels such a ground  The appellant appeared before the Court assisted by an interpreter in the Mandarin language  He was invited to make oral submissions and did so speaking from a prepared document  These submissions were but a repetition  without particulars  of the grounds of appeal  There is nothing in the
