CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This application was filed on   April   pursuant to s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth   the Judiciary Act    The applicant seeks a declaration that the assessment was not properly made by the respondent  It also seeks orders prohibiting the respondent from enforcing the assessment or the penalty assessment  In essence  the applicant claims that the assessment was made in bad faith and for an improper or ulterior purpose  so that in reality there is no assessment at all of its taxation liability in respect of that financial year  cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     By motion of   April   the respondent seeks to have the application summarily dismissed on the grounds that it is clearly untenable and that it amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court  Alternatively  the respondent seeks that the statement of claim be struck out as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action   On   August   the respondent issued to the applicant a statutory demand  the first statutory demand  pursuant to s  E of the Corporations Act    Cth   the Corporations Act   in respect of the monies owing under the assessment and the penalty assessment  then totalling    the assessed amount plus interest   That prompted the applicant  on   September   to apply to the Supreme Court of South Australia to set aside the first statutory demand pursuant to s  G of the Corporations Act   That matter was heard on   November    Judgment was reserved  Late in the day of   November   the applicant filed an application in this Court also pursuant to s  B of the Judiciary Act seeking that the notice of assessment and the penalty assessment be declared invalid and quashed  matter SAD   of    In the Supreme Court proceedings  on   January   Judge Withers set aside the first statutory demand because the proceedings in this Court demonstrated a genuine dispute in relation to the debt  His Honour said at   of his reasons    The plaintiff filed its summons in the Federal Court challenging the Deputy Commissioner s assessment late on the day before the hearing of this matter  The defendant was not aware of this prior to argument  But for the filing of that summons the plaintiff s application would have been dismissed   In the meantime  on   January   the respondent applied by motion in the Federal Court proceedings  matter SAD   of   to strike out the application  It contended that  on the statement of claim  the application could not possibly succeed  On   February   Finn J dismissed the application with costs  The transcript of the hearing of that day reveals that the matter was dismissed because there was no defence mounted to the motion to have the application struck out   Then round two began appliedHaritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   March   Haritopoulos Pty Ltd also issued proceedings under s  B of the Judiciary Act in this Court  matter SAD   of   against the respondent for orders that certain notices of assessment of income tax against it were invalid as not having been made in good faith and having been made for an improper purpose  In particular  Haritopoulos challenged the validity of an assessment issued on   November   in respect of the financial year ended   June   by which Haritopoulos was assessed for income tax liability at    plus certain other amounts to which I do not need to refer  and the validity of an assessment issued on   November   imposing a penalty assessment of    On   May   the respondent applied to summarily dismiss that application  The motion was heard on   August    Judgment was given on   March    Justice Besanko found that  on the material before the Court  Haritopoulos had no arguable case that the assessment challenged was made in bad faith and entered summary judgment dismissing the proceeding in its entirety  Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     In each of the proceedings heard by Finn J and Besanko J  the nature of the allegations is very similar to those now asserted in the statement of claim filed on behalf of the applicant in this matter   Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that  unless the applicant is given leave to amend its statement of claim to add what is called a new issue  and to rely on an affidavit of Pantelis Charitopoulos sworn on   May   in opposition to the motion  the Court would on the motion make an order dismissing the application because the issues raised on the present statement of claim are in essence the same as those already addressed   Taking facts alleged in the present statement of claim at their highest  the issues which might point to invalidity of the assessment and of the penalty assessment are the same as those which Besanko J addressed in Haritopoulos   FCA    They are a failure to provide particulars of the assessment and of the penalty assessment  secondly  the issue of the assessment on   September   when  a few weeks earlier  an officer of the respondent had anticipated that it would take six to eight weeks for a default assessment to issue  thirdly  the fact that the penalty assessment was issued so close in time to the assessment  and finally  the failure to consider the package of information provided on   November   before making the assessment  although it is clear that there was no undertaking given to consider that material before making the assessment  and in fact it was made plain on   October   and in the letter of   November   that a default assessment would issue notwithstanding the provision of that further information    I agree with Besanko J  for the reasons his Honour gave  that on those allegations no arguable case of bad faith on the part of the respondent in making the assessment or the penalty assessment could be made out  As so much has been acknowledged by counsel for the applicant  I do not need to repeat those reasons  Furthermore  although it has not been expressly stated in this application  I note that Besanko J also rejected the further contention that arguably there had been a breach of s   of the   Act and in any event his Honour found it beyond argument that s   meant that any such breach would not affect the validity of the assessment  His Honour also noted  as appears also to be the case here  that the claim based upon a want of procedural fairness had not been pursued before him  and in any event it was unarguable as ss   and   would operate so as not to affect the validity of the assessment even if there had been a want of procedural fairness to which the applicant was entitled  In the light of those provisions  Besanko J concluded  and I agree  that the applicant was bound to confine its challenge  as distinct from any challenge to the amount of the assessment under Pt IVC of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  to the  Hickman grounds    R v Hickman  Ex parte Fox and Clinton   HCA         CLR   per Dixon J at   relevantly that the assessment was not made in good faith citedR v

html  In those circumstances  assuming the Deed had not by then been entered into  it was not inappropriate for the respondent to endeavour to fix an amount in accordance with s   of the Act as the assessable income of Haritopoulos  Its decision to do so when it did  to protect or better secure its legal position  does not impugn the bona fides of the exercise of the power  Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   at    Nor could the timing of the decision  or the reason for the timing of the decision  inform the manner in which the power under s   has exercised in the particular circumstances   The position of the applicant is even more remote from the proposed Deed of Company Arrangement  There is nothing in that document to suggest that its position  or the position of the respondent in relation to the applicant  could have been affected in any way by it  The applicant is not mentioned in it  The only basis upon which counsel for the applicant sought to attribute the paragraph of the Reasons for Decision referred to in the proposed amended statement of claim to the issue of the assessment against the applicant was by use of the plural  assessments  in the passage that has been quoted  There is no reason to do so  The plural is readily explained by reference to the fact of the primary assessment under s   and then the penalty assessment made against Haritopoulos  In the context of that passage in those Reasons  there is no basis upon which the use of that plural expression could be taken to be referring to the applicant citedRe Mendonca  Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation     FLR   It is also clear  for the reasons already expressed  that the particular paragraph of those Reasons for Decision could not have affected the respondent forming the view in terms of s  b  of the   Act of not being satisfied with the return furnished by the applicant for the financial year ended   June   or the assessment of the amount on which income tax ought to be levied  It is apparent on the material that the respondent had formed the view that a default assessment should be made in respect of the applicant s taxation liability for the financial years ended   June   at least by   October    The default assessment crystallised the liability of the applicant to pay income tax and determine its extent  Re Mendonca  Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation     FLR   at      It
