Johnson   Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited  No     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAstrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR     It is appropriate to consider each advertisement  as viewed by a consumer  in its entirety  taking account of content and presentation and also the circumstances in which it was published   Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v Glaxosmithkline Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR     at    The message conveyed by the advertisements is for the Court to determine   Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR       The significance of an elucidator in similar terms was considered by the Full Court in Astrazeneca   In that case  the GOAL study referred to in the advertisements was said to be based on observations of clinical tests undertaken with     patients with uncontrolled asthma   and no more  at    The elucidator represented that  in that study    of patents achieved  total control  of asthma symptoms and   achieved  well controlled  asthma for periods of   out of   weeks over the   month study by using the promoted product   Seretide Total Control   at    The elucidator  in those specific advertisements  did not allow inferences to be drawn by the reader that all  virtually all  or even a majority of asthma patients  would achieve total control of asthma symptoms by using Seretide  at     In considering the advertisements then before it  the Full Court recognised that the significance of footnotes to which a consumer s attention is drawn depends on the material in question and the surrounding circumstances in each individual case  at    This is not limited to questions of format   In the present case  I am of the view that the invitation to generalise is stronger and more comprehensive than in the advertisements considered in Astrazeneca   It is clear from the Summer Glow advertisements as a whole that the message conveyed was that  as a generalisation and supported by the  use test    out of    Holiday Skin users  preferred Summer Glow  The message conveyed is that the study supported the generalisation and that  as a properly conducted and representative test  the preference of those women should be extrapolated to the population of Holiday Skin users  It cannot be said that if  for example  the   women had been carefully chosen from a population of Dove aficionados who had once used Holiday Skin  the representation was other than misleading  It follows that if the results or methodology of the study do not support the generalisation sought to be drawn  the fact that the surveyed population expressed the stated preference does not prevent the advertisements from being misleading   Johnson contends that the advertisements emphasise the tanning aspect of the products and that the user preference claim relates directly to the tanning attributes of the products  that is  that   out of   Holiday Skin users preferred Summer Glow because it gives a better tanning effect  It submits that the  heart of the ads  is the reference to  the best summer tan  emphasised in the television advertisement by the exhortation to   think again    Johnson submits that Unilever intended to communicate superiority in terms of performance attributes and  in particular  that the television advertisement stresses tanning rather than moisturising or other attributes such as fragrance  Johnson makes these submissions with an eye to what it says is a disconformity between the study  which relevantly measured   out of   as a general preference  and the advertisements  which communicate performance superiority as to tanning    Unilever contends that the competing products are sold as body lotions with a tanning component  The products are sold in the  moisturiser  section of the supermarkets  rather than among self tanning or sunscreen products  where they are marketed as moisturisers that give a tan rather than as tanning agents  Unilever submits that the emphasis in the television advertisement is on the body lotion and the moisturising capacity of the body lotion that  additionally  provides for tanning  that is  a moisturiser with a hint of tanning where use will moisturise the skin and build a gentle tan   In order to determine whether there has been a contravention of s   of the Act    it is necessary to determine whether or not the conduct complained of amounted to a representation which has or would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct   has been directed     Astrazeneca at     Where the persons to whom the conducted is directed are not identified individuals  but members of a class to which the conduct is directed in a general sense  it is necessary to isolate a representative member of that class   Campomar at    The question then is whether a misconception is likely to arise on the part of that representative consumer from the conduct alleged   Campomar at   Astrazeneca at    For there to be a contravention of s     the ordinary or reasonable representee must be shown to labour under some erroneous assumption   Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Campomar at    The question is whether any misconceptions or deceptions alleged to arise from the advertisements are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the class of the public towards whom the conduct has been directed   Campomar at     Astrazeneca at     The distinction between the advertisements in this case and those in Astrazeneca illustrates why Johnson s criticism of the age of the population tested is made out  The appellant in Astrazeneca complained that patients with significant concomitant diseases  smokers and children under   years of age had been excluded from the study of     patients with uncontrolled asthma   upon which the advertisements were based  This was said to give rise to a misrepresentation that the results of the GOAL study would likely be achieved in clinical practice  No mention was made in the advertisements of the fact that the GOAL study did not include those patients  However  no contravention of s   of the Act arose because   none of the flyers or advertisements represented that the GOAL Study patients were representative of the asthma suffering members of the community at large    at     Unilever chose to exclude certain women of certain ages from the study and now submits that age is not relevant to the outcome  Johnson has not established that the exclusion of women under   in fact biased the results but does not need to do so  Women of a variety of age groups  including those who appear to be in the under   age group  are portrayed in the television advertisement  The print advertisement invites  every woman  regardless of age  to use Summer Glow  The assertion of preference is thereby represented to be over the class of all women  or at least women over a range of ages that clearly includes under  s   The advertisements should be considered  in their totality  as directed to women without age restriction  The context of the advertisements was that a new market had been established  Previously  there was a market in tanning agents  moisturisers and sunscreens  Johnson established a new market in moisturisers that had a tanning effect  Unilever wished to enter that market and to take customers from Johnson as well as to expand the market  Unilever s existing market for its Dove products was  I infer from Mr Kibble s evidence absent Unilever submitting to the contrary  largely in the age group of   to   year old women  Johnson s market was particularly significant in the under   year old age group  The representation asserts a preference for Summer Glow by Holiday Skin users  However  the population surveyed excluded a substantial proportion of those users in circumstances where Unilever was  at least in part  targeting Johnson s market in which the under  s were a substantial class  Where the conclusion drawn from the study should have been based on the Johnson user cohort  it was based on the Dove user cohort citedBateman v Slatyer     ALR   The advertisements were not a mere reporting of the study  Unilever did not expressly hold itself out as having itself conducted the market research but it did present the market research as capable of generalisation to all Holiday Skin users  it did not qualify the variants used and it represented that the   out of   general preference was a preference for the tanning attributes of the products  By presenting the preference claim including the elucidator in this manner  Unilever conveyed the impression that the study provided a basis for the representations   Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd     FCR   at    A statement of opinion cannot be regarded as false or misleading or as misleading and deceptive simply because it is incorrect   Global Sportsman at   Bateman v Slatyer     ALR   at    However  in this case  as in RAIA at   it is implicit in the statement of the comparison that

specialised the report or the more remote from the corporation s area of business  the easier it will be to establish that the corporation is merely passing on the information  for what it s worth   In Harkins v Butcher   NSWCA         NSWLR   for example  the New South Wales Court of Appeal found that an agent who distributed a brochure incorporating a copy of a survey diagram to purchasers was not liable for a contravention of s   on the basis that   the recipients would know that the agents did not hold themselves out as professional surveyors  and had not carried out the survey themselves    at    The Court of Appeal s decision was affirmed by a majority of the High Court  who had regard to the nature of the parties  the character of the transaction and the contents of the brochure

au au cases cth HCA  html  The question for the Court is whether reasonably minded members of the class of consumers to whom each advertisement is directed would take from it the representation which is alleged  Campomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at      By its amended statement of claim  Johnson alleges that the representations in each advertisement are     a  that   out of   users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin for its tanning attributes  the first representation     b  that   out of   users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin  with respect to each of the four respective product variants  Fair to Normal and Normal to Darker   the second representation   c  that   out of   users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin  the third representation  and   d  that Summer Glow is the best tanning body lotion available  the fourth representation    The first and second representations are said to raise for determination the construction of the advertisements  The third and fourth representations raise the validity of the market research   Where the persons to whom the conducted is directed are not identified individuals  but members of a class to which the conduct is directed in a general sense  it is necessary to isolate a representative member of that class   Campomar at    The question then is whether a misconception is likely to arise on the part of that representative consumer from the conduct alleged   Campomar at   Astrazeneca at    For there to be a contravention of s     the ordinary or reasonable representee must be shown to labour under some erroneous assumption   Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Campomar at    The question is whether any misconceptions or deceptions alleged to arise from the advertisements are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the class of the public towards whom the conduct has been directed   Campomar at     Astrazeneca at     A contravention of s   may occur even when a corporation is acting reasonably and honestly   Campomar at   citing Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty

  HCA         CLR   at    However  the fact that a corporation acts honestly and reasonably and does not intend to mislead or deceive does not necessarily absolve it from liability   Parkdale at   Yorke    It is a matter of fact in each case  Unilever submits that the reference to the  use test  in the elucidator would lead the consumer to understand that it had been carried out bona fide by a research house and that Unilever relied upon it  That representation was true citedGardam v George Wills   Co Ltd     ALR   It is the case that the study was a specialised report  It can not be said  however  that the study was remote from Unilever s business  Unilever is engaged in the sale of consumer products to the public and conducts advertising to sell those products  It was not suggested that Unilever had no knowledge or understanding of market surveys  Indeed  Unilever issued sophisticated instructions to Colmar Brunton and indicated in clear terms the result it wished to achieve  It cannot be said that Unilever in any way disclaimed a belief in the truth or falsity of the comparison or the study on which it was based or was merely   passing it on for what it is worth     Yorke at    To the contrary  the results of the study were conveyed to the public as part of an integrated advertising campaign  In the circumstances  Unilever adopted them  it was not a   mere conduit     Gardam v George Wills   Co Ltd     ALR   at   citedGillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd     ALR   The preference claim is qualified by the elucidator  However  there can be no doubt that Unilever intended to communicate superiority  This is not a case of  mere puffery    Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd     ALR   at    That asserted superiority was in terms of performance attributes  rather than other attributes such as fragrance  While Mr Kibble may have intended the testing to be of   the performance of the product and its sensory appeal  skin feel and fragrance   emphasis added  the advertisement made no reference to fragrance and little or no reference to sensory  in contrast to tanning performance  appeal   It follows that I accept Johnson s submission that the message communicated by the commercial is that   out of   users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin for its tanning attributes  The first representation was made in the television advertisement   The print advertisement states that Summer Glow   combines rich body lotion with a hint of self tanning agents   and includes in its list of the product s attributes   everyday body moisturiser   and   gradually builds a beautiful light tan    This places greater emphasis than does the television advertisement on the moisturising capacity of the product   Comparative advertising does not create any presumption with respect to a breach of the Act   Energizer at    However  as Heerey J pointed out in Energizer   the more actual comparison is used  the more potential there is for error and half truth  at    The factual assertions must be   not untrue  or misleading half truths    at    Lindgren J discussed at   the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement to be making reference  In that case  it was conceded that  if the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement was referring was all Energizer batteries rather than the one particular battery the subject of comparison  the advertisement was misleading or deceptive   Unilever s reliance on the failure by Johnson to establish that a different preference would have been expressed had all four variants been tested by the study is ill founded  The fact is that the study simply did not include the two variants of Holiday Skin or compare them to both variants of Summer Glow  The reasonable consumer would have understood  in the absence of qualification  that the user preference was found to exist across all variants  or at the least  to a comparison of each comparable variant  when no such preference had been expressed in the  use test  citedGlobal Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd     FCR   The advertisements

      CLR   at    The elucidator  which refers to the  leading research company  is used to validate an assertion that the   out of   preference relates to Holiday Skin users generally  not to restrict it  The television advertisement portrays a group of women who are presented as representative of women generally  There is no suggestion that these women personally participated in the  use  test  but there is  in my view  a clear assertion that Summer Glow is the better product because the results of the market research can be extrapolated to them  The print advertisement expands the application to  every woman  or  at least  every user of Holiday Skin citedJanssen Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd     IPR   Unilever has represented to the consumer that the preference exhibited by Holiday Skin users is supported by the  use test   The study was silent as to the preference of Holiday Skin users under the age of   who represented a substantial proportion of those users  The onus is on Johnson to establish that the representation was misleading and deceptive but  following Burchett J s observations in Janssen Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd     IPR   at   if Johnson establishes that there is no foundation in the study for a statement in the advertisements  that may be sufficient proof that the statement is misleading  As his Honour recognised  the question is whether the context in which the representation is made implies that adequate foundation exists for making it  Johnson submits that the claim made was not supported to the degree that the ordinary and reasonable consumer would understand and that the evidentiary onus shifts to Unilever to show that consumers will not be mislead   A comparison  said to be supported by a  use test  conducted by a  leading research company  gives the impression that the study has been carefully conducted and that the results support the precise statement made  A reader or viewer  seeing the reference to the leading research company  would understand that the study had been conducted properly and with care and that it fully supported the claim based upon it  cf RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited     FCR   at    As in Janssen   the context of these advertisements must be  or is likely to be  taken as implying that there is an adequate foundation in
