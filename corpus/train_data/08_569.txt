no presumption upon default of the respondent of the correctness of the applicant s claims  see Commissioner of Taxation v Finn   HCA         CLR         It was not open to the court to make an order for default judgment except on the bringing of a motion supported by evidence as to the merits of the application  see Australian Securities Commission v McLeod     FCR   per Drummond J  see also for example Grey v Mango Prepaid Calling Cards Pty Limited   FCA   per Nicholson J  and Zomba Production Music v Roadhouse Productions     ALR   per Stone J       However  recent authorities indicate that the introduction of Order  A provides the foundation for a finding that in the absence of a defence where there is a pleading by way of a statement of claim then the facts in the statement of claim are admitted citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v  Cellnet LLC   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Examples of the recent authorities which would fall within the

it may be  I note that s   of the Act confers jurisdiction upon this court with respect to matters arising under the Act   The Act does not contain a section which expressly empowers the court to order the delivery up of infringing products  This particular feature of the Act   in contradistinction to s   of the Copyright Act    Cth  was noted by Einfeld J in Roussel Uclaf v Pan Laboratories Proprietary Limited   FCA         IPR     His Honour further noted  however  that this court has general power to make an order for delivery up of that kind in accordance with established principles of equitable relief pursuant to s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   That section provides that the court has power in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction to make orders of such kinds  including interlocutory orders  and to issue  or direct the issue of  writs of such kinds as the court thinks appropriate  I note  further  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act     which provides for this Court to be a superior court of record and a court of law and equity   I am quite satisfied  having regard to ss   and   of the Federal Court of Australia Act     that I have power to make order   of the orders sought  Power to make order   is derived  in my opinion  from a combination of s   of the Act and ss   and   of the Federal Court of Australia Act     Orders   and   as described earlier  are ancillary  and power to make them is to be found  in my opinion  in s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act      Some further comment should be made in respect of the form in which the restraint proposed is cast  In Atkins Court Forms   Second Edition  Volume     issue  page   paragraph   the learned authors of that English text state as follows    Account of Profits The plaintiff in an infringement action is entitled  at his option  to an account of profits in lieu of damages  Where there is a consent or default order  there having been no full court hearing with consequent guidance as to what constitutes an infringement  the orders should be narrowly framed consideredWalker v Wilson Doors  Sales and Contracts  Limited   RPC   The position in Australia in respect of an Applicant in an infringement application being entitled by election to an account of profits in lieu of damages is no different  In respect of the last sentence in the passage quoted  the learned authors cite Walker v Wilson Doors  Sales and Contracts  Limited   RPC    Regard to that case discloses that it reports an exchange between Lloyd Jacob J and counsel in relation to the form of a restraint order  His Lordship was concerned in the making of an order that the restraint not be cast overly widely  The restraint that had been proposed  albeit by consent  was one whereby the defendants would be restrained  whether by their directors  officers  servants or agents  or any of them or otherwise howsoever from infringing the plaintiff s letters patent numbered   His Lordship remarked  at page   I am aware that this has been a common form of order in the past  In fact  I know because bitter experience has taught us  that it might well result in a dispute between the parties that has to be fought in contempt proceedings and might easily arise where parties have really got a genuine difference as to what is and what is not within the scope of the patent   I am conscious that this is a default proceeding  It seems to me that the form of order which is proposed in this instance does not suffer from the vice of generality of the kind which occasioned concern to Lloyd Jacob J   It may prove to be the case that upon the filing of the affidavit of the kind described in para   of the proposed orders that more detailed direction is needed in respect of the taking of accounts  It seems to me  therefore  that it is appropriate to adjourn the substantive application to a date to be fixed  as well as adjourn the notice of motion to a date to be fixed  and to grant to the parties liberty to apply  both particularly in respect of or in relation to the taking of an account and otherwise generally in relation to the further conduct of the proceeding   At the request of counsel for the Applicants  I shall in the formal orders add the words  in Australia  after  setting  in paragraph   and  predicts  in paragraph     I certify that the preceding twenty nine   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan    Associate Dated    April   Counsel for the Applicants  Ms K Downes     Solicitor for
