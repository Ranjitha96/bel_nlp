provided to the Court on the day of the hearing  the parties said this about the United States proceedings      United States judgment     Paragraph   of the October submissions refers to proceedings

the matter of Federal Trade Commission v Atkinson   Ors   United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois  Eastern Division  Case No   CV   An amount of US  was imposed jointly and severally upon Mr Atkinson and Inet Venture Pty Ltd  as equitable monetary relief for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act   FTC Act   and the Controlling the Assault of Non Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of     CAN SPAM Act      As set out at paragraphs   and      of the October submissions  s   of the Spam Act provides that a relevant consideration for the Court is        if the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so   whether the person has previously been found by a court in a foreign country to have engaged in any similar conduct      The parties submit that the findings of the United States court are relevant and should be taken into account by the Court  but do not amount to prior findings of contraventions that pre date the conduct the subject of these proceedings  as they arise from the same conduct  and accordingly are not an aggravating factor  As the penalties sought in the present proceedings are in respect only of such emails as are connected with Australia  the parties submit a penalty in the amount proposed remains appropriate  On   November   default judgment in the United States case was entered against five of the six defendants in the proceeding  including Mr Atkinson  The proceeding  commenced by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  alleged a range of contraventions of the Federal Trade Commission Act  the  FTC Act  concerning contended deceptive practices in connection with the sale of certain purported herbal products and a pharmaceutical medication  some of which involved representations as to sexual enhancement  There seems to be some correlation between the products in issue and those the subject of these proceedings  In addition  the proceedings involved contended contraventions of the United States Controlling the Assault of Non Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act    the  CAN SPAM Act   Various provisions of the CAN SPAM Act were relied upon by the FTC in the proceedings  The essential contention was that Mr Atkinson and others had initiated the transmission of unsolicited computer email messages in contravention of the Act in respect of the sale and promotion of the above products  The Court found  on the face of the FTC material  that there had been contraventions of the CAN SPAM Act  and that       A  the total amount of consumer injury caused by Defendants Lance

Communications and Media Authority v Clarity  Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR  There have now been three judgments of the Court in respect of contraventions of s    among other provisions  of the Spam Act   They are  Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity  Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   per Nicholson J  Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong  No     FCA         ALR   per Logan J  and a further ex tempore judgment by Logan J on   December   concerning further respondents in the Mobilegate litigation   Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd  No     FCA    The decision of Nicholson J in Clarity    involved conduct on the part of the corporation of sending   commercial electronic messages between   April   and   April    In the majority of these contraventions  Clarity  had used harvested addresses in contravention of s   of the Spam Act   Mr Mansfield  the second respondent  was found to have aided  abetted  counselled and procured the contraventions and to have been knowingly concerned in or a party to them  The Court found Mr Mansfield to have been  closely involved  in the contraventions  The proceedings were contested  Nicholson J made findings of fact in a primary judgment and addressed the question of the pecuniary penalty in the judgment cited above  Nicholson J took these matters into account  it was difficult to quantify the loss or damage caused by the conduct and thus the presence of loss or damage was treated as a possible aggravating circumstance  the contraventions involved a  huge volume  of electronic messages described by witnesses as  annoying  time consuming and frustrating  resulting in responses through filtering and blocking software  since the contravening conduct was the first conduct to be prosecuted under the Spam Act and the respondents genuinely believed that their conduct did not involve a contravention  these circumstances amounted to  an important factor in their favour  the respondents had not been found by the Court to have engaged in previous contraventions  although the conduct of the respondents was deliberate  the deliberateness was an expression of their belief that their understanding of the new law was correct  and  the issue of capacity to pay a pecuniary penalty  although a relevant factor  was of less relevance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty meeting the objective of general deterrence  His Honour applied the totality principle  On the question of cooperation  the applicant acknowledged that the respondents had not attempted to hinder or prevent it from conducting its investigation of the respondent s conduct  The applicant contended that cooperation flowed from the fact that at no time did the respondents entertain the possibility that their conduct might contravene the Spam Act   The respondents vigorously opposed the position asserted by the applicant that they had not shown any cooperation in relevant respects  Nevertheless  one point of distinction between Clarity  and the present proceeding is that the respondents in Clarity  contested the proceedings because they believed their conduct did not involve a contravention of the Act  Thus  they simply sought to ventilate their view of the quality of their conduct in the face of new legislative provisions  In these proceedings  Mr Atkinson  in the face of enforcement proceedings  exhibited genuine cooperation with the Authority  In approaching the assessment of the pecuniary penalty  Nicholson J considered that there is a need for  commercial realism in fixing penalties   He also said this  One difficulty which emerges in the application of the pecuniary penalty provisions in the new Act is that the maximum penalties are so high as to give rise to  an unrealistically large penalty   The unrealistic character derives principally from the quantum of penalty viewed in relation to the capacity of either respondent to pay and the need for general as well as specific deterrence  It is not just the total quantum of a pecuniary penalty which can provide the element of general deterrence  That quality derives from a consideration of the penalty in relation to the conduct giving rise to it and the financial capacity of the offenders  Where the financial capacity is not great  a  lesser  pecuniary penalty in value will derive its quality of general deterrence from its magnitude in relation to that capacity     As to a penalty of    m sought against Clarity    A penalty in the amount of     million is clearly one beyond the capacity of Clarity  to pay and so likely to lead to its liquidation  It is quite disproportionate to the commercial realities of Clarity    Even as proposed it is in the particular circumstances  an unrealistically large penalty       It is overly weighted in favour of general deterrence  Importantly  it does not appear to be constructed on any allowance of the new character of the legislation and the entitlement of the respondents to test their view of the effect of the legislation  Similar views were expressed in relation to the pecuniary penalty sought against the individual  Mr Mansfield  In the end result a pecuniary penalty of  m was imposed upon Mr Mansfield  The pecuniary penalties imposed in the matter amounted to approximately   of the maximum penalties possible  Secondly   I consider that the decisions of the Court in Clarity  and Mobilegate engage factors which significantly differentiate those cases from the present case  Clarity  was a fully contested proceeding involving a different class and scale of conduct  There was no cooperation in relation to the proceeding because the respondents took the view that their conduct did not involve a contravention of the relevant provisions especially in circumstances where the legislation had not been tested and no judicial determination was before the respondents which may have aided their analysis of the various integers contained in the sections  The respondents in Clarity  cooperated in the conduct of the case but not in the sense of accepting the contention that its conduct contravened the Spam Act   so as to avoid the applicant incurring the costs of the proceeding  The decision in Mobilegate involved truly reprehensible predatory conduct of a kind which warranted a penalty directed emphatically towards specific deterrence and transparent general deterrence  The class of conduct the subject of Mobilegate is not evident in these proceedings  Thirdly   however  as to the class of conduct on the part of Mr Atkinson  there is simply no doubt that Australian citizens find large scale distribution of unsolicited commercial electronic messages promoting the sale of products  in the circumstances of this case  very irritating and annoying  It causes all users of computers to constantly update spam filters and other protective devices to try to deflect the unwanted rain of electrons and digits disseminated by those who wish to do what Mr Atkinson has done  The Parliament has made its intention plain that the unsolicited distribution of electronic emails  spam  is to be discouraged  Notwithstanding these considerations  the Court ought to take into account and attach significant weight to Mr Atkinson s cooperation with the Authority in isolating the extent of the conduct and in seeking to resolve the present claims on the basis of admissions and a joint submission  Fourthly   Mr Atkinson is represented by independent lawyers and he has formed his view as to the various matters the subject of the submission with the assistance of that advice citedAustralian

litigation   Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd  No     FCA   citedTrade Practices Commission v Stihl ChainSaws  Aust  Pty Ltd   ATPR    In Mobilegate   Logan J was addressing conduct involving the sending of unsolicited short message service messages to the mobile telephones of users who had been deceived into providing their mobile telephone numbers to representatives of either Mobilegate   the first respondent  or Winning Bid   the second respondent  under the belief that they were corresponding with individuals seeking to meet them and form relationships via dating web sites  Logan J described the respondents as  predators on the emotionally vulnerable for reward  which was  a particularly vile form of behaviour   His Honour said the conduct was  duplicitous and exploitative  and  cruel and callous   His Honour concluded that this class of conduct warranted a  very substantial penalty   Among a number of considerations his Honour noted that the conduct was deliberate and covert and that penalties must be sufficiently significant to  deter the unscrupulous from taking a calculated business risk  but should not be so high as to be  oppressive  in the sense contemplated in Trade Practices Commission v Stihl ChainSaws  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA     ATPR      In addition  the evidence demonstrated that there was approximately  m of financial loss on the part of individual mobile telephone users who were charged communications fees  His Honour found that the conduct was  of such an intimate exploitive nature that the exploiter by the very conduct gives itself  himself or herself  a degree of insulation at a practical level from suits for financial recovery  and the conduct involved a  consistent pattern of studied deception   It was deliberate contravening conduct with no mitigating circumstances  In addition  there was no evident cooperation in the administration of justice  The entity  Mobilegate   was ordered to pay  m which represented     of a possible maximum of approximately    The entity Winning Bid was ordered to pay   representing     of a possible maximum of    So far as the individuals were concerned  Logan J took into account that their involvement was extensive  knowing and persistent  However  in examining the implications which might be drawn from statutory maximum pecuniary penalties in the context of individuals found to be parties to contravening corporate conduct  Logan J considered assessment of the maximum penalty as a  theoretical exercise   Significant pecuniary penalties were ordered against the individuals having regard to the quality of their engagement in the conduct of the corporation  There is little point isolating the amount of each penalty in respect of each individual in the circumstances of the findings citedMarkarian v The Queen     CLR  Clearly  it is important to take into account the scale of penalties the Parliament has selected as the appropriate range leading to a maximum penalty in respect of contraventions of particular legislation  Often  careful attention will need to be given to the Parliament s selection of maximum penalties as an expression of the Parliamentary intention that particular conduct  must be transparently deterred  This is entirely consistent with Markarian v The Queen     CLR    In addition  the Regulation Impact Statement at p   of the EM sets out the following statement of the problem sought to be addressed by the Spam Act at p        B   Problem or issue identification         Unsolicited electronic messages or  spam  are reaching plague proportions and growing exponentially  It is causing immense frustration and reduced productivity for users  businesses and government agencies  If left unchecked it will reach proportions which will threaten the viability of the internet as a reliable communications medium  A recent comprehensive review of the problem by the National Office for the Information Economy recommended a multi layered approach to addressing the problem  including the implementation of specific anti spam legislation  The EM describes the problem so identified as an international problem affecting the efficient operation of internet telecommunications networks and imposing costs on end users  At p   the EM notes   There are clear signs of a deleterious impact on the performance of the global e mail network with some commentators predicting that the continuing proliferation of spam could mean the end of e mail as an effective form of communication   At p   the EM contains this observation in relation to penalties      A daily ceiling for penalties has been set that may be charged for all contraventions against a particular provision that have occurred in one day  This has been included to ensure that a meaningful penalty may be charged for a single contravention without causing an unrealistically large penalty payable for multiple contraventions  For example  there are reported cases of dedicated spammers sending millions of unsolicited commercial electronic messages each day  Without a ceiling amount for daily contraventions  such a spammer could potentially be liable for a million contraventions  The ratio between the penalty payable for a person for single contravention and the ceiling amount is   times      ConclusionscitedMinister for Industry  Tourism
