Macks v Edge   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAscot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper   HCA         CLR   Gibbs CJ said  at      The general words of ss    and   must be understood in the context of the Act  which confers jurisdiction on the Family Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters  and in that context it would be unreasonable to impute to the Parliament an intention to give power to the Family Court to extinguish the rights  and enlarge the obligations  of third parties  in the absence of clear and unambiguous words  It can safely be assumed that the Parliament intended that the powers of the Family Court should be wide enough to prevent either of the parties to a marriage from evading his or her obligations to the other party  but it does not follow that the Parliament intended that the legitimate interests of third parties should be subordinated to the interests of a party to a marriage  or that the Family Court should be able to make orders that would operate to the detriment of third parties  There is nothing in the words of the sections that suggests that the Family Court is intended to have power to defeat or prejudice the rights  or nullify the powers  of third parties  or to require them to perform duties which they were not previously liable to perform  It is one thing to order a party to a marriage to do whatever is within his power to comply with an order of the court  even if what he does may have some effect on the position of third parties  but it is quite another to order third parties to do what they are not legally bound to do  referred toDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain     FCR   In The Queen v Ross Jones  Ex parte Green   HCA         CLR   Wilson and Dawson JJ said  at    footnotes omitted     We should add that even if those proceedings were a matrimonial cause  the Family Court would nevertheless lack the power to grant the relief sought  Apart from any constitutional limitation  it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the Family Court are to be understood in the context of the Family Law Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters  Those powers  which include the power to grant injunctive relief under s      are not to be construed so as to confer jurisdiction to defeat the rights  or enlarge the obligations  of persons who are not parties to the marriage involved in the relevant matrimonial cause  Ascot Investments Pty  Ltd  v  Harper         The principle referred to in the above passages has been applied in a number of cases in this Court and  in particular  it was applied in a context involving the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain     FCR    Davies  Lockhart and Burchett JJ said  at      A sequestration order reflects a right of a creditor  and creates rights as between a debtor and his creditors and trustee  The Family Court  in the pursuit of its duty  in an appropriate case  to adjust rights as between the parties to a marriage  has no power to deprive other parties of their rights  Its power to deal with the property of the parties over whom it has jurisdiction must start with the property that is theirs  not with property that the law  whether the Bankruptcy Act or some other law  has vested in another  referred toRe Boscolo  Ex parte Botany Council     FCR   Thirdly   in terms of the position before the Amending Act  s  A of the Bankruptcy Act has been in the Act since   and the above principles did not mean that this Court would never exercise its discretion to transfer proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court  The circumstances of the case might suggest that that course was appropriate even though  once transferred  the Family Court was bound to give full force and effect to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act   Re Sabri  Ex parte Sabri v Brien     FCR    I also refer to Re Boscolo  Ex parte Botany Council     FCR   as an example of a case where this Court refused to transfer proceedings to the Family Court referred toRe Sabri  Ex parte Sabri v Brien     FCR   Thirdly   in terms of the position before the Amending Act  s  A of the Bankruptcy Act has been in the Act since   and the above principles did not mean that this Court would never exercise its discretion to transfer proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court  The circumstances of the case might suggest that that course was appropriate even though  once transferred  the Family Court was bound to give full force and effect to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act   Re Sabri  Ex parte Sabri v Brien     FCR    I also refer to Re Boscolo  Ex parte Botany Council     FCR   as an example of a case where this Court refused to transfer proceedings to the Family Court   Had this application been made under the law as it stood prior to the enactment of the Amending Act  I would have seen no reason to transfer the proceedings to the Family Court  It is true that the Family Court would have had jurisdiction to hear the trustee s claim by reason of the order for transfer and the provisions of s  A  but the Family Court would have had no power to make orders altering the ownership interests in the freehold property  leasehold property and speedboat if and once the trustee had brought the transfers within the provisions of s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act   If he was unsuccessful in doing that then the ownership interests would remain as they are  Furthermore  there is no existing order of the Family Court that might suggest  as it did in Re Sabri  Ex parte Sabri v Brien   that to avoid the appearance of conflict between orders  the proceedings should be transferred to the Family Court   For the purposes of this case  the important change introduced by the Amending Act is that it gives the Family Court the power to make such orders as it considers appropriate  altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in what is referred to as  the vested bankruptcy property   It is necessary to examine the amendments in some detail because  as the submissions developed  counsel for Mrs Edge submitted that in pursuing a matrimonial cause the trustee  had simply issued in the wrong court    The starting point is the introduction into the Family Law Act of two new paragraphs in the definition of  matrimonial cause   For present purposes  paragraph  cb  is the relevant paragraph and it is in the following terms     cb  proceedings between           i  a party to a marriage     ii  the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the marriage            with respect to any vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party  being proceedings     iii  arising out of the marital relationship  or                iv  in relation to concurrent  pending or completed divorce or validity of marriage proceedings between the parties to the marriage  or    v  in relation to the divorce of the parties to the marriage  the annulment of the marriage or the legal separation of the parties to the marriage  being a divorce  annulment or legal separation effected in accordance with the law of an overseas jurisdiction  where that divorce  annulment or legal separation is recognised as valid in Australia under section     The term  vested bankruptcy property  is defined in s   of the Family Law Act as follows     vested bankruptcy property    in relation to a bankrupt  means property of the bankrupt that has vested in the bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Act     For this purpose  property has the same meaning as in the Bankruptcy Act      By reason of the Amending Act  s   of the Family Law Act  which is in Part VIII  now reads        In property settlement proceedings  the court may make such order as it considers appropriate             a  in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them  altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property  or    b  in the case of proceedings with respect to the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage  altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in the vested bankruptcy property            including             c  an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property  and            d  an order requiring             i  either or both of the parties to the marriage  or    ii  the relevant bankruptcy trustee  if any    to make  for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the marriage or a child of the marriage  such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines  referred toThe Queen v Ross Jones  Ex parte Green   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On   May   Mrs Edge issued proceedings in the Family Court of Australia against the trustee and the bankrupt seeking certain orders under the Family Law Act    Cth   the Family Law Act    During the course of the submissions on the application  counsel for Mrs Edge indicated that the orders sought in the proceedings in the Family Court may need to be amended  After the submissions  a member of the firm of solicitors acting for Mrs Edge filed an affidavit in which it is said that Mrs Edge has amended the application in the proceedings in the Family Court in terms of the orders sought  Subject to the question of costs  I am prepared to decide this application on the basis of the orders sought in the amended application  Those orders are as follows         That pursuant to section   of the Family Law Act     leave of the Court be granted to institute proceedings for the orders applied for hereinafter                 That pursuant to section   of the Family Law Act   a declaration be made that                    Pursuant to section  KA of the Family Law Act     the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on   May   is valid and binding  and                         The transfers executed on   and   September   respectively pursuant to the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on   May   are valid and binding                          In the alternative to     that the transfers effected on   and   September   respectively were in contemplation of the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on   May   and thus valid and binding                          As a consequence thereof the wife is entitled to be and remain registered as the sole proprietor both at law and in equity of the properties situate at and known as   Range Road North  Upper Hermitage in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume   Folio   and       Pelican Point  Morgan in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume   folio                     In the alternative  that if the Transfers referred to in paragraphs     and     above are void against the first respondent by reason of the operation of either or both of sections   and   of the Bankruptcy Act                         An order pursuant to sub sections  K b  and  c  of the Family Law Act terminating the binding financial agreement entered into between the husband and wife on   May                            Such order as is just and equitable pursuant to section  K  of the Family Law Act   preserving or adjusting the rights of the wife in relation to the property the subject of the terminated binding financial agreement                In the further alternative to   and   that pursuant to section   of the Family Law Act     the net matrimonial assets of the parties be divided as to   to the applicant wife and   to the respondent husband                That the husband s Trustee in Bankruptcy PETER IVAN MACKS be substituted as the Respondent in these proceedings in respect of the husband s property that may vest in the Trustee in Bankruptcy   The trustee submits that  insofar as an order is sought under s   of the Family Law Act   the application is out of time  and it will be necessary for Mrs Edge to obtain an extension of time  I have no information before me as to whether an extension of time will be granted  and I think it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that it may be granted   Significant amendments were made to the Bankruptcy Act and Family Law Act by the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act    Cth   I will refer to this Act as  the Amending Act   In terms of the issues in this case  it was not suggested that the relevant provisions of the Amending Act did not apply by reason of the fact that the relevant provisions came into effect during the course of    I note that the amendments in Schedule   came into operation on   September   those in Schedule   on   March   and the balance on   April     In order to explain the effect of the Amending Act on the legal rights and interests between a non bankrupt spouse and the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt spouse  it is necessary to briefly examine the position before that Act  For present purposes  the previous position may be summarised as follows   First  s   excludes from the operation of subsection    among other things  a transfer to meet all or part of a liability under a maintenance agreement  Before   April    maintenance agreement  was defined to include a financial agreement within the meaning of the Family Law Act   A similar exclusion or exception applied in relation to other provisions in the Bankruptcy Act   but it was not an exclusion or exception in the case of the operation of s   where the main purpose of the transfer was to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor s creditors or to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor s creditors  s    Before the introduction of the Amending Act  Mrs Edge could have raised as a defence or exception to the trustee s claim under s   but not s   an allegation that the transfers were to meet liabilities under a financial agreement   In The Queen v Ross Jones  Ex parte Green   HCA         CLR   Wilson and Dawson JJ said  at    footnotes omitted     We should add that even if those proceedings were a matrimonial cause  the Family Court would nevertheless lack the power to grant the relief sought  Apart from any constitutional limitation  it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the
