Que Noy v Northern Territory of Australia   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredDaniel v Western Australia     ALR   Section   of the Act states that  authorise  in relation to the making of native title determination applications and dealing with matters arising in relation to such applications  has the meaning given by s  B  Section  B states    Authorising the making of applications   For the purposes of this Act  all the persons in a native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application or a compensation application  and to deal with matters arising in relation to it  if     a  where there is a process of decision making that  under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group  must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind  the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process  or     b  where there is no such process  the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision making agreed to and adopted  by the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group  in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters  or in relation to doing things of that kind      That definition also applies to the use of  authorise  in s  B of the Act  Daniel v Western Australia     ALR   at     Finally  s   provides that  applicant  has a meaning affected by s   of the Act  That subsection states    Applicant in case of applications authorised by claim groups     In the case of     a  a native title determination application made by a person or persons authorised to make the application by a native title claim group  or     b  a compensation application made by a person or persons authorised to make the application by a compensation claim group   the following apply     c  the person is  or the persons are jointly  the applicant   and     d  none of the other members of the native title claim group or compensation claim group is the applicant    Before moving to the requirements of s  B  there are two technical matters that are necessary to address  First  the section refers to replacing  the applicant  which is defined in s   by reference to s   to include jointly all of the persons authorised under s   to make the application  Thus  the motion under s  B should be to replace all of the named applicants  despite the fact it proposes that some of them are to retain their status  see Daniel   ALR   at   Combined Mandingalbay Yidinji Gunggandji Claim v State of Queensland   FCA   at      That is a practical  but not a substantive  issue where not all of the persons who are named applicants are sought to be replaced  but it is not inconsistent with recent authorities which hold that authorisation under s  B is held by persons individually  rather than by those persons jointly as  the applicant   see Butchulla People v Queensland   FCA         FCR   at     Doolan v Native Title Registrar     FCR   at    In this matter  the terms of the motion intended  and would practically operate  to remove only Ms Foster as a named applicant and to replace her with her daughter  Margaret Foster  another member of the Kamu people  The other named applicants would retain their status  But  the motion may be regarded alternatively as achieving that purpose by seeking to replace  the applicant  including all of the named applicants  and replacing them with a new  applicant  including the existing named applicants except for Marjorie Foster and adding Margaret Foster   In Daniel   ALR   at     French J outlined the conditions that must be satisfied before an order can be made under s  B  they are       There is a claimant application      Each applicant for an order under s  B is a member of the native title group      The person to be replaced is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it      Alternatively  the person to be replaced has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group      The persons making the application under s  B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising under it      A careful reading of s  B  indicates that the cumulative grounds upon which the motion under s  B may be brought  that is  one of the two alternatives in ss  a i  or  ii  and the ground in ss  b  refer to the application for the determination of native title under s   of the Act  They focus upon the status of the current applicant to make the application or that applicant s conduct in relation to that application  and upon the putative applicant s authorisation to make and deal with matter arising in relation to that primary application  The status of the proposed new applicant to pursue the motion under s  B require those cumulative conditions to be satisfied  but not necessarily an explicit separate authorisation by the claim group to seek an order under s  B  That status already exists if there is an authorisation of the claim group under s  B to make the claimant application itself and to deal with the matters arising in relation to it  see eg Ward v Northern Territory     ALR   at      In Daniel   ALR at     that particular issue does not appear to have been contentious or therefore to have required particular remark  Nor  in my view  did it arise in Chapman v State of Queensland     FCR   to which my attention was drawn by senior counsel for Marjorie Foster   To satisfy the condition in ss  B a ii  the s  B applicants must show the extent of the authority given to Ms Foster by the claim group and point to conduct said to have exceeded that authority  There is no requirement under that subsection for a decision to be made revoking such authority  Daniel   ALR   at      In that case  at   French J said    If the original authority conferred upon an applicant for the purpose of making and dealing with matters in relation to a native title determination is subject to the continuing supervision and direction of the native title claim group  then it may be that an applicant whose authority is so limited is not authorised to act inconsistently with a resolution or direction of the claim group  In a case where an applicant does not comply with such a resolution or direction  it is reasonable to say that the applicant has exceeded the authority given to him or her by acting in contravention of the claim group decision  The criterion of excess of authority as a condition of the power under s  B may be less onerous than the criterion of cessation of authority  It does not require a separate decision making process in order to establish it  It is also consistent with a beneficial construction of s  B as a facultative provision directed to maintaining the ultimate authority of the native title claim group       See also Ward v Northern Territory of Australia     ALR     A decision of the native title claim group is required by ss  B a i  to remove the current applicant s authority  see Daniel   ALR   at    At the commencement of the hearing of the application under s  B on   June   the evidence said to support that that decision had been made was said to come from the affidavit of Ms Mearns  That affidavit outlined the details of a meeting of the Kamu people on   February    The meeting did not extend to all members of the native title claim group  In particular  neither Gabriel Hazelbane nor Paddy Huddleston nor other members of the Wagiman people or the Warai people were present  At that meeting  according to Ms Mearns  it was unanimously resolved to remove Ms Foster as a named applicant from the native title determination application and that Margaret Foster and Arthur Que Noy should be named on behalf of the Kamu people as applicants  There was no evidence as to whether minutes  or any record other than what appears in Ms Mearns affidavit  of the meeting were taken  Clearly  the decision of the Kamu people in that regard is not a decision of the claim group itself  Mr Barber s affidavit provided evidence of decisions made by the Wagiman and Warai people subsequent to   June    the first hearing day of the motion   The evidence is that both the Wagiman people and the Warai people after   June   decided to support the motion   The Kamu people s decision was  it was submitted  made at the meeting on   February    Ms Foster and four of her children  namely Maxine Storer  Michael Foster  Kenny Storer and Lynette Anderson did not attend  On the evidence  two of those children do not actively participate in decisions made by the Kamu group  and the other three persons including Ms Foster were notified of the meeting  There is no other evidence concerning which members of the Kamu people were notified of the meeting  nor how they were notified  nor what they were told would be considered at the meeting   As the submissions of senior counsel for Ms Foster indicate  other decisions of this Court have held that the words  the application  in ss  B b  refer to both the native title determination application and the application under s  B   Daniel   ALR   at   or to only the s  B application   Chapman   FCR   Mandingalbay   FCA   at     Moran v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales   FCA   at      Any authority to make the native title determination application and authority to make the application under s  B are clearly interdependent  The members of the claim group authorised to apply under s  B to replace an applicant must be the proposed new applicant and they must be authorised to make the native title determination application and deal with matters arising under it  Consequently  in my view  authorisation to bring the application under s  B must follow from the authorisation required by s  B b   That authorisation includes separate authorisation for each member of the native title claim group who will make up  the applicant   For those persons who will not be newly appointed  but who will maintain their existing status  it would be sufficient to merely refer to their prior authorisation and the fact that it has not been revoked  Butchulla   FCA       FCR   at    consideredCombined Mandingalbay Yidinji Gunggandji Claim v State of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii
