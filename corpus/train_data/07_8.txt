Lawson v NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBissett v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Section   of the Native Title Act provides that the Federal Court may join any person as a party to proceedings under the Act if it is satisfied that  the person s interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings   NTS is no stranger to applications made under this section  In Bissett v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales   FCA     Tamberlin J considered an application for the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council to withdraw as a party from a native title proceeding and for NTS to be joined as a party  In December   the status of the Land Council as a Native Title Representative Body was withdrawn at its own request  The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission decided to grant funds to NTS to assist in certain activities including carrying out the functions of a representative body as set out in s  B of the Native Title Act  referred toByron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People     FCR   In deciding whether NTS had the requisite interest under s     Tamberlin J applied the principles identified by the Full Court in Byron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People     FCR    His Honour agreed with the views of Katz J in Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of NSW   FCA         FCR   that despite amendments to the Native Title Act the reasoning in Byron was applicable to the case before him  His Honour summarised the Full Court s views as follows  at      In Byron Environment Centre   the Full Court held that although the relevant  interests  are not confined to interest in land or water  they do not extend to mere emotional associations  ideological or bare intellectual interests in the subject matter of the application  The  interests  must not be indirect  remote or lacking in substance and must be capable of clear definition such that they may be affected in a discernible way in relation to the application  at     per Black CJ   Tamberlin J considered the functions of a representative body and considered that they would be facilitated if NTS were a party to the proceeding  His Honour also observed that the expression   a determination in the proceedings  should not be equated with a final determination of native title rights  In considering the nature of the  interests  referred to in the section  his Honour said at        In relation to the asserted appropriateness of a narrow construction of the expression  interests  because of a power to veto an otherwise agreed settlement  the provisions of s   should be borne in mind  The provision empowers the Court at any time to order a party other than an applicant to cease to be a party to the proceedings  This power could be invoked by the Court if a representative body is a party to the proceedings and adopts a grossly unreasonable approach in relation to a proposed consensual determination of the proceedings  In addition  it should be kept in mind that the Court must always be satisfied that the person or body has the requisite interest in any particular circumstances and this provides a safeguard on the extent to which other persons or bodies can be joined   Tamberlin J held that NTS had a sufficient interest to meet the requirement of s   and that the application for joinder should be allowed  For the same reasons I am satisfied that NTS has sufficient interest in the compensation application and the order for joinder in this proceeding should be made   NTS has brought the present application to dismiss the proceedings under O  A r  of the Federal Court Rules because of a failure to progress the compensation claim  The following history of the matter  which I accept as correct  is taken from the affidavit of Mr Savidis   The compensation application covers an area  identical to the external boundaries of the Barkandji Traditional Owner s Application  NSD   of   in which NTS is a party and the legal representative of the applicant  This application  known as the Barkandji   application  was first lodged with the Tribunal on   October   referred toJango v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Jango v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR   the applicants failed in their compensation claim for two independent reasons both of which indicate the evidentiary hurdles that must be overcome by an applicant in such a case  Sackville J expressed those reasons as follows  at            First  the applicants have not shown  on the evidence  that the indigenous witnesses  or members of the compensation claim group  acknowledged and observed at the relevant times the laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc as pleaded in the Points of Claim       Secondly  I am not satisfied that any laws and customs relating to rights and interests in land that may have been acknowledged and observed by the Aboriginal witnesses are the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc  within the meaning of s   of the NTA   Given the lack of progress with the present application  there is no reasonable prospect of such evidence ever being produced  Under the circumstances  I accept that NTS has done everything possible to ensure that those who might have an interest in the claim have been consulted about the present application  They have obtained full support from all persons they have been able to contact except Dorothy and Phillip Lawson  I accept that NTS has been authorised by the Barkandji people to apply to have the compensation claim dismissed referred toMcKenzie v South Australia     ALR   I am conscious that the Court s power under Order  A rule   and under s  C of the Native Title Act must be exercised cautiously  The applicable principles are helpfully set out by Finn J in McKenzie v South Australia     ALR   at   et seq  For the reasons set out above  I am satisfied however  that it is appropriate to exercise those powers in the present circumstances  I shall therefore make the orders sought by NTS   I certify that the
