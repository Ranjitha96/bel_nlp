Republic of Poland v Ginter   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedUnited Mexican States v Cabal     CLR  A detailed consideration of the law in relation to bail under the Act is found in United Mexican States v Cabal     CLR    Although directly referrable to the bail provisions under s  f iv  of the Act it is  nonetheless  apt to a consideration of a bail application under s   of the Act and the rationale for the  special circumstances  requirement  which was described in these terms      Because the typical extraditee is a person who has fled from another country after committing a serious crime  granting bail to that person provides a further opportunity for him or her to flee from the reach of the extraditing country  The ever present risk of flight in extradition situations was the rationale for the  special circumstances  requirement of s   of the Act    The Explanatory Memorandum stated        Sub clause   provides that a person shall not be granted bail unless there are special circumstances  Such a provision is considered necessary because experience has shown that there is a very high risk of persons sought for extraditable offences absconding  In many cases the person is in Australia to avoid arrest in the country where he is alleged to have committed the offence  ie the person left the jurisdiction to avoid justice  The circumstances relied upon by the second respondent in granting bail is more referrable to a bail application in the criminal jurisdiction generally  However  the position in extradition cases is different as appears from Cabal at   and       However  it does not follow that the principles that apply in criminal cases are fully applicable to extradition cases  First  Australia s international relations and standing are involved in extradition cases  They are seldom involved in domestic criminal cases  Secondly  the Court must take account of the purpose and policy of the Act  It would be a serious error to take the view that the enactment of the Act has no bearing on the application of the Court s incidental power to make an order granting bail to a person held under a s  a  warrant    That enactment cannot alter the power implicit in s   of the Constitution   But it can affect its application to the circumstances of the particular case  That is because the provisions of the Act illuminate the object of the proceedings that give rise to the application or appeal to this Court        In our opinion  it is an error in a bail application in an extradition matter to take into account that there is  a predisposition against unnecessary or arbitrary detention in custody   The Parliament has made it plain that bail is not to be granted unless special circumstances are proved  However unpalatable such a conclusion may be to the mind of the common lawyer  the Parliament believed that the fulfilment of Australia s treaty obligations makes the principles governing bail in domestic cases inapplicable in extradition cases  In extradition cases  the general rule is that defendants are to be held in custody whether or not their detention is necessary  Only when there is something special about a defendant s circumstances can the question of bail be considered  For that reason  it is erroneous to take into account  those circumstances which ordinarily would fall for consideration on an application for bail where a person is charged domestically for the commission of a crime   Those circumstances may be taken into account in considering the exercise of discretion after special circumstances have been established  But they can play no part in determining whether the applicant has established special circumstances  In Cabal the grounds for granting bail were explained      Given this background and the rationale for the  special circumstances  condition  bail in extradition cases should be granted only when two conditions are fulfilled  First  the circumstances of the individual case are special in the sense that they are different from the circumstances that persons facing extradition would ordinarily endure when regard is had to the nature and extent of the extradition charges  This means that the circumstances relied on must be different in kind from the disadvantages that all extradition defendants have to endure  To constitute  special circumstances  the matters relied on  need to be extraordinary and not factors applicable to all defendants facing extradition     Secondly  there must be no real risk of flight  Absence of a real risk of flight is ordinarily a necessary but not a sufficient condition of bail  When there is a real risk of flight  ordinarily bail should be refused   Further  the risk of flight should be considered independently of the effect of the proposed bail conditions  In this area of law  the history and character of the defendant and the potential punishment facing the defendant are likely to be surer guides to the risk of flight than bail conditions    even rigorous conditions  A person  fearing punishment and inclined to flee  is unlikely to be diverted from that course by the prospect that his or her sureties may forfeit their securities or by stringent reporting conditions  Even if the defendant has to report twice daily to the police  he or she will have a period of twelve to fourteen hours in which to leave Australia   Emphasis added As to the issue of confusion surrounding the charges  the materials provided by the Applicant in support of the extradition request clearly set out the history of the matter and the reason for the present charges differing from those originally preferred against the first respondent  The applicant provided information that the investigation into the first respondent s alleged criminality commenced in   resulting in him being originally charged in December    Subsequent to this  the authorities learned of a second investigation into the first respondent s alleged criminal activity which resulted in the merger of those investigations in March    Following the merger  the first respondent s alleged criminality was reconsidered and a provisional arrest warrant was obtained in August   after the allegations against the first respondent had been supplemented in July    In December   further amendment of the case resulted in one charge being discontinued due to a limitation period which applied resulting in the remaining two counts the subject of this extradition request giving rise to a further provisional arrest warrant in January    As a consequence of this decision  the provisional arrest warrant issued in August   was revoked  There is nothing which emerges from these circumstances  in my view  which qualifies as a special circumstance for bail reasons  I do not consider that delay by Poland in making the request for the first respondent s extradition is a special circumstance warranting the grant of bail  It would be different perhaps in the case of unacceptable delays in the extradition process itself  Cabal at    The fact that the first respondent has no current Polish or Australian passport is not  inevitably  a barrier to flight  The case of Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions     FCR   demonstrates this point  Schoenmakers had  as a condition of his bail  been required to surrender his passport to the Australian Federal Police  Nonetheless he managed to flee from Australia to Thailand upon his release on bail from extradition detention  Cabal at    The second respondent  in my opinion  erred in his findings regarding the existence of special circumstances on the basis that the matters noted at   above were more properly characterised as ones that might ordinarily fall for consideration on an application for bail by a person charged with a domestic offence  The second respondent erred as a matter of law in so finding  Flight Risk In the materials provided by the applicant in support of its request for extradition it is noted that the first respondent left Poland in   shortly after his alleged criminal activity  indicating that the first respondent was leaving Poland with the intent of absconding from criminal justice  There was no material before the second respondent to contradict this assertion  It is evidence of the first respondent s preparedness to take flight from Poland to this country in order to evade alleged criminal conduct  In Cabal it was said at   and       The purpose of the extradition proceedings is set at risk if an applicant is entitled to bail upon proof of special circumstances and a probability that the applicant will not abscond  If there is a real risk that the applicant will abscond  the objects of the Act and the rationale of ss   and   require the refusal of bail in all but exceptional cases  Unless the special circumstances are so cogent and the risk so very low that the proper exercise of discretion requires the grant of bail  any real risk of flight should be decisive against the grant of bail   Emphasis added        It is no doubt true that the test is not whether the proven special circumstances are such that it is not probable that the applicant will abscond  But it is not a question of whether the personal and other public interests outweigh the objects and rationale of the Act  Once special circumstances are proved  the Court must consider all the circumstances of the case  the chief of which is the risk of flight  If a real risk of flight exists  the proper exercise of the discretion will ordinarily require the refusal of bail  That the first respondent departed Poland in the circumstances asserted is not a necessary factor to a finding that he is a risk of flight  As was said in Cabal at   it is a mistake to think that a person is unlikely to abscond simply because that person did not leave the extraditing country  to avoid justice   In any event  in my opinion  risk of flight ought not to be confined to flight from Australia  It is capable of including flight within Australia  In my opinion  the second respondent failed to take into account a material matter namely  evidence that the first respondent posed a real risk of flight  This was an error of law  Conclusion In my opinion  reviewable error has been demonstrated both in respect to the question of the existence of special circumstances under s   of the Act as well as the question whether there is a real risk of flight in relation to the first respondent
