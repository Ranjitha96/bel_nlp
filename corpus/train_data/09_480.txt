cases sa SAIRC  htmlOn   August   the respondent issued a Summons in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia  IRCSA  alleging that at all material times of her employment she was performing duties covered by the Clerks  Award  SA   the Clerks Award  and then from   March   under the Notional Agreement Preserving the State Clerks  Award  Cth   the Clerks NAPSA   She sought the underpayment of her claimed entitlements and interest  that is the difference between what she was paid pursuant to the Fitness Award and the Fitness NAPSA and what she contended she should have been paid pursuant to the Clerks Award and the Clerks NAPSA  The IRCSA had jurisdiction to entertain that claim under s  a  of the Fair Work Act    SA   the FW Act  and as an  eligible court  as defined in s   and pursuant to s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the WR Act  including the claim arising under the federal instrument  relevantly the Clerks NAPSA  see ISS Health Support Services Pty Ltd v Duthie   SAIRC     ISS Health v Duthie    The appellant denied that the respondent was performing the duties covered by the Clerks Award and the Clerks NAPSA as contended  and argued that the relevant instruments were the Fitness Award and the Fitness NAPSA  The IRCSA appeal was listed for hearing on   April    On   April   his Honour Senior Judge Jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal  It is unclear what the  jurisdictional issue  is  It may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders  although as noted in   of these reasons  s   of the FW Act would appear to accommodate such an appeal   It may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent  having regard to the  matter  including the federal element and the provisions of ss   and   of the WR Act  As to that  see the decision in ISS Health v Duthie   SAIRC   at

Court discussedKronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd  CMI Toyota    FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe IRCSA appeal was listed for hearing on   April    On   April   his Honour Senior Judge Jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal  It is unclear what the  jurisdictional issue  is  It may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders  although as noted in   of these reasons  s   of the FW Act would appear to accommodate such an appeal   It may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent  having regard to the  matter  including the federal element and the provisions of ss   and   of the WR Act  As to that  see the decision in ISS Health v Duthie   SAIRC   at     See also Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd  CMI Toyota    FCAFC     Kronen   at   and    It may be that the appeal may be incompetent because it is not an appeal from the whole of the decision  but only that part of it which related to the period up to   March    In Kronen   FCAFC     an Industrial Magistrate of the IRCSA had considered claims for underpayment of wages for overtime work and for underpayment of superannuation contributions  The written reasons for judgment dismissed the claim for overtime pay  but made no order reflecting the Industrial Magistrate s conclusions on the superannuation claim  The Full Court  Gray  Branson and Lander JJ  observed at     The industrial magistrate made no order reflecting the conclusions he had reached on the superannuation claim  He neither dismissed the claim  which he was bound to do  if he came to the conclusion that he had no power to order the making of payments  nor made any purported declaration reflecting the conclusion to which he had come as to the meaning and effect of the provisions of the Award relating to superannuation  His Honour seems to have thought that the expression of a conclusion in his reasons for judgment was sufficient  It was not  The whole of the application by summons before the court needed to be dealt with  Plainly  because the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the superannuation claim  that aspect of the application was required to be dismissed  There is nothing in the FW Act  which continues the existence of IRCSA established first under the Industrial Relations Act    SA  which requires its decisions to be reflected in formally drawn orders so that its orders must be drawn up and sealed  Nor is there anything in the South Australian Industrial Proceedings Rules  SA  dealing with those topics  In Kronen   FCAFC     the Full Court clearly accepted that the expression of an order dismissing the claim for overtime payments in the reasons for decision was sufficient to enliven the right of appeal  subject to granting leave to appeal if that were necessary  see at    Clearly  that decision is different from the present circumstances  It is clear that the fact that the IRCSA does not routinely draw up formal orders after a decision  including reasons for decision  does not of itself impede the right of appeal under s   of the WR Act  see Kronen   FCAFC    It therefore falls to consider whether the Industrial Magistrate  in particular by   of his reasons set out above  has in substance finally determined the issue as to how the parties  legal rights are to be assessed  Had the word  determine  been substituted for the word  conclude  or been used in conjunction with it  there would in my view have been no scope for debate about that  The limited liberty to apply as to the quantum reflects such an intention  In my view  the existence or otherwise of a right of appeal should not be determined by the precise word or words used  but by their substantive effect  I do not need to decide that issue because the appellant has taken upon itself to have this appeal dismissed  However  I think there is at least a reasonable basis to conclude that the Industrial Magistrate intended to  and did  finally determine the issue of principle in a binding way and that his expression at the conclusion of his reasons was intended to  and did  operate in that way  In any event  if there were any ambiguity  the Industrial Magistrate could have been asked to clarify the meaning of   of his reasons so as to indicate whether he intended it to be the operative judicial determination of that issue  or further  his Honour could have been asked to make such an operative judicial determination  The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court  in the latter event  could have been allowed to stand as if that operative determination had been made at the time of the publication of the reasons and any necessary extension of time granted  No party would thereby have been prejudiced  and indeed the respondent opposed the stay motion and wanted to proceed with the appeal  I turn to consider the issue of the costs of the appeal  Section   of the WR Act relevantly provides      A party to a proceeding  including an appeal  in a matter arising under this Act     must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause        Despite subsection   if a court hearing a proceeding  including an appeal  in a matter arising under this Act     is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has  by an unreasonable act or omission  caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding  the court may order the first mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs        In subsections   and   costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses citedAttorney General v Sillen   EngR         HL Cas  Any right of appeal has a statutory source  Attorney General v Sillen   EngR         HL Cas   at

of the amount payable under the applicable instruments  In Ah Toy     FCR     the Full Court held that an appeal from findings made in the reasons of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory who had conducted an inquiry under s   of the Companies Act  NT  into the conduct of the putative appellant as the liquidator of a particular company was incompetent  The findings were followed by a series of orders under s   that the putative appellant make good to the company its loss caused by certain actions taken by the liquidator  There was initially no appeal from some of the orders themselves  that was done by amendment at the hearing relating only to some of the challenged findings which did not relate directly to the liquidator  Not surprisingly  the Full Court regarded as incompetent the amended appeal to the extent that it challenged only those findings unrelated to the orders  In Ah Toy     FCR     the Full Court at     addressed various authorities considering what constitutes a  judgment  decree or order   I shall not repeat them  In essence  that expression covers only the operative judicial acts  binding upon the parties and determinative of their legal rights  It must involve the formal judicial act or order by which the Court disposes of the matter before it citedHi fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR  It is

citedCitigroup Pty Ltd v Mason   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn matters such as the present  as I have noted  it is commonplace for the Court to decide the issue of principle between the parties  leaving it to them to then agree upon the consequential detailed calculations  The final determination of the issue of principle may operate only as an interlocutory judgment  as it does not finally dispose of all issues in the proceeding  It is akin to the separate determination of a question under O   of the Federal Court Rules   where an order recording such a determination may give rise to an appeal by leave under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   However  s   of the WR Act provides that it is not necessary to obtain leave to appeal under s   and s   has consequently been held to prevail over the requirement for leave  Citigroup Pty Ltd v Mason   FCA         FCR   at         The question remains whether the reasons of the Industrial Magistrate constitute a determination  binding upon the parties and determinative of their legal rights  notwithstanding that there is no formal or separate sealed order recording such a determination citedAustralian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts     FCR  In Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts     FCR     the Full Court found that an appeal from the decision of the Australian Telecommunications Commission was competent in the following circumstances  The decision was that the employee should be compulsorily retired for medical unfitness under s   of the Telecommunications Act    Cth   As required by s     the Telecommunications Regulations    Cth  made provision for review of such a decision  The Review Tribunal decided that  there was insufficient evidence to recommend any alternative to the decision   The employee successfully challenged the validity of the decision of the Review Tribunal under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth  including on the basis that the relevant regulations did not make proper provision for review of the initial decision so the initial decision under s   was itself invalid  The judge at first instance delivered reasons for judgment to that effect  and  although no formal judgment was entered  both in his reasons for judgment and by a minute of orders containing proposed orders accompanying them made declarations as to the invalidity of the decision to retire the employee and setting aside that decision  The primary judge also concluded that  in any event  the Review Tribunal had failed to accord the employee procedural fairness so that  but for the decision about the invalidity of the relevant regulations  the matter would have had to be remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconciliation  The Full Court regarded the appeal from the order setting aside the initial decision as competent  even though there was no challenge to its being set aside for breach of procedural fairness  That is  the appeal was regarded as competent even though it was accepted by the employer as appellant that the Review Tribunal decision should be set aside because procedural fairness was not given to the employee  Toohey J  with whom Fisher J agreed  said at     that the appeal was  from a finding implicit in the judgment  that the initial decision was also invalid because it must have been on that basis that the matter was not remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration  but that the decisions were declared to be invalid
