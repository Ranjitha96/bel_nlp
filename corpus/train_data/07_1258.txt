au au cases cth federal ct  html  CSR referred to several authorities indicating that the Category   documents are not protected from disclosure by the doctrine of legal professional privilege  see  e g  Eli Lilly and Company v Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals   FCA         FCR    However  those authorities do not assist CSR in relation to the question of relevance  Furthermore  even if the Category   documents were privileged  such privilege would not relieve Rockwool of any obligation to provide discovery of them citedMulley v Manifold   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is convenient to deal with Categories   to   of the claimed further discovery together  as they fall under the general rubric of Project Sleipner activities  I am not persuaded that the documents in respect of which further discovery is sought in those four categories are documents which fall within the reach of O   r   of the Rules  There is no material which  to my mind  reveals that Rockwool has not addressed in its discovery the prior art directly relevant to the assertion that the alleged inventions are not novel  Indeed  as I understood the submissions for CSR  the dispute arises because it claims that an incorrect assessment has been made by Rockwool about the materiality of the documents in Categories   to   rather than that their relevance has not been assessed at all by Rockwool  Of course  Rockwool s assessment of the extent to which such documents should be discovered is not conclusive  That is a matter for the Court  But  on the other hand  the existence of a document or documents which possibly touch upon an issue in question in the proceeding is not itself sufficient to order its discovery  Mulley v Manifold   HCA         CLR   at      That is a matter to be decided by the Court from the pleadings and the evidence on the application citedAstra National Productions Ltd v Neo Art Productions Ltd   WN   The class of the first category of documents  in my view  is not  by its description or by such information as there is as to its likely contents  of such a nature as to satisfy the  relevance  hurdle of O   r    The conferences and meetings referred to  and including the presentations by an employee or employees of Rockwool in April   and in September   are obviously not confined to the product claims concerning MMV fibres in Rockwool Patent   or the method of producing MMV fibres in Rockwool Patent    The fact that  at such conferences and meetings  there would have been information sharing between informed persons in the general industry does not indicate or tend to indicate that the information included information about the prior art concerning or leading up to the particular claims made in the two patents  Accordingly  I do not consider that there is a prima facie case that the conferences and meetings included in the exposure of information concerning whether the claimed inventions the subject of those patents involved an inventive step compared to the prior art  It is a case of the material relied upon by CSR not taking me over that threshold test  See the discussion by Tomlin J in Astra National Productions Ltd v Neo Art Productions Ltd   WN   at     That conclusion reflects the view I have come to  notwithstanding the careful and helpful submissions of senior counsel for CSR  that discovery in this matter should be confined to documents which relate directly to the particular issues concerning the validity of the two Rockwool patents in suit  and that wider inquiry of material concerning Project Sleipner generally or relating to other fibres or processes than the particular products and process the subject of the two patents will not expose documents which fall within the coverage of O   r   of the Rules   I have reached the same conclusion in relation to the Category   documents  insofar as CSR contended that they may expose that the claimed characteristics of elements of the Rockwool Patents were previously well known and recognised by manufacturers of MMV fibres  so that documents of that class may support CSR s third ground of alleged invalidity  It is necessary for a prima facie case to be made out that the category of documents sought to be discovered  including of the two particular presentations specified  may adversely affect the case of Rockwool or may support the case of CSR  I am not satisfied that they might do so
