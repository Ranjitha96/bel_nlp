Following protracted negotiations the parties have now resolved their differences and executed a deed of settlement  However  the question of the costs of the proceeding remains in issue   The applicant submits that the respondent should pay all of its costs  or alternatively all of its costs up to and including the injunction application  The respondent s case is that the applicant should
