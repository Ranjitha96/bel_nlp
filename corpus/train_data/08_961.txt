Boyn v Schering Pty Ltd   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedAustralian Iron   Steel Pty Ltd v Banovic   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  He submits that Australian Iron   Steel Pty Ltd v Banovic   HCA         CLR     Banovic   bears some similarity to the present case  although it was concerned with discrimination on the ground of sex under the Anti Discrimination Act    NSW   AD Act   I refer to this case below   Banovic   relied on by Mr Boyn  is distinguishable  In that case  all of the relevant conduct occurred after the commencement of the Anti Discrimination Act    NSW   the AD Act    In Banovic   Australian Iron   Steel Pty Ltd  AIS  operated a steel works at Port Kembla  New South Wales  All of the following events occurred after June   the date of the entry into operation of the AD Act  Until mid   AIS pursued recruitment practices that resulted in women constituting a very small proportion of the AIS ironworker workforce  Another result of those practices was that the waiting time for employment as an ironworker was considerably higher for women than for men  In mid   AIS changed its practice as a result of which the number of women employed as iron workers increased  both in terms of absolute numbers and also as a proportion of the total ironworker workforce  Still  however  the waiting time for women as compared with the men was vastly disproportionate  being measured in years rather than a few days or weeks   A downturn occurred in the steel industry in   and AIS ceased recruiting new iron workers from September of that year  The downturn continued  In October   AIS announced that it would be retrenching iron workers as from   November   on the basis of  last on  first off   AIS in fact retrenched those iron workers who commenced work after   January    Eight female iron workers who were retrenched complained of unlawful discrimination on the ground of their sex  By a   majority  the High Court held that although the  last on  first off  principle was in itself unobjectionable  it exacerbated the adverse effects of past discriminatory practices by AIS  and so it was open to the Equal Opportunity Tribunal to find  in respect of retrenchments  that the past discrimination on the ground of sex was repeated   The facts are distinguishable from those of the present case because the earlier discriminatory hiring practice of AIS  as well as the implementation of the  last on first off  policy  post dated the commencement of the AD Act  and because the implementation of that policy was able to be regarded as repeating the discrimination involved in the hiring practice  In the present case  the statement of claim does not allege any discriminatory treatment by Schering of Mr Boyn as compared with Schering s treatment of other people after the Act commenced to operate on   June     I do not find it necessary to deal with Schering s second and third attacks on the statement of claim distinct from its first attack  It suffices to say that once it is accepted that  immediately before the commencement of the Act on   June   there was in place a superannuation scheme that Mr Boyn had voluntarily joined and about which he had no legal cause of complaint at that time  one searches in vain for subsequent conduct by Schering that fits the descriptions contained in ss   and   of the Act  Mr Boyn s complaint seems to be simply that Schering did not choose to make a  top up superannuation payment  that would have made the amount received by Mr Boyn equal to some unidentified amount payable to some unidentified person or group who were at some unidentified time younger to some unidentified extent than Mr Schering   On my understanding of the facts  I do not think that the statement of claim can be amended so as to plead  in respect of superannuation  unlawful discrimination by Schering occurring after   June   and falling within ss   and   of the Act  However  I am reluctant to deny Mr Boyn the opportunity of amending the statement of claim in an attempt to support the claim in respect of superannuation  I will allow him that opportunity  Before taking advantage of it  however  I strongly urge that Mr Boyn and those advising him should consider carefully the question whether facts can be pleaded showing a case falling within ss   and   of the Act consisting of conduct by Schering after   June   citedMaxwell v Murphy     CLR   It is common ground that in order to succeed on his claim under the Act  Mr Boyn must be able to establish that Schering unlawfully discriminated against him on the ground of his age in one of the respects identified in paras  a   b  and  d  of s   of the Act  see   above it is common ground that para  c  is irrelevant  after the Act commenced operation on   June   for example  see Maxwell v Murphy     CLR   at    However  the statement of claim does not allege facts falling within s   and s   of the Act occurring after that date  There is no pleading of the conduct of Schering after   June   that amounted to Schering having treated Mr Boyn less favourably than  in circumstances that were the same or not materially different  Schering had  after   June   treated or proposed to treat persons of a different age after   June    see s   of the Act
