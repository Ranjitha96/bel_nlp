Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  These circumstances raise an issue as to the nature of this application  An order dismissing an application for an order nisi is interlocutory  see NAHQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at       Accordingly  leave to appeal is required by s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The applicant has not obtained leave to appeal   However  counsel for the first respondent informed the Court that the first respondent did not oppose this application being treated as an application for leave to appeal  I have proceeded on that basis and will treat this application as an application for leave to appeal citedDecor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   An application for leave to appeal falls to be determined by reference to the principles established by the Full Court s decision in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR    That case applied a two limbed test to determine when leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision should be granted  First  the decision below must be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by this Court  secondly  substantial injustice must be demonstrated if leave were to be refused  supposing the decision to be wrong  at     The principal submission made on behalf of the first respondent was that the applicant has not satisfied the first of these requirements  That is  the first respondent submitted that the Federal Magistrate s decision is not attended with sufficient doubt as to warrant its reconsideration by this Court   It is convenient to note the origins of this proceeding  The applicant filed an application in the High Court for an order nisi on   April   which was remitted to the Federal Court by Heydon J on   August    The matter was remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court by Emmett J on   August   citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The question whether conduct is sufficiently serious to amount to persecution is a factual matter for the Tribunal  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS   FCAFC   at         Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Kord   FCA         FCR   at          On a fair reading of the Tribunal s reasons  the reference to harassment and discrimination not reaching a sufficient level of seriousness to be characterised as persecution referred to the harassment and discrimination suffered by the applicant and his family after the war  In my view  the Tribunal s reference was not directed to the physical assault that the applicant suffered  In any event  I am not satisfied that the Tribunal s findings of fact were unreasonable or erroneous or not reasonably open to it

citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second ground relied upon by the applicant is that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in applying s  R a  of the Act  The applicant submitted that the Tribunal found that the essential and significant motivation for the harm feared by the applicant was that criminals wanted to take control of his family s assets  According to the applicant  the Tribunal arrived at this conclusion erroneously by considering the  primary motivating factor  in the actions taken by the criminals  In substance  the applicant s argument is that the expression  primary motivating factor  departed from the language of the Act and led the Tribunal to address the wrong question  giving rise to a jurisdictional error  cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR     The Tribunal s reasons for decision ought not to be read in an over technical or pedantic way  They must be read fairly and in context  The expression  primary motivating factor  was used by the Tribunal on one occasion  Elsewhere in its reasons  both before and afterwards  the Tribunal used the phrase  the essential and significant reason  or  the essential and significant motivation   These expressions correctly reflect the test that is required in relation to s  R a   I agree with the submission made on behalf of the first respondent that when the various passages in the Tribunal s reasons are considered together and in context  it becomes clear that the Tribunal applied the correct test  In my opinion  there was no error in the Tribunal s conclusion that the applicant s evidence concerning what happened to his family strongly suggest that the essential and significant reason for these events was that criminals wanted to take control of his family s assets   This conclusion was reached by Scarlett FM and I agree with his Honour s reasons citedHtun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at   The third ground raised by the applicant was that the Tribunal did not adequately consider whether or not the State of Bangladesh had tolerated  condoned or was complicit in the criminal activities of Mohammed Ali and his associates  The applicant submitted that the Tribunal had therefore failed to deal with the integers of the applicant s claim  thereby constituting a jurisdictional error  Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at     W  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALD   at     SAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     The applicant contended that the criminal activities directed at his family were instigated  and were successful  because the criminals knew that the State would fail to offer protection to the applicant and his family due to their Pakistani ethnicity  The applicant
