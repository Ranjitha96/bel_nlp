make the following observations    The conduct of the first respondent as described earlier in this judgment represents multiple breaches of the service provider rules under the Act  including improper imposition of fees  failures to comply with the TIO scheme  and failures to comply with specified directions of the applicant  It is not in dispute that the second respondent  in his role as

the contravening conduct of the first respondent  This conduct of both respondents represented deliberate contravention of the Act over several years     The applicant makes no claim that any substantive loss or damage was suffered as a result of the relevant contraventions  or that monetary amounts to which the relevant conduct related were substantial  However I consider that the matter is significant because of the four separate types of conduct pleaded  and that it is appropriate to order relief to ensure that the particular conduct does not recur     It is not in dispute that the respondents have not previously been found by the Court in proceedings under the Act to have engaged in similar conduct     The contravention of the legislation by the first respondent arose from conduct of the second respondent  who was clearly in a senior management role in the first respondent     It is common ground that the first respondent does not presently operate as an internet
