Gryst v Dromana Estate Limited  ACN       in the matter of Dromana Estate Limited   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The short point raised in this matter is whether Dromana s failure to comply with a stale statutory demand without more can found Mr Gryst s application to have it wound up in insolvency under Ch   Pt     of the Corporations Act   The provisions of that Part have been the subject of considerable judicial attention most recently by the High Court in Aussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR    To foreshadow what I have to say  central to the scheme of that Part is the device of the statutory demand the failure to comply with which  unless successfully challenged  gives rise both to a basis for winding up a company in insolvency and the s  C a  presumption of insolvency   By way of background s  F and s  G of the Act provide         F  If  as at the end of the period for compliance with a statutory demand  the demand is still in effect and the company has not complied with it  the company is taken to fail to comply with the demand at the end of that period       F  The period for compliance with a statutory demand is           a  if the company applies in accordance with section  G for an order setting aside the demand   i  if  on hearing the application under section  G  or on an application by the company under this paragraph  the Court makes an order that extends the period for compliance with the demand the period specified in the order  or in the last such order  as the case requires  as the period for such compliance  or  ii  otherwise the period beginning on the day when the demand is served and ending   days after the application under section  G is finally determined or otherwise disposed of  or  b  otherwise   days after the demand is served  SECTION  G COMPANY MAY APPLY        G  A company may apply to the Court for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on the company       G  An application may only be made within   days after the demand is so served       G  An application is made in accordance with this section only if  within those   days           a  an affidavit supporting the application is filed with the Court  and  b  a copy of the application  and a copy of the supporting affidavit  are served on the person who served the demand on the company   The two noteworthy aspects of these provisions for present purposes are  first  that the s  F  period for compliance with a statutory demand turns in the first instance on whether or not a company has applied  in accordance with section  G  to set aside the demand and  secondly  it will only have so applied in accordance with that section if it complies with the dual requirements of filing and service specified in s  G a  and  b  within   days of the service of the demand   It is now well settled that  if a s  G application and affidavit are not filed and served within the time so specified  the Court has no power to extend the period for the making of such an application  see Aussie Vic Plant Hire at   David Grant   Co Pty Limited  rec apptd  v Westpac Banking Corporation     CLR    In the present matter  the statutory demand was served on Dromana on   November    The application to set it aside was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria on   December    It was not served on Mr Gryst until   December    In consequence  that application was not one made  in accordance with section  G  of the Act  The emphatic language of s  G  admits of no other conclusion  see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd     FLR   Deputy

clarity citedRe Turf Enterprises Pty Ltd   Qd R   I have already indicated that the plaintiff has not sought to rely upon any other basis for winding up Dromana than its failure to comply with the statutory demand  Shorn of the presumption of insolvency  that application has been so narrowly drawn as to be doomed to failure  see Ford s Principles of Corporations Law at      While on a s  P application the Court may order that an insolvent company be wound up in insolvency  see s  A  there is no evidentiary basis before me that could suggest insolvency  other than the non compliance itself  When viewed in the context of the affidavit evidence that has been filed in support of  and in opposition to  the present application  the position is no different  A serious dispute exists between the parties  But Dromana s insolvency is not suggested  cf Re Turf Enterprises Pty Ltd   Qd R    Perhaps it was for this reason that counsel for Mr Gryst apparently accepted that the originating process as it stands could not succeed without the aid of the presumption  I am thus in the position of being satisfied in the circumstances that Mr Gryst has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting his s  P application   I will in consequence order under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act that the originating process be dismissed  I have directed the parties to file and serve submissions relating to costs citedTokich Holdings Pty Ltd v Sheraton Constructions  NSW  Pty Ltd  in liq      FLR   I would add that I have indicated that I would not at this late stage grant leave to amend the originating process to add other possible bases for winding up Dromana in insolvency  cf s  B of the Corporations Act   Undoubtedly a serious dispute exists between the parties and on substantial grounds  as to Mr Gryst s claims and Dromana s offsetting claim against him  I seriously doubt whether proceedings for winding up in insolvency is an appropriate vehicle in which to resolve what appears to be no more than a commercial dispute  cf Tokich Holdings Pty Ltd v Sheraton Constructions  NSW  Pty Ltd  in liq      FLR   at   ff    I certify that the preceding
