SZLJK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj     CLR   In my opinion  the present case is to be contrasted with that which came before the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj     CLR    In that case the Immigration Review Tribunal  the procedural fairness requirements for which were materially analogous  came to decide a review application in ignorance of a request which had been made on behalf of the review applicant for a later hearing date because of an inability to attend the scheduled hearing  Because of an internal error within the Immigration Review Tribunal  that letter requesting the later hearing was not drawn to the Immigration Review Tribunal member s attention before the case was decided  Later  following representations by the visa applicant s agent  the Immigration Review Tribunal did hold a further hearing and made a second decision which was in favour of the visa applicant  The High Court by majority held that the Immigration Review Tribunal had power to make that second decision  Indeed  having regard to the reasons for judgment of certain members comprising the majority  the Immigration Review Tribunal s first decision was no decision at all because a requirement of the governing provisions had not been observed   Here  though  a hearing was offered  It is just that the invitation was not availed of and the Tribunal then went on to decide the case on the basis of the material which it had before it   Section  A of the Migration Act makes provision for this type of situation  That section reads as follows        If the applicant             a  is invited under section   to appear before the Tribunal  and   b  does not appear before the Tribunal on the day on which or at the time and place at which the applicant is scheduled to appear            the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it     This section does not prevent the Tribunal from rescheduling the applicant s appearance before or from delaying its decision on the review in order to enable the applicant s appearance before it as rescheduled citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The granting of a protection visa requires the engendering of a state of satisfaction on the part of the Minister or his delegates  There are authorities in this Court which stand  with respect unremarkably  for the proposition that it would be difficult for the Tribunal to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction  standing as it does in the place of the Minister if an applicant does not put before the Tribunal sufficient information  for example  because of an absence of attendance at a hearing  Without that  satisfaction  engendered on the part of the Tribunal  the visa application has to be rejected see amongst the authorities for this Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of     FCAFC   per Black CJ  Sundberg and Bennett JJ citedNAFX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Indeed  some judges have gone so far as to regard the rejection of an application in that circumstance as an  inevitable consequence  of non attendance at a hearing see NAFX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at para    The bare statement provided in the visa application did not  for example  provide any basis for satisfaction in respect of an inability for the Appellants to secure state protection   In these circumstances and hard though it may be  the result on the appeal is  in my opinion  clear  It must  for reasons which I have given  be dismissed   The orders that I make in the appeal are     The appeal is dismissed      The Appellants are to pay the First Respondent s costs of and incidental to the appeal which are fixed in the amount of
