Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  No     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton   Co   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Of particular importance in this case is the use by Darrell Lea of darker shades of purple in the packaging of its seasonal chocolate products at Christmas in the years      Darrell Lea used a purple and bronze copper theme in association with Darrell Lea signage and brand usage  The purple is like that used by Cadbury  It is distinct from the lighter shade boysenberry  This was the only evidence isolating a specific decision by Darrell Lea to use purple  If this decision were made with the intention of misleading consumers into thinking that Darrell Lea products were associated with Cadbury  that would be strong evidence that such misleading in fact occurred  Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton   Co   HCA         CLR   at     The primary evidence as to this matter was given by Ms Anne McGlinchey who is currently an independent marketing and retail consultant but worked for Darrell Lea and an associated company from   to    In particular from January   after returning from maternity leave  she was Darrell Lea s Marketing Manager until she left the company in October     When Ms McGlinchey commenced her duties as Marketing Manager she reported to Mr Bruce Goldman the then General Manager of Retail and Marketing  At the time she believed that the Darrell Lea shops looked  tired and dowdy and needed to be freshened and updated   There were too many different colours used  products were too difficult to find and the store layout was not clear  Each store presented its own range of in store gifts which differed not only from one store to another but also within stores   While Ms McGlinchey did not have the power to make the ultimate decision on colour choice  she was a key figure in the process and on her unchallenged evidence the genesis of the idea for the Christmas   colour scheme was hers  Darrell Lea also called Ms Hurst  who took over Ms McGlinchey s position  and Mr Michael Lea  one of the two directors of the company and who has had a lifetime s experience in its business  Mr Jason Lea  Mr Michael Lea s cousin  who was a director at the time of the   Christmas planning  has recently died  If one accepts Ms McGlinchey  Ms Ettia and Ms Hurst  as I do  as truthful and reliable witnesses  it just seems inherently unlikely that Mr Goldman or Mr Tolmie would have harboured  unbeknowns to Ms McGlinchey  Ms Ettia and Ms Hurst  a secret purpose to misappropriate Cadbury s business by deliberately misleading consumers  As Walton makes clear  this would be the act of a dishonest trader  An allegation of such a kind falls to be assessed in the light of the rule in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   citedJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii

from the rule in Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR    In Heydon  Cross on Evidence     th Australian ed    at   the learned author says        while the rule in Jones v Dunkel permits an inference that the untendered evidence would not have helped the party who failed to tender it  and entitles the trier of fact to take that into account in deciding whether to accept any particular evidence which relates to a matter on which the absent witness could have spoken  and the more readily to draw any inference fairly to be drawn from the other evidence by reason of the opponent being able to prove the contrary had the party chosen to give or call evidence  the rule does not permit an inference that the untendered evidence would in fact have been damaging to the party not tendering it  The rule cannot be employed to fill gaps in the evidence  or to convert conjecture and suspicion into evidence    And as the learned author had earlier said  at   in formulating the basic rule  failure to call a witness   may   not must  in appropriate circumstances   lead to the inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted that party s case   emphasis added  citedBriginshaw v Briginshaw

Chocolate Sensory Study  consumer research report commissioned by it in August   and conducted in October   by Ms Caroline Shelton of National Field Services  The research methodology was provided by a firm called QBrand Consulting after consultation with Professor Roger Layton  Emeritus Professor of Marketing at the University of New South Wales   Although by this time the trial date had already been fixed and the survey was obviously conducted for the purpose of the trial  Cadbury did not comply with Practice Note No   issued by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court in   which provides       Survey evidence     There are many problems in obtaining acceptable survey evidence including the use of relevant and unambiguous questions and whether the actual conduct of the survey  including methodology  is satisfactory      The admissibility of surveys is always a matter for the trial Judge to determine but the risk of the survey being rejected or given little  if any  weight at the trial may be diminished if the following procedure when a party seeks to have a survey conducted  Subject to other directions of the Court in the particular case  the Court expects that this practice will usually be followed         Notice should be given in writing by the party seeking to have the survey conducted to the other parties to the proceeding         The notice should give an outline of       a  the purpose of the proposed survey    b  the issue to which it is to be directed    c  the proposed form and methodology    d  the particular questions that will be asked        e  the introductory statements or instructions that will be given to the persons conducting the survey        f  other controls to be used in the interrogation process             The parties should attempt to resolve any disagreement concerning the manner in which the survey is to be conducted and any of the matters mentioned in   above         The matter of the survey should be raised with the Court at the directions hearing as soon as possible after the steps mentioned above have been taken    No explanation was proffered for this non compliance  which was obviously a deliberate choice by Cadbury and its advisors   Ms Shelton arranged for   participants to attend at her firm s premises  They were selected at random from the Melbourne Telephone Directory  Seventy one per cent were female  They were screened to exclude  amongst other things  people who did not buy chocolate at all or who bought an excessive amount of chocolate  Participants were shown different forms of chocolate  blocks  Easter eggs etc  in batches with wrappings in different colours  one colour for each batch blue  gold  purple  red and green  In fact  all chocolate was from Cadbury  although there was nothing to

Squash Co Ltd   RPC   at     This is purely a question of fact  Thus in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v The Pub Squash Co Ltd   RPC   at     Powell J  in a judgment upheld by the Privy Council  held that although the plaintiff s soft drink  Solo  in a lemon coloured can had achieved a level of recognition and acceptance  it did not follow that the proprietor of  Solo  thereby became entitled to a monopoly in yellow coloured cans or that the mere fact the defendant adopted a yellow can for its product dictated a finding of passing off  In other words  it may not be enough that a particular colour is associated in the mind of consumers with a particular product  In the present case  purple may prompt in the reasonable consumers  mind a remembrance that purple has been associated with Cadbury chocolate  but not necessarily the conclusion that the purple packaged product presented for sale to him or her therefore must be Cadbury s   In the present case Cadbury s own evidence  see   above  speaks of the elements in the  brand architecture  the name Cadbury  the colour purple  the glass and a half device etc  The architectural metaphor is apt  The architecture of a building involves the whole  not just one component such as a roof or wall  Cadbury s marketing shows how the name Cadbury and the colour purple are inextricably intertwined  with each one reinforcing the other and creating a total impact more than the sum of the parts  This is particularly striking in the late  s commercials which had not only extensive use of purple but the repetitive mantra  Cadbury is chocolate is Cadbury is chocolate   In any case  since Cadbury is without doubt one of the most well  and favourably  known names in all consumer marketing  and dominates the field of chocolate in Australia  it would be irrational in the extreme for Cadbury not to make the maximum use of the name   In cross examination Mr Nowicki was pressed to think of an example where the colour purple alone would be used for Cadbury with no indicia of branding such as the Cadbury name and the glass and a half device  There was a noticeable pause  perhaps upwards of half a minute  Eventually Mr Nowicki gave as an example the television show  Dancing with the Stars  on Channel   which he said      integrated into that show is specific uses of the colour purple as brand indicia in areas that the production company would not enable us to use other elements of our branding    He was asked       There s two indicia used  the show is brought to you by Cadbury and in the background is the is the purple colour     No  within the show specifically  within the production itself there are components independently where we only use purple      Mr Nowicki had previously said that the  show itself is brought to you by Cadbury   No program of  Dancing with the Stars  was in evidence  but if Cadbury were paying substantial amounts to sponsor a high rating television show it is inconceivable that the name Cadbury would not be transmitted aurally and visually to viewers  even if some elements of the show  such as sets and costumes  contained only purple  If all that viewers saw in a program about dancing was some use of purple  why should they think of chocolate at all  let alone Cadbury chocolate  I am not satisfied that  Dancing with the Stars  is a true example of the purple colour alone used without the name Cadbury   Shortly after that passage of evidence there was a mid morning break  Upon resumption  Mr Nowicki volunteered that he had thought of another example where purple alone was used  The example he gave was the   Manchester Commonwealth Games where the Queen s baton was purple as part of the Cadbury marketing plan associated with the event  This would have been a transient use  in the most literal sense   I conclude that  for all practical purposes  Cadbury s use of the colour purple in marketing  promotion  advertising  packaging  and point of sale is always associated with the famous name Cadbury  What Cadbury said in its final submissions as to marketing and sponsorship activities  triathlons  Sydney Olympics etc  is true generally of Cadbury in the marketplace     Each of these activities involve the use of Cadbury purple in connection with  Cadbury   followedGeneral Electric Co v General Electric Co Ltd     WLR   at   The likely behaviour of

not only for its statement of the law but for its reminder that these kinds of cases turn essentially on their own particular facts  His Lordship said     Although your Lordships were referred in the course of argument to a large number of reported cases  this is not a branch of the law in which reference to other cases is of any real assistance except analogically  It has been observed more than once that the questions which arise are in general questions of fact  Neither the appellants nor the respondents contend that the principles of law are in any doubt  The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition   no man may pass off his goods as those of another  More specifically  it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed  These are three in number  First  he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying get up  whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description  or the individual features of labelling or packaging  under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public  such that the get up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff s goods or services  Secondly  he must demonstrate a representation by the defendant to the public  whether or not intentional  leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff  Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial  as long as they are identified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff s  For example  if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description  it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name  Thirdly  he must demonstrate that he suffers  or  in a quia timert action  that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant s goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff   The findings above lead to these conclusions  Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market  yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names  They have distinct identities in the market place  Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate  Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple  or any other colour  as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury  I am not satisfied that this has occurred  or is likely to occur   There will be an order that the application be dismissed  Darrell Lea foreshadowed an application for indemnity costs  The question of costs will be adjourned to a date to be fixed  Outlines of submissions are to be filed by Darrell Lea seven days and by Cadbury three days before the adjourned date     I certify that the preceding one
