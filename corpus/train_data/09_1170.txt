Zhang v Commissioner  Australian Federal Police   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAdler v Gardiner   FCA       ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe extent of the authority conferred   and the conclusion that those executing a warrant do not have an   unexaminable discretion     was endorsed by Hely J in Adler v Gardiner   FCA       ACSR   at   to   as follows  citation omitted      The objective inquiry           The executing officer or constable assisting  has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that things seized will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence  The notion of reasonable grounds for a suspicion imports an objective test  but  reasonable  involves a value or normative judgment   Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption     NSWLR   at   and there may well be legitimate differences of opinion as to what falls within the term  particularly when it is used in relation to a nebulous expression such as  suspicion   A court is not entitled to substitute its own opinion on that question for the opinion of the executing officer or constable assisting  That does not mean that the executing officer  or constable assisting  has an unexaminable discretion  it does mean  however  that the officer s decision is only impeachable if the decision was one which the officer could not lawfully reach on the materials before him or her                    The onus  then  is on the applicants to establish that the seizure decisions taken in relation to the disputed documents were infected by reviewable error      Notwithstanding the conclusion that it is unnecessary to resolve the Applicants  submission as to the warrants being   bad on their face   considerable concern is nevertheless expressed as to the guidance which warrants of such complexity provide to those executing them and in protecting those whose premises are being searched  It was perhaps in recognition of the complexity presented by the warrants that a briefing session was held prior to   April   with a view to better informing those persons who would be involved in the events

conferred by these provisions only assumes additional importance when it is recalled that a search warrant may be issued and executed in respect to premises occupied by persons other than those involved or suspected of being involved in criminal activity  Where the terms of s  E are satisfied  a warrant may thus be issued in respect to premises occupied by persons unconnected with any crime

Wales  Ltd v Jones     QB  For the purposes of the present interlocutory application  it is unnecessary to do more than refer to the breadth of the authority conferred by s  F and to the constraints imposed upon that authority  The authority conferred is that conferred upon the   executing officer or a constable assisting    It is not an authority to seize only that which a Court subsequently concludes falls within the terms of the warrant  But the extent of the authority conferred by s  F is constrained by the requirement that the   executing officer   or   constable assisting   only seize that which he   believes on reasonable grounds   is relevantly either   evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates   or   evidential material in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence    In the absence of the   executing officer   or   constable   forming such a belief on   reasonable grounds   the warrant confers no authority to seize anything  No authority has been conferred by the legislature or by the warrants to enter a person s premises and to seize at random documents or things which may be believed to be of interest  There must always remain   reasonable grounds   for the belief set forth in s  F d   Authority to seize things other than those described in the warrant  cf Chic Fashions  West Wales  Ltd v Jones     QB   at   is now expressly addressed in s  F d ii   But that authority also remains confined by the requirement that there be   reasonable grounds   for the belief that is formed and by the requirement that the thing seized be   in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence   citedCitibank Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR  Prior to his attendance at those premises  Mr Caplice had a telephone conversation with the Eighth Respondent  Mr Alan Crowe  Mr Caplice requested an opportunity to   review any materials seized under the search warrants so that they can assert any claims they may have for legal professional privilege    A request that   the search be suspended for a short period of time so that we can properly advise our clients and get instructions   was denied  A search undertaken with a view to precluding meaningful access to legal advice and the opportunity to claim legal professional privilege may render unlawful a search undertaken  Citibank Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR     Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd     FCR    But such is not the present case citedCoward v Allen   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFirst  Senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondents quite properly relied upon the public interest in permitting those responsible for enforcement of the criminal law to continue their investigations  This consideration was rightly advanced as of relevance to both the discretion to grant interlocutory relief and to the discretion to grant an extension of time pursuant to s  c  of the Judicial Review Act   In Coward v Allen   FCA         ALR   Northrop J had concluded in respect to a warrant issued under the now repealed s   of the Crimes Act that there was a serious question to be tried in relation   to the manner in which the warrants were executed and whether the seizure of things was valid       ALR at    His Honour nevertheless declined relief  In doing so His Honour concluded      In my opinion  the motions for interlocutory injunctions should be refused  The balance of convenience weighs in favour of the respondents  In the public interest  they should have a reasonable time to examine the things seized  to decide whether to prosecute or not  and to retain the things needed as evidence in support of any prosecutions  The other things should be returned to the applicants  The court hearing those criminal proceedings may have to determine  on the principles expressed in Bunning v Cross   whether evidence obtained by means of the search warrants is admissible or not  Any civil action arising from the seizure could be continued at the conclusion of those criminal proceedings  If no prosecutions are commenced  the applicants would be free to continue with their actions based on the unlawful execution of the warrants  In the meantime  the public interest requires that the respondents to the actions should be able to continue their investigations  Accordingly  the motions for interlocutory injunctions are refused        A valuable safeguard which adequately protected the interests of those whose property was wrongly seized lay  it was said  in the discretion of the Court   should there be a prosecution   to exclude such evidence  In the context of considering whether documents should be returned  in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALR   at   Hill J likewise observed      I am thus placed in the situation where there are competing views  although it must be said that the preponderance of view is in favour of refusing to order the return of items  even where those items have been illegally seized  if there are criminal proceedings pending in which the items may be used as evidence  While the court would not wish to be seen to be rewarding members of the police who obtain possession of material without lawful authority  there is to be weighed against that a public interest in the administration of and non interference with justice  Should the court order that material  albeit invalidly obtained  to be used in evidence in a pending prosecution be delivered up to those from whom it was taken the prosecution  which might otherwise succeed  could be frustrated          Of course  the question whether the items in the present case  if otherwise admissible  should be admitted in evidence in the pending prosecution  despite the fact that they were obtained without lawful authority  will be a matter for the judicial officer hearing the prosecution  Bunning v Cross   HCA         CLR       ALR    The existence of this discretion suggests to me that I should not interfere with the pending prosecution by requiring the documents seized to be returned but leave instead to the judicial officer presiding on that prosecution the question whether the material illegally obtained should be admitted into evidence in the prosecution  The importance of the enforcement of the criminal law may readily be accepted  It is self evidently in the public interest that those who commit criminal offences should be brought to account  Those who commit fraud  including a fraud upon the public revenue  should be brought to account  It is equally of importance that those investigating suspected criminal conduct be able to exercise all powers as are conferred upon them by the legislature to access materials and to secure the availability of all materials lawfully seized for the purposes of any subsequent proceeding  But it is not considered that either Northrop J or Hill J was attempting to do anything other than to recognise that aspect of the public interest and apply it to the facts before them appliedCrowley v Murphy   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhen addressing the terms of the now repealed s   in Crowley v Murphy   FCA         ALR     Lockhart J addressed some of the principles relevant to the manner in which a search warrant is executed as follows      I will not attempt to state exhaustively the procedures that policemen should follow when executing search warrants  That would be both unnecessary and undesirable  What should be done must vary according to the circumstances of each case  But I shall endeavour to give some general guidance          First  like most statutory powers  the power of enforcing a search warrant must be exercised in good faith          Second  the power must be exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred  It must not be used for some ulterior purpose  If  for example  it is used to punish the person whose premises are to be entered and searched  plainly that is an ulterior purpose          Third  the power must be exercised fairly  having regard to all the circumstances          Fourth  it must be exercised having regard to those affected by its exercise and  in particular  to the rights of those persons  I shall return to this later          Fifth  the officer executing the warrant must strictly follow the directions contained in it and must not exceed the limits of the authority it confers         Northrop J agreed      ALR at    The same principles  it is considered  are equally applicable to a warrant issued under s  E and executed under s  F citedDifferent Solutions Pty Ltd v Australian Federal Police  No     FCA  http www austlii

and R D Nicholson JJ  Notwithstanding s  K  the power to seize still derives primarily from s  F and the language of s  K is   quite specific   Hart   FCAFC   at       FCR at    French  Sackville and R D Nicholson JJ  in the context of addressing a different issue to that now before the Court  nevertheless there observed        Where s  K is relied upon  seizure is deferred until the completion of the examination of things moved from the warrant premises under that section       T he section involves a distinction between moving things from the warrant premises to another place for examination  on the one hand  and seizure of those things  on the other  Section  K does not specify any time period for the completion of the examination  However  it is ancillary to s  F  It confers no free standing power of seizure  The purpose of the examination or processing which it authorises under s  K  is to determine whether the things which have been moved from the premises  may be seized under the warrant   The power to seize still derives from s  F  It therefore exists only in relation to a  warrant that is in force   The warrant remains in force only for the period specified in it  s  E   If seizure has not been made of things moved under s  K within the period stated in the warrant  then the power to seize lapses  If examination has not been completed the power to examine also lapses  Absent any other lawful basis for retaining the things moved  they must be returned                 The respondents contended that s  K  authorises not only the removal to another place of computers or storage devices in or on which electronic material is stored  but the copying of such material onto storage devices brought to the premises for the purpose and the removal from the premises of those devices  It is a fundamental difficulty in the path of this approach to the construction of s  K  that the language of the subsection is quite specific  It provides that  in certain circumstances   the things may be moved to another place   The provision only authorises the moving of a thing to another place for the purpose described  The fact that the legislation  by virtue of the definition of  evidential material  contemplates that material in electronic form  may be  seized   without identifying the manner by which it may be seized  does not demonstrate that material in electronic form can be  moved  in accordance with s  K  of the Crimes Act        Their Honours there also referred to the   need to recognise the operational realities in which warrants are executed     FCAFC   at       FCR at    One purpose achieved by provisions such as ss  H and  P is to ensure that the occupier or other person is fully informed as to the extent of the authority conferred by a warrant  He is thereby placed in a position whereby he can observe that the terms of a warrant are not being exceeded  The statement in the warrant of those matters required by s  E a  and  c  and the requirement that a copy of the warrant be made available  ensure that the occupier or other person is not reduced to a mere bystander  Just as the issue of a warrant may be challenged in an appropriate Court upon the basis  for example  that the issuing officer erred when reaching the state of   satisfaction   required by s  E    the manner in which a warrant is executed may also be challenged upon the basis  for example  that there did not exist   reasonable grounds   for seizing materials as required by s  F d   Section  L imposes its own further constraints upon the power that

required by s  L  with a view to determining what may be found upon the   hard drives    Again  at a final hearing that part of the conversation deposed to by Mr Mazzoni may be put in a broader context  And s  L A  may not clothe the Respondents with sufficient authority to copy the data on the disks in the manner in which they did  Irrespective of whether   data   is to be construed in the manner as concluded by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker   FCA   at       FCR   at   to   the issue which gives rise to the serious question to be tried remains a question as to whether the manner of execution of the warrants was such as to provide   reasonable grounds   for the belief referred to in s  L A   Nor is it considered that s  K necessarily provides the authority to remove   the servers and some of the hard drives    Such evidence as there presently is available provides little basis for any conclusion to be reached that it was   significantly more practicable   to move equipment for the purposes of s  K a i   Forensic experts were assisting in the search  And  even if s  K a i  was satisfied  there remains concern as to whether s  K a ii  had been satisfied  On either view  it is considered that at this stage a serious question arises in respect to whether the manner in which the warrant was executed on the O Keefe s Lane premises in respect to the computers found on those premises has exceeded the authority conferred by the legislation and by the terms of the warrant as issued  Section   of the Judicial Review Act provides for the manner in which an application under that Act is to be made and s  c  imposes   inter alia   a requirement to lodge an Application in the Registry within   days of the decision the subject of review  It is ss     and   of that Act that confer jurisdiction upon this Court pursuant to the terms of that Act  If the jurisdiction of this Court which is sought to be invoked is to include that conferred by the Judicial Review Act   it may be that the Amended Application fails to comply with O   r  b  of the Federal Court Rules   cf Kennedy   FCA   at       FCR at   per Branson J  Whether any further amendment is sought to be made to the existing Amended Application   however  remains a matter for the Applicants to address and for the docket judge who has this proceeding assigned to him to resolve  Section  c  assumes present relevance because the events now the subject of the present proceeding took place on   April   and the initial Application was not lodged until   September     a period some four months out of time  Reliance upon s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth   the Judiciary Act   may not present such a problem for the Applicants   but reliance upon s  B could not permit review of the decision of the   issuing officer   to issue the warrants  that officer not being an   an officer     of the Commonwealth    If an extension of time were granted  the decisions to issue the warrants would also be susceptible to review pursuant to the Judicial Review Act   Decisions to issue warrants  it may be accepted  are decisions of an   administrative character     Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner  Australian

  may have conferred some unconstrained power or authority on this Court to grant interlocutory relief  such an assumption must be rejected  In Johns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J observed  citations omitted      The relief which may be ordered under s  d  of the AD JR  Act is not so much at large that the Court may make an order against a party to litigation even though no ground for relief under the general law is established against that party  Section  d  does not set the Court on an uncharted course without legal reference points by which to steer              However  s  d  applies only when the making of an order is  necessary to do justice between the parties   That means justice according to law  It may be that a person who acquires information knowing that the information is imparted to him in breach of a statutory duty is in the same position as he would have been if the duty were an equitable obligation of confidence              If there be no right to relief against a person under the general law  that person does not become liable to have an adverse order made under s  d  merely by reason of being joined as a

cth FCA  htmlAt one time it had been suggested that a   warrant should state the description of the offence in question with a particularity sufficient to enable the person whose premises are being searched to know the exact object of the search   Parker v Churchill   FCA         FCR   at   per Jackson J  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran     FCR   at   per Lockhart J  But there has since been a retreat from such an exacting standard  The   precision required   it has since been suggested    may vary with the nature of the offence  the other circumstances revealed  the particularity achieved in other respects  and what is disclosed by the warrant  read as a whole  and taking account of its recitals   Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police   FCA         FCR   at   per Burchett J  The objective of the requirement  however  has remained constant  The   requirement to state the offence exists to set bounds to the area of search which the execution of the warrant would involve       What is significant     is that the warrant disclose the nature of the offence in question so as to indicate the area of search   Harts Australia No       FCR at   per Hill  Cooper and Whitlam JJ appliedPrice v Elder   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn such circumstances  that inference and that alone may be sufficient to form a conclusion that the balance of convenience rests heavily in favour of the Applicants  If interlocutory relief were to be refused  any success that the Applicants may have at a final hearing would be largely rendered nugatory  cf Price v Elder   FCA   per Emmett J  The rights of individuals are not to be whittled away by conferring greater power upon those executing warrants than the already extensive power they presently possess  Damages  in such a context  may not be an adequate remedy  Such factors  however  must necessarily be taken into account together with other considerations  Also to be taken into account is the effect that the seizure of documents is having upon the business of the Applicants  That effect is not insignificant  Some significance is also to be attached to the estimated cost of about   that would be incurred by the Applicants in further reviewing the materials seized  Whether the task is as complex as is asserted and whether the costs are as high as may presently be believed may be queried  And  whatever may be the extent of those costs and whatever may be the explanation as may finally emerge  the Applicants have made decisions since April   to not challenge the validity of the warrants or the manner of their execution until now  To now raise the question of costs is a very much belated consideration that should be given less weight than had such matters been raised at the outset  But some additional costs will unquestionably be incurred and some weight can be given to that consideration when assessing the balance of convenience citedPuglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALR  First  Senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondents quite properly relied upon the public interest in permitting those responsible for enforcement of the criminal law to continue their investigations  This consideration was rightly advanced as of relevance to both the discretion to grant interlocutory relief and to the discretion to grant an extension of time pursuant to s  c  of the Judicial Review Act   In Coward v Allen   FCA         ALR   Northrop J had concluded in respect to a warrant issued under the now repealed s   of the Crimes Act that there was a serious question to be tried in relation   to the manner in which the warrants were executed and whether the seizure of things was valid       ALR at    His Honour nevertheless declined relief  In doing so His Honour concluded      In my opinion  the motions for interlocutory injunctions should be refused  The balance of convenience weighs in favour of the respondents  In the public interest  they should have a reasonable time to examine the things seized  to decide whether to prosecute or not  and to retain the things needed as evidence in support of any prosecutions  The other things should be returned to the applicants  The court hearing those criminal proceedings may have to determine  on the principles expressed in Bunning v Cross   whether evidence obtained by means of the search warrants is admissible or not  Any civil action arising from the seizure could be continued at the conclusion of those criminal proceedings  If no prosecutions are commenced  the applicants would be free to continue with their actions based on the unlawful execution of the warrants  In the meantime  the public interest requires that the respondents to the actions should be able to continue their investigations  Accordingly  the motions for interlocutory injunctions are refused        A valuable safeguard which adequately protected the interests of those whose property was wrongly seized lay  it was said  in the discretion of the Court   should there be a prosecution   to exclude such evidence  In the context of considering whether documents should be returned  in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALR   at   Hill J likewise observed      I am thus placed in the situation where there are competing views  although it must be said that the preponderance of view is in favour of refusing to order the return of items  even where those items have been illegally seized  if there are criminal proceedings pending in which the items may be used as evidence  While the court would not wish to be seen to be rewarding members of the police who obtain possession of material without lawful authority  there is to be weighed against that a public interest in the administration of and non interference with justice  Should the court order that material  albeit invalidly obtained  to be used in evidence in a pending prosecution be delivered up to those from whom it was taken the prosecution  which might otherwise succeed  could be frustrated          Of course  the question whether the items in the present case  if otherwise admissible  should be admitted in evidence in the pending prosecution  despite the fact that they were obtained without lawful authority  will be a matter for the judicial officer hearing the prosecution  Bunning v Cross   HCA         CLR       ALR    The existence of this discretion suggests to me that I should not interfere with the pending prosecution by requiring the documents seized to be returned but leave instead to the judicial officer presiding on that prosecution the question whether the material illegally obtained should be admitted into evidence in the prosecution  The importance of the enforcement of the criminal law may readily be accepted  It is self evidently in the public interest that those who commit criminal offences should be brought to account  Those who commit fraud  including a fraud upon the public revenue  should be brought to account  It is equally of importance that those investigating suspected criminal conduct be able to exercise all powers as are conferred upon them by the legislature to access materials and to secure the availability of all materials lawfully seized for the purposes of any subsequent proceeding  But it is not considered that either Northrop J or Hill J was attempting to do anything other than to recognise that aspect of the public interest and apply it to the facts before them
