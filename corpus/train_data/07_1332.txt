Khaled v Rapid Building Systems Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRush v Commissioner of Police   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery  Because of their immediate relevance  it is sufficient for present purposes to refer to observations I made in Rush v Commissioner of Police   FCA         ALR   at            Information discovery under O  A r   is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subparas  a   b  and  c  of that rule  Subpara  a  requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court  While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level  see Gull Petroleum  WA  Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd   FCA   at     the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one  see Hooper   FCR   at    Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case  it is not enough merely to assert that there is  or is the mere possibility of  a case against the prospective respondent  Hooper at    Importantly  as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd     ALR     FCA     St George Bank    at                   d  belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture  Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to  rather than rejecting a proposition  Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility  The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question  If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists  that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action  John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd   FCA   at         and                      While O   r   expressly contemplates  fishing  it equally requires that each of the limiting conditions prescribed in subparas  a   b  and  c  must be established  Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves  Airservices Australia Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd     FCR     ALR     FCA   at      Rapid  as I understand it  has developed a system for the prefabrication of buildings and holds patent rights in respect of that system  In early   the applicants sought from Rapid an agency to market Rapid s product in India  It would seem that a prospective purchaser would be required to construct a Rapid manufacturing plant to produce the product and the agency related to the sale of the plant itself  The terms of the agency were contained in the following letter from Rapid to Mr Kirsten of   May      Thank you for your letter of April     in which you request to represent our company in India exclusively for up to December          As I explained to you before  we are not prepared to give exclusive rights for countries  especially not as big as India   We are currently working closely with Sagric  who are currently also in India promoting our product whenever appropriate     Ernst  we are prepared to give you and Agim Khaled non exclusive rights to India until December       As soon as you have identified an interested party  the name must be registered with us and that company will then automatically become exclusive for you to receive commission as soon as a contract has been fulfilled   As long as RBS has not yet been dealing with that company or person before     The commission RBS will pay is   of the total value of the Rapid manufacturing plant plus   of the yearly royalty stream     It is important that Agim Khaled meets with us before he starts marketing in India  We must discuss his approach  give him some product knowledge and show him the plant and some projects first     Please consider the above and let me know if you want to proceed on that basis    Emphasis added   To anticipate matters  an attempt was later made in   to vary the registration requirement  This was resisted  I would also note that the applicants propose to contend that there is an ambiguity in what  registration  means in this context and that the contract was varied by conduct for at least a period in    There is evidence  though  of Rapid being notified in writing of the names of  interested parties  citedL J Hooker Ltd v W J Adams Estates Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This leads to the second of the issues on which the TP Act claim is premised  As the right of an agent to receive commission from a principal rests on contract express or implied  cf L J Hooker Ltd v W J Adams Estates Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   it is necessary both to ascertain the terms of the agency contract and to construe them in their setting   Irrespective of whether the agency was exclusive or non exclusive  it was each of these at different times  there can in my view be little doubt that on the material before me      i  it authorised the applicants to act as Rapid s agents in the sale of Rapid plants in India     ii  it required the applicants  as soon as they had identified an interested party  to register that name with Rapid  and that company will then automatically become exclusive for  the applicants  as long as Rapid had not been dealing with that company or person before   iii  Rapid was to pay commission of   of the total value of the plant plus   of the yearly royalty stream   iv  the commission was payable  as soon as a contract has been fulfilled    I am satisfied and I do not think that counsel for the respondents strongly suggests to the contrary that the term  registration  of itself  or in light of the course of dealing between the parties as revealed in the material before me  can reasonably be argued in this context to mean no more than that the applicants would make known to Rapid the name of interested parties they have identified
