effect of s  A was discussed by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia   FCA         FCR    Lee J s observations were picked up by the Full Court of the Federal Court in De Rose v State of South Australia  No     FCAFC    The Court consisted of Wilcox  Sackville and Merkel JJ  Their Honours at par   said     In Ward v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   Lee J made the following points about s  A          Section  A  is intended to remove any ground for anticipation or expectation that unless cause is shown for another order  costs will follow the event  at        Nonetheless  s  A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion  at          There is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order  It follows that the exercise of the discretion is not conditional upon a finding of fact or the formation of an opinion as to the occurrence of unreasonable conduct or the existence of special circumstances  at        Section  A  of the NT Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court s discretion in cases where a party acts unreasonably  but s  A  does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s  A   at          The matters to be taken into account in making a costs order are left to the Court s discretion  which must be exercised judicially  However  the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs  at      The court has as general power to make orders for costs as Lee J s comments in Ward illustrate  There is a specific power where the court is satisfied of the matters referred to in subs  A  of the Act  In my opinion those considerations do not apply   Looking at the matter generally  in my judgment  this is not a case where it is appropriate to make any order as to costs  The consequence is that  pursuant to subs  A  of the Act  each party to the Notice of Motion is to bear his or her own costs   For the above reasons I give leave to Shane Coghill to discontinue the notice of motion filed on   February   and note that  pursuant to s  A of the Act  each party to that motion is to bear his or her own costs      I certify that the preceding fifteen   numbered paragraphs

appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs  at      In this particular case  the submissions by Mr Neal on behalf of the Jagera People are         Costs   While there is no requirement for a threshold condition to be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order in this matter  Jagera People argue that even if there was  it would have been surpassed by the conduct of Mr Coghill in           Bringing the proceedings in the first place             Failing to withdraw the Notice of Motion in a timely manner including following indirect discussions between Michael Neal of Michael Neal Lawyers and Paul Richards of counsel on behalf of Mr Coghill         Failing to communicate with the Jagera People let alone attend the meeting to discuss this matter that was arranged by Jagera People         Failing to respond to the fax of   May   from Michael Neal Lawyers in a timely manner    The reference to a fax of   May   is a reference to a fax in which Mr Neal wrote to Mr Coghill  in which he said        I am instructed that as you are already aware that your application to strike out the claim has little if any prospects of success  and as you have not         taken up the invitation of the Jagera People to attend a meeting  or    withdrawn the application      Jagera People regrettably must seek an order for costs against you if you lose the application          In an endeavour to try and settle this matter as amicably as possible  I am also instructed that if your application is withdrawn by close of business on Wednesday    May   no order for costs will be sought      Jagera People ask again that you withdraw your application and do so straight away   Mr Coghill did not reply to the fax  but on   May filed the document headed    Notice of Discontinuance   the terms of that document are set out in par   above  The offer contained in the fax is a little bit at odds with the application for costs now made  the basis of it being that the deadline imposed by the facsimile  namely Wednesday   May   passed and there was no Notice of Discontinuance filed  or any communication by Mr Coghill with Mr Neal   In the light of all the material  including the written submissions filed by Mr Coghill today  and observations put to the Court on behalf of Queensland South Land Council by Mr Colin Hardy concerning attempts to resolve matters of dispute involving claims  including the claim of the Jagera People  I am not satisfied that this Notice of Motion is a proceeding which has by any unreasonable act or omission caused another party to incur costs in connection with the institution or conduct of it  This is not a case where an unmeritorious claim has been progressed in circumstances where costs are caused to another party
