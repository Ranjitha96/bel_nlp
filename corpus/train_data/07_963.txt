Competition and Consumer Commission v Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is a dispute as to the reach of the similar provision to s

Gummow and Hayne JJ  at     per Kirby J  at   per Callinan J   I do not need to enter this debate because the claim depends upon ASIC establishing that Citigroup was under a fiduciary duty to Toll  which it breached by failure to avoid the five alleged conflicts of interest  The claim fails for the reasons given above   The first insider trading claim is that Citigroup  through Mr Manchee  sold   shares in Patrick  at or shortly after  pm on   August   while in possession of inside information  The inside information is said to be a supposition made by Mr Manchee at about  pm during the  cigarette on the pavement conversation  with Mr Darwell  that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the takeover of Patrick  see Further Amended Statement of Claim     referred toAdler v ASIC   NSWCA         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  The findings of Santow J on this question were unaffected by the decision of the Court of Appeal  see Adler v ASIC   NSWCA

adviser and its client where the adviser holds itself out as an expert on financial matters and undertakes to perform a financial advisory role for the client  see Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ    per Brennan J  Aequitas v Sparad No   Limited  formerly Australian European Finance Corporation Limited      ACLC   at   per Austin J   The same principle will usually apply to financial advisers and corporate advisers  Each will owe fiduciary obligations to the client because each undertakes to act in the client s interests and not solely in its own interests  see Aequitas at   per Austin J  This is consistent with the principle stated by Mason J in Hospital Products at       Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship  But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty  see Breen v Williams at   per Gummow J  Aequitas at   per Austin J  cf News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  Hospital Products at   per Mason J   It is true  as is shown by Daly  Hadid and Aequitas   that an adviser may have fiduciary obligations to the client  But for the express terms of the mandate letter  the pre contract dealings between Citigroup and Toll would have pointed strongly toward the existence of a fiduciary relationship in Citigroup s role as an adviser   I have set out the pre contract dealings in some detail because they were referred to by Mr Walker and they contain all of the indicia of a fiduciary relationship of adviser and client   In summary  Citigroup gave Toll advice as to the wisdom and merits of making a bid for Patrick  Citigroup gave strategic advice which involved the use of its financial acumen  judgment and expertise to further Toll s interests  Citigroup worked closely with Toll as is evidenced by the presentations made before the execution of the mandate  as well as the large number of communications between them  both oral and by email   There were substantial negotiations as to the fees payable to Citigroup  and Citigroup ultimately secured success fees in the range of AUD  million to AUD  million  Fees of that order are testimony in themselves to a finding that Citigroup held itself out as an expert adviser on mergers and acquisitions  which points to the existence of a fiduciary relationship  see Daly at   per Gibbs CJ    per Brennan J  Aequitas at     per Austin J   There is force in Citigroup s submission that Australian law does not recognise a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure  The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive  accordingly  a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information  see Breen v Williams at   per Gaudron and McHugh JJ      per Gummow J  Pilmer at   per McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ  Aequitas at     per Austin J  Dresna Pty

observations in Daly are to be confined in the manner discussed by Austin J in Aequitas at    ASIC asserted that Daly was referred to by the High Court in Pilmer without disapproval at   but I do not consider that their Honours  remarks amounted to a clear acceptance of the reasoning of Brennan J  However I do not need to consider this question because in my view the claim fails at a factual level referred toAndar Transport Pty Limited v Brambles Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract  the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply  Thus  whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations  and the scope of any fiduciary duties  is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction  see Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ  Toll  FGCT  Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited   HCA

  HCA         CLR   at   per Callinan J citedAsia Pacific Telecommunications Limited v Optus Networks Pty Limited   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Citigroup has established Chinese walls between employees who work in the private side and the public side of its business  It is apparently now more common to describe these structures by the anodyne term  information barriers  see Asia Pacific Telecommunications Limited v Optus Networks Pty Limited   NSWSC   at     I prefer the traditional description  Chinese walls   The issues which arise in the present proceedings raise  at least in part  the question of whether Citigroup s Chinese walls were adequate to prevent the flow of inside information from the private side to the public side   The proceedings arise out of the purchase by a public side employee of over one million shares in Patrick Corporation Limited  Patrick  at a time when private side employees working in the IBD were acting for Citigroup s client  Toll  on a proposed takeover bid for Patrick  The shares were purchased by a trader  Mr Andrew Manchee  who worked on the proprietary trading desk which is situated in Equity Derivatives  within the Equities Division   A reminder that Chinese walls may sometimes be porous is to be found in the recent decision of Bergin J in Asia Pacific v Optus   The authorities to which I have referred above at     make it clear that the question of whether any fiduciary relationship existed between Citigroup and Toll is to be determined by the proper construction of the mandate letter

 per Millett LJ   Further support may be found in the discussion of the authorities by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum at     per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA  The duty of a fiduciary is one of undivided loyalty  The  no conflict  rule is based on practical considerations and recognises that the fiduciary s over riding duty may be swayed by a conflicting interest  The existence of a Chinese wall cannot  of itself  overcome the prohibition against a fiduciary acting at the same time both for and against the same client  Indeed  it exposes the vice to which Professor Finn referred   However  as the UK Law Commission observed  a financial conglomerate may obtain protection against any allegation of breach of the duty of loyalty if the client consents to the company carrying on business using Chinese walls as part of its organisational structure  The extent of the duty of loyalty would then be determined according to the contractual arrangements between the parties  see Law Commission Consultation Paper at         It is true  as Frankfurter J said in Securities and Exchange Commission v Chenery Corporation   US     at   that  to say a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis  see the citation in Beach Petroleum at   per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA  But it is otherwise where the parties acknowledge that they are not in a fiduciary relationship  In my view  those words mean what they say and should be enforced accordingly  unless the mandate letter was vitiated as a matter of law   Brickenden has been followed in this Court in CBA v Smith at   per Davies  Sheppard and Gummow JJ  It has also been followed and explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum at     per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA   Their Honours said in Beach Petroleum at   that Brickenden is not authority for the general proposition that in no case involving breach of fiduciary duty may a court consider what would have happened if the duty had been performed  This is because Brickenden is now to be understood in light of the decision of the House of Lords in Target Holdings Limited v Redferns     AC    Their Lordships there said at   that causation is to be determined using commonsense and hindsight  see Beach Petroleum at   per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA  I respectfully agree with the views of the Court of Appeal   I do not need to decide the issue of causation  ASIC s submissions assumed  contrary to my finding  that Citigroup and Toll were in a fiduciary relationship  Whilst the issue of causation does not need to be determined  it seems to me that in light of the observations of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum   ASIC s submission that  the expectations  or inclination to give permission of the beneficiary Toll are irrelevant  should be rejected   ASIC alleges five separate breaches of fiduciary duty by Citigroup  These claims fail because I have come to the view that Citigroup was not in a fiduciary relationship with Toll  Nevertheless  I will address each of the five alleged conflicts because there are other reasons why those claims would fail even if Citigroup did owe fiduciary duties to Toll   I will deal with the five  conflicts  in the order in which they were pleaded  All of them are said to be conflicts of interest and duty referred toBirtchnell v The Equity Trustees  Executors and Agency Company Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The subject matter over which any fiduciary obligations will

Citigroup s advice was given to Toll which was a person who was  or was  likely to become  an interested party  in Patrick  see Reg      c i   In my view  in this context  likely  means a real and not remote chance  see for example Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers     FCR   at   per Bowen CJ  Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ  Boughey v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason  Wilson and Deane JJ  It seems to me that Toll s past record of success in takeover bids  its core competence in the field  and the planning and effort which went into this bid made it likely  even as at   August   that Toll would become an interested party within the meaning stated in the authorities citedBoulting v Association of Cinematograph  Television and Allied Technicians     QB   As Lord Upjohn said in Boulting v Association of Cinematograph  Television and Allied Technicians     QB   at     there must be a  real conflict of duty and interest and not some theoretical or rhetorical conflict    The fourth conflict  as pleaded at     of the Further Amended Statement of Claim  is that it was in the interests of Toll that the price of Patrick shares not go up during trading on   August     By placing itself in this position of conflict  Citigroup is said to have breached its fiduciary duty to Toll  The claim fails because of the absence of a fiduciary relationship but I will deal with the other elements of the claim contained in the pleading followedBreen v Williams   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed in Breen v Williams   HCA         CLR   at    Australian courts have consciously refrained from attempting to provide a general test for determining when persons       stand in a fiduciary relationship   It may be  as their Honours said  that the term  fiduciary relationship  defies definition  This is because of the difficulty of stating a comprehensive principle suitable for application to different types of relationships that carry different obligations  see Hospital Products at   per Gibbs CJ  News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited     FCR   at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ   The observations of Gummow J in Breen v Williams at     are to the same effect  But his Honour also pointed out that a contractual term may be so precise in its regulation of what a party may do that there is no scope for the creation of a fiduciary duty   It follows from these statements of principle that it is open to the parties to a contract to exclude or modify the operation of fiduciary duties  This was the view of the Law Commission Consultation Paper which was reached after a careful examination of the authorities  see at         Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship  But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty  see Breen v Williams at   per Gummow J  Aequitas at   per Austin J  cf News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  Hospital Products at   per Mason J   In Australia  the duty of loyalty is proscriptive rather than prescriptive in nature  see Breen v Williams at   per Gaudron and McHugh JJ      per Gummow J  Pilmer v Duke Group Limited  In Liq    HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ   Indeed  this is a distinction which is recognised in s  A aa  of the Corporations Act   It imposes a duty upon a financial services licensee to have in place adequate arrangements for  the management of conflicts of interest   The statutory requirement is to be contrasted with the duty in equity of a fiduciary to eliminate or avoid conflicts  see Breen v Williams at   per Gaudron and McHugh JJ  Of course  one way of managing conflicts would be to eliminate them but s  A aa  does not require a licensee to take that step  see the discussion by Mr Tuch    MULR at       Support for the proposition that Chinese walls do not eliminate conflicts may be found in the Law Commission Consultation Paper   At       the UK Law Commission referred to a paper by Professor Finn   Fiduciary Law and the Modern Commercial World  Norton Rose Oxford Law Colloquium   at p    Professor Finn pointed out that the vice is not the possibility of misuse of confidential information but  rather the  compromising of a fiduciary s duty of loyalty   There is force in Citigroup s submission that Australian law does not recognise a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure  The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive  accordingly  a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information  see Breen v Williams at   per Gaudron and McHugh JJ      per Gummow J

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The standard of proof of the claim is the balance of probabilities but I must take into account the gravity of the matters alleged  see s  c  of the Evidence Act   This would appear to correspond with common law principles so that the well known test stated in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   applies  see Heydon JD  Cross on Evidence   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworths    at   cf Odgers S  Uniform Evidence Law   th ed  LawBook Co    at         As stated above  Mr Manchee was one of five traders on the proprietary trading desk  he reported to Mr Darwell  his daily trading limit was AUD  million  see     above   Mr Manchee s evidence was that his trading style was to look at chart patterns and relative performance of stocks to look for trading ideas  I accept his evidence on this matter citedBristol and West Building Society v Mothew   Ch   The distinguishing or over riding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty  see Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Limited v Forbes   FCAFC         FCR   at   per Finn J  Beach Petroleum at   per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA  Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew   Ch   at   per Millett LJ   The nature of the fiduciary obligation is encapsulated in the following remarks of Millett LJ in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew at    The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty  The principal is entitled to the single minded loyalty of his fiduciary  This core liability has several facets  A fiduciary must act in good faith  he must not make a profit out of his trust  he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict  he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list  but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations  They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary  As Dr  Finn pointed out in his classic work Fiduciary Obligations   p    he is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary  it is because he is subject to them that he is a fiduciary  citedChan v Zacharia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  That view is supported by both Australian and English authority  see Chan v Zacharia   HCA         CLR   at   per Deane J  News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  Noranda Australia Limited v Lachlan Resources NL     NSWLR   at   per Bryson J

Browne Wilkinson   This duty embodies  the twin themes  of preventing undisclosed conflict of duty and interest  or of duty and duty  and of prohibiting misuse of the fiduciary position  see Chan v Zacharia at     per Deane J  Gibson Motorsport at   per Finn J   In Chan v Zacharia   Deane J said in plain terms at   that the parties to a partnership agreement could provide  that any fiduciary relationship between the partners was excluded   The observations of Mahoney JA in Woolworths v Kelly at   were to the same effect  His Honour said that fiduciary duties could be  varied or released  by contract  Also  in News Limited   a Full Court of this Court  Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  said at   that whether there are any fiduciary obligations at all may depend on the terms of the contract referred toCommercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Limited v Ferrcom Pty Limited     NSWLR   ASIC called Mr Chatfield to give evidence but it chose not to lead any evidence from him on the relevance of the information  I can therefore infer that Mr Chatfield s evidence would not have assisted  see Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Limited v Ferrcom Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per Handley JA   The other person identified in the particulars  Mr Little  was not called by ASIC to give evidence  The plain inference is that his evidence would not have assisted   The third conflict is said to have arisen because it was likely that the fact that Citigroup had acquired  such a substantial body of shares  would come to the notice of private side employees providing corporate advisory services  namely Mr Dempsey and his team  or to those providing investment banking services  namely Mr Bartels and his team  or their superiors  Mr Roberts and Mr Sinclair  or the Compliance department and in house lawyers  see Further Amended Statement of Claim   followedCommissioner for Corporate Affairs v Bracht   VR   It is also important to bear in mind that  as is noted in Ford s Principles of Corporations Law at     the origin of the extended definition of  officer  is to be found in Parliament codifying  at least in part  the principles stated by Ormiston J in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Bracht   VR     In Bracht   Ormiston J considered the proper construction of s   of the Companies  Victoria  Code which prohibited a person who was bankrupt from taking part in the management of a corporation  His Honour considered at   that the concept of  management  comprehended   activities which involve policy and decision making  related to the business affairs of a corporation  affecting the corporation as a whole or a substantial part of that corporation  to the extent that the consequences of the formation of those policies or the making of those decisions may have some significant bearing on the financial standing of the corporation or the conduct of its affairs    The language of subparagraphs  b i  and  b ii  of the definition of  officer  corresponds  in large measure  with Ormiston J s description of the concept of management  What emerges from this is that an officer is involved in policy making and decisions that affect the whole or a substantial part of the business of the corporation   Moreover  this is reflected in the distinction drawn in the Corporations Act between officers and employees and it is supported by authorities that have considered the statutory definition   It is true  of course  that the meaning of  officer  must be considered in its particular statutory context  see for example Bracht at     per Ormiston J  Duties of honesty  care and diligence are imposed on officers by ss     of the Corporations Act   But it seems to me that  if anything  this reinforces the view I have expressed as to the requirement that an officer occupy a management role   In my view  Mr Manchee did not fall within either subparagraph  b i  or  b ii  of the definition of  officer   ASIC has not established that he had any involvement in policy making or decisions that affected the whole or a substantial part of the business of Citigroup  Mr Manchee was one of five proprietary traders employed by Citigroup  There was no evidence that anyone reported to him or that he had any responsibilities apart from proprietary trading   The proprietary trading desk is one of four trading desks in the Equity Derivatives Division which is itself a subdivision of Equities  one of six divisions in the CIB  The CIB is one of Citigroup s three businesses  Mr Manchee s trading was subject to daily limits and to the direction of his risk manager  Mr Darwell followedCommissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green   VR   The amendment was explained in     of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill    Cth  as follows    Doubt was also expressed as to whether the term  information  would be interpreted as encompassing supposition  intentions and other matter not sufficiently certain to require its release to the public  notwithstanding the broad interpretation given to the term in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green   VR   at      Proposed amendment     Proposed section  A  provides definitions of  information  and  securities  in relation to a body corporate  to apply for the purposes of the insider trading provisions  The definition of information is an inclusive one  with information being taken to include supposition and other matters insufficiently definite to warrant being made known to the public and matters relating to the intentions  or likely intentions  of a person   It is also apparent that the new definition was to include in the concept of information  factual knowledge obtained by means of a hint or veiled suggestion from which the receiver of it can impute other knowledge  see Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green   VR   at   referred toCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith     FCR   A person may be in a fiduciary relationship as to some aspects of the relationship but not others  see New Zealand Netherlands Society  Oranje  Incorporated v Kuys     All ER   at     per Lord Wilberforce  see also Noranda Australia v Lachlan Resources at     per Bryson J  Thus  a bank which gives its customers financial advice in the course of a transaction that includes an advance of money to the client may be in a fiduciary relationship with the client in its role as adviser  The bank may be expected to act in its own interests in ensuring the security for the loan but it will undertake fiduciary obligations to the client if it creates an expectation that it will advise in the customer s interests on the wisdom of the investment  see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith     FCR   at   per Davies  Sheppard and Gummow JJ   A person occupying a fiduciary position will be absolved from liability for what would otherwise be a breach of duty by obtaining a fully informed consent  see CBA v Smith at   per Davies  Sheppard and Gummow JJ citedD   J Constructions Pty Limited v Head   ors trading as Clayton Utz     NSWLR   Nevertheless  warnings have been sounded in other authorities about the risk of leakage through Chinese walls  Thus  for example  Bryson J said in D   J Constructions Pty Limited v Head   ors trading as Clayton Utz     NSWLR   at        it is not realistic to place reliance on such arrangements in relation to people with opportunities for daily contact over long periods  as wordless communication can take place inadvertently and without explicit expression  by attitudes  facial expression or even by avoiding people one is accustomed to see  even by people who sincerely intend to conform to control   Nevertheless  having seen Mr Monaci in the witness box  it seems to me that the warning sounded by Bryson J in D   J Constructions is apt  That is to say  it is not always realistic to place reliance on arrangements comprising Chinese walls  see   above   Adequate arrangements require more than a raft of written policies and procedures  They require a thorough understanding of the procedures by all employees and a willingness and ability to apply them to a host of possible conflicts   Mr Monaci s entire statement was the result of reflection by him in hindsight which he did not take into account in the particular circumstances that arose on   August    The

Limited      ACLC   at   per Austin J   There were substantial negotiations as to the fees payable to Citigroup  and Citigroup ultimately secured success fees in the range of AUD  million to AUD  million  Fees of that order are testimony in themselves to a finding that Citigroup held itself out as an expert adviser on mergers and acquisitions  which points to the existence of a fiduciary relationship  see Daly at   per Gibbs CJ    per Brennan J  Aequitas at     per Austin J   The first conflict is said to have arisen once Citigroup acquired its own interest in Patrick shares on   August    Citigroup is then said to have had a fiduciary duty to disclose to Toll  as its adviser  all relevant knowledge in relation to decisions to be made by Toll about the bid  The duty is said to be based on the decision of the High Court in Daly   in particular the reasons of Brennan J at     The duty of disclosure pleaded in the first conflict is said to be a duty to furnish Toll with all relevant knowledge possessed by Mr Bartels which may reasonably be regarded as relevant to the making of Toll s decision as to whether the premium for the bid should be marketed by reference to the closing price of Patrick shares on Friday    August   or the closing price on Thursday    August   see Further Amended Statement of Claim     It is then said that it was relevant for Toll  when making a decision as to how to market the bid  to know that the market activity in Patrick shares on   August    had been materially contributed to by Citigroup s own actions  in acquiring its stake in Patrick for the purpose of making profits for itself  see Further Amended Statement of Claim     It may follow that Brennan J s observations in Daly are to be confined in the manner discussed by Austin J in Aequitas at    ASIC asserted that Daly was referred to by the High Court in Pilmer without disapproval at   but I do not consider that their Honours  remarks amounted to a clear acceptance of the reasoning of Brennan J  However I do not need to consider this question because in my view the claim fails at a factual level   The second conflict  as with the first  also raises the question of whether Australian law recognises the positive duty to furnish information consistently with that stated in Daly    The second conflict is said to arise from the following knowledge  as at about  pm on   August   on the part of Messrs Roberts  Sinclair  Monaci and Scott          that Mr Dempsey and the private side employees of Citigroup in the IBD who were assisting him  were advising Toll on the bid    that Citigroup had acquired a substantial shareholding in Patrick on its own account on   August     that they were concerned about how the acquisition of Citigroup s stake would be perceived by Toll and by the market    that there was a perception that Toll and the market might infer that Citigroup s Chinese walls had failed   Citigroup is then said to have had a duty  through Messrs Roberts  Sinclair  Monaci and Scott  to inform Toll that it had engaged in substantial trading in Patrick shares on   August    Thus Citigroup is said to have had a conflict of interest and duty  see Further Amended Statement of Claim       Both counts of misleading or deceptive conduct are founded upon a fiduciary duty to disclose in accordance with Daly  The claims fail in the absence of any finding of fiduciary relationship between Citigroup and Toll and particularly my rejection of any Daly duty in the circumstances of the present case   Section  CA  of the ASIC Act prohibits conduct in relation to financial services if the conduct is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law   ASIC contends that by being in the five alleged positions of conflict  Citigroup breached its fiduciary duty to Toll and that each breach of fiduciary duty was unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law of a State or Territory referred toDarlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract  the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply  Thus  whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations  and the scope of any fiduciary duties  is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction  see

sophistication and intelligence of the person to whom disclosure is required to be made  see Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say Dee Pty Limited   HCA   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ   The authorities which deal with time charging by solicitors reveal a special instance where a solicitor has a conflict between his or her own interest in earning fees  and the duty to the client  A central question in these proceedings is whether the principles stated in the authorities on solicitors apply where the alleged fiduciary relationship is not one of the established categories   Citigroup did not obtain Toll s express consent to trade on its own account in the context of its advisory role in the Patrick takeover  but in my view informed consent is to be implied from Toll s knowledge of Citigroup s structure and method of operations  Toll s experience and  core competency  in mergers and acquisitions must also be taken into account in determining this question  see Farah at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ   Although Mr Chatfield would have preferred Citigroup not to trade on its own behalf  he knew that Citigroup was a large financial conglomerate which did not act exclusively for Toll  He also knew that Citigroup had a proprietary trading desk which could operate for the benefit of Citigroup so long as knowledge of Toll s confidential information did not leak to the proprietary traders   It is true that Mr Chatfield did not turn his mind to the question of whether Citigroup would suspend its proprietary trading during the period of the mandate  but the effect of his evidence was that he accepted that Citigroup could trade for third parties or for itself  so long as it did not use Toll s confidential

Securities Limited     ACLR   This approach to construction has been adopted in relation to s   of the Securities Industry Act    NSW  the successor to s  A of the Securities Industry Act and precursor to s  A of the Corporations Act     see Hooker Investments Pty Limited v Baring Bros Halkertson   Partners Securities Limited     ACLR   at     per Young J  R v Rivkin   NSWCCA         FLR   at     per Mason P  Wood CJ at CL and Sully J  As Young J said in Hooker Investments v Baring Bros  at   information goes further than knowledge and   may include a rumour that something has happened with respect to a company which a person neither believes nor disbelieves    In my view it follows from what was said by McInerney J in CCA v Green   by Young J in Hooker Investments v Baring Bros and by Barr and Hall JJ in Hannes v DPP that information can be non specific and that what is drawn from it by way of inference is also included within the statutory definition of information  Moreover  the information  whether in the form of a hint or a rumour  must be communicated orally or by conduct  for example by observation of the words or conduct of others   It also seems to follow from this that an inference may be a supposition or a matter of supposition  and therefore falls within the definition of information in s  A  The supposition would therefore be that which the person drew from the hint or other non specific information received from another   It was submitted on behalf of Citigroup that the legislative history shows that the inclusive definition of  information  in s  A of the Corporations Act was not intended to extend the ordinary meaning of the word  information  to encompass uncommunicated thought processes followedHospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation   HCA         CLR   at   Mason J said that where a contractual relationship provides the foundation for the erection of a fiduciary relationship  the contract regulates the rights and liabilities of the parties  His Honour went on to say that the fiduciary relationship   if it is to exist at all  must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with  and conforms to  the contractual terms   How then  to use the language of Mason J in Hospital Products   can a fiduciary relationship be superimposed upon the mandate letter in the face of clear language which excludes it  Citigroup disputes the applicability of ten of the eleven propositions propounded by ASIC  It submits that because the mandate letter provides so precisely that no fiduciary relationship exists between Citigroup and Toll  there is simply no scope for the mandate to accommodate a fiduciary relationship  It submits that the propositions put forward by ASIC to overcome this difficulty have no application particularly when the fiduciary relationship is not one of the  per se  relationships referred to in the authorities  see for example Hospital Products at   per Mason J   The substance of Citigroup s answer to the claim is that the duty of a fiduciary to obtain the informed consent of a client has no application here because it presupposes the existence of an antecedent fiduciary relationship  No such pre existing relation is claimed to have been created   Citigroup also relies  to the extent necessary  upon events preceding  and post dating  the execution of the mandate letter  as demonstrating Toll s knowledge of  and informed consent to  Citigroup s proprietary trading in Patrick shares  These events include the submission by Citigroup to one of the Toll companies  Toll Transport Pty Limited  Toll Transport  and subsequent execution  of a Custodian   Nominee Appointment Agreement dated   June    That contract deals with the acquisition by Citigroup of a discreet pre bid stake in Patrick for and on behalf of Toll  This contract contained express disclosure of Citigroup s right to trade as principal in Patrick shares   As Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed in Breen v Williams   HCA         CLR   at    Australian courts have consciously refrained from attempting to provide a general test for determining when persons       stand in a fiduciary relationship   It may be  as their Honours said  that the term  fiduciary relationship  defies definition  This is because of the difficulty of stating a comprehensive principle suitable for application to different types of relationships that carry different obligations  see Hospital Products at   per Gibbs CJ  News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited     FCR   at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ   The courts have recognised certain classes of persons as falling within established categories of fiduciary relationships  Examples of these include trustee and beneficiary  agent and principal  solicitor and client  director and company  employee and employer  and partners  see Hospital Products at   per Gibbs CJ  at   per Mason J   Apart from the established categories  perhaps the most than can be said is that a fiduciary relationship exists where a person has undertaken to act in the interests of another and not in his or her own interests but all of the facts and circumstances must be carefully examined to see whether the relationship is  in substance  fiduciary  see Hospital Products at     per Gibbs CJ  News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ   In Hospital Products  Mason J observed at   that  contractual and fiduciary relationships may co exist   His Honour said that if a fiduciary relationship is to exist between parties to a contract  the fiduciary relationship must conform to the terms of the contract  He went on to say that   The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction   The same principle will usually apply to financial advisers and corporate advisers  Each will owe fiduciary obligations to the client because each undertakes to act in the client s interests and not solely in its own interests  see Aequitas at   per Austin J  This is consistent with the principle stated by Mason J in Hospital Products at       Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship  But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty  see Breen v Williams at   per Gummow J  Aequitas at   per Austin J  cf News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  Hospital Products at   per Mason J   The scope of the fiduciary duties will vary and is to be determined according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the case  see Hospital Products at   per Gibbs CJ    per Mason J   Moreover  there is force in Citigroup s submission that the alleged conflict of interest is too remote  There must be  a conflict or a real or substantial possibility of a conflict  see Hospital Products at   per Mason J  In fact   Mason J went even further at   quoting the statement of Judge Learned Hand in Phelan v Middle States Oil Corporation     F  d    at     that the conflict rule does not apply       not only when the putative interest  though in itself strong enough to be an inducement  was too remote  but also when  though not too remote  it was too feeble an inducement to be a determining motive  distinguishedKelly v Cooper   AC   That view is supported by both Australian and English authority  see Chan v Zacharia   HCA         CLR   at   per Deane J  News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ

also Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Limited   UKHL         AC   at   per Lord Browne Wilkinson   The scope of any duty  and the extent to which the existence of Chinese walls may protect against an allegation of breach would be determined not only by the express terms of the contract but also by any implied terms  see Kelly v Cooper at     per Lord Browne Wilkinson   I do not consider that the circumstances of the present case are identical with those of Kelly v Cooper where the Privy Council held that there was to be implied in a contract with a real estate agent  a term that the agent was free to act for other principals selling similar properties  Such a term was implied because the practice is notorious and it would otherwise be impossible for the estate agents to perform their ordinary business functions  see Kelly v Cooper at   per Lord Browne Wilkinson   In my opinion  there is nothing in the relationship of investment banker financial advisor and client which requires a conclusion that it is an inherent part of the business of investment banking for the banker to engage in trading in its client s target s shares   But  in my opinion  in the particular circumstances of this case  for the reasons given above  Toll had sufficient knowledge of the real possibility of proprietary trading by Citigroup to amount to informed consent   Citigroup relied upon the concession made by Mr Chatfield in cross examination that if on   August   Citigroup had told him it had engaged in proprietary trading  it wouldn t have made any difference  to the decisions which Toll made  see   above   ASIC sought to meet this by submitting that a fiduciary who has not obtained informed consent does not escape the consequences of that failure by showing that the information which was not disclosed would not  as a matter of fact  and with hindsight  have affected the client s decision referred toLac Minerals Limited v International Corona Resources Limited     DLR   th     Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ considered that these remarks contain an important question  if not the question  see News Limited at    La Forest J also agreed with Professor Finn s remarks in Lac Minerals Limited v International Corona Resources Limited     DLR  th    at   consideredLaw Society of New South Wales v Foreman     NSWLR   ASIC s answer to this conundrum is to be found in eleven propositions to which I will refer later  At the heart of them is the proposition that where the inclusion of a particular term in a contract between a fiduciary and client would create an actual or potential conflict of interest between the fiduciary and the client  the fiduciary must obtain the client s informed consent to the inclusion of that provision  This approach to the question builds  in large measure  analogically upon principles applicable to solicitors  see in particular the observations of Mahoney JA in Law Society of New South Wales v Foreman     NSWLR   at       The gravamen of ASIC s case is that for the exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the mandate letter to be effective  it was incumbent upon Citigroup to draw Toll s attention expressly to the effect of the exclusion  that is  that it permitted Citigroup to trade in Patrick shares on its own account  in potential conflict with the interests of Toll   A solicitor who wishes to enter into a time charging costs agreement with the client must make full disclosure to the client of all the implications of such an agreement  see Foreman at     per Mahoney JA  Re Morris Fletcher v Cross  Bill of Costs     Qd R   at   per Fryberg J  McNamara Business   Property Law v Kasmeridis   SASC   at     per Doyle CJ   In Foreman   Mahoney JA said at   that fiduciary obligations  including full disclosure  exist not only in the carrying out of an agreement already made between a solicitor and client  but also in respect of the making of it   Mr Walker submitted that this observation by Mahoney JA indicates that the disclosure obligation applies to the making of a contract where a person who would otherwise be in a fiduciary relationship seeks to exclude fiduciary obligations in the terms of the contract   However  I do not consider that this submission provides an answer to the conundrum presented by the apparent exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the present case  There are two reasons for this   Indeed  in Foreman at   Mahoney JA specifically pointed out that a solicitor is in a fiduciary position vis   vis the client and or in a position of influence  Hence the need for the solicitor to give the client advice that would enable a proper understanding of the operation and effect of a time based costs agreement  see McNamara at   per Doyle CJ   This submission is said to be based upon the principles stated in the authorities dealing with time charging by solicitors  see Foreman and the other authorities referred to at     above  ASIC submitted that the principle is not limited to solicitors and applies generally to all fiduciaries   However  for reasons given above at     I do not consider that this principle applies in the present case  In particular  even if the principle stated by Mahoney JA in Foreman is of general application to fiduciaries  it cannot apply unless the fiduciary is within an established category or is subject to fiduciary obligations before entering into the contract   To hold otherwise would be to say that a person who is not a fiduciary may nevertheless owe an obligation which flows from a fiduciary relationship  That could hardly be correct referred toLion Nathan Australia Pty Limited v Coopers Brewery Limited   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract  the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply  Thus  whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations  and the scope of any fiduciary duties  is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances

solicitor is actually retained  see United Dominions v Brian at     per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ   First  the authorities dealing with solicitors  costs agreements have  as their foundation  the Court s inherent jurisdiction over solicitors and the fiduciary nature of the solicitor and client relationship as an established fiduciary category  see McNamara at   per Doyle CJ   Indeed  in Foreman at   Mahoney JA specifically pointed out that a solicitor is in a fiduciary position vis   vis the client and or in a position of influence  Hence the need for the solicitor to give the client

observations in Daly are to be confined in the manner discussed by Austin J in Aequitas at    ASIC asserted that Daly was referred to by the High Court in Pilmer without disapproval at   but I do not consider that their Honours  remarks amounted to a clear acceptance of the reasoning of Brennan J  However I do not need to consider this question because in my view the claim fails at a factual level   Support for the view that the interests identified in the present case were too remote is also to be found in the remarks of the majority in Pilmer at   per McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ  Their Honours said that it is not sufficient to say generally  that there was a hope or expectation of future dealings   Most professional advisers would hope  as their Honours said  that the proper performance of the task would lead the client to retain them again followedPrince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG   UKHL         AC   A favoured technique for dealing with conflicts of interest which arise from the carrying on of business by large financial institutions is the use of Chinese walls  They are widely used by institutions in Australia  the United Kingdom  the United States and Canada  see Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG   UKHL         AC   at   per Lord Millett  see also Law Commission Consultation Paper at       Chinese walls are a means of restricting the flow of information between different departments of the same organisation  see Bolkiah at   per Lord Millett  see also Law Commission Consultation Paper at         In Bolkiah at   Lord Millett described Chinese walls as a technique for  managing  conflicts of interest  The use of this word is significant because it suggests that Chinese walls do not eliminate conflicts  they are no more than a technique for managing conflicts of interests which continue to exist   Cases dealing with claims brought by former clients of solicitors and accountants to restrain the firm from acting against it show a willingness by the courts to accept the concept of Chinese walls as a means of quarantining information within the firm  see Bolkiah at     per Lord Millett  Photocure ASA v Queen s University at Kingston     IPR   at   per Goldberg J   The relief sought in those cases turned upon the question of whether there was a risk of disclosure or misuse of confidential information  Lord Millett said in Bolkiah at     that there is no rule of law that Chinese walls are insufficient to eliminate the risk of disclosure but the Court should restrain the firm from acting unless satisfied that effective measures have been taken to prevent disclosure   Thus  the question of whether Chinese walls are effective will be a question of fact in each case  although Lord Millett emphasised that the wall must be  an established part of the organisational structure  not created ad hoc   see Bolkiah at    The same approach must be taken in determining whether Chinese walls constitute adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest within s  aa  of the Corporations Act    In Bolkiah  Lord Millett at   drew upon the observations in the Law Commission Consultation Paper to illustrate the type of organisational arrangements which would ordinarily be effective  see also Law Commission Consultation Paper at        These are          the physical separation of departments to insulate them from each other    an educational programme  normally recurring  to emphasise the importance of not improperly or inadvertently divulging confidential information    strict and carefully defined procedures for dealing with situations where it is thought the wall should be crossed  and the maintaining of proper records where this occurs    monitoring by compliance officers of the effectiveness of the Chinese wall    disciplinary sanctions where there has been a breach of the wall   Nevertheless  as I have said above at       in Bolkiah   Lord Millett referred to Chinese walls as a technique for managing conflicts of interest and he described the types of organisational structures that would ordinarily be effective   Mr Monaci s statement of evidence set out in great detail the measures which Citigroup has in place  These appear to me to comply with the requirements stated by the UK Law Commission and adopted by Lord Millett in Bolkiah   I will not repeat the evidence but the paragraph numbers of Mr Monaci s statement which describe the arrangements are as follows          physical separation by departments        educational programmes      especially   and     procedures for dealing with crossing the wall        monitoring by compliance officers      and       disciplinary sanctions      Mr Monaci also referred in other parts of his statement to Citigroup s policies and procedures for the identification and management of conflicts of interest that arise in its business  He referred to some of the written policies which apply to Citigroup s Australian operations  They were set out at   of his statement   Mr Monaci said at   that Citigroup s written policies are available to all employees and regular training is provided  He said at   that the written policies make clear that employees must be alert to the possibility of conflicts and  escalate any issues in relation to actual  apparent or potential conflicts of interest  followedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The phrase  carries on or may carry on the business  must be construed in context so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all of the provisions of the statute  see Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  I also accept that the phrase is to be construed in light of the modern corporate practice of carrying on business as a corporate group   But the difficulty which arises is  how can it be said that Virgin  as a     owned subsidiary of Patrick  carried on the business of that entity  ASIC submitted that to say so would be to find that Virgin  a listed company conducting the business of an airline  was carrying on the business of its major shareholder  Patrick  a listed company carrying on the business of a stevedore   Subparagraph  c ii A  must be read with s   of the Corporations Act which provides as follows   A reference in this Act to a person carrying on a business  or a business of a particular kind  is a reference to the person carrying on a business  or a business of that kind  whether alone or together with any other person or persons   I have therefore come to the view that  applying the approach to construction stated in Project Blue Sky   Virgin can be said to have been carrying on the business of Patrick  notwithstanding that it was not carrying on the whole of that business  I reject ASIC s submission that the  business  that Patrick had in relation to Virgin is properly characterised as  the business of owning     of Virgin Blue    It also follows from this that Virgin shares are not  other financial products  and therefore that the advice did not fall within Reg      c iii  of the Corporations Regulations    On this finding  the exemption contained in Reg      c  would have been engaged so that Citigroup would not have been providing financial services to Toll for the purpose of s  A aa  of the Corporations Act  citedR v Firns   NSWCCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCCA  html  The question of whether a matter is  readily observable  is one of fact  Observability does not depend on proof that persons actually perceived the information  the test is objective and hypothetical  see R v Firns   NSWCCA         NSWLR   at   per Mason P   Where the information is a  matter of supposition  the question of whether it is generally available depends on whether the supposition is capable of being made or drawn by other investors based on readily observable matter or information that has been made known in the manner stated in s  C b i  of the Corporations Act   see s  C c    ASIC called Mr Sisson to give expert evidence  However  his first report dated   October   did not deal with the question of whether the  information  relied on by ASIC was generally available  Mr Sisson did address the question briefly in a later report dated   March   in reply to the evidence of Citigroup s expert  Mr Richard Mews   However  in my view  the test applied by Mr Sisson as to whether the information was generally available was not in accordance with that which has been recognised by the authorities  There are two reasons for this  First  the test of whether material is readily observable is not whether the particular matter was widely observed but whether it could have been  see R v Firns at     per Mason P  see also Hannes v DPP at   per Barr and Hall JJ   The second reason is that s  C c  of the Corporations Act does not appear to involve a consideration of whether the market has had a reasonable time to absorb the information  see the analysis of the extrinsic material in     of the judgment of Mason P in R v Firns   His Honour was of the view that Parliament s intention was not to  penalise individual initiative and diligence   Thus  it seems to me that Mr Sisson s evidence on this question must be rejected  The effect of what he did was to ask whether it was generally available by considering the question of whether it was generally known   Nevertheless  it does not follow that I must find that the information was generally available  Citigroup submitted that I should make this finding upon the basis of the evidence of its expert  Mr Mews  But I am not satisfied that Mr Mews  evidence establishes the proposition for which Citigroup contends citedR v Hannes   NSWCCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCCA  html  It seems to me that the case must fail unless I find that Mr Manchee made the supposition in precisely those terms  This is because the authorities establish the central importance of the identified information to the statutory scheme  see R v Hannes   NSWCCA         FLR   at     per Spigelman CJ  Reference has also been made to the level of precision required in formulating the charge  see Hannes v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions  No     NSWCCA       ACSR   at       per Barr and Hall JJ   The position seems to me to be analogous to that which was referred to by Spigelman CJ in R v Hannes at      Here the supposition that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the Patrick takeover was one essential part of the  information  on which the claim was based  As Spigelman CJ said at   if it was generally available  one would expect to find it in the contemporaneous reports  Yet no such evidence was available  even in the form of speculation or rumour   Mr Mews and Mr Sisson agreed that when one is considering whether information in the form of a deduction is generally available  the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle is apt  But as Mr Sisson said  if all pieces other than those from a small area are removed  as Mr Mews appears to have done  it is relatively easy to fit the remaining pieces together to reach the desired conclusion   Counsel for Citigroup pointed to the evidence of Mr Harvey to support a finding that the information was generally available  Mr Harvey was called by ASIC to give evidence on its behalf referred toR v Rivkin   NSWCCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

Limited     ACSR   White J found that a person who was not a director and who described himself as a consultant  was an  officer  within subparagraph  b i  of the definition because he was intimately involved in all the important decisions affecting the corporation  Her Honour said at   there could be no doubt about the person s importance to the  drive and direction  of the company and that it

In Re HIH Insurance Limited  in prov liq    ASIC v Adler   NSWSC         ACSR   per Santow J  a question arose as to whether Mr Adler  who was a director of the parent company but not of the subsidiary  was an  officer  of the subsidiary company  Santow J held that he was an officer of the subsidiary under subparagraphs  b i  and  b ii  of the definition   The reason Santow J found that Mr Adler was an officer was that as a director of the holding company and a member of its investment committee  he participated in decision making as to how the funds of the HIH group were invested  His Honour said it was for this reason that Mr Adler was a person whose decisions clearly affected the whole or a substantial part of the business of the subsidiary as well as someone with the capacity to affect significantly the subsidiary s financial standing  see at     referred toRe Morris Fletcher v Cross  Bill of Costs     Qd R   A solicitor who wishes to enter into a time charging costs agreement with the client must make full disclosure to the client of all the implications of such an agreement  see Foreman at     per Mahoney JA  Re Morris Fletcher v Cross  Bill of Costs     Qd R   at   per Fryberg J  McNamara Business   Property Law v Kasmeridis   SASC   at     per Doyle CJ explainedRyan v Triguboff     NSWLR   In Ryan v Triguboff     NSWLR   Lee J dealt with the question of whether a deduction formed by the defendant could constitute  specific information  within s  A of the Securities Industry Act  His Honour held at   that the deduction could not constitute  specific information  within the section because that expression required information that was capable of being pointed to and identified  and that it  must be capable of being expressed unequivocally    The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  amended the earlier provisions regulating insider trading which were contained in the Corporations Act     Corporations Law and Australian Securities Commission Act     The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act formed part of the arrangements for a national scheme for corporate regulation which came into operation on   January     The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act reformed the regulation of insider trading in light of the recommendations of the Report of the House of Representatives Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled  Fair Shares for All Insider Trading in Australia   AGPS      Thus  it can be seen that the purpose of the extended definition was to make it plain that the term was not to be confined to  specific information  consisting of an existing fact that was capable of being expressed unequivocally  as stated by Lee J in Ryan v Triguboff citedSecurities and Exchange Commission v Chenery Corporation   US     It is true  as Frankfurter J said in Securities and Exchange Commission v Chenery Corporation   US     at   that  to say a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis  see the citation in Beach Petroleum at   per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA  But it is otherwise where the parties acknowledge that they are not in a fiduciary relationship  In my view  those words mean what they say and should be enforced accordingly  unless the mandate letter was vitiated as a matter of law referred toStevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is difficult to see that the words of the mandate letter have anything other than their plain meaning  Citigroup was retained solely as an adviser to Toll  as an independent contractor and not as a fiduciary  The engagement of Citigroup as an  independent contractor and not in any other capacity  suggested that the parties had in mind the distinction between independent contractors and employees or agents  see for example Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   per Mason  Wilson  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ  Thus  these words also point against the assumption of any fiduciary capacity referred toSymonds v Raphael   FamCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth family ct  html  This principle applies whether or not the costs agreement is made before the solicitor is instructed  see Symonds v Raphael   FamCA         FLR   at     per Baker and Burton JJ  see also McNamara at   per Doyle CJ  The reason given in those authorities for the proposition that the solicitor must make full disclosure even before the contract of retainer is that the fiduciary relationship may arise before the solicitor is actually retained  see United Dominions v Brian at     per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ referred toTarget Holdings Limited v Redferns     AC   Their Honours said in Beach Petroleum at   that Brickenden is not authority for the general proposition that in no case involving breach of fiduciary duty may a court consider what would have happened if the duty had been performed  This is because Brickenden is now to be understood in light of the decision of the House of Lords in Target Holdings Limited v Redferns     AC    Their Lordships there said at   that causation is to be determined using commonsense and hindsight  see Beach Petroleum at   per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA  I respectfully agree with the views of the Court of Appeal referred toToll  FGCT  Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that

execution of the mandate letter as part of its case  However  a difficulty arises because of its disavowal of any fiduciary relationship pre dating the actual execution of the mandate letter  cf United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ   A central part of ASIC s case is that Citigroup was required  as a financial services licensee  to have in place adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest  see s  A aa  of the Corporations Act   According to ASIC  conducting proprietary trading without having obtained Toll s informed consent to the proprietary trading  amounts to a breach of this subsection   ASIC does not concede that  as a matter of statutory construction  s  A aa  applies only where a licensee and its client are in a fiduciary relationship  However  Mr Walker SC  for ASIC  did concede that for the purposes of the present case  ASIC s contention that Citigroup contravened s  A aa  depends upon the success of ASIC s submission that the parties were in a fiduciary relationship   Even if Citigroup did owe fiduciary duties to Toll  the question of whether s  A aa  was engaged depends upon a number of questions of statutory construction  The principal questions are whether Citigroup was providing  financial services  within the meaning of s  A  and  financial product advice  within the meaning of s  B  of the Corporations Act   as well as whether any such services were exempt services within Reg       of the Corporations Regulations    Cth    ASIC seeks to argue the conflicts claim on three further bases  These are  first  a contravention of s  H of the Corporations Act   second  breach of s  DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  and third  breach of s  CA of the ASIC Act   However  each of them depends upon acceptance of ASIC s contention that Citigroup owed fiduciary duties to Toll   The subject matter over which any fiduciary obligations will extend must be determined by the character of the venture or undertaking  see Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees  Executors and Agency Company Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Dixon J  United Dominions v Brian at   per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ  News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  This is to be ascertained from the terms of the agreement and the course of dealing between the parties  see News Limited at   per Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  Australian Breeders Co operative Society Limited v Jones     ALR   at   per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ  Beach Petroleum NL v Kennedy   NSWCA         NSWLR   at   per Spigelman CJ  Sheller JA and Stein JA   This principle applies whether or not the costs agreement is made before the solicitor is instructed  see Symonds v Raphael   FamCA         FLR   at     per Baker and Burton JJ  see also McNamara at   per Doyle CJ  The reason given in those authorities for the proposition that the solicitor must make full disclosure even before the contract of retainer is that the fiduciary relationship may arise before the solicitor is actually retained  see United Dominions v Brian at     per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ   This points to a limitation of the principle to those who fall within an established category of fiduciary relationship or  at very least  to those who carry fiduciary obligations before the execution of the contract  as in United Dominions v Brian   The second reason why the principle is not applicable in the present proceedings is that ASIC s case was that the fiduciary relationship between Citigroup and Toll arose from the mandate letter  ASIC specifically eschewed any suggestion that the fiduciary relationship arose prior to the execution of the mandate letter on   August     It follows that there is no place in these proceedings for the application of the principle that a person who is already subject to fiduciary obligations must obtain the client s fully informed consent to the exclusion or modification of those obligations referred toWalden Properties Limited v Beaver Properties Pty Limited     NSWLR   A different formulation of the test is to be found in the judgment of Hutley JA in Walden Properties Limited v Beaver Properties Pty Limited     NSWLR   at      However  his Honour s remarks are explained by the learned authors of

observations of Mahoney JA in Woolworths v Kelly at   were to the same effect  His Honour said that fiduciary duties could be  varied or released  by contract  Also  in News Limited   a Full Court of this Court  Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ  said at   that whether there are any fiduciary obligations at all may depend on the terms of the contract
