edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlLike the power to terminate the service of an officer or an enlisted member  the power exercisable in respect of a referred redress of grievance complaint is in modern form statutory and found in the Defence Regulations but  to borrow language employed by Sir Own Dixon in describing the former in Commonwealth v Welsh   HCA         CLR   at   it is no new subject  Though  for the purposes of the present case  Part XV was further amended on   May   by the Defence Force Amendment Regulations    No   SLI   of   in ways not presently material  they find contemporary expression in reg     and   within Part XV of the Defence Regulations  when CPL Millar made a complaint to her commanding officer seeking redress of a grievance and then sought the subsequent referral of that complaint to the professional head of the Australian Army she was invoking rights the origins of which are ancient and deeply rooted in our constitutional heritage  As will be seen  it is also no coincidence that the Governor General in Council by  at the time  reg  b  of the Defence Regulations  prescribed Brigadier to be the minimum rank to be held by an officer to whom the Chief of Army may delegate the power to determine a referred redress of grievance complaint  Knowledge of legal history  of the relationship between the Sovereign  the Parliament and the Armed Forces  of the rank structure and chain of command within the Army and of the responsibilities in respect of subordinates assumed by those who hold the Queen s commission in the Defence Force is essential to an appreciation of the nature of the power exercisable on the referral of a complaint seeking a redress of grievance  all the more so because the language of reg   is compressed  That regulation assumes that its reader will either have that knowledge or at least make an effort to obtain it  In  not suited to be an enlisted member  the present offers a paradigm example of  a matter of opinion or policy or taste   Further  as Sir Owen Dixon noted in Welsh   HCA         CLR     at   of other regulations governing the relationship between the Commonwealth  and that term is used to include the Crown in right of the Commonwealth  and members of the Defence Force and in a passage to which I have already alluded     In  considering the meaning and effect of the Air Force Regulations their purpose cannot be neglected  namely to provide rules to govern one of the armed forces of the Crown  The relation to the Crown of members of the armed forces is no new subject  the rules of the common law define it  The regulations are not to be read in disregard of those rules and of the long tradition to which they have contributed  At common law neither commission nor enlistment in the services does or can amount to a contract with the Crown and neither officer nor man obtains any legal right against the Crown to pay  deferred pay  half pay  pension or emolument   All engagements between those in the military service of the Crown and the Crown are voluntary only on the part of the Crown  and give no occasion for an action in respect of any alleged contract  per

exposition on the subject of procedural fairness  Mason J  in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   remarked of the expression that it  conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case   It is not difficult to see how  in the context of operational service in times of a large scale deployment of the Australian Army  the content of a procedural fairness obligation in respect of a redress complaint either as initially made or on referral may in some cases be very limited indeed  In the present case  though the occasion for the initiation of termination procedures arose from incidents on operational service  the decision making process occurred in more benign circumstances in Australia  There is nothing in the circumstances which would suggest that any attenuated procedural fairness obligation attended BRIG Bornholt s consideration of the referred redress complaint  Thus  the assumption of the parties that the making of a decision by him was attended with a procedural fairness obligation which included the affording of a fair opportunity to CPL Millar to know the case made against her and to contradict it is correct  I accept therefore that he was obliged to afford CPL Millar procedural fairness in determining that referred redress complaint  The nature of that obligation though  as Mason J observed  depends on the circumstances of the particular case  In this case  CPL Millar had already been the recipient of a Termination Notice which set out the basis upon which it was proposed to terminate her service in the Army  Only after that notice and an opportunity to respond had been given was the decision to terminate her service made by a delegate of the Chief of Army  In turn  before BRIG Bornholt became involved  CPL Millar had already sought redress from her CO and had the benefit of a reasoned decision as to why her complaint was not upheld  In light of those processes and their outcomes  it is clear that CPL Millar was well aware by then that the reason why a decision had been made to terminate her service on the basis of unsuitability and why her initial grievance was not upheld was a view  supported by the opinion of the Army psychologist CAPT Brown in her report of   November   in particular  that  considering her behaviour on operational service in Iraq against the background of her service as a whole  there was a risk that under stress her performance would not be satisfactory  In seeking to have the Chief of Army overturn the termination decision on the review of her grievance complaint she furnished a further report from Mr Zemaitis along with character references from military associates and superiors  Upon referral and as required by Defence Instruction  General  PERS     Redress of Grievance Tri Service Procedures made under the Defence Act  a report in respect of the referred complaint was prepared for the Chief of Army s  or delegate s  consideration by the Complaints Resolution Agency within the Headquarters of the Australian Defence Force  It is the report of that agency which came before BRIG Bornholt and which he came to adopt  In adopting that report  its suggested outcome and the reasons as his own BRIG Bornholt adopted a report in which the case advanced by CPL Millar was thoroughly rehearsed and commented upon  as was the process that had led up to the decision to terminate her service and the initial rejection of her redress complaint  No new consideration personal to CPL Millar was introduced by the staff who compiled the report for Brig Bornholt  Neither did he do this of his own motion  In these circumstances  a further passage from the judgement of Mason J in Kioa v West  at   is apposite     T his is not to say that fairness will necessarily  or even generally  require that an applicant for a further entry permit be given an opportunity to be heard even where deportation may follow from its refusal  The grant of an entry permit is a matter of discretion  Indeed  the cancellation of a temporary entry permit is expressed to be a matter of absolute discretion  s     In the ordinary course of granting or refusing entry permits there is no occasion for the principles of natural justice to be called into play  The applicant is entitled to support his application by such information and material as he thinks appropriate and he cannot complain if the authorities reject his application because they do not accept  without further notice to him  what he puts forward  But if in fact the decision maker intends to reject the application by reference to some consideration personal to the applicant on the basis of information obtained from another source which has not been dealt with by the applicant in his application there may be a case for saying that procedural fairness requires that he be given an opportunity of responding to the matter   In re H K   An Infant      QB    If the application is for a further temporary entry permit and it is made in circumstances which are relevantly similar to those in which the earlier permit was granted  the applicant may have a legitimate expectation that the further entry permit will be granted or will not be refused in the absence of an opportunity to deal with the grounds on which it is to be refused  And if the refusal is to be attended by the making of a deportation order  the case for holding that procedural fairness requires that such an opportunity be given is unquestionably stronger       In this respect recent decisions illustrate the importance which the law attaches to the need to bring to a person s attention the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision is likely to turn so that he may have an opportunity of dealing with it  FAI is one illustration  Cole v  Cunningham     ALR     is another  as are Reg  v  Gaming Board for Great Britain  Ex parte Benaim and Khaida     QB   at p   and Daganayasi v  Minister of Immigration     NZLR        BRIG Bornholt was obliged to investigate the referred complaint  As a senior officer he was able  as would have been the Chief of Army of Army himself  to require staff to prepare a report on the subject  In that regard  the procedure envisaged by the Defence Instruction  General  is not inconsistent with the Defence Regulations in relation to the investigation of a referred redress complaint  Whether he interfered with the termination decision was a matter for the exercise of discretion after investigation  Given the particular way in which the investigation was conducted  effectively on the papers  there was no need to give CPL Millar any further opportunity to be heard before making a decision  At the very latest  the fullness of the case she had to meet  both in terms of expert opinion and underlying reports and service history had been exposed to her in the disposal by her CO of her redress complaint  BRIG Bornholt decided not to uphold her redress complaint not on the basis of new information personal to her obtained from another source and not exposed already to her but on the basis of existing materials  In these circumstances  and contrary to the submission advanced on her behalf  he was not obliged again to revert to her and to offer her an opportunity to comment upon the reasons he proposed to adopt in declining to uphold her redress application  Rather  as is evident from the passage quoted  she   cannot complain if the authorities reject  her  application because they do not accept  without further notice to  her  what  she  puts forward   I therefore reject the submission that BRIG Bornholt denied CPL Millar procedural fairness in making his decision  A further submission was made that CPL Millar had not been afforded an opportunity to comment upon an assessment made of her by her Squadron Sergeant Major which was taken into account by CAPT Brown in her report  However  as the Respondents demonstrated in their written submissions  by the time that CPL Millar sought the referral of her redress complaint she had had two opportunities to comment upon this assessment  of which she had taken advantage  once in the course of showing cause why her service ought not be terminated and again in the seeking of the referral of her redress complaint  There is no substance in this aspect of her procedural fairness challenge  Neither  when it is recalled that it is the referral decision which is under review is there any substance in her assertion that she was denied an opportunity to comment upon comments made by the Army s Psychological Support Service North Queensland on the subject of her suitability  Those comments were limited to a concurrence with the views already expressed by CAPT Brown and were exposed to CPL Millar in the results of the  Quick Assessment  which was made of her initial redress complaint  An examination of his reasons discloses that BRIG Bornholt approached his task in two particular ways  On the one hand  he examined whether the procedures adopted to date had been appropriate and whether the decisions reached were reasonably open  on the other and in any event he reached his own opinion on the whole of the evidence before him  which included the further evidence provided by CPL Millar in seeking the referral of her redress complaint  as to whether she was  in terms of reg  e  of the Defence  Personnel  Regulations   suited to be an enlisted member followedAttorney General  NSW  v Quin     CLR  The following observation of Brennan J in Attorney General  NSW  v Quin     CLR   at     is no less pertinent in this case than in other judicial review cases    The essential warrant for judicial intervention is the declaration and enforcing of the law affecting the extent and exercise of power  that is the characteristic duty of the judicature as the third branch of government      T he duty extends to judicial review of administrative action alleged to go beyond the power conferred by statute or by the prerogative or alleged to be otherwise in disconformity with the law  The duty and the jurisdiction of the courts are expressed in the memorable words of Marshall CJ in Marbury v Madison      It is  emphatically  the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is   The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository s power  If  in so doing  the court avoids administrative injustice or error  so be it  but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error  The merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant power and  subject to political control  for the repository alone    footnote reference omitted     Like other officers of the Commonwealth  the decisions of the Chief of Army and his delegates are amenable to judicial review either by the High Court by constitutional writ under s  v  of the Constitution or in such other courts as the Parliament invests with federal jurisdiction judicially to review their decisions  but only for error of law  There is nothing inherently illogical or unreasonable about the opinion as to CPL Millar s suitability to which BRIG Bornholt came  Twice before she had been considered for discharge on the basis of unsuitability but a choice had been made as between competing assessments not to discharge her  As a result of her performance on operational service two psychologists  MAJ Hadfield  provisionally  and CAPT Brown formed the opinion that CPL Millar was not suited to be a soldier  Assisted by their opinions and looking at the whole of her service history  BRIG Bornholt was entitled to form the opinion he did as to her unsuitability  In so doing  he was entitled to and self evidently did take into account the views of Mr Zemaitis  It is just that he chose not to accept the latter s views  BRIG Bornholt was also entitled to form a view  based on a comparison of the reports of the Army psychologists and Mr Zemaitis prepared for him by staff and adopted by him that one reason for the differing views may have been that Mr Zemaitis did not have access to CPL Millar s full psychological file followedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe feature

FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlFor completeness  I should note that  though reference is made by the Full Court in Martincevic v Commonwealth   FCAFC         FCR   to a redress of grievance investigation  it did not prove necessary in that case for the Full Court to explore the nature of the power able to be exercised by the Chief of Army upon the referral of a redress complaint  Rather  that case highlighted that the existence and outcome of a subsisting redress investigation before the making of a discharge decision may constitute  and in the circumstances of that case was held to constitute  a relevant consideration for the purposes of the making of that discharge decision  It does not follow from the lack of understanding of the nature of the power evident in the Commonwealth s submissions that CPL Millar must succeed in her judicial review application  To determine that it is first necessary to relate in more detail the factual background which gave rise to CPL Millar s initial redress complaint  its later referral and this judicial review application  It is also necessary to set out why BRIG Bornholt came to confirm the decision to terminate her service with the Army  BRIG Bornholt s reasons are comprehensive  It would do that officer less than justice not to set them out in full but so to do in the main body of the judgement would  in my opinion  detract from its continuity and ready comprehensibility  I therefore annex the full text of BRIG Bornholt s reasons and highlight pertinent features in the main body of the judgement  Before CPL Millar deployed to Iraq as part of Operation CATALYST   she undertook pre deployment training at Randwick Barracks in Sydney from   June   for a period of one month  During that time  CPL Millar maintained a good rapport with most  but not all  of the members attending this pre deployment training course  It is a feature of reg   of the Defence  Personnel  Regulations   noted

must be terminated  One aspect of that opinion is whether the decision maker is  satisfied  in terms of reg  e  that the member is not suited to be an enlisted member  These features of reg   mean

        CLR     at   Windeyer J  observed in Marks v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     at   that  in Australia  the position of the Crown in relation to the Defence Force depended not upon the prerogative but rather upon statute such that the inquiry was whether the relevant statute law modified or abrogated the common law position  Hence the significance of Sir Owen Dixon s observation as

Bowthorpe v Minister for Defence     IR   at   per Neaves J  Bromet v Oddie     ALD   at   per Finn J  consideredR v The Army Council  ex parte Ravenscroft     KB  Such is the plenary nature of the power exercisable on the merits by the Chief of Army or a delegate on a referred redress complaint that this Court might decide  as a matter of discretion rather than jurisdiction  summarily to dismiss the application of a member of the Army who has chosen to seek judicial review of a termination of service decision rather than seek redress under the Defence Regulations  That  I note  was one of the bases upon which a Queen s Bench Divisional Court refused to grant prerogative relief to an officer in such a position in R v The Army Council  ex parte Ravenscroft     KB    Insofar as there are also suggestions  at   per Viscount Reading CJ  at   per Ridley J and at   per Avory J  in that case that a court would not interfere with the dismissal of an officer because that was a matter of military discipline  the case is inconsistent with  for example  Welsh s Case   supra  here and not good law  The latter aspect of the case is perhaps explicable on the basis that  at the time  officers served at the pleasure of the Crown with the basis for their dismissal being the Prerogative rather than  as in Australia  statutory  That distinguishing feature does not though affect the authority of that case insofar as it recognises that the plenary nature of the right of redress may provide a basis for discretionary refusal of a prerogative writ citedR v Army Board of the Defence Council  ex parte Anderson     QB  It was common ground as between CPL Millar and the Respondents that BRIG Bornholt was obliged to afford her procedural fairness in deciding her referred redress complaint  As it happens  there is contemporary English intermediate appellate authority which would support such a conclusion in the particular context of the consideration of a referred redress of grievance complaint  in that case one arising from an allegation of racial discrimination by a member of the British Army  R v Army Board of the Defence Council  Ex parte Anderson     QB
