SZBUH v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedMinister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn response to a question put to him in the same terms  counsel for the appellant said it was incumbent on the Tribunal to ascertain the appellant s means as to whether he would be able to prosecute any appeal against charges that might be made against him up to the superior courts  This was put in the context that the information in the US Department of State report was correct and the information in the DFAT ICI  to the extent of the dichotomy drawn between the lower courts and the higher courts by the US Department of State  was wrong  This  in itself  illustrates that if there was error  it was error of fact  not law  Moreover  even if the US Department of State report correctly reflected the position as at the date of the Tribunal s decision  the Tribunal was under no obligation to enquire of the appellant as to whether or not he had the means to prosecute an appeal to the higher appellate courts  Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA         ALR   at      This ground of appeal cannot be sustained  The second ground asserts that his Honour erred in finding at   that s  A of the Act did not apply in circumstances where  it appeared     the decision of the  Tribunal  turned on information provided by the   appellant   himself for the purposes of the review application to the  Tribunal  and also general country information   This second ground was particularised in the amended Notice of Appeal in the following way       i  Contrary to his Honour s finding  information specifically concerning the appellant was provided by the appellant s adviser who faxed a copy of a document dated   August      ii  The appellant s adviser also  submitted by fax a number of photographs of the  appellant  and a copy of a poster of the  appellant  seeking support in the student council election of    The appellant s argument in relation to this ground was put on two bases  One correct  the other incorrect  First  it is correct to say that  as a matter of fact  the information referred to in the particulars was not given by the appellant himself  it was given by his adviser  Second it is incorrect to say that  as a matter of the proper construction of s  A b  of the Act  such information was not given by the appellant  and therefore excluded from the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s  A   Counsel for the appellant disavowed any reliance on an argument that the information given was not for the purpose of the appellant s application  His case was confined to his Honour s reference to the word  himself  in reliance on a contention that the information was not given by the appellant himself  but by the appellant s adviser  His Honour s use of the word  himself  is perhaps unfortunate  but I do not think it conveys any suggestion that his Honour was of the view that information falling within the exclusion that is s  A b  is confined to information which the appellant himself gives and does not include information given by others on his behalf  If it does then  in my view  that construction is wrong  This ground of appeal must be rejected  The third ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction by concluding its fact finding task substantially in a manner that a fair minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly  This third ground was particularised in the amended Notice of Appeal in the following way       i  The Tribunal did not accept  that outside of student politics the  appellant  has a high political profile  because of  the generality of his answers to the Tribunal s questions about the philosophy  mandate and objectives of the Chatra League and Awami League        ii  The transcript of the Tribunal hearing demonstrates that  contrary to the Tribunal s assessment of the generality of the appellant s responses  the appellant responded specifically to the Tribunal s generic question Q        iii  The appellant s response to the Tribunal s Q  spans approximately six typed pages of the transcript and was made in difficult circumstances where the appellant was specifically told by the Tribunal  No  I don t want a political discourse  and later   Now  I think I ve got that        v  The particulars to grounds   above and   below were repeated referred toNABE v Minister for Immigration
