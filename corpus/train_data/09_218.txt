Australian Trade Commission v Isaac Jewellery Pty Ltd  No      FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedAcerose Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority of New South Wales  unreported  Sup Ct  NSW  Carruthers AJ    July  Isaac Jewellery also relies upon the decision of Acerose Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority of New South Wales  unreported  Sup Ct  NSW  Carruthers AJ    July   in which the successful defendant sought an order that the unsuccessful plaintiff pay its costs  Carruthers AJ  refusing such order and instead ordering that each party pay its own costs  said as follows    Also these proceedings are  as I have already indicated  by their nature a test case as far as other Spinner s franchisees are concerned  and I take into consideration the line of authority applied in decisions such as that of Cummins J in Lyser v Camberwell City Council     LGRA     where his Honour was dealing with the construction of certain Local Government by laws  His Honour there deviated from the general rule that costs should follow the event because the matters which were debated before him were matters of much general interest in so far as Local Government administration was concerned  Similarly  the decision of Acerose is distinguishable since the Court in that matter was clearly of the opinion that the case before it constituted a test case  As to the decision in Cripps   Austrade submits that it does not stand for the principle that non indigent public authorities cannot be awarded costs  In Attrill there had already been a division of judicial opinion within the Supreme Court and the New South Wales Court of Appeal found that the determination of that dispute in the Court was a matter in the public interest  For this reason it ordered that each party pay its own costs  In Acerose and Cripps public interest was found to be involved in the decision distinguishedAttrill and Others v Richmond River Shire Council     NSWLR  Isaac Jewellery refers to the decision of Attrill and Others v Richmond River Shire Council     NSWLR   in which the Court  having resolved a difference of judicial opinion concerning the interpretation of a provision in the Local Government Act     ordered each party to pay its own costs of the appeal because the Court found the resolution of the issue to be in the public interest  Austrade submits that the decisions of State Courts relied upon by Isaac Jewellery should be treated with caution  In Attrill the Court was faced with a difference of judicial opinion relating to a local government statute and such factor clearly demonstrated a distinct public interest  No such consideration arises in the present appeal  In Attrill there had already been a division of judicial opinion within the Supreme Court and the New South Wales Court of Appeal found that the determination of that dispute in the Court was a matter in the public interest  For this reason it ordered that each party pay its own costs  In Acerose and Cripps public interest was found to be involved in the decision citedAustralian Trade Commission v Isaac Jewellery Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Court delivered its judgment in these proceedings on   February    see Australian Trade Commission v Isaac Jewellery Pty Ltd   FCA     Isaac No       At the request of the parties the Court reserved the question of costs  The Court has now heard the party s submissions in relation to costs which are summarised hereunder referred toBullock and Others v Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia and Others  No       FCR  Provided the Court exercises its discretion judicially  its power to award a certificate is unfettered  see Bullock and Others v Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia and Others  No       FCR   at   referred toCretazzo v Lombardi     SASR  The basic rule remains that the Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion in relation to costs subject only to the requirement that the discretion be exercised judicially and not arbitrarily or capriciously and not on grounds unconnected with the litigation  see Cretazzo v Lombardi     SASR   at   referred toHughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR    Secondly  it remains the established principle that an award of costs to the successful party is compensatory  see Latoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ at   McHugh J at    In Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR     at   Toohey J observed    Ordinarily  costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order  Ritter v  Godfrey     K B    distinguishedIndependent Commission Against Corruption v Cripps and Anor  unreported  Sup Ct  NSW  Sully J    August  Isaac Jewellery also relies upon the decision in Independent Commission Against Corruption v Cripps and Anor  unreported  Sup Ct  NSW  Sully J    August   which it submitted was an example of a Court declining an award of costs in favour of a public body given that the public body was pursuing a matter of public interest and the public body was not an indigent private person  Austrade rejects the implication that its submissions before the Tribunal were in any way responsible for the Tribunal s erroneous conclusions concerning the operation of s  b i  and s  b ii  of the EMDG Act  Its submissions before the Tribunal addressed both sub sections for the Tribunal s consideration but neither party suggested that the Export Market Development Grants  Change in Ownership of Business  Guidelines    the Guidelines  applied to s  b i   Austrade submits that it was the Tribunal s error to erroneously apply the Guidelines to such subsection  Austrade also submits that there is no major public interest in the Court s decision which should lead the Court to depart from the usual practice of ordering that the successful party receive a costs order in its favour  Further  Austrade emphasises that the suggestion that the public interest was to be served by the appeal first arose from a comment by Gary Dennis  Isaac Jewellery s consultant  and that Mr Tonkin s response clearly stated that Austrade would not pay Isaac Jewellery s costs  Similarly  the decision of Acerose is distinguishable since the Court in that matter was clearly of the opinion that the case before it constituted a test case  As to the decision in Cripps   Austrade submits that it does not stand for the principle that non indigent public authorities cannot be awarded costs  In Attrill there had already been a division of judicial opinion within the Supreme Court and the New South Wales Court of Appeal found that the determination of that dispute in the Court was a matter in the public interest  For this reason it ordered that each party pay its own costs  In Acerose and Cripps public interest was found to be involved in the decision referred toLatoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSecondly  it remains the established principle that an award of costs to the successful party is compensatory  see Latoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ at   McHugh J at    In Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR     at   Toohey J observed    Ordinarily  costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order  Ritter v  Godfrey     K B     As stated  an award of costs is in its nature compensatory  and not punitive  McHugh J at   of Latoudis observed that a costs order may    and usually will  be made even though the action has failed through no fault of the unsuccessful party    The Court is unable to discern any factor to justify the Court exercising its discretion in favour of Isaac Jewellery so as to deny Austrade its entitlement to costs  Application for Costs Certificate Section   of the Costs Act relevantly provides      Subject to this Act  where a Federal appeal succeeds on a question of law  the court that heard the appeal may  on the application of a respondent to the appeal  grant to the respondent a costs certificate in respect of the appeal             The certificate that may be granted under subsection   or   by a court to a respondent to a Federal appeal is a certificate stating that  in the opinion of the court  it would be appropriate for the Attorney General to authorize a payment under this Act to the respondent in respect of     a  the costs incurred by the respondent in relation to the appeal  and    b  any costs incurred by an appellant in relation to the appeal that have been  or are required to be  paid by the respondent to the appellant in pursuance of an order of the court  not being costs to which a costs certificate granted under section   relates  Section   defines  Federal appeal  to include

Richmond River Council   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Court does not consider that there is any wide public interest established in the result of this appeal to justify an order that each party pay its own costs  as was ordered in the authorities relied upon by Isaac Jewellery and the rational for which was considered in Oshlack v Richmond River Council   HCA         CLR    If an appeal raises a novel question of   much general importance and some difficulty    see Ruddock at   the appeal Court may refuse an order for costs against the unsuccessful appellant  see Re Mersey Railway Co     Ch D   at   and    No such consideration arises in the present appeal followedRepatriation Commission v Cornelius     ALD  In Repatriation Commission v Cornelius     ALD   Branson J observed at   that costs certificates may be granted in the following circumstances    The restricted circumstances in which costs certificates may be granted indicates that the Act is not intended to provide  in effect  an alternative source of legal aid but is intended to advance a more specific public interest  That public interest would seem to be the alleviation of the costs burden that can fall on an individual who appropriately and successfully institutes a proceeding before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a federal court yet thereafter finds himself or herself a respondent to a successful  appeal  on a question of law or as to the amount of damage awarded at first instance  This public interest as described above appears to be similar to the factual scenario of the present proceedings  Nothing in this Court s decision to uphold Austrade s appeal form the AAT suggests that Isaac Jewellery did not  appropriately and successfully  institute a proceeding before the AAT  and Isaac Jewellery now finds itself as a respondent to the successful appeal on a question of law by Austrade  Austrade has obtained a benefit of a similar kind to that considered in Repatriation Commission v Milenz   FCA    Finn J at   found that the successful appellant obtained a benefit in ensuring that   administrative decisions made under the Veterans  Entitlement Act are made according to law   and thus  making a respondent     bear the costs of the appeal in these circumstances undercuts the public interest served by the Federal Proceedings  Costs  Act     By analogy  Austrade has an interest in ensuring that decisions made under the EMDG Act are made by the application of the correct principles  In this respect a benefit has resulted in Austrade s favour from the determination of the appeal  Further  the respondent in this case is a small business of limited financial means and thus making Isaac Jewellery bear the full cost of the appeal would undercut the public interest as described by Branson J at   of Cornelius  followedRepatriation Commission v Milenz   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAustrade has
