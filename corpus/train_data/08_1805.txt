Review   Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd  No      FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedGlobal Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd     IPR   The parties agreed that  in proceedings such as this  the Court would ordinarily order that the unsuccessful party or parties pay the costs of successful party or parties on the claim and cross claim respectively  see  e g   Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd     IPR    Thus  ordinarily  the applicants would pay Redberry s costs of the application and Redberry would pay the cross respondents  costs of the cross claim  In this case  however  the position is complicated by Redberry s offers of settlement   I turn first to Redberry s latest offer of compromise of   August   which invoked O   of the Rules  The offer complied with the formal requirements of the order  which are set out in O   r    The offer also provided a time for acceptance in accordance with O   r     Currently  O   r   of the Rules applies  i f     an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant  and     the respondent obtains an order or judgment on the claim to which the offer relates as favourable to the respondent  or more favourable to the respondent  than the terms of the offer   If applicable  this provision creates a presumptive entitlement in the respondent to indemnity costs after   am on the day after the offer was made  This provision is  however  a comparatively new one  having commenced operation only on   August    The provision cannot apply to Redberry s offer of compromise  which was made in the preceding year  in August   see Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  s   and the Legislative Instruments Act    Cth  s  b  citedCoshott v Learoyd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  As at August   the only provision in connection with costs following an applicant s rejection of a respondent s offer of compromise was O   r   which deals with the position  i f     an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant  and     the applicant obtains judgment on the claim to which the offer relates not more favourable than the terms of the offer   If applicable  this provision also creates a presumptive entitlement in the respondent to indemnity costs  The provision cannot apply to Redberry s offer of compromise  however  because the applicant not only rejected the respondent s offer but was wholly unsuccessful in the claim  In this circumstance  O   r   of the Rules has no application  see Coshott v Learoyd   FCA   at   per Wilcox J  Dukemaster   FCAFC   at   per Sundberg and Emmett JJ  and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd     ALR   at   per Sackville J referred toDukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Subsequently  Redberry filed additional costs submission  with leave  to address the fact that  as the Court noted  O   r   did not commence operation until   August    In these submissions  Redberry submitted that  if the Court were bound to follow Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd   FCAFC     in order for an award of indemnity costs to be made  the test was whether it was imprudent or unreasonable to reject the offer of   August     In relation to the costs of the cross claim  Redberry submitted that it was to be treated as an  applicant  for the purposes of O   of the Rules  see O   r   and O   r    where an  applicant  is defined to include a  cross claimant  and a  respondent  is defined to include a  cross respondent   Accordingly  in reliance on O   r   of the Rules  Redberry submitted that it was entitled to     its party party costs on the cross claim up to   August   and     its costs on the cross claim from   August   onwards on an indemnity basis   As at August   the only provision in connection with costs following an applicant s rejection of a respondent s offer of compromise was O   r   which deals with the position  i f     an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant  and     the applicant obtains judgment on the claim to which the offer relates not more favourable than the terms of the offer   If applicable  this provision also creates a presumptive entitlement in the respondent to indemnity costs  The provision cannot apply to Redberry s offer of compromise  however  because the applicant not only rejected the respondent s offer but was wholly unsuccessful in the claim  In this circumstance  O   r   of the Rules has no application  see Coshott v Learoyd   FCA   at   per Wilcox J  Dukemaster   FCAFC   at   per Sundberg and Emmett JJ  and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd     ALR   at   per Sackville J   The authorities recognise that the making of an offer outside O   by a respondent  which is rejected by an applicant who turns out to be wholly unsuccessful  is a matter to be taken into account in determining the nature of the costs order to be made  In such a case  a respondent claiming indemnity costs must show that the rejection of the offer of compromise was imprudent or unreasonable  see Dukemaster   FCAFC   at     University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA   at   per French J  and Seven Network   ALR   at   and    Where a cross claimant makes an offer  which is rejected by a cross respondent  and the cross claimant ultimately fails  the position is quite different since there is little  if any  basis for saying that the rejection of the offer of compromise was imprudent and unreasonable   The question is  therefore  whether or not it can be said that the applicants acted imprudently or unreasonably in rejecting Redberry s offer of compromise in relation to the applicants  claim  Plainly enough  even in the present circumstances  the mere refusal of an offer of compromise is not sufficient to satisfy this test  see John S Hayes   Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd     FCR   at   per Hill J and Dukemaster   FCAFC   at     Although the refusal of the offer is a factor to take into account  it is not determinative on the question of indemnity costs  As Sackville J said in Seven Network   ALR   at    the court is required to consider whether the rejection of the offer of compromise was unreasonable by considering  among any other relevant circumstances  the strengths and weaknesses of the applicants  case  looking at the claim prospectively at the time the offer was made   emphasis original    The following factors support the conclusion that the applicants  rejection was not imprudent or unreasonable      The Designs Act introduced a comparatively new statutory framework and  as at August   there were few decisions under the Act concerning the issues arising in this case  The authorities  therefore  provided limited guidance as to the likely outcome       The applicants  claim was tenable  It was not unreasonable  There were what I referred to as  clear similarities between the Review Design and the design embodied in the Redberry garment  and there was also the direction in s   of the Designs Act to be considered  Of course  the directions in ss  a     c  and  d      and   had to be borne in mind and standard of the informed user applied  The application of this standard depended  however  on the evidence adduced at trial  including the evidence of Ms Mudie  Her affidavit had not been filed and served let alone read at the time Redberry made its offer  The prior art  which was significant in this case  was also not fully explored until the trial  As at August   the prior art relied on by Redberry was apparently limited to between   to   items  see the particulars under   to the Amended Defence and Cross Claim filed on   August    Many more items formed part of the prior art relied on at trial  Further  had the applicants been successful  they might ordinarily have expected damages or an account of profits  at their election  Had they been successful  they might reasonably have expected to recover rather more than the amount Redberry offered  I doubt that the difficulties the applicants faced at trial in connection with their claims for general damages and additional damages would have been apparent to them at the time of the rejection of the offer of compromise  In one sense  these difficulties were the product of a relatively new legislative regime as applied to the fashion industry  most of which became manifest at trial       As I acknowledged in my earlier reasons for judgment  had the applicants  claim for infringement been made out  a question would have arisen as to whether Redberry could successfully invoke s  b  of the Designs Act   Consideration of this issue led to consideration of evidence adduced by Redberry  including the evidence of Mr Liu  It may be recalled that  although I ultimately accepted his evidence as essentially truthful  it is correct to say  as the applicants did  that there were some unexplained deficiencies in his account  His evidence was not available to the applicants at the time of the offer and hence it is not open to the applicants to rely on these deficiencies in explaining their rejection of the offer  I accept  however  that  even at time of offer  the applicants might reasonably have perceived that there were aspects of Redberry s case that tended against accepting Redberry s account of things and that it would have been difficult for them then to have predicted how these matters might turn out at the trial       I accept that neither the applicants nor Redberry raised the issue as to the effect of commissioning manufacture outside of Australia      Further  neither the offer of compromise nor the letter accompanying it contained a statement of reasons as to why Redberry believed that the application would fail  see Dukemaster   FCAFC   at     As Sundberg and Emmett JJ there said    Whatever the position may be with an offer made under Order   a Calderbank offer  or any offer of compromise outside the regime in Order   is unlikely to serve its purpose of attracting an indemnity award of costs if the rejecting applicant fails to recover more than what is ordered  unless the offer is a reasonable one and contains a statement of the reasons the offeror maintains that the application will fail   I do not consider that there are countervailing matters that outweigh these considerations  Accordingly  viewed as at   August   it was not imprudent and unreasonable for the applicants to reject Redberry s offer of compromise so far as the applicants  claim was concerned   It may follow from this discussion that the rejection of Redberry s earlier settlement offer also provides no basis for an award of indemnity costs  Further  as at   June   when this earlier offer was made  the applicants knew comparatively little about Redberry s case  The applicants had Redberry s defence but  as they noted in their letter rejecting the offer  as at   June   they did not have the respondent s verified list of documents or copies of documents showing that only   of the allegedly infringing garments had been imported  The letter containing the offer did not contain any statement of reasons as to why Redberry believed that the application would fail referred toSeven Network Ltd v News Ltd     ALR   As at August   the only provision in connection with costs following an applicant s rejection of a respondent s offer of compromise was O   r   which deals with the position  i f     an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant  and     the applicant

indemnity costs  The provision cannot apply to Redberry s offer of compromise  however  because the applicant not only rejected the respondent s offer but was wholly unsuccessful in the claim  In this circumstance  O   r   of the Rules has no application  see Coshott v Learoyd   FCA   at   per Wilcox J  Dukemaster   FCAFC   at   per Sundberg and Emmett JJ  and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd     ALR
