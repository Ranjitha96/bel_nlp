Notice of Dispute dated that day   the Notice of Dispute   Allphones commenced a dispute resolution process with approximately ninety of its franchisees with whom it was then in dispute citedHoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd  No     ATPR    The Notice of Dispute expressly referred to proceedings NSD   of   and to the Hoy Mobile proceedings which had been decided by Rares J in May    as to which see Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd  No     ATPR      In the Notice of Dispute  Allphones also mentioned the prospect that the ACCC might bring proceedings against it pursuant to s  B  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth    the Act    Those foreshadowed proceedings have now been commenced  NSD   of    Allphones made quite clear in the Notice of Dispute that it was seeking to resolve all of the issues raised in all of the proceedings to which it made reference in that document  In the Notice of Dispute  Allphones said that the dispute resolution process was being undertaken pursuant to cl   of its old Franchise Agreement and Pt   of the Franchising Code of Conduct  Allphones proposed a process of negotiation followed by a mediation  if necessary  At the end of cl   of the Notice of Dispute  Allphones said      Allphones will invite the ACCC to participate in the mediation  If the ACCC chooses not to do so  Allphones will keep the ACCC informed of the progress of the mediation  Allphones proposed that Mr Fitzgerald QC be appointed to act as the mediator should mediation be required citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd  No     FCA         ALR       ATPR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn circumstances which I have described in two previous judgments delivered by me   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd  No     FCA         ALR       ATPR     and Allphones Retail Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA     on   August   by Notice of Dispute dated that day   the Notice of Dispute   Allphones commenced a dispute resolution process with approximately ninety of its franchisees with whom it was then in dispute  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd  No     FCA       ALR       ATPR     I dealt with an application for interlocutory injunctive relief made by the ACCC against Allphones in proceedings NSD   of    At     of that judgment  I described certain events leading up to the service of the Notice of Dispute  That description was based upon the evidence before me for the purposes of the application with which I was then dealing and  to some extent  may be controversial  But  allowing for these limitations  the description which I gave in those paragraphs of that judgment is a useful starting point for placing the Notice of Dispute into an appropriate context  Accordingly  I incorporate those paragraphs into these Reasons in order to provide some detail of the context in which the Notice of Dispute came to be issued  The Notice of Dispute was issued pursuant to the Franchising Code of Conduct and the contractual arrangements then in existence between Allphones and the franchisees upon whom it was served   the eligible franchisees    It was served upon all of Allphones existing franchisees who were not operating under its new Franchise Agreement or who had not released Allphones from past breaches of its old Franchise Agreement  The sending of the Notice of Dispute commenced a dispute resolution process in accordance with the provisions of the Franchising Code of Conduct and the contractual arrangements between Allphones and the eligible franchisees  The dispute resolution process commenced in this fashion was  if necessary  intended to culminate in a mediation  In the Notice of Dispute  Allphones raised ten issues to be addressed by negotiation and mediation with the eligible franchisees  The main issues may be conveniently grouped into four broad categories citedBailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn the present case  Allphones put in train a formal dispute resolution process which involved negotiations with its disaffected franchisees and  if necessary  a formal mediation  In order to make that process worthwhile  at the time when the process commenced  viz on   August   Allphones promised that it would provide relevant financial information to those parties with whom it was in dispute in order to facilitate those negotiations and that mediation  It was quite prepared to obtain and to provide to its franchisees an investigating accountant s report in respect of all of the critical matters in dispute  This was contemplated in the Notice of Dispute itself which  of course  was created and served approximately five or six weeks before the undertakings were given to the Court on   October    A fair appreciation of the relevant events is that the two BDO reports were always intended to be part of the dispute resolution process and that Allphones had probably always intended to use them in support of contentions which it would make in the various Statements of Position served by it as to the quantum of the levies  charges  fines  bonuses  rebates and other payments in dispute  At common law  documents produced for the purposes of such negotiations attracted without prejudice privilege  see Rabin v Mendoza   Co     All ER       WLR     and Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited   FCA   at     citedBrown v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR  These statements were referrable to the common law position  That position may have been extended by s   of the Evidence Act although there is a difference of opinion on this question emerging in the authorities  In this Court  in Brown v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   a Full Court expressed the tentative view that the expression      in connection with an attempt to negotiate the settlement of a dispute   as it appears in s     appears to extend the scope of the common law privilege followedCJ Redman Constructions Pty Ltd v Tarnap Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlThe views expressed by Jacobson J are in line with those of Campbell J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales  In CJ Redman Constructions Pty Ltd v Tarnap Pty Ltd   NSWSC     his Honour said  at     It will be apparent that the letter alludes to there being settlement discussions on foot  but gives no detail of those settlement discussions  and  most importantly  does not involve the writer of the letter either making an admission on behalf of his client concerning the matter of the settlement discussion  or attributing any admission to the recipient of the letter  While the letter alludes to it having been the addressee of the letter who had   indicated the possibility of a global resolution to all outstanding matters   I do not see that as involving any admission it is possible for a person to want to resolve a dispute which he or she regards as totally unmeritorious  The letter is one which one would not be within the rationale of the common law concerning legal professional privilege  That rationale is that people should be free to explore settlement of disputes  and make admissions in the course of those discussions  safe in the knowledge that any admissions which they make will not be tendered against them later in Court  if the negotiations break down  The wording of section   is capable  on one reading of the expression   in connection with   of extending wider than did the common law  There is  in one sense of it  a connection between this letter and the settlement negotiations  because the letter talks about the settlement negotiations  However  the expression   in connection with   while sometimes capable of referring to a connection of any kind between two subject matters  does not always have that reference  cf Wonall Pty Ltd v Clarence Property Corporation Ltd   NSWSC         NSWLR   at      It is necessary to look to the context in which the expression occurs to determine its particular meaning  in that particular context  In the particular context of section     it seems to me that the expression  in connection with  does not extend to any connection of any kind whatever  Rather  the expression needs to be construed by reference to the purpose of the without prejudice privilege  I see no basis for concluding that the rationale of the without prejudice privilege under section   of the Evidence Act is any different to the common law  There are some exceptions to the privilege  in section     which go wider than the exceptions to the privilege at common law  but I see no basis for concluding that the fundamental prohibition contained in section   has any different rationale to the common law on the topics  The ACCC did not suggest that it could invoke any of the exceptions to the operation of s   specified in s    The ACCC s sole submission was that the copy of the first BDO report furnished to it on   September   was not protected by s   because it was provided for mixed purposes  one of which was for use in the litigation between the ACCC and Allphones in this Court  This submission ignores the terms of the Phillips Fox letters of   and   September   and the terms of the Notice of Dispute itself  In the first of those letters  Phillips Fox deferred any commitment to the proposition that the report could be used for the purposes of that litigation  In the second of those letters  Phillips Fox made quite clear that it was not prepared to accede to the request made by Corrs that Allphones agree that the report be able to be admitted into evidence in the litigation in this Court  It restricted the use to the dispute resolution process then under way and requested that the documents be treated as   confidential and without prejudice    In CJ Redman Constructions Pty Ltd   NSWSC     Campbell J focussed particularly on the rationale for the without prejudice privilege at common law  namely  that people should be free to explore the settlement of disputes and to make admissions in the course of those discussions  safe in the knowledge that any admissions which they make will not be tendered against them later in Court  if the negotiations break down distinguishedcitedCommissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFurther  even if the reasoning in Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   could sensibly be applied to documents protected by without prejudice privilege  which I doubt  I do not think it would assist the ACCC in the present case  The ACCC had a legitimate interest in the Allphones disputes with its franchisees as the relevant regulatory authority under the Act and for the purposes of the Franchising Code of Conduct  Allphones sought to involve the ACCC in those capacities in the dispute resolution process instigated by Allphones  In fact  the ACCC was keeping a close eye on that process  The disaffected franchisees were probably looking to the ACCC for protection  Given the promptness with which the ACCC raised its concerns about Allphones  conduct in relation to that dispute resolution process  I infer that  in the period from early September   to at least January   officers of the ACCC and or its lawyers were in regular contact with franchisees and their legal representatives about the negotiations and foreshadowed mediation instigated by the Notice of Dispute  The copy of the first BDO report sent to Corrs on   September   was sent in connection with Allphones  dispute with the eligible franchisees  It cannot be tendered in evidence because s   forbids its tender followedField v Commissioner for Railways for NSW   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Field v Commissioner for Railways for NSW   HCA         CLR     Dixon CJ  Webb  Kitto and Taylor JJ  in a joint judgment  said  at         The law relating to communications without prejudice is of course familiar  As a matter of policy the law has long excluded from evidence admissions by words or conduct made by parties in the course of negotiations to settle litigation  The purpose is to enable parties engaged in an attempt to compromise litigation to communicate with one another freely and without the embarrassment which the liability of their communications to be put in evidence subsequently might impose upon them  The law relieves them of this embarrassment so that their negotiations to avoid litigation or to settle it may go on unhampered  This form of privilege  however  is directed against the admission in evidence of express or implied admissions  It covers admissions by words or conduct  For example  neither party can use the readiness of the other to negotiate as an implied admission  It is not concerned with objective facts which may be ascertained during the course of negotiations  These may be proved by direct evidence  But it is concerned with the use of the negotiations or what is said in the course of them as evidence by way of admission  For some centuries almost it has been recognised that parties may properly give definition to the occasions when they are communicating in this manner by the use of the words  without prejudice  and to some extent the area of protection may be enlarged by the tacit acceptance by one side of the use by the other side of these words  see Thomas v  Austen     LJ  OS  KB   Kurtz   Co  v  Spence   Sons     LT     at p   Paddock v  Forrester     EngR       Man   G

QBD   at pp      Needless to say  the privilege is a matter to be raised by objection to the admissibility of the evidence  For the purpose of deciding such an objection the judge may take evidence on the voir dire   The Justices who delivered the joint judgment went on to hold that the question of whether the privilege attaches depends upon whether the communication formed part of the negotiations for the settlement of the action or was reasonably incidental to those negotiations   Field   CLR at    In Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA         ALR     Jacobson J said  at         Communications made  in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement      The statutory requirement that the communication be  in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement  reflects the language used by the High Court in Field   at    There  Dixon CJ  Webb  Kitto and Taylor JJ contemplated that the privilege extends to cover communications that are reasonably incidental to negotiations  The effect of the authorities at common law is that the privilege applies to offers to negotiate and expressions of willingness to do so  it is not necessary that there be an offer capable of acceptance  Arnotts at      The same position applies under the Evidence Act   It is sufficient that the communication can be described as an  opening shot  in negotiations  GPI Leisure Corporation Ltd v Yuill     NSWLR   at   citedHarman v Home Department State Secretary     AC  As I understand proposed Order   the ACCC seeks leave to be released from the

   citedRingrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe original of the first BDO report is presumably in the possession of Allphones  The original may be a business record of Allphones or  perhaps  of BDO  although I doubt that this is so  For reasons which I will explain  I do not need to decide this point for present purposes  see Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR   at      pp     for a discussion of some of the relevant issues   In my view  the original of the report is not admissible in evidence because the ACCC is prevented from seeking to tender it by s   of the Evidence Act   Section   of the Evidence Act is in the following terms        Exclusion of evidence of settlement negotiations     Evidence is not to be adduced of             a  a communication that is made between persons in dispute  or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party  in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute  or   b  a document  whether delivered or not  that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute
