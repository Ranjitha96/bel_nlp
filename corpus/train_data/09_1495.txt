Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services  Kempsey  Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe principles applicable to the assessment of damages under s   of the Copyright Act were set out by Black CJ and Jacobson J in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services  Kempsey  Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at   ff  It is unnecessary to repeat what was said in that case  save for two relevant observations  First  in DAP Services   the Aristocrat companies claimed damages only upon one basis  namely  the value of lost sales calculated by reference to the report of a chartered accountant who attempted to calculate the loss of profits for each lost sale  see DAP Services at    However  the claim for compensatory damages failed in DAP Services because the evidence did not establish that each sale by the respondents was at the expense of a new Aristocrat machine  see DAP Services at    Second  it was suggested in DAP Services at  ff that there may have been other bases upon which damages could have been assessed  These included the possibility of finding that Aristocrat had lost some proportion of the sales made by the infringing respondents  see Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling   FCA   at   per Emmett J  However  these alternatives were not open in DAP Services because there was no evidence to support the assessment of damages on those bases  In the present case  the Aristocrat companies contend that the appropriate measure of compensatory damages is the loss of profit that would have been made from the sale of second hand or refurbished Aristocrat gaming machines by the Aristocrat companies  or the loss of profits on the sale of conversion kits  The evidence in support of that assessment was contained in the affidavits of Mr Irarrazaval and Mr Graham Ward  the Group Financial Controller of Aristocrat  Mr Irarrazaval s evidence dealt in some detail with the market for the sale of Aristocrat new and refurbished gaming machines to countries in South America  Evidence was given as to the volume of second hand or refurbished gaming machines supplied by the Aristocrat companies to companies in South America during   to   and the prices at which Aristocrat second hand or refurbished gaming machines were supplied in the South American market  Mr Irarrazaval gave evidence in relation to the market in a number of South American countries  In relation to Peru  Mr Irarrazaval said that notwithstanding the significant size of the gaming machine market  and the large number of Aristocrat gaming machines installed and operating across the various venues in Peru  the relevant member of the Aristocrat group of companies had difficulties selling Aristocrat gaming machines to customers between   and    Mr Irarrazaval attributed that difficulty to the high number of counterfeit gaming machines being sold in Peru at prices significantly below the prices at which the Aristocrat companies were able to offer genuine refurbished gaming machines  Mr Irarrazaval gave evidence as to the prices that were obtained by the respondents for sales in South America covering the period from   to   in respect of gaming machines recorded on  seized invoice spreadsheets   Whilst it is true that the Aristocrat companies have not established that all of those gaming machines were counterfeit  it is relevant to record that  as Mr Irarrazaval says  the amount obtained for those machines was around  US  to  US  per machine  He observed that this is lower than the price at which the Aristocrat companies sold their refurbished gaming machines into South America at that time  which was put at between  US  and  US  per unit  The principles upon which additional damages are awarded were discussed in DAP Services at  ff  It is not necessary to set out the principles in any detail  It is sufficient to say that the objectives include deterrence  and that an element of penalty is an accepted factor in the remedy  Also  the assessment of the amount to be rewarded is a somewhat imprecise exercise and the Court is to have regard  amongst other things  to the flagrancy of the infringement and the need to mark the Court s disapproval of the conduct  In the present case  as in DAP Services  the actions of the respondents demonstrate a cynical and flagrant exploitation of the Aristocrat companies  copyright  Although the number of infringing transactions was ultimately proved to be far less than the number claimed by the Aristocrat companies  it is plain that the respondents were engaged in a commercial exercise  Their actions were plainly flagrant and undertaken for commercial gain  The Aristocrat companies claimed that the true nature of the respondents  business was a large scale counterfeiting operation  They failed to make this good  But the statements made in the emails when considered with much of the materials seized on the Anton Piller raids show the willingness of the respondents to engage in counterfeiting when it suits their commercial purposes  There is no need for any proportionality between the amount of compensatory damages under s   and the amount of additional damages under s   DAP Services at    I am also entitled to take into account the conduct of the respondents after the acts constituting the infringement  Accordingly  I am entitled to include in my calculation of additional damages the attitude of the respondents to this litigation  in which they vehemently denied any involvement in counterfeiting  For the reasons mentioned above  additional damages cannot be maintained against Tonita as it has not been established that Tonita was involved in any of the   impugned transactions  The amount of additional damages awarded in DAP Services was   against Vidtech and Mr Parry  see DAP Services at   and    Here  the activities were on a scale which seems to me to be larger than that which existed in DAP Services  In addition  there are three groups of respondents  I have come to the view that I ought to award an amount of   for additional damages under s   against the Global respondents  the Impact respondents and Mr Allam  jointly and severally  Although Mr Allam was an independent contractor  he was intimately involved in the venture and there is no basis for awarding a lesser sum of additional damages against him  Damages were also sought for infringement of trade marks  breach of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act and passing off  However  these claims were pressed only to the extent that damages awarded for copyright infringement were inadequate referred toAssociated Midland Corporation Ltd v Bank of New South Wales     NSWLR  It is a fundamental principle of the law of torts that to maintain an action for conversion  the plaintiff must have either actual possession of the goods or the immediate right to possession at the time of the conversion  Penfolds Wines Proprietary Limited v Elliott   HCA

toAustralasian Performing Right Association Limited v Jain     FCR  Both Branson J  at   and Kenny J  at   referred to the decision of a Full Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Limited v Jain     FCR    There  Sheppard  Foster and Hill JJ held at   that a  studied and deliberate course of action  in which a respondent had decided to ignore the applicant s rights and to allow a situation to develop which he must have known would be likely to result in an infringement  amounted to an authorisation  Jain was an authority on the question of the degree of control that was required to give rise to an authorisation prior to the enactment of s  A  and s  A   But as Kenny J observed at   and   that case emphasises the breadth of the concept of authorisation and that a failure to take reasonable steps to prevent an infringing act is a relevant consideration to a finding of authorisation  The degree of control  the nature of the relationship between the parties and the question of  reasonable steps  are now enshrined in s  A a   b  and  c  which I am required to take into account in determining whether the claims of  authorisation  are made out  Three separate tests have been stated  The first is the   Performing Right Society test  namely whether the director  directed or procured  the company s infringement  The second is the   Mentmore test  that is whether the director or officer  makes the tortious act his own  by deliberate  wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement  see the discussion of Finkelstein J in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   ff distinguishedBeck v Montana Constructions Pty Ltd     FLR  Nor is there any substance in the

toBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs I have said  the Aristocrat companies have the onus  Whether the standard is the balance of probabilities or the Briginshaw standard as was submitted by the respondents  there was nothing in the evidence adduced by Mr Coster which imposed any onus of proof on Global  To the extent that Global had any evidentiary onus  that was discharged by Mr Andrews  oral evidence and the documentary evidence to which I have referred  Although I have reached an adverse view of Mr Andrews  credit  it does not follow that I would reject all of his evidence as untruthful  It seems to me that Mr Andrews  evidence of the Play King transaction was consistent with the documentary evidence and I accept it  During the course of the hearing  the Aristocrat companies placed great weight on a bundle of business communications involving either the Global  Impact or Tonita respondents  or a combination of one or more of the groups of respondents  Second  although there is some difference in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate to describe the standard of proof under s   as the Briginshaw standard  the cases all recognise that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact in issue on the balance of probabilities will vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved

      FCR   at         Fourth  the position stated by the Full Court of the Federal Court exposes a difference of views on the question of whether the trier of fact must feel  an actual persuasion   Weinberg  Bennett and Rares JJ accepted that the Court must be so persuaded in Communications and Allied Services Union v ACCC at    But that observation was based upon the statement of Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   at      In Qantas v Gama at   and   Branson J  with whom French and Jacobson JJ expressed general agreement  considered that the Briginshaw test has been replaced by the provisions of s     and should be avoided due to its tendency to mislead referred toCBS Inc v Ames Records   Tapes Ltd   Ch  The reason for the House of Lords  decision appears to be the absence of control over the actions of the purchasers and the possibility of legitimate use rather than the inevitability of infringement  see     see also CBS Inc v Ames Records   Tapes Ltd   Ch   at    per Whitford J   This is to be contrasted with the facts of the present case as is well illustrated by the email set out at    Mr Allam was requested to provide game software and blank chips  I reject his denial that he knew the purpose to be the copying of the game software onto the chips in South America  It is true that Mr Allam had no real ability to control what took place in South America  but there was no possibility that the blank EPROMs were to be used for a legitimate purpose  It was inevitable that the EPROMs were to be used for the purpose of infringement  Moreover  there was other evidence which was indicative of unauthorised copying by the Tonita respondents  This was the existence of the Dataman software on the Loose HDD  Mr McKemmish s evidence that the Dataman software was operated on the Loose HDD gives rise to a very strong inference that the Tonita respondents used it to burn Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs  see    When this evidence is taken into account  it makes more credible the evidence of Mr Channa that he saw Mr Allam burning EPROMs from an EPROM burning device  see   distinguishedCBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC   UKHL       AC  The position here is quite different from that which existed in CBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC   UKHL       AC    There  the House of Lords held that the sale of a

behalf of the Aristocrat companies  that some of the explanations given by Mr Andrews were revealed under cross examination to be unacceptable  This reflects upon Mr Andrews  credit but it does not make good the propositions for which the Aristocrat companies contend  Disbelief of a witness on his or her credit does not amount to positive evidence of the opposite of what is disbelieved  Gauci v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at   J  D  Heydon  Cross on Evidence   th Aust ed  at    The data matching exercise must be considered on the basis of the quality of the evidence adduced by the Aristocrat companies  as the foundation upon which the exercise was conducted  The question of the quality or sufficiency of the evidence raises two separate sub issues  The first is the evidence pertaining to the OLGR records which formed the basis for the production of the  orange  and  yellow  serial numbers referred toHarding v Commissioner of Inland Revenue     NZLR  The authorities go so far as to establish that a bailment does not necessarily impose upon a bailee the obligation of redelivering the identical object that was bailed  Motor Mart v Webb at   Harding v Commissioner of Inland Revenue     NZLR   at   referred toJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt also follows in my view that the Aristocrat companies have failed to establish that Global knew or ought to have known of any infringement of its copyright in the components of the machines identified by Mr Coster  I will address the knowledge question in more detail when I deal with the  pattern of trade  and Jones v Dunkel submissions made by Mr Cobden  Mr Coster s evidence was that the local regulations in Peru require games and artwork on gaming machines to be in Spanish  He also gave evidence that  in his experience  there is a very significant problem of machines being  rebirthed  in Peru with the insertion of Spanish games and Spanish artwork  The Aristocrat companies submitted that I was entitled to draw an inference of knowledge from the failure of Global to call Mr Birks to give evidence  Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR    I reject this submission for the following reasons  First  the rule in Jones v Dunkel only applies where a party is required to explain or contradict something  Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     J D  Heydon  Cross on Evidence   th Aust ed    at   pp      The Aristocrat companies had the burden of proving the elements of secondary infringement  Once it appeared that the machines had been shipped from Mr Birks  premises  it was for the Aristocrat companies to establish the requisite level of knowledge on the part of Global  But absent any evidence of infringement by Mr Birks  or indeed any suggestion of such to Mr Andrews  the rule in Jones v Dunkel has no application  Second  the rule cannot be employed to fill gaps in the evidence or to convert conjecture and suspicion into inference  Cross on Evidence at   p    Yet this is precisely what Aristocrat seeks to do  Third  even if the rule were applicable  the appropriate inference is that Mr Birks  evidence would not have assisted Global s case  Jones v Dunkel at        The rule could therefore not be elevated to the level at which the Aristocrat companies sought to put it  namely to draw an inference that Mr Birks  evidence would have been damaging to Global s case  It is true that Mr Birks swore an affidavit which was filed by Global and that a forensic decision was ultimately taken by Global not to call Mr Birks to give evidence  But the mere filing of an affidavit  and even a decision taken late in the trial not to rely on that evidence  cannot alter the effect of the three propositions which I have set out above as to the inapplicability or inutility of the rule in relation to the Play King transaction referred toThe Koursk   P  Tamberlin J referred to Australian and English authority which support the abovementioned statement of principle including the decision of the High Court in Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   and the seminal English case  The Koursk   P   referred toLuxton v Vines   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSixth  it is sufficient if the circumstances give rise to a reasonable and definite inference  but if they produce conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is a matter of conjecture  the allegation is not proved  Palmer v Dolman at       Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Luxton v Vines   HCA         CLR   at   and other High Court authorities cited in Palmer v Dolman at   see also The Trustees of the Property of Cummins v Cummins   HCA         CLR   at    referred toMorris v C  W  Martin   Sons Ltd     QB  One of the obligations of a bailee is to redeliver the goods to the bailor  The nature of the duty varies according to the circumstances in which and the purpose for which the goods are delivered to the bailee  Morris v C  W  Martin   Sons Ltd     QB   at    In Morris v C  W  Martin   Diplock LJ at   and Salmon LJ at   observed that one of the common law duties imposed upon a bailee is not to intentionally convert the goods to his or her own use  Yet this is precisely what the Behong Agreement required Behong to do  It may be true that Behong was contractually bound not to resell the materials in their unscrapped form  but that does not undermine the proposition that the fundamental commercial purpose of the Behong Agreement  as exemplified in the terms to which I have referred  was for Behong to collect and scrap or destroy the materials  Nothing could be further from the concept of bailment  The evidence of the dealings between Behong and Messrs Fisher and Allam indicate knowledge on the part of the Tonita respondents that their purchases of the unscrapped materials may have amounted to a breach of contract  However  that is irrelevant to the claim for conversion  No claim of inducement of breach of contract was made referred toMotor Mart Limited v Webb   NZLR  Moreover  as Turner J observed in Motor Mart Limited v Webb   NZLR   at     it would be a mistake to conclude that the transaction of bailment is not capable of adaptation to modern commercial circumstances  Indeed  his Honour said      I decline to assume that  under the pressures and stresses of modern legal necessity  some new mutation may not burst into flower  of a quality to startle the author of the Institutes were he privileged to behold it  Nevertheless  the Behong Agreement cannot be such a mutation  This is evident from the nature of the obligations entailed by the relationship of bailment  The authorities go so far as to establish that a bailment does not necessarily impose upon a bailee the obligation of redelivering the identical object that was bailed  Motor

circumstances raise a more probable inference in favour of the allegation  Where the allegation is a serious one  the inquiry is to take account of the requirements of s  c    and what was said by the High Court in Neat Holdings about the need for caution in making such a finding  Palmer v Dolman at      To the extent that the claims are based upon circumstantial evidence  they will not be made out unless I am satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities  taking due account of what was said in Neat Holdings  The Aristocrat companies claim that the respondents are liable for copyright infringement  either as joint tortfeasors or on the ground that one or other of them has authorised the copyright infringement carried out by the others  The legal principles applicable to each of these separate heads of liability have been considered in some detail by the authorities  I do not consider that there is any real dispute between the parties as to those principles  but I will refer to them briefly below referred toNguyen v Cosmopolitan Homes   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlThird  the Court of Appeal of NSW has accepted that the balance of

submission  Mr Cobden drew the Court s attention to the test of unfair prejudice under s     as defined by Papakosmas v the Queen   HCA         CLR   at   which envisaged a danger that the fact finder may use the evidence on an improper  perhaps emotional  basis  that is on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case  Mr Cobden argued that the respondents had failed to clearly articulate the basis upon which s   had been invoked  and in any case  the evidence objected to did not meet the test set out in Papakosmas  Finally  Mr Cobden rejected the analogy drawn by the respondents between the role of the independent computer expert and that of the independent solicitor in the carrying out of Anton Piller orders  He argued that the independent computer expert is not an officer of the Court and is therefore not under the same obligations as the independent solicitor  He also referred to several Federal Court practice directions and practice notes in which the role of the independent solicitor is significantly more regulated than that of the independent computer expert              ADMISSIBILITY OF MR MCKEMMISH S EVIDENCE The view that I came to after hearing the submissions of the parties was that  whilst it is undesirable for a person who has occupied the role of an independent expert for the purpose of an Anton Piller order to then give evidence as an expert witness  I did not consider that the submissions that had been put before me demonstrated that it was an abuse of process  Moreover  the undesirability of Mr McKemmish giving evidence could

following reasons  Third  there was no evidence in the present case of the type which resulted in a finding of constructive knowledge in Raben Footwear   In that case  the importer made inquiries from

company s infringement  The second is the   Mentmore test  that is whether the director or officer  makes the tortious act his own  by deliberate  wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement  see the discussion of Finkelstein J in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   ff  The third test was formulated by Finkelstein J in Root Quality at    The test is that the director s conduct is such that          he was so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act that it is just that he should be rendered liable appliedSchellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFirst  the rule in Jones v Dunkel only applies where a party is required to explain or contradict something  Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     J D  Heydon  Cross on Evidence   th Aust ed    at   pp     referred toSeltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlThird  the Court of Appeal of NSW has accepted that the balance of probabilities test stated in s   requires the Court to reach a level of actual persuasion  Nguyen v Cosmopolitan Homes   NSWCA   at     Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     However  the learned editor of Odgers  Uniform Evidence Law   th ed    observes at       that      It is difficult to see how the proposition that  actual persuasion  is required can stand under  s   of  the Act       referred toSony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSecond  it was suggested in DAP Services at  ff that there may have been other bases upon which damages could have been assessed  These included the possibility of finding that Aristocrat had lost some proportion of the sales made by the infringing respondents  see Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling   FCA   at   per Emmett J appliedS W  Hart   Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhilst I have not been able to conduct a visual comparison of the infringing compliance plates with the Aristocrat companies  originals  the evidence is sufficient for me to infer that the test stated by the High Court in S W  Hart   Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems   HCA         CLR   at     and   is satisfied  The Tonita respondents had prior access to the copyright works  From the material before me going to infringement of compliance plates  in particular the evidence of Mr Parsons  I infer the elements of resemblance  actual use and causal connection  The onus then passed to the Tonita respondents to rebut the inference of copying but they failed to discharge that onus  Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams  Textiles  Ltd   UKHL       All ER   at     referred toThompson v

inference  but if they produce conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is a matter of conjecture  the allegation is not proved  Palmer v Dolman at

Impact Joint Venture for reward  to supply services and to procure parts and equipment for the purposes of the joint venture and that they are  so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act s  that it is just that  they  should be rendered liable  Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd   FCA         ALR   at     cf Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at          Kenny J said in Cooper at   that she agreed with the test stated by Finkelstein J  So did Wilcox J in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd   FCA         ALR   at     He went on to add a qualification  that the person need not be a director of the company referred toUniversity of New South Wales v Moorhouse   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Cooper at   Kenny J observed that s  A  of the Copyright Act  which corresponds to the current s  A  is premised on the concept of  authorisation  developed by the High Court in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse   HCA         CLR    Moorehouse is authority for the proposition that  authorisation  means  sanction  approve  countenance  express or formal permission is not required  per Gibbs J at     per Jacobs J at      Gibbs J said at           a person who has under his control the means by which an infringement of copyright may be committed such as a photocopying machine and who makes it available to other persons  knowing  or having reason to suspect  that it is likely to be used for the purpose of committing an infringement  and omitting to take reasonable steps to limit its use to legitimate purposes  would authorize any infringement that resulted from its use  Kenny J also referred in Cooper to the observations of Gummow J in WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Limited     FCR   at       Gummow J there pointed to the broad concept of  authorisation  accepted by the High Court in Moorhouse referred toWEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Limited     FCR  Kenny J also referred in Cooper to the observations of Gummow J in WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Limited     FCR   at       Gummow J there pointed to the broad concept of  authorisation  accepted by the High Court in Moorhouse  As Gummow J explained in WEA International at   infringement of copyright statutes are considered tortious  so as to make applicable the common law principles of liability of joint tortfeasors  It is not sufficient to establish a claim of joint liability that two or more persons assisted or concurred in or contributed to a tortious act  what is required is that there be  some common design  WEA at    In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper   FCA         FCR   at     Tamberlin J pointed out that it follows from the remarks of Gummow J in WEA International that          there must be something in the nature of concerted action or agreed common action  It is not necessary that there must be an explicitly mapped out plan with the primary offenders  Tacit agreement between the parties is sufficient       In WEA International at   Gummow J pointed out that where the infringer is a corporation  questions often arise as to the degree of involvement on the part of directors necessary for them to be rendered personally liable  He observed that this question is not answered by the principles which govern  authorisation  and joint tortfeasance  Rather  recourse is to be had to the authorities which explain the circumstances in which a director or officer will be personally liable for the torts of the corporation  It is those authorities which prompted Kenny J to say in Cooper at   that the law concerning the liability of directors and officers for corporate wrongdoing is unclear  As Kenny J said in Cooper at   no Full Court has settled which of the tests is correct  However  I do not need to consider the question because  in my view  it is essential to recognise that the debate in the authorities as to the test to be applied to the liability of directors or officers for the wrongs of the corporation is a different question from that which applies to the question of liability for  authorisation  or joint tortfeasance  This was what Gummow J pointed out in WEA International at    Subject to the observations I have made about Mr Channa  it seemed to me that the witnesses called by the Aristocrat companies were  generally speaking  truthful  They made concessions where appropriate and  apart from specific matters to which I have referred in the course of these reasons  I accept their evidence  The respondents suggested that Mr Juan Pablo Irarrazaval  the General Business Manager of Latin America for ATI  was not a witness of truth  Mr Irarrazaval s evidence dealt principally with the market for gaming machines  including second hand machines  in South America
