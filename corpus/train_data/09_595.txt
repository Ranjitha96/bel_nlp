Sigma Pharmaceuticals  Australia  Pty Ltd  ACN       v Wyeth   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharma Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWyeth criticised Dr Rowe s conclusions as no more than a routine literature search  falling short of establishing that what was shown by the documents to which he referred had entered the common general knowledge of those in Australia experienced in the practical working of formulating drugs for therapeutic use  See Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharma Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and    It is true that Dr Rowe does not  in his several reports  use the words of s   of the Act  common general knowledge as it existed  in Australia  Nevertheless  on a fair reading of his reports  he does in my view do more than list the matters that he thought could be derived from the publications to which he referred  Dr Rowe first identified the relevant skilled person  He said that during his time at Abbott Laboratories in Sydney in the late  s working on new pharmaceutical formulations  he headed a team of six people comprising three analytical chemists and three formulation chemists  as well as several technicians  At the time he had a PhD  and the chemists in the team all had chemistry or pharmacy degrees and between two and fifteen years experience  He said that was the team he considered to be a typical team involved in pharmaceutical formulation  including sustained release formulation  in Australia at the priority date  He went on to say that where in his affidavit he referred to a skilled person  he was referring to what he would have done and what he believed  on the basis of his experiences  other persons with similar experience would be likely to have done at the priority date  Thus  for example  when he later referred  at par   of his affidavit  to standard textbooks which he owned  and which would have been routinely referred to by the Skilled Person at the Priority Date  he is to be taken as saying that a team such as the Abbott Laboratories group would have routinely referred to those texts  Throughout his main report  his affidavit  he uses variants of this formulation  Accordingly  when in examining the integers of the various claims  Dr Rowe says that the claims do not  provide anything that is new or surprising or an advance over what was well known and understood by the Skilled Person as at the Priority Date  and that they provide results of routine trial and error testing  at par   his opinion is to be understood in the manner I have described  Aspects of Dr Rowe s evidence were challenged  briefly   given time constraints  by Professor Charman  See pars   to   of his affidavit of   May    It is not possible on an application such as this to come to a conclusion as to which expert s opinion is preferable  That is a matter for close examination at trial  Even taking into account Professor Charman s criticisms  I remain of the view that Dr Rowe s evidence  understood as I have explained it  raises a prima facie case of invalidity for want of an inventive step  Manner of new manufacturefollowedAppleton Papers Inc v Tomasetti Paper Pty Ltd     NSWLR  I do not agree that damages will be adequate compensation for Wyeth simply because it will be able to recover lost royalties in reliance on the undertaking  or that potential loss to Wyeth Australia is irrelevant  Similar arguments were rejected by McLelland J in Appleton Papers Inc v Tomasetti Paper Pty Ltd     NSWLR     Appleton   at     The defendant points out that in substance the plaintiff uses its patent to license the manufacture of paper by others and receives a once only royalty upon manufacture  It is submitted that if an account of sales by the defendant is kept the damage suffered by the plaintiff is precisely quantifiable  It is also submitted that a distinction should be drawn between the plaintiff and other members of the group in which the plaintiff operates and that it is only the position of the plaintiff that matters  It is submitted that loss of sales or loss of market position by parties further down the distribution chain  whether or not connected with the plaintiff  do not bear upon the balance of convenience between the parties to this litigation  I am unable to accept that potential losses to others with whom the plaintiff is in a relevant commercial relationship dependent upon the validity of the patent  and its effectiveness in conferring a monopoly  are irrelevant to the question of the granting of interlocutory relief  The ability of a party to effectively prevent infringements of its patents must necessarily affect the value of those patents and its commercial standing vis   vis others with whom it deals in relation to those patents  and this is not a matter to be ignored  particularly as this kind of injury does not lend itself to ready calculation in monetary terms  The present case is stronger than Appleton because Wyeth is Wyeth Australia s ultimate holding company  Loss to Wyeth Australia thus feeds through directly to Wyeth itself  It is likely that Wyeth Australia  and thus Wyeth  will suffer a loss of market share from Sigma s possible acquisition of up to   of the market for venlafaxine products at the expense of Efexor XR  It was common ground that unlike originator companies that market to medical practitioners  generic companies market direct to pharmacies  Ms Braithwaite  Wyeth Australia s Pharmaceutical Business Director  said that in view of the size of Sigma s sales force and the presence it has at the pharmacy level  which is where the decision and incentive to substitute a generic product for Efexor XR lies  Sigma s product has the ability to quickly take market share from Efexor XR   with consequent considerable and irreparable damage to Wyeth s business   In addition Wyeth Australia is likely to be forced to reduce the price at which it sells Efexor XR due to discounting by Sigma  The balance of convenience favours the grant of relief  At best Sigma s trade in Evelexa XR has just commenced  It launched its product on   May   the same day on which Wyeth commenced its cross claim  Sigma has commenced taking orders on the basis that the product will be delivered to pharmacies for sale by   June    However there is no evidence that any supply contract has been entered into  On the other hand Wyeth has an established trade  It is much more likely to suffer from a disturbance of the status quo than is Sigma  The relevance of this comparison between a new entrant and an established participant in a market is shown by cases such as Appleton     NSWLR at   and Pharmacia Italia SpA v Interpharma Pty Ltd     IPR     Pharmacia Italia   at   appliedAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe general principles to be applied are   a  whether there is a serious question to be tried  or Wyeth has made out a prima facie case in the sense that  if the evidence remains the same  there is a probability that at trial it will be entitled to relief   b  whether Wyeth will suffer irreparable harm  for which damages will not be an adequate remedy  unless an injunction is granted  and   c  whether the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction    See Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR     O Neill   at   and   appliedB Braun Melsungen AG v Terumo Corporation     IPR  Even if one looks solely to Wyeth s own potential loss  as Sigma contends one should  its undertaking does not adequately protect Wyeth  The probable scenario  if no injunction is granted  is that other generic companies will enter the market  In   and   there were five applications for ARTG registration of products containing venlafaxine  In March   Alphapharm Pty Ltd obtained registration for a venlafaxine product called Enlafax XR  I accept Wyeth s submission that if Sigma is not restrained  other generic suppliers are unlikely to be restrained  and will enter the market  Once a post Sigma entity does so  quantification of Wyeth s loss will become impossible  See B Braun Melsungen AG v Terumo Corporation     IPR     Braun   at    Sigma s royalty solution depends on a loss of sales of Efexor XR translating directly into sales of Evelexa XR  Further  detriment suffered by Wyeth Australia because of Sigma s discounting will not be covered by the undertaking  which is limited to lost sales  It does not cover retained  though discounted  sales  Wyeth s feared loss or damage is summarised at   to    Sigma s feared loss is of a different order  It has just entered the market  It has reached that position with its eyes open to the risk  It has incurred setting up and preparation costs well aware of the risk they may be wasted  The evidence is that Sigma has a portfolio of more than   products with others planned for launch during   and    Ms Braithwaite s evidence was that Sigma s projected turnover in sales of Evelexa XR would amount to approximately     of its total company turnover  In some respects Mr de Alwis  evidence of loss seems exaggerated  such as his claims that Evelexa XR was to be the jewel in Sigma s crown  that an interlocutory restraint may lead to a decrease in Sigma s share price  and that pharmacists might assume that an injunction reflected adversely on the quality of the product  On this last point  Sigma s own marketing to pharmacists refers to the existence of this patent proceeding and to its undertaking not to list on the PBS until the case is resolved  See also Braun   IPR   at    As indicated at   it is likely that other generic companies will seek to establish their products in the market in competition with Efexor XR  Ms Braithwaite says that this will lead to intense competition between generic companies  I refer to what I have said at   about For the foregoing reasons  I am of the view that the balance of convenience favours the grant of interlocutory relief appliedBeecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd     CLR  After discovering the Patent on   March   Sigma persisted with its commercial preparations for a launch of its product  In very similar circumstances to those here present  the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd     CLR     Beecham   dealing with balance of convenience  said at     The facts which appear to us to be decisive on this question may be stated quite briefly  In April   after the plaintiff had been building up in Australia a substantial business in ampicillin over a period of several years  the defendant announced its intention of marketing hetacillin in Australia  The plaintiff on  th May   warned the defendant that if it began to do so proceedings for infringement of the patents would be taken  It was in the face of this warning that the defendant commenced the acts now complained of  and the action was thereafter instituted without delay  Any goodwill the defendant may since have built up for hetacillin would of course be destroyed or damaged by granting an injunction  but that was a risk the defendant took with its eyes open   If it be not restrained  it will presumably take advantage of the time before the hearing to subject the goodwill of the plaintiff s established trade in ampicillin to the prejudice of competition from a product which the defendant maintains has some points of superiority  In no meaningful sense could matters be said to be kept in statu quo if in these circumstances the defendant were left free to pursue its course  merely keeping an account of the profits

Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSection   of the Act provides that the claims defining the invention must be fairly based on the matter described in the specification  This requires that there be a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed so that the alleged invention as claimed is broadly described in the body of the specification  Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Lockwood   at    A lack of fair basis is a ground of invalidity independent and distinct from the others and its determination is a matter of construction for the court  Lockwood at      Sigma contends that for fair basis purposes it is appropriate to consider the body of the specification prior to its amendment  because any claim supported by material added by the amendment will  because of s   of the Act  have a later priority date and therefore lack novelty  On this basis Sigma asserts that claims   to   and   are not fairly based on the matter described in the specification insofar as any of them claim the use of a formulation of venlafaxine hydrochloride which does not consist of a spheroid core containing microcrystalline cellulose and HPMC together with venlafaxine coated with an ethyl cellulose and HPMC mixture  For the reasons set out at   to   I do not accept that fair basis is to be determined by reference to the specification prior to its amendment  In Lockwood   CLR at     the High Court said    Erroneous principles   The comparison which s   calls for is not analogous to that between a claim and an alleged anticipation or infringement  It is wrong to employ  an over meticulous verbal analysis      It is wrong to seek to isolate in the body of the specification  essential integer  or  essential feature  of an alleged invention and to ask whether they correspond with the essential integers of the claim in question        Real and reasonably clear disclosure    Section   requires  in Fullagar J s words   a real and reasonably clear disclosure     But those words  when used in connection with s     do not limit disclosures to preferred embodiments  As was said in Lockwood   CLR at   the words  real and reasonably clear disclosure  do not limit disclosures to preferred embodiments  or I would add examples  The spheroid core example is just that  Sigma s contention cannot be accepted when the specification is read as a whole  The invention is not limited to the example  It relates to a method of treating patients using a single daily dosing formulation of venlafaxine hydrochloride that provides a peak blood plasma concentration of venlafaxine within a defined period or at a defined level  Under the heading  Brief Description of the Invention  there are consistory style statements  three of which are set out at   and   that reflect various embodiments of the invention  These provide a description of the invention later claimed  See in particular claims   and    Nothing in the body of the specification suggests that the description of the invention it contains is wider than the invention claimed  The spheroid example is an example of one embodiment later reflected in a claim upon which Wyeth does not presently rely  See page  B  lines   to   page  C  line   and claims   and    The examples given at page   of the specification all deal with coated spheroids and are examples of the formulations referred to at page  D  lines   to    For the foregoing reasons  I do not consider
