Westpac Banking Corporation v Victor Warren Ollis   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAllanson v Midland Credit Ltd and Another     ALR   The circumstances arising in these proceedings appear to be similar to those considered by the Full Federal Court in Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd and Another     ALR    In that matter a creditor had brought proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales claiming monetary sums from the defendants  While the case was pending  a sequestration order was made against one of the defendants to those proceedings  The litigation involved complex issues including those raised under defences and cross claims and leave was sought under s  b  of the Act to continue the proceedings  At   their Honours observed    It would seem that all of these issues would be better and more comprehensively dealt with by a contested trial of the action in the Supreme Court than could possibly be the case if Midland Credit were required to lodge a proof of debt in respect of its claim against Mr Allanson alone   Similar considerations arise in this instance  The determination of the rights of Westpac will resolve any issue of ownership and of the existence of charges in respect of the identified properly citedColeman v Lazy Days Investments Pty Ltd     FCR   The grant of the stay pursuant to s   of the Act made by Smith FM on   July   does not alter the status of Mr Ollis as a bankrupt  see Coleman v Lazy Days Investments Pty Ltd     FCR   at    The sequestration order  having been made  remains in force  Accordingly s  b  of the Act continues to apply rendering the current application for leave necessary   A further issue raised is the effect of the orders sought if the restraining orders obtained by the New South Wales Crime Commission are set aside by the Court of Appeal  It is apparent that by virtue of the operation of s  A of the Act  the property subject to the restraining orders does not form part of Mr Ollis  bankrupt estate whilst the restraining orders are in force  If the orders are set aside  the provisions of s   apply so that his property then becomes vested in the trustee  It is only at this point that Westpac would seek to join Mr Condon as a defendant in the proceedings  The Court does not need to consider this issue further as Mr Dibb has submitted that Mr Ollis has not in fact appealed against the making of the restraining order but only in respect of the making of a proceedings assessment order   The Court is satisfied from the evidence before it that leave under s  b of the Act is required to enable Westpac to proceed with the adjudication of its claim against Mr Ollis and others and that the grant of leave would not be contrary to the purpose of the Act   I certify

of those authorities referred to the wide construction which is to be given to such words   in respect of  as contained in s  b  of the Act   In Re McMaster   FCR     Heerey J referred to the considerations which must be addressed by the Court when considering such an application  He stated    The modern bankruptcy law serves three purposes  The first is to ensure that the assets of the bankrupt are distributed rateably among creditors  The second  which is interrelated with the first  is to ensure that one creditor does not obtain an undue advantage over other creditors  The third is to bring about the discharge of the debtor from future liability for his existing debts  so that the debtor may start afresh  see Storey v Lane  supra   at     Counsel for Mr Ollis submitted that the continuation of the proceedings would place Westpac in a more advantageous position relative to other creditors  because Westpac sought declarations that Mr Ollis held certain property or interest in property on trust for Westpac and alternatively a declaration that property and interests in property were subject to a charge in favour of Westpac   Despite such circumstances  the Court considers that the proceedings would merely determine the rights of the parties in relation to the property or property interests and determine ownership thereof  The determination would not provide Westpac with any privilege or preference  Accordingly  the submission is rejected citedTrustees Executors   Agency Co Ltd v Reilly   VLR   The term  in respect of  as it appears in s  b  of the Act has been
