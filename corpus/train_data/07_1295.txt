SZIHX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedWAJR v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     ALR   The notice of appeal raises two grounds not in issue before the Federal Magistrate  In WAJR v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     ALR   new appeal grounds were substituted at the last minute when the appellant had been assigned pro bono counsel  French J noted at     It is ordinarily regarded as exceptional to allow a point to be raised on appeal that was not raised at first instance University of Wollongong v Metwally  No     HCA         ALR     ALJR   Crampton v R   HCA         CLR     ALR    But as Branson and Katz JJ said in H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALD   at        This does not mean that an issue can never be argued on appeal that was not argued at the hearing at first instance   His Honour continued at     To allow too readily the running of new points  or indeed a whole new case  on appeal is to undermine the appellate process by rendering the trial process almost irrelevant   There appear to be no  exceptional  circumstances in this case  The appellant sought to impugn the Tribunal s decision under s   of the Act before the Federal Magistrate  That point has now been abandoned in favour of two quite different grounds  To allow the appellant to agitate those grounds would be to render the process before the Federal Magistrate irrelevant and indeed contrary to the policy in the Act  as this Court would be made the Court of first instance  The appellant  who was unrepresented on appeal  could not explain why the present course had been adopted and why the matters sought to be agitated could not have been raised before the Federal Magistrate  For those reasons  in my opinion  it would have been inappropriate to have allowed the appellant to argue those matters on this appeal  However  there is a more compelling reason for reaching that conclusion  Both new grounds would fail for the simple reason that the Tribunal did not rely on any country information  The grounds of appeal are therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal s decision   The appeal must be dismissed and the appellant must pay the first respondent s costs   I certify that the preceding nineteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander J    Associate Dated    August   Counsel for the Appellant  The Appellant appeared in person     Counsel for the Respondent  N Johnson     Solicitor for the Respondent  Sparke Helmore     Date of Hearing    August       Date of Judgment    August         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
