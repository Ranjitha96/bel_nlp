There is a question as to the content of the term  material facts  in O   r   of the rules  An English case  Millington v Loring     QBD     is still annotated in the Butterworths Practice for a proposition that    Whether or not a fact is material will depend on the circumstances of each case  Material facts are not limited to the facts constituted in the cause of action  but extend to the relief being sought  and generally  so that there is no chance of the respondent being taken by surprise   I can see how this proposition has pertinence in relation to the giving of particulars in relation to the damages which an applicant seeks in either a common law or statutory cause of action founded claim for damages  It is rather less easy to see how this has any application in relation to a claim for injunctive relief under s    Especially  that is so  having regard to the terms of s   which excludes from the fatality of impact on a discretion to grant injunctive relief particular considerations  that  under the general law of equity  would be followed  Whether or not the considerations that are set out in relation to these representations become material may depend upon the course taken by Burnett Water in its defence  I do not see that they have any place in the statement of claim  I strike them out  Paragraphs     are as follows    Compliance audit and internal audit   In early June   the department administering the EPBC Act  then the Department of Environment and Water Resources  DEWR  informed the respondent that it proposed to conduct a random compliance inspection of the dam to assess compliance with the conditions of approval  the compliance audit    Prior to the compliance audit occurring in June   the upstream fishway had not been operated for a period of   consecutive months as particularised in paragraph   above   At the time of the compliance audit and subsequently a company trading as  SunWater  operated the dam as agent of the respondent   PARTICULARS OF AGENT AND AGENCY      a  On or about   December   the respondent became a wholly owned subsidiary of SunWater Pty Ltd  ACN       trading as  SunWater     b  on   January   SunWater Pty Ltd changed its company name to ACN       Pty Ltd  trading as  SunWater     c  On   May   ACN       Pty Ltd was de registered and its assets transferred to a newly incorporated company  SunWater Pty Ltd  ACN       trading as  SunWater     d  The agency between the respondent  as principal  and SunWater as agent  commenced in or about November   when the dam commenced operation and continued thereafter    e  The scope of the agency was at all material times for SunWater to operate the dam on the respondent s behalf  including compliance with the approval and negotiations with the department administering the EPBC Act    Prior to the site visit to the dam by a four person audit team from DEWR for the purposes of performing the compliance audit  an employee of SunWater and agent of the respondent  Andrew Maughan  worked to ensure that the upstream fishway operation would be demonstrated to the auditors   When the DEWR audit team conducted a site inspection of the dam on   June   SunWater staff acting as agents for the respondent operated the upstream fishway to represent to the auditors that the upstream fishway was in fact operational   Further  on   August   Peter Sampson  General Manager Water Services  SunWater  and an agent of the Respondent  wrote to DEWR and requested that the audit report find  inter alia   that  The upstream fish lift is operational   In so doing Mr Sampson represented to DEWR that the upstream fishway was operational   On     October   an internal auditor employed by SunWater  Danny Green  acting also as an agent for the respondent  conducted an internal audit of the environmental management system of the dam   Mr Green found in his report  dated   October    the internal audit report  inter alia    It is noted that SunWater may be breaching the conditions outlined within its Federal licence to operate and maintain Paradise Dam  The wording of the condition may work in the favour of SunWater however SunWater is exposed to negative publicity and undue political scrutiny even if a court does find that the organisation has not breached the conditions     Further  Mr Green found in the internal audit report   There is a possible non conformance with the operation of the upstream fish lift at Paradise Dam as it has only been operated   days in the year up to   June       The operation of the upstream fishway at the Paradise Dam for   days in the year up to   June   represented operation for     of total daily time   The findings of the internal audit report were not conveyed to DEWR   DEWR and representatives of SunWater  acting as agents for the respondent  arranged a meeting in Brisbane on   November   to discuss a draft compliance audit report provided by DEWR to SunWater concerning the findings of the compliance audit of the dam conducted by DEWR in June     On   November   Mike Smith  Director of the DEWR Monitoring and Audit Section sent an email to Briony Pomplum  Environmental Services Manager  SunWater  setting out the issues that DEWR wished to address at the meeting  One of the issues raised by Mr Smith was   Can SunWater provide advice as to whether the fishlift has been operating as intended i e   with optimal operating times and if not  what are SunWater s plans to address any shortfall in operational performance    The proposed meeting on   November   to discuss the draft DEWR compliance audit report was cancelled by DEWR and in lieu of the meeting SunWater prepared a letter to answer the questions raised by Mr Smith   Ms Pomplun prepared a draft response to Mr Smith s questions on   November   that responded to his question regarding  whether the fishlift has been operating as intended      by stating in reply that the upstream fishway had been  plagued with mechanical failure   On   November   Mr Danny Green  acting as an employee of SunWater and agent of the respondent  stated in an email in relation to the draft response prepared by Ms Pomplun  inter alia   that   I suggest that the words responding to whether the fishlift has been operating as intended should be modified  The audit did not come down too hard on this aspect so I don t  sic  think we should include comments like  plagued with mechanical failure      Mr Green s email on   November   in relation to Mr Pomplun s draft response was copied  inter alia   to Peter Boettcher  Chief Executive Officer of SunWater and Chief Operating Officer of the respondent   On   November   Mr Boettcher wrote  as Chief Operating Officer of the respondent  to DEWR in lieu of the meeting planned for   November   and responded to the question from DEWR particularised in paragraph   above by stating   The upstream fishway operating range is EL    m to EL   m  The fishway became operational when the dam commenced in December    The fishway has not been operated as intended due to    December   to March   represented the commissioning phase of the fishway  Initial mechanical problems were experienced during March   to June   During the period June   December   the fishway operation was interrupted by the construction of the mini hydro facility at the Dam  Advice was received in August   from the Burnett Dam Alliance  BDA  to cease operating the fishway at the then current level of EL    m  due to concerns by BDA that the fish hopper might hit a submerged rock pimple   Evidence Doc No       The storage continued below this level from August   to October    Investigations during July to September   by  Burnett Water Pty Ltd  BWPL  found that the fishway could in fact be operated to the full lower operating level of EL   m  without damaging the hopper  On   October   a correction was received from BDA that the fishway could operate to the EL    m   Evidence Doc No      and operation of the fishway recommenced with on site supervision    The current operation will be monitored to assess any further operational issues  whilst the operator is on site  Once reliable operation is confirmed  continuous operation of the fishway will recommence     The statements by Mr Boettcher in his letter to DEWR of   November   particularised in paragraph   acknowledged that     a  condition   of the approval required continuous operation  and   b  the respondent knew it had failed to operate the upstream fishway for long periods    The conduct engaged in by Mr Boettcher  set out in the preceding paragraphs  was engaged in on behalf of the respondent by Mr Boettcher as an employee of the respondent with in the scope of his actual or apparent authority   In the premises  that state of mind of Mr Boettcher in engaging in the conduct set out in the preceding paragraphs was the state of mind of the respondent pursuant to section  B  of the EPBC Act   In the premises  the respondent  through its employees and agents  knew that the upstream fishway had not operated for long periods during   and   and the respondent knew that this contravened or may contravene condition   of the approval  There are a number of criticisms that were made  legitimately  in my opinion  in relation to these paragraphs  As a general proposition the paragraphs plead evidence rather than material facts  That aside  paras       are particular conclusions related to Burnett Waters having acknowledged that condition   of the approval required continuance of operation and then Burnett Water knowingly contravening that  The submission is made that these allegations going to the subsequent conduct are irrelevant distinguishedMinister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree  No

factual background to the proceedings is described in an earlier interlocutory judgment which I gave on   December   Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd   FCA    The most convenient way to deal with the challenge made is  first  to make some particular comments on the general submission advanced on behalf of the Conservation Council  that the paragraphs under challenge were factors going to the exercise of a discretion to grant injunctive relief  and therefore necessarily pleaded in the statement of claim so as to avoid Burnett Water being taken by surprise  In that regard  a number of decisions of this Court in which a question of the granting of injunctive relief under s   of the Act were relied upon citedWide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThis practice application is a sequel to an order which I made on   March   striking out the then existing statement of claim for reasons which I then published  Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd  No     FCA    Having so done  I granted leave to the Wide Bay Burnett Conservation Council Inc  Conservation Council  to file and serve an amended statement of claim  In today s application  Burnett Water Pty Ltd  Burnett Water  seeks the following orders in respect of the amended statement of claim  that paras               and       be struck out  In Professor Cairns  work  Australian Civil Procedure   th Ed  at page   the following statement is made in respect of the Australian position relative to the system of pleadings which developed in England following the Judicature Act    UK   Judicature Act  reforms    The same system was later introduced into the Australian jurisdictions  The system of pleading initiated by the Judicature Act   is still in force  although with some modifications  Supreme Courts in the Australian States and Territories are courts of unlimited jurisdiction  Their rules adopt the procedural concepts of the   revision of the English rules of     That particular observation made by Professor Cairns commended itself to the authors of Bullan and Leake and Jacob s Precedents of Pleadings   th Ed  at para     as a good background in respect of the Australian position     Professor Cairns  in the paragraph quoted  speaks of the position in relation to the Supreme Courts of the States and Territories  Whilst a purist might these days debate the proposition as to whether or not truly those courts are courts of unlimited jurisdiction  having regard to the impact of Federal statute law conferring exclusive jurisdictions on this Court  the proposition about the taking up of the Judicature Act rules which Professor Cairns makes in respect of the Supreme Courts  has  so far as the essence of the pleading rule in this court is concerned  equal resonance  By that I mean that in O   r   one finds familiar language having regard to post Judicature Act pleading rules  That rule provides as follows    Subject to these rules       a  a pleading of a party shall contain and contain only a statement in summary form of the material facts on which the party relies but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved  Order   rule   of this Court s rules provides    Where a pleading       a  discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading     b  has a tendency to cause prejudice  embarrassment or delay in the proceeding  or    c  is otherwise an abuse of process of the court  the court may at any stage of the proceeding order that the whole or any part of the pleading be struck out   It is under this rule that Burnett Water seeks the striking out of the paragraphs identified
