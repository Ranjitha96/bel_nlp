Interville Technology Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAFP v Natcomp Technology Australia  unreported  Downing Centre Local Court    July  The Crown also conceded before me that it had inadvertently misled his Honour when reference was made to a comparative case of AFP v Natcomp Technology Australia  unreported  Downing Centre Local Court    July    The Crown  when putting its submissions before the Magistrate  mistakenly stated that the penalty imposed in the Natcomp matter had been a total of   whereas in truth the total was    Mr Lancaster  who appeared for Interville  accepts that the concessions made by the Crown are correct  and accepts that the Crown misled the Magistrate  albeit quite inadvertently  I have before me the transcript of the proceeding before Magistrate McIntosh on   November    His Honour dealt with the matter very late in the afternoon  after a lengthy day dealing with a large number of traffic offences  That is  of course  not to be taken as being criticism of his Honour  but rather it demonstrates the pressure under which the Magistrate was when he came to consider the question of sentencing  The transcript records that his Honour s initial reaction was to impose a fine of   for sequence number   and   for each other matter  That would have brought the total sentence to a figure of    However  it was at that point that the Crown made reference to the Natcomp matter  and errantly described the total fine in the matter at    In light of this  the Magistrate said that he would  have to up the ante   His Honour then dealt with the matter  and made his remarks on sentencing which appear at pages   to   of the Appeal Book  I will not set out the remarks in full  but his Honour observed that these offences are becoming common in the film  television  and music industries  and call for heavy penalties to be imposed  His Honour observed that he was dealing with serious offences which call for heavy penalties to be imposed to  get the message out  that film and music piracy is not to be countenanced  His Honour took into account a number of matters which he was required to consider in determining the penalties to be imposed  His Honour took into account the fact that Interville had pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity  that copyright piracy was not the main part of Interville s business  which was the operation of an Internet caf  and that the copyright infringements were  a by product  of the business  His Honour also took into account the fact that he was asked to make a forfeiture order in relation to certain hardware  which was said to have a replacement value of    Moreover  he took into account the financial situation of the company which showed that it was a comparatively small business  with a net profit in its accounts for the year ending   June   of approximately    As I have said  his Honour took into account in determining the penalty for sequence   the   matters set out in relation to section  BA of the Crimes Act   and what he had been told about the effect of the decision in Natcomp   In considering the question of the severity of the sentence  I am required to have regard to the matters set out in Part IB of the Crimes Act and  in particular  the matters set out in section  A  Section  A  sets out a non exhaustive list of matters which the Court is required to take into account referred toCameron v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere have been a number of observations by the courts on the fact that a plea of guilty is ordinarily a matter to be taken into account in mitigation  because it is usually some evidence of remorse  and in particular  the community is spared the expense of a contested trial  see  eg  Siganto v the Queen   HCA         CLR   at     Cameron v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at    referred toDirector of Public Prosecutions Cth v Said Khoda El Karhani     NSWLR  The relevant principles have been referred to in a large number of cases  The decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions Cth v Said Khoda El Karhani     NSWLR   contains useful discussion of the relevant principles commencing at page    The principle of general deterrence which should be taken into account in determining the sentence was discussed in that decision  Reference was also made to this in the decision of Von Doussa J in Hamm v Middleton   FCA         IPR   referred toHamm v Middleton   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe relevant principles have been referred to in a large number of cases  The decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions Cth v Said Khoda El Karhani     NSWLR   contains useful discussion of the relevant principles commencing at page    The principle of general deterrence which should be taken into account in determining the sentence was discussed in that decision  Reference was also made to this in the decision of Von Doussa J in Hamm v Middleton   FCA         IPR    Section  A c  of the Crimes Act provides that one of the matters which the Court must take into account is whether the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character  In that event  the Court is to take into account the course of conduct  This was referred to in Hamm v Middleton at    That subsection is relevant in the present case  because the Crown submits that the appellant s offending conduct persisted throughout the period of   October   to   December    A further matter which the Court must take into account is set out in section  A g    under which the Court is required to take into account the fact that the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the particular offence followedKam Lai Ha v McCusker   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe third decision to which Interville referred was the decision of Emmett J in Kam Lai Ha v McCusker   FCA         IPR   at     There  Emmett J observed that   when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total it is always necessary for the Court to take a last look at the total to see whether  it looks wrong    The Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all of the offences  His Honour there referred to the decision of the High Court in Mill v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at   where the High Court made reference to the principle of totality stated in the leading text of Thomas  Principles of Sentencing  It seems to me that in the present case  the essential error which was made by the Magistrate was that his Honour failed to have regard to the principle of totality  His Honour took into account most of the matters which were put to him by Mr Lancaster  but he fell into error  albeit inadvertently  at least in part because of the inadvertent mistakes made in the submissions of the Crown  One of the matters which the learned Magistrate failed to take into account was the publicity which was given to Interville s offences  Mr Lancaster asked me to take that into the account on the question of deterrence  Whilst it has some bearing  it seems to me that I must  in accordance with the well known principles referred to above  give some weight to the need for the factor of general deterrence to be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty  notwithstanding the deterrent effect of the publicity  The Magistrate was also asked to take into account the fact that changes had been made in the administration and conduct of Interville s business  It appears that his Honour had regard to this  It is also important to bear in mind that Mr Phae is now  and was at the time when the matter came before the Magistrate  the only operating director  The other director  Mr Lee  had resigned from the company  and Mr Phae had implemented measures to prevent a recurrence of the offences  These measures included steps taken to prevent downloads and education of staff members  Mr Lancaster also asked me to take into account the fact that the company is not a large company  and that whilst the offences are to be dealt with upon the basis that the company is a corporate offender  I should approach the matter upon the basis of the size of the company  However  this raises a point to which the Crown referred  namely  that in the case of personal offenders  there is a greater range of punishments  which include imprisonment and community service  I therefore have to take this into account in assessing the appropriate penalty  Mr Lancaster accepted that the offence is a serious one  He submitted that the figure initially contemplated by the Magistrate of   was an appropriate approach because it starts with the   maximum figure and applies the relevant discounts  He also submitted that the figure of   per additional offence was appropriate  On the other hand  the Crown submitted that the sequence   offence should carry a larger penalty and that the other penalties of   for sequences   to   were within the range and should remain  In my view  taking into account all of the matters which have been put to me this morning  the approach which I ought to take is that to which Emmett J referred in Kam Lai Ha   I think this exposes the error in the Magistrate s reasoning and I would have thought that taking all these matters into account the appropriate penalty ought to be    In arriving at that figure  I have determined that the appropriate penalty for sequence   should be   and that the amount for each of sequences   to   should be    This would bring the total to   but I will reduce it to   because  in my view  to order more than   in total would  look wrong   In coming to this view I have taken into account the fact that Interville has incurred additional legal expenses as a result of the Magistrate s inadvertent error  I do not think it is necessary to engage in a mathematical exercise for the reasons that I have referred to above referred toLe v R   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlInterville also referred to Le v R   FCA         IPR   at     in which the Court recorded the submissions of the Crown in relation to the matters to be taken into account  In particular  reference was made at subparagraph   of   to the need to weigh all relevant factors and in doing so to avoid a mathematical approach in which there are increments to or decrements from a predetermined range of sentences referred toSiganto v the Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere have been a number of observations by the courts on the fact that a plea of guilty is ordinarily a matter to be taken into account in mitigation  because it is usually some evidence of remorse  and in particular  the community is spared the expense of a contested trial  see  eg  Siganto v the Queen   HCA         CLR   at     Cameron v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at    referred toVu v New South Wales Police Service   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn the written submissions for Interville  reference was made to three decisions which are of assistance in determining the appeal  The first is a decision of Rares J in Vu v New South Wales Police Service   FCA         IPR    At     his Honour there observed that it is impossible to have regard to each of the matters referred to in section  A  separately  Rather  the Court has to approach the determination of a sentence by taking into account all of the matters that are relevant  His Honour also said that in general  the sentencing court will reach a conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed after weighing all of the relevant factors
