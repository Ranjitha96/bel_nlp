Nipperess v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCommissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Cainero     ALD   The question  therefore  is whether the failure to consider this issue constituted a failure to consider the whole of the applicant s case  In Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Cainero     ALD   Foster J said  at        It could not be suggested that the Tribunal was under any obligation to isolate in its reasons every issue of fact and record a specific finding in respect of each of them  It is obviously sufficient  in light of the cases referred to above  and as a matter of common sense  that a sufficient compliance with the requirement of considering all issues of fact and giving adequate reasons occurs when the reasons themselves provide a sufficient indication that the ultimate facts to be decided have been fully kept in mind and that no significant area of primary fact has been ignored  referred toCoulton and Ors v Holcombe and Ors   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In relation to this submission  the respondent submits that the Tribunal was not required to consider expressly every matter raised by the applicant  see Minister for Health v Charvid Pty Ltd     ALD    Further  the respondent says that the applicant expressly disavowed reliance upon the ground of aggravation before the Tribunal  see the portion of the transcript set out at   above  and that accordingly he was not entitled to raise it on appeal  and relies upon Coulton and Ors v Holcombe and Ors   HCA         CLR   at     referred toMifsud v Campbell     NSWLR   The applicant says that the Tribunal should have considered the totality of the medical evidence and consider whether it suggested that the applicant had suffered an   injury   within the meaning of the SRC Act  The applicant submits that because of the comments in relation to  aggravation  at the beginning of the hearing  the Tribunal failed to carry out its review of the material before it  and relies upon Mifsud v Campbell     NSWLR   appliedMinister for Health v Charvid Pty Ltd     ALD   In relation to this submission  the respondent submits that the Tribunal was not required to consider expressly every matter raised by the applicant  see Minister for Health v Charvid Pty Ltd     ALD    Further  the respondent says that the applicant expressly disavowed reliance upon the ground of aggravation before the Tribunal  see the portion of the transcript set out at   above  and that accordingly he was not entitled to raise it on appeal  and relies upon Coulton and Ors v Holcombe and Ors   HCA         CLR   at       In these circumstances  and even having taken into account the fact that the applicant was unrepresented  I consider that the evidence was insufficient to raise this question as a real issue in the proceedings  In coming to this conclusion  I bear in mind the observations of Woodward J in Charvid   where his Honour said  at      Counsel relied     on s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act     which requires the Tribunal to give reasons for its decision  which  if in writing   shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence     on which those findings were based   Arising from this requirement  it is to be assumed that any matters not dealt with in the Tribunal s reasons must have been found to be not material to its decision  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALD     ALR   at    There could  however  be two reasons for a matter raised in the hearing not being dealt with in the decision  It could be that the Tribunal took the view that  whatever the state of the evidence  the matter was not important or  material  to the issues which it had to determine  or it could be that  although the matter was potentially important  the evidence on it was so skimpy or uncertain that no useful conclusion could be drawn  The Tribunal need not attempt  in its reasons  to deal with every matter which has been covered by evidence before it  or even every matter dealt with in counsel s arguments  The requirement of s   is  in my view  that the Tribunal should deal with all the matters which it is bound by relevant legislation to consider  or which it has found persuasive  or which have been urged upon it and would have been persuasive had they been established by the evidence  Steed v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALD     ALR   at    referred toMinogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The respondent submits that the applicant is intelligent and was competent in the presentation of his claim before the Tribunal  which are factors to be taken into consideration by the Tribunal and the Court  see Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA         FCR     The further amended supplementary notice of appeal contains five questions of law to be determined by this appeal  see at   above   However  I consider that in fact the appeal raises two real issues  The first issue  which corresponds to the second and third question of law  relates to whether the Tribunal erred in determining that the appellant could not have suffered a subclinical compression fracture during his period of army service   The second issue  which corresponds to the first  fourth and fifth question of law  relates to the question whether the Tribunal considered the totality of the evidence  and in particular  whether the Tribunal erred by confining itself to propositions  a   b  and  c   reproduced at   above   Related to this issue is the submission that the Tribunal unjustifiably narrowed the scope of its inquiry because of the conversation with the applicant at the outset of the hearing   The issue of assistance to be provided to unrepresented litigants was further considered by the Full Federal Court in Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   The Court there observed  at      In Abram v Bank of New Zealand   ATPR   at   a Full Federal Court  faced with an unrepresented litigant s claim that the trial judge had not given him appropriate assistance to present his case  made this comment         What a judge must do to assist a litigant in person depends on the litigant  the nature of the case  and the litigant s intelligence and understanding of the case         We respectfully agree with this observation  Because the duty of the judge varies according to the factors identified by the Full Court in Abram   the duty to assist an unrepresented accused in criminal proceedings is likely to be more extensive than that imposed on a judge hearing civil proceedings in which one or more of the parties are not legally represented      The Full Court in Minogue then referred to the decision of Rajski  in which Mahoney JA observed  at     of his Honour s reasons     Where a party appears in person  he will ordinarily be at a disadvantage  That does not mean that the court will give to the other party less than he is entitled to  Nor will it confer upon the party in person advantages which  if he were represented  he would not have  But the court will  I think  be careful to examine what is put to it by a party in person to ensure that he has not  because of the lack of legal skill  failed to claim rights or to put forward arguments which otherwise he might have done  referred toNABE v Minister for Immigration

hearing civil proceedings in which one or more of the parties are not legally represented      Certainly  if it had been squarely raised as a material issue by the evidence  see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         ALR   at     the Tribunal would have been required to consider whether the applicant had suffered an aggravation without suffering a fracture even if the applicant had not raised the issue  However  as outlined above  there was no recent or detailed medical opinion which supported the claim which the applicant now seeks to make  Brief references in dated medical reports were not sufficient to determine the issue in his favour  In these circumstances  the fact that the applicant was unrepresented was not enough to oblige the Tribunal to investigate the issue further   I note the applicant s submission that the Tribunal improperly confined itself as a result of its question to the applicant at the outset of the hearing  I agree that  in the circumstances  if the Tribunal had in fact improperly confined itself  it would have been unfair of the Tribunal to rely upon the applicant s statement that he was not claiming aggravation to restrict its consideration of the issues  The applicant s statement was made in response to a question from the Tribunal  That question effectively asked the applicant to confine his claim  when there would have been no apparent advantage to him  and  in fact  a distinct disadvantage  in doing so  There was no indication from the transcript that the applicant understood the significance of the statement he was making  or that he could make submissions in the alternative  Without intending any criticism  I note that there is no suggestion in the transcript that this possibility was explained to him by the Tribunal or by counsel for the respondent  When an applicant is unrepresented  I do not consider that a Tribunal should exclude from its consideration a matter which is raised as a material issue by the evidence because an unrepresented party has agreed to do so  unless it is clear that the unrepresented party understands the implications of confining his or her claim   However  as referred to above  I do not consider that the Tribunal failed to consider any material issue  The claim now pressed by the applicant was not a material issue before the Tribunal  Whilst it may have been possible for the applicant to have made a claim of the nature which he is now suggesting  it was not a claim which he made to the Tribunal  nor was it raised as a material issue by the evidence before the Tribunal  Accordingly  this ground of appeal must also fail appliedNeil v Nott   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is a well recognised principle that a tribunal  or a court  has a particular duty towards unrepresented applicants who appear before it  The High Court in Neil v Nott   HCA         ALJR   observed at   that     A frequent consequence of self representation is that the court must assume the burden of endeavouring to ascertain the rights of parties which are obfuscated by their own advocacy  consideredRajski and Anor v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd  unreported  Court of Appeal of New South Wales    June   The respondent rejects the submission that the Tribunal  manoeuvred  the applicant into a disadvantageous position  The respondent says that the applicant at no time requested assistance or guidance  and does not make any complaint that he was prevented from presenting his claim in the manner in which he intended  The Tribunal was merely refraining from interfering in the applicant s case  see Sullivan at      The respondent says that it was not incumbent upon the Tribunal to frame the applicant s claim on his behalf  and to have done so would have contravened the impartiality and neutrality which are vital to fairness between the parties  see Rajski and Anor v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd  unreported  Court of Appeal of New South Wales    June     The Full Court in Minogue then referred to the decision of Rajski  in which Mahoney JA observed  at     of his Honour s reasons     Where a party appears in person  he will ordinarily be at a disadvantage  That does not mean that the court will give to the other party less than he is entitled to  Nor will it confer

not  because of the lack of legal skill  failed to claim rights or to put forward arguments which otherwise he might have done   I note also the observations of Samuels JA in Rajski with respect to the limits upon the assistance that a court or tribunal should provide to an unrepresented litigant  His Honour observed  at   of his Honour s reasons     In my view  the advice and assistance which a litigant in person ought to receive from the court should be limited to that which is necessary to diminish  so far as this is possible  the disadvantage which he or she will ordinarily suffer when faced by a lawyer  and to prevent destruction from the traps which our adversary procedure offers to the unwary and untutored  But the court should be astute to see that it does not extend its auxiliary role so as to confer upon a litigant in person a positive advantage over the represented opponent   I have set out above the medical evidence which was before the Tribunal at the time it made its decision  Much of that evidence relates to whether the applicant exhibited vertebral fractures  However  several medical experts linked the applicant s degenerative spinal change to his roping and climbing activities without specifically identifying vertebral fractures  see the reports of Dr Bull  Dr Millar  Dr Ness and Dr Garrick and the   report of Professor Sambrook  The reports of Dr Cameron and Dr Billett  as well as the evidence of Dr Maxwell and Dr McGill  contradict the claim that the applicant s spondylosis was aggravated by his activities   Some of the reports which formed part of the applicant s medical history raised the possibility that his spinal degeneration could be exacerbated without him having suffered a fracture  However  the evidence relating to this possibility was scant and derived from various medical reports which were part of the background to the applicant s claim  rather than the main portion of his medical evidence  Many of those reports were brief reports which were many years old  Despite the fact that the existence of compression fractures was clearly in dispute  none of the recent evidence of Professor Sambrook suggested that the applicant could have suffered an aggravation of his spondylosis even if the fractures did not exist  Further  the respondent s medical experts gave evidence that the applicant s condition was the result of normal degeneration  which is inconsistent with the position now pressed by the applicant  In these circumstances  the references in his medical reports mentioned above would have been insufficient  without further evidence  for the Tribunal to have made a finding that the applicant s spondylosis had been aggravated by his service without him having suffered a compression fracture

Sports Drug Agency   FCA         FCR   Gray J said at      The extent to which the Tribunal is obliged to be proactive is a difficult question  It is possible to have considerable sympathy with the proposition that the Tribunal is obliged only to determine the issues placed before it by the parties  It must be recognised  however  that at least in some circumstances  the Tribunal is obliged to look at issues that are not raised directly  It can only do so  however  if those issues are apparent on the material before it  consideredSullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   The applicant responds that in view of the fact that he was unrepresented  it was unfair of the Tribunal to ask him whether he was claiming aggravation  That issue was essentially a medico legal issue and the applicant  who had neither medical nor legal training  may have been unaware of the legal implications of his answer  The applicant points to the fact that the claim of aggravation had been before the original decision maker  and that under s  c  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  the Tribunal has the power to inform itself as it thinks appropriate  The applicant says that  if the Tribunal confined itself because of the applicant s answer to this question  the Tribunal failed to afford procedural fairness to the applicant  and relies upon Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   at     per Deane J   The respondent rejects the submission that the Tribunal  manoeuvred  the applicant into a disadvantageous position  The respondent says that the applicant at no time
