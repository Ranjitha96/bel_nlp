could obtain to order  Ladbroke  Football  Ltd at      That copyright can exist in such a mundane compilation of information readily available to all shows why the skill  judgment and labour in selecting what to include in a trade catalogue will be as relevant as the often very limited skill  judgment and labour involved in putting that selection into written form  in determining whether the compilation has sufficient  originality  to attract copyright      In considering whether a compilation that wholly consists of or that includes existing material is itself an original work  the question is whether the compilation  looked at as an entity  is original  it is not proper to dissect the work into its parts  and by determining that the individual parts lack originality  to deny originality to the whole work  This issue is dealt with fully in Ladbroke  Football  Ltd   The reason is that by s   of the Act   copyright is a statutory right which     would appear to subsist  if at all  in the literary or other work as one entity  per Lord Hodson at      See also Ladbroke  Football  Ltd at       and       and      Copyright in a work will be infringed by the unauthorised reproduction of a substantial part of the work  see ss   and     of the Act  In determining whether that has occurred  it is sometimes said that the question is whether the part taken could by itself be the subject of copyright  But as Lord Reid said at     when both the questions whether copyright subsists in a work and  if so  whether it has been infringed are in issue          that is only a shortcut  and the more correct approach is first to determine whether the plaintiffs  work as a whole is  original  and protected by copyright  and then to inquire whether the part taken by the defendant is substantial      Later in that same case  Drummond J observed  at     Ladbroke  Football  Ltd  Reddwood Music and Eisinger proceed on the basis that a composite work made up of pirated material and original material produced by the compiler can itself be an original work possessing copyright  even though it may also infringe the copyright in the pirated material included in it      In my opinion  a work can be an original work in which copyright will subsist  even though it is itself an infringement of the copyright in an earlier work because it is  in part  a copy of a substantial part of that copyright work  This will be the position provided the later work includes qualitatively significant changes to the copies material citedAcorn Computers Ltd v MCS Microcomputer Systems Pty Ltd     FCR  Though not raised in submissions by Pakula Tackle  I accept that s   of the Copyright Act does not prevent the creation of an equitable interest in copyright

consideredGlobal Brand Marketing Inc v Cube Footwear Pty Ltd     IPR       FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThis was relied upon behalf of Zacatak so as to question whether Pakula Tackle had even established any standing to bring the alleged copyright infringement claim  For its part  Pakula Tackle sought comfort from a more recent decision  Global Brand Marketing Inc v Cube Footwear Pty Ltd     IPR    In that case  in the course of an interlocutory judgment in respect of an application for the dismissal of a proceeding or alternatively the striking out of a statement of claim  Goldburg J  at page   para   stated    According to para   of the statement of claim  the deed of assignment purports to assign  all part  present and future rights to sue for infringement of the copyright and all other intellectual property rights in the said sample patterns and footwear patterns used to produce footwear under licence from the applicant   This assignment of rights to sue is an assignment not of a bare right of action but the assignment of a right which is incidental to the assignment of intellectual property rights  see Taypar at FCR     IPR    The distinction between an assignment of copyright simpliciter and an assignment of copyright coupled with an assignment of rights to sue for infringement  whether past  present or future  does not appear to have been the subject of consideration in Dixon v Masterton  citedParkdale Custom Built Furniture Proprietary Limited v Puxu Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI remind myself too that a contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act is not established by the mere manufacture and distribution of a product which  though properly labelled with the distinguishing name and mark of the manufacturer  bears great resemblance and is even intended to bare such resemblance to the product of another manufacturer which has and continues to be marketed and advertised  Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Proprietary Limited v Puxu Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR    Perhaps out of an abundance of caution  Zacatak by its Counsel offered the following undertaking  UNDERTAKING   In respect of the first page of the website  www zacataklures com au  attached hereto  the Respondents shall within   days hereof  cause the words  previously Pakula Lures  in the first paragraph to be deleted  cause the words  which we were manufacturing for ten years prior  in the third paragraph to be deleted  cause the words  now  and  more so than before  in the sixth paragraph to be deleted  cause the words  under the old banner  in the tenth paragraph to be deleted   The Respondents undertake  until the trial of this action or earlier order  to keep full and proper accounts of and relating to the sale of all game fishing lures by the First Respondent  All in all  having regard to its pleaded case and the evidence relied upon in support thereof on the application  there are flaws evident in Pakula Tackle s ability even to prosecute its trade mark and copyright infringement claims  This aside  most of the trade mark infringement claims do not  in my opinion  raise a serious question to be tried  Assuming that questions of standing could be resolved  Pakula Tackle has raised a serious question to be tried in respect of a copyright infringement claim  The pleaded claims for relief relying upon the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act are not strong  Especially that is so in relation to claims again Mr Mario Zacaropoulos and his wife

interlocutory injunctions  In a judgment recently delivered in Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic and Felts Pty Ltd   FCA     Sebel s case  at paras     Foster J offers a comprehensive summary of those principles  which I gratefully adopt    THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES  INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS    In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     a majority of the High Court held that  where an interlocutory injunction is sought  inter alia  in respect of private rights  it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought  Their Honours who comprised the majority made clear that the final relief sought need not be injunctive in nature  See      pp      per Gleeson CJ    to    pp      per Gaudron J  and      pp       to    pp     and    p    per Gummow and Hayne JJ   At    p   Gleeson CJ also specifically cited with approval Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies    th edn     pp       In his Reasons for Judgment  at    p   Gleeson CJ expressly approved the following passage from the Reasons for Judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at    In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show   that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case  in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief    that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted  and   that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction     These remarks of Mason ACJ which were approved by Gleeson CJ echo the observations made by the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at    pp     when referring to the well known passage in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA       CLR   at     Gummow and Hayne JJ said   By using the phrase  prima facie case  their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed  it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial  That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument     HCA         CLR   at    With reference to the first inquiry  the Court continued  in a statement of central importance for this appeal     HCA         CLR   at      How strong the probability needs to be depends  no doubt  upon the nature of the rights  the plaintiff  asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks     At   to    pp   and   their Honours went on to explain the similarities and differences between the test expounded in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA       CLR   and the test articulated in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd   UKHL       AC   as follows  When Beecham and American Cyanamid are read with an understanding of the issues for determination and an appreciation of the similarity in outcome  much of the assumed disparity in principle between them loses its force  There is then no objection to the use of the phrase  serious question  if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question  like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham   depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham    However  a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that  provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff s claim is not frivolous or vexatious  then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient  The critical statement by his Lordship is  t he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious  in other words  that there is a serious question to be tried    UKHL       AC   at    That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters of onus     UKHL       AC   at        So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial  the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought      Emphasis added      Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed  They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought     The second of these matters  the reference to practical consequences  is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application  See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   at     and the article by Sofronoff    Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect   Australian Law Journal  vol          The first consideration mentioned in Beecham   the nature of the rights asserted by the plaintiff  redirects attention to the present appeal           The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia   HCA       CLR   require Sebel to show that     a  it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted  and   b  the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction     The first of these matters involves an assessment by the Court as to whether the claimant would  in all material respects  be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy  as he would be in if an injunction were granted  see the discussion of this aspect in Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies    th edn    at pp     at pp     and at pp       The second of these matters requires the Court to exercise a discretion   In exercising that discretion  the Court is required to assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by the defendant  third persons and the public generally if an injunction is granted  with that which is likely to be suffered by the claimant if no injunction is granted  In determining this question  the Court must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief  if granted  will adequately compensate the claimant for the continuing breaches which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted   In order to address the irreparable injury question  the balance of convenience and the balance of justice in the present case  it is necessary to consider the nature and strength of Sebel s case and the circumstances in which the respondent decided to compete with Sebel by importing the Titan chair into Australia and by promoting and selling that chair in this country   It is also necessary to consider and evaluate the impact that the grant or refusal of an injunction will have or is likely to have on third persons and the public generally   In Patrick Stevedores Operations No   Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia  No     HCA         CLR   at   and    pp     Brennan CJ and McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  in a joint judgment  expressly adopted a passage from Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies  th edn    at pp     which may be summarised as follows     a  In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application  the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances   b  Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case  and   c  Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive    The question is how to apply those principles to the circumstances of the present case  insofar as they have been revealed on the evidence led on the hearing of the interlocutory injunction  In a general way the proceedings might be described as a suit between two trade competitors in the market for the supply of fishing lures and associated equipment  Mr Peter Pakula  the director of Pakula Tackle  has a long association with that market  As long ago as   Mr Pakula caused a business name  Pakula Tackle  to be registered in Sydney  He carried on business under this name until December    The business embraced the design  manufacture  distribution and sale of fishing lures  The lures were for use in game fishing  Mr Pakula has deposed and it does not seem to be controversial that lures produced in the course of this business quickly became well recognised and popular within the game fishing fraternity both in Australia and worldwide  In December   Mr Pakula sold his business to a company  Tailored Marine Accessories Pty Ltd  Tailored Marine   A director of that company was a Mr John Zacaropoulos whose then wife was Mrs Jennifer Zacaropoulos  The Second Respondent in these proceedings  Mr Mario Zacaropoulos  is the cousin of Mr John Zacaropoulos  Mr Mario Zacaropoulos commenced to work in the business along with his cousin John upon its acquisition by Tailored Marine from Mr Pakula  Mr Pakula continued  for some time  to work in that business as a  consultant   In or about May   Mr John Zacaropoulos and wife Jennifer separated  The present Applicant  Pakula Tackle was incorporated at about the same time  Under the terms of their separation Mrs Jennifer Zacaropoulos became the sole shareholder in Pakula Tackle  I infer  although it is not completely clear on the affidavit material  that pursuant to the separation agreement Pakula Tackle succeeded to the business hitherto conducted by Tailored Marine  Mr Mario Zacaropoulos remained employed in the business  now as an employee of Pakula Tackle  Mr Pakula also continued his consultancy to the business  Over the course of his consultancy during the ownership of the business by Tailored Marine  Mr Pakula observed  so he states  a continuing deterioration in that business because of quality control  customer relations and production issues  That observation is controversial  Mr Mario Zacaropoulos has deposed to working  tirelessly  in the business  promoting an increase in the profits of the business  during the period from   to   March    Additionally  in respect of Zacatak s trade mark number   I note  as in like fashion as did Foster J in the Sebel case  that this is a registered trade mark  The Registrar must therefore have considered that this trade mark had about a distinguishing features which permitted its registration under the Trade Marks Act   The Registrar s opinion is not binding and his reasons for registering trade mark number   are not in evidence  Nonetheless  at this interlocutory stage  that Zacatak s alleged infringement arises  in part  from its use of its own registered trade mark  is not a factor which tells in favour of the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief to Pakula Tackle  For the reasons which I have given  I am not persuaded  in respect of registered mark   albeit at an interlocutory stage  that Pakula Tackle has made out even a serious question to be tried  That conclusion renders strictly unnecessary for me to consider the ramifications of registered trade mark   being registered to Gamefish Central  not Pakula Tackle  Section   of the Trade Marks Act makes provision for the assignment of a registered trade mark  Such an assignment may be made either with or without the goodwill of the business concerned in the relevant goods or services  The term  assignment  in relation to a trade mark is defined by s   of the Trade Marks Act to mean  an assignment by act of the parties concerned   No assignment of any of the marks pleaded is evidenced  Pakula Tackle is said to be an authorised user  but that is not the way its case is cast in the statement of claim  Further  the evidence led on its behalf to date on that subject is noteworthy for its vague generality consideredShell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Ltd     CLR  In applying this test one does not engage in comparing the registered mark and the allegedly infringing mark side by side but instead asks one self whether  drawing upon an imperfect recollection  potential customers might form an impression that the allegedly infringing mark is one in the same as the registered trade mark  see Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Ltd     CLR   at    That there might possibly be public confusion is not sufficient  Approaching the question in this way and as a matter of general impression  my conclusion at this interlocutory stage is that Pakula Tackle s infringement case is weak in respect of any infringement of such rights as it may enjoy in respect of registered trade mark number    I doubt whether  even drawing on imperfect recollection  a potential customer would be confused as between the two marks  There are obvious differences which one might think would play upon a recollection  the eagle in the case of the Pakula Tackle mark and the Australian Flag in the case of the Zacatak mark  The names themselves are radically different appliedSouthern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR  In Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR   at     It is not necessary  in order to find that a trade mark offends against the section  to prove that there is an actual probability of deception leading to a passing off  While a mere possibility of confusion is not enough for there must be a real  tangible danger of its occurring   Reckitt   Colman  Australia  Ltd v Boden   at pp     Sym Choon   Co Ltd v Gordon Choons Nuts Ltd     at p   it is sufficient if the result of the user of the mark will be that a number of persons will be caused to wonder whether it might be the case that the two products come from the same source  It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt   iii  In considering the probability of deception  all the surrounding circumstances have to be taken into consideration   This includes the circumstances in which the marks will be used  the circumstances in which the goods will be bought and sold  and the character of the probable purchasers of the goods  Jafferjee v Scarlett   at p   citedTaypar Pty Ltd v Santic     FCR  What is deposed to is an assignment by Gamefish Central to Pakula Tackle of the right to litigate the infringement of copyright  When this assignment occurred is not evidenced  In Taypar Pty Ltd v Santic     FCR   at   Spender J stated    Any infringement of the copyright in the drawing     the  Reflections  plan  or the house at Drayton Terrace  occurred at a time when Taypar was not the owner of the copyright  and in my view  Taypar is not competent to sue in respect of any such infringement  This was relied upon behalf of Zacatak so as to question whether Pakula Tackle had even established any standing to bring the alleged copyright infringement claim  For its part  Pakula Tackle sought comfort from a more recent decision  Global Brand Marketing Inc v Cube Footwear Pty Ltd     IPR    In that case  in the course of an interlocutory judgment in respect of an application for the dismissal of a proceeding or alternatively the striking out of a statement of claim  Goldburg J  at page   para   stated
