application   MZXFN v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FMCA    Although his Honour did not state expressly in his reasons whether that dismissal was pursuant to r    a  or  c  of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules    Cth  the parties have proceeded on the basis of a right of appeal from a final decision  On my reading of his Honour s decision  I am satisfied that it is appropriate to proceed on that basis  His Honour found that the appellant had not been denied procedural fairness  at     and that s  B of the Act precluded the application of any common law principles of procedural fairness  at    His Honour observed  in relation to the newspaper articles  at       In my view  a proper reading of the Tribunal s decision indicates that it did no more than consider the material and draw a conclusion that the material either did not support  the appellant s  claims or that the articles otherwise provide corroborative material for  the appellant  sufficient to encourage the Tribunal to find  the appellant  was a witness of credit  Having found difficulties with  the appellant s  credibility  the Tribunal was entitled to consider the material offered by  the appellant  as a means of corroboration  and to then reject those items without necessarily proceeding to make a specific and express finding that the newspaper articles were forgeries      His Honour held that in the absence of other corroborative evidence  it was open to the Tribunal to make the findings that it did on the documents given to the Tribunal by the appellant  at    His Honour did not consider it to be surprising that the Tribunal did not place significant weight upon the medical reports  at     His Honour said that the Tribunal had simply proceeded to make an adverse credibility finding against the appellant  It considered the material provided by the appellant  which in part was sought to provide what might be described as corroboration but found that that material did not assist or support the appellant s claim  at    His Honour noted that the Tribunal had not found that the newspaper articles or the medical reports could properly be described as forgeries or fraudulent   The appellant appears in person assisted by an interpreter  He relies on the same grounds that were before the Federal Magistrate and submits that the Tribunal   sort of ignored   the medical reports and the newspaper articles  Further particulars are not given   The Minister submits that the appeal must fail for two fundamental reasons  The first is that there has been no denial of procedural fairness and the second is that  even if there had been such a denial  s  B of the Act applies  That section relevantly provides that Div   of Pt   of the Act is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with   Section  A  of the Act in Div   has no application  as the documents in question were given to the Tribunal by the appellant for the purposes of the review application  s  A b   Indeed  the appellant does not raise any ground of appeal in this regard followedNBKT v Minister for Immigration
