MZXPC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMZXMD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The judgment that the appellant seeks to appeal was apparently made under O    A of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules  Order    A c  permits the Court to dismiss an application if a party fails to appear at a hearing  The judgment is in the nature of an interlocutory judgment  see recently  for example  MZXMD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per Weinberg J and the cases there cited  Accordingly  pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  the appellant requires leave to appeal  The appellant has not sought leave  notwithstanding that the defect is apparent from the first respondent s notice of objection to competency  I note too that leave must be sought within   days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision or an extension of time sought in which to seek such leave  The appeal is incompetent in the absence of a grant of leave citedMZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Even if leave were sought  I would not be disposed to grant it  The present is a hopeless case  This is the second occasion in which the appellant has instituted proceedings for judicial review of the Tribunal s decision in March    There is no suggestion that the appellant seeks to challenge the decision on any new ground  Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances  see  for example  MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   referring to Wong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at   and MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     Even if the circumstances did not give rise to res judicata  these second judicial review proceedings would attract an Anshun estoppel  see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding  Furthermore  there is nothing to support the appellant s contention that the course taken by the Federal Magistrate on this occasion was so unfair or otherwise affected by error that it ought be set aside on appeal referred toWong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   Even if leave were sought  I would not be disposed to grant it
