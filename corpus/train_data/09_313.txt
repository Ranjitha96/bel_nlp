cases cth FCA  htmlFurthermore  once a generic is released into the market for PBS products  it would be likely to have the effect of reducing Wyeth s market share  As Gyles J observed in GenRx Pty Limited v Sanofi Aventis   FCA         IPR   at       A new entrant     would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible  The question which arises in all these circumstances is whether damages would be an adequate remedy  Wyeth submitted that any doubts which may exist in its ability to recover its losses at a final hearing point toward an order being made in the interests of justice for identity discovery at the earliest possible date appliedHexal Australia Pty Limited v Roche Therapeutics Inc     IPR  It seems to me to follow that the Court should approach an application along the same lines as that which applies to a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief  Whilst an applicant under O  A is not required to establish a serious question to be tried  the applicant s prospects of success are not to be considered in isolation from the element of the interests of justice  The strength or otherwise of the prospects will bear upon the question of where the interests of justice lie  Hexal Australia Pty Limited v Roche Therapeutics Inc     IPR   at   appliedHooper v Kirella Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe considerations which are to inform the exercise of the discretion were stated by a Full Court in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    See also Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd   FCAFC   in relation to the principles applicable under O  A r    Two of the considerations referred to in Hooper are critical to the determination of the present application  The first is that  although an applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent  the power conferred by  O  A r   is not to be exercised in favour of a person who intends to commence  merely speculative proceedings   The prospects of success are a material factor in the exercise of the discretion  Hooper at    The second consideration is that an applicant must show that the order is necessary in the interests of justice  Their Honours said that this means that an applicant must show that the making of the order is necessary to provide that person with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which he or she complains  Hooper at    The jurisdictional facts There was substantial argument between the parties as to whether two of the necessary jurisdictional facts were established  The first was whether Wyeth had made reasonable inquiries  The second was whether the  proceeding  to which O  A r   refers is final or interlocutory  it being contended by the Department that Wyeth s purpose is to commence a proceeding for interlocutory relief  which is not contemplated by the Rule  These issues can be disposed of quite briefly  There was some force in Mr Howe s submission that Wyeth has not adduced any evidence of inquiries made overseas as to the identities of the sponsors  Wyeth acknowledged that TGA applications are often preceded by similar applications made in other jurisdictions  Nevertheless  I am prepared to proceed on the basis that inquiries in those jurisdictions would not be conclusive  The test stated in Hooper does not expressly stipulate any threshold which an applicant must satisfy for the exercise of the power  But in stating that a material factor in the exercise of the discretion is the prospect of success in the proceedings  the Full Court in Hooper specified  as one of the elements of the claim for identity discovery  that an applicant provide evidence in support of its claim for final relief  In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper   Whilst good cause must be shown  each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice  Wyeth s evidence as to prospects of successcitedInterpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe observations of Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA   at     recognise the difficulties which may arise in restoring a patentee to the position it occupies as the only supplier of the product in the event that the patent holder succeeds at the final hearing but is denied interlocutory relief  Nevertheless  I have come to the view that it is not in the interests of justice to order identity discovery on this application  There are two reasons for this  First  I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that Wyeth has good prospects of success at a final hearing  The most that can be said is that it has a provisional working hypothesis which would need to be supplemented by further evidence  including expert evidence  to determine the strength of Wyeth s case distinguishedViskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSenior counsel for the Department placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of French J in Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc   FCA    There  his Honour was dealing with an application for information discovery under O  A r    He said at   that the rule should not be permitted to authorise information discovery except for good cause shown in terms of the conditions  He continued     In respect of patents for inventions  the exercise of the discretion must have regard both to the intrusive nature of the order and the need to encourage research and development unhampered by the prospect of speculative review of working papers by competitors  To allow the remedy in this case based upon formulaic recitations of wide application would set the threshold for pre action discovery so low that there would be few cases in which a person wishing to challenge a patent could not obtain discovery of the kind which is sought here  However  these remarks are to be read in their context  His Honour expressed the view at   that the evidence which was required to satisfy the first element of O  A r   namely reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has the right to obtain relief against the prospective respondent  was an opinion expressed as a conclusion stated in terms of the rule  His Honour considered that the conclusionary statement was insufficient to meet the requirements of O  A r  a   I do not think it follows that his Honour s observations establish that a high threshold must be satisfied before an order will be made under O  A r    It is true that French J said at   that if an order were made in that case it would establish a very low threshold for the application of the rule  But  in my opinion  that was because of the slender basis of the evidence in support of the  reasonable cause to believe   In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper   Whilst good cause must be shown  each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice  Wyeth s evidence as to prospects of success
