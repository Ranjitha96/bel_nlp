as the respondents  in respect of the contraventions of ss   and   of the Act and if so in what amount and by reference to what considerations  and whether any penalty imposed on any of those respondents should be paid to John Holland or paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth  By operation of the Fair Work  Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments  Act    Cth  the repealed Workplace Relations Act    Cth  continues to apply to conduct that occurred prior to the repeal of the Act  John Holland and the CFMEU  the AMWU and the CEPU have agreed that

observations of Buchanan J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies v McAlary Smith at    At   Buchanan J said this    The totality principle is a guide to sentencing practice  It must be adapted to the circumstances  It is designed to avoid injustice in the overall result  It is not a principle which suggests that a penalty should necessarily be reduced from an aggregate total fixed for multiple offences  Rather  it involves a final check to ensure that a total or aggregate penalty is not  in all the circumstances  excessive  It may not be citedPearce v The Queen     CLR   at   and Hamberger

concurrency  One further matter should be mentioned in relation to the policy guiding the approach to imposing a penalty  In Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions  supra  Lander J at   put the principles in these terms with which I respectfully agree    There are three purposes at least for imposing a penalty  punishment  deterrence  and rehabilitation  The punishment must be proportionate to the offence and in accordance with the prevailing standards of punishment  R v Hunter   Therefore the circumstances of the offence or contravention are especially important  The penalty must recognise the need for deterrence  both personal and general  In regard to personal deterrence  an assessment must be made of the risk of re offending  In regard to general deterrence  it is assumed that an appropriate penalty will act as a deterrent to others who might be likely to offend  Yardley v Betts   The penalty therefore should be of a kind that it would be likely to act as a deterrent in preventing similar contraventions by like minded persons or organisations  If the penalty does not demonstrate an appropriate assessment of the seriousness of the offending  the penalty will not operate to deter others from contravening the section  However  the penalty should not be such as to crush the person upon whom the penalty is imposed or used to make that person a scapegoat  In some cases  general deterrence will be the paramount factor in fixing the penalty  R v Thompson   In some cases  although hardly in this type of contravention  rehabilitation is an important factor       citations omitted In Ponzio   Lander J was considering a contravention of s  AA of the Act which prohibited an employer from making a payment to an employee in relation to a period during which the employee was engaged in industrial action  Previous contraventions The intervener has formulated a schedule consisting of   references to cases in which a pecuniary penalty was imposed on a Union involved in the present contraventions  in respect of previous breaches of the Act or the BCII Act or alternatively breaches by officials of one or more of those Unions  The applicant also relies upon these references  I advised the parties that I would only have regard to those cases within the schedule to which I was expressly taken and upon which the intervener and the applicant expressly rely  The previous contraventions relied upon are these citedCommunity and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd     IR  I have had regard to the discussion of the totality principle in Mill v The Queen     CLR   per the Court and particularly at     Johnson v R     ALR   and particularly per Gleeson CJ at   and   and per Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ at   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd     ALR   per Goldberg J  Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   Ors   FCAFC     FCR   particularly per Jessup J at   to   Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan  supra  and particularly per Stone and Buchanan JJ at   to   Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary Smith  supra  per Gray J  per Graham J and per Buchanan J  Kelly v Fitzpatrick  supra  per Tracey J  and Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd     IR   per Finkelstein J citedWilliams v CFMEU  No      FCA  It is fair to say that that approach has not been generally supported in the authorities  Rather than commence the assessment by determining an overall penalty and then distributing the amount of that penalty amongst the various contraventions either arithmetically or by reference to a weighted distribution  the better approach to the application of the totality principle involves an assessment of a penalty appropriate to each contravention and then a final overall assessment of the sum of the penalties to consider whether the aggregate is  just and appropriate   This approach is consistent with Mill v The Queen  supra  and has been applied by Goldberg J in ACCC v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd   Jessup J in Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions  Jessup J in Williams v CFMEU  No      FCA   and Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick  supra   The approach has been described by Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ in Johnson v R  supra  at   in these terms    The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox  but not necessarily immutable  practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency  It seems to me that when Branson J formulated in CFMEU v Coal   Allied Operations Pty Ltd  No     supra at   of these reasons  a non exhaustive list of considerations to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion in respect of a contravention of what was Part XA of the Act  her Honour was not intending to convey the impression that by making reference to whether previous contraventions of Part XA of the Act had occurred  her Honour was suggesting that previous contraventions of other provisions of the Act or other contraventions relevant to the exercise of the discretion ought to be excluded from consideration  I respectfully agree with the observations on these matters of Jessup J in Williams v CFMEU  No    and Dowsett J in Temple v Powell     IR   at    I respectfully disagree with the approach adopted in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU     IR   at       per Le Miere J  I disagree in the sense that the exercise of the discretion ought not to be fettered by an exclusionary rule  Each case will turn on its own facts  Further  I do not accept that contraventions by a federally registered Union ought to be disregarded if the previous contraventions have occurred in a different geographical place from that within the area of responsibility of that part of the Union engaged in the contraventions under consideration in the imposition of a penalty  Otherwise  a Union registered under Commonwealth legislation operating nationally would be required to be treated as a collection of Balkan States rather than a nationally governed organisation conducting itself in a way consistent with the objectives of the Commonwealth legislation under which it is registered and legislation under which it operates in the modern Australian environment  In that sense  I respectfully agree with the observations of Kiefel J in Hadgkiss v CFMEU     IR   at   and    The penaltycitedStanden v Feehan     IR  So far as Part   of the Act is concerned the only penalty proceeding involving a contravention of the right of entry provisions is Standen v Feehan     IR   per Lander J  as to the contravening conduct  and     IR    as to the penalty decision   Mr Feehan was an official of the CFMEU although the CFMEU was not a party to the proceeding  Mr Feehan in exercising powers of entry to premises under ss  B and  C of the Act intentionally hindered and obstructed a person in contravention of s  E of the Act  A penalty of     was imposed on Mr Feehan  The maximum penalty was      As to questions of broader principle  Lander J considered at   of the penalty decision that punishment played some part in formulating a penalty for a contravention of the right of entry provisions but rehabilitation played no real part  Lander J was dealing with the imposition of a penalty
