under subsection   in relation to that decision  but may   make such an application in respect of the decision made on such a   review   Section   provides      Subject to this section  where       a  a request has been made to an agency or Minister in   accordance with section     and      b  the period of   days  in relation to the request  mentioned in   paragraph  b  or that period as extended under   subsection   has expired since the day on which the   request was received by or on behalf of the agency or Minister    and      c  notice of a decision on the request has not been received by the   applicant      the principal officer of the agency or the Minister shall  for the   purpose of enabling an application to be made to the Tribunal under   section     be deemed to have made  on the last day of that period  a   decision refusing to grant access to the document   Section   of the FOI Act provides    Subject to this section  in proceedings under this Part  the Tribunal has power  in addition to any other power  to review any decision that has been made by an agency or Minister in respect of the request and to decide any matter in relation to the request that  under this Act  could have been or could be decided by an agency or Minister  and any decision of the Tribunal under this section has the same effect as a decision of the agency or Minister   Applying the principles laid down in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA       CLR   the Tribunal found that the failure to notify the applicant of the transfer in accordance with s   of the FOI Act did not invalidate the transfer  In the Tribunal s view  Parliament intended the notification requirement to be procedural  It intended that the person making the request be notified that the request was being handled by another agency  The requirement was for notification  where a request is transferred   In the Tribunal s view  this meant that the notification was to occur after the transfer had occurred  A failure to comply with s   did not affect the transfer  let alone render it invalid   The Tribunal then dealt with the final question  whether the requests had been deemed to be refused while in the possession of the Attorney General and the Justice Minister respectively  In the absence of any extension of time pursuant to s   of the FOI Act   the   day period for a decision on the request to the Attorney General would have expired on   October    The transfer occurred on   October   within that   day period  Similarly  the request was received by the Justice Minister by   September   and the date of the transfer was   September    The transfer occurred within   days of the Justice Minister s receipt of the request  In each case  therefore  there was no deemed decision while the requests were in the possession of the recipients of them  No decision had been made by either recipient  The Tribunal only had jurisdiction if a decision had been made  or was deemed to have been made  so it did not have jurisdiction in either case   At the heart of the applicant s case is the proposition that the transfer of a request pursuant to s  b  does not absolve the original recipient of the request from the obligation to search its records for documents to which the request relates  and to respond to the request in an appropriate manner in relation to each relevant document in its possession  In other words  a transfer of the whole of a request  without regard to what documents the transferor has  or may have  that would answer the request is not a valid transfer under s  b   The original recipient of the request retains an obligation to respond with a decision on the request within the time required  and can only transfer so much of the request as relates to identified documents that have a subject matter more closely connected with the functions of another agency than with those of the recipient of the request
