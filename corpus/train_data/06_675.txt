Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations  No     FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toPerkins v Cuthill     ALR   The other formulation of the appropriate test is that an order may be made under s   of the ADJR Act if the applicant satisfies the Court that it is just in all the circumstances to make such an order  That was the approach suggested by Keely J in Perkins v Cuthill     ALR   at   and favoured by French J in Snow v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at     In Snow v Deputy Commission of Taxation  supra  French J said that there may be cases where an order under s   of the ADJR Act will not be made  even though the test for the granting of an interlocutory injunction is satisfied  His Honour said  at      In my opinion however there may be cases where  for reasons peculiar to the administration of the Judicial Review Act and the particular legislative scheme on which it is operating  the establishment of a  serious question  to be tried and a balance of convenience in favour of an applicant  ordinarily sufficient to justify the grant of an interlocutory injunction  will be insufficient to warrant the making of an order under s        It is unnecessary for present purposes to attempt an exhaustive definition of the boundaries within which the powers conferred by the two sections may operate    Allowing for that possibility  French J said that it would be preferable to adopt the test formulated by Keely J in Perkins v Cuthill  supra    In many cases  including the present  the application of the test for an interlocutory injunction is the proper test to be applied on an application under s    Both parties to this application argued the application on the basis that the two requirements for an interlocutory injunction were both necessary and sufficient and I will proceed on that same basis   I turn to consider whether there is a serious question to be tried referred toSnow v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation  WA      ALR  referred toFaingold v Zammit     FCR   In Faingold v Zammit     FCR   the Full Court of this Court considered the two formulations and said that  in practical terms  there may be very little difference between them  It held that the trial judge in that case had not erred in applying the test appropriate on the application for an interlocutory injunction referred toBuck v Bavone   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  To successfully challenge the Registrar s decision  the applicants must make out one of the above grounds in the context of a power the exercise of which is conditioned on the Registrar being satisfied of one of the grounds in s   of the Act  The question of the limits that this fact places on the scope of a challenge to a decision has been considered in a number of authorities  but it is unnecessary to pause on this point on this application  Buck v

HCA         CLR   per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at     referred toJameson v Guri Wa Ngundagar Aboriginal Corporation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Registrar authorised the preparation of the examination report pursuant to s    The examiner spoke to certain persons for the purposes of preparing the examination report  The applicants contend that there were persons the examiner should have spoken to  to whom he did not speak  The notice to show cause is based on the findings of the examiner  as set out in his report  As I have said  it seems that the delegate of the Registrar had a copy of the examination report before preparing the notice to show cause  but the examination report was marked  Draft   It was not until some time after the service of the notice to show cause that the delegate was told the examination report marked  Draft  was in fact the final report  There is evidence before me that the delegate was told this some time in late February    The conclusions of the delegate for the purposes of his decision to appoint an administrator were based on the findings of the examiner  The applicants asked for a copy of the examination report before responding to the notice to show cause  but it was not provided  I doubt that the failure to provide the examination report amounts to a breach of the rules of natural justice  see Jameson v Guri Wa Ngundagar Aboriginal Corporation   FCA    The applicants pointed to the fact that the Registrar did not raise any further concerns that she had despite their invitation by letter dated   April   to do so   It is not clear to me that there is a serious question to be tried  Had the fate of this application turned on that issue  I would have been disposed to allow the applicants to make further submissions on the issue  Although they have already had an adequate opportunity to do so  the decision is an important one from the applicants  point of view  As it is  I have reached the conclusion that the balance of convenience clearly favours the refusal of the application and it is unnecessary to pursue the issue of whether there is a serious question to be tried any further   I turn now to consider the balance of convenience
