Adelaide Bank Limited  In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd   FCA  Three grounds under this section were advanced  These were   a  The Statutory Demand was not made in compliance with s  E of the Act because it was not in the prescribed form  see s  E e  of the Act  and was not accompanied by an affidavit that   i  Verified that the claimed debt was due and payable by BMG as at   August   and   ii  Complied with the Rules of Court    see s  E  of the Act     The alleged non compliance with each of the provisions referred to above was said to be constituted by the failure on the part of Adelaide Bank to verify the Statutory Demand or otherwise include in the affidavits read in support of its case on the present Application a statement by an appropriately qualified witness to the following effect   I believe there is no genuine dispute about the existence or amount of the debt       In support of these contentions  Mr Watts relied upon the decision of Tamberlin J in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd v Shanghai Jerrys Candle Company Ltd   FCA       b  The Statutory Demand was issued for an improper purpose  That purpose was said to be the purpose of preventing or delaying BMG  Mr Watts and Mrs Watts from taking action against Adelaide Bank for damages or compensation by reason of the bank s conduct in allegedly dishonouring various alleged agreements and arrangements and in taking possession of the property and in taking steps to sell it as mortgagee in possession  and   c  The amount of the debt claimed in the Statutory Demand was misstated  At the hearing on   December   Mr Watts conceded that there was in existence as at   August   a debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank but submitted that the correct amount of the debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank at that

must be capable of being quantified as an amount of money   Chase Manhattan Bank Australia Ltd v Oscty Pty Ltd   FCA         ACSR   at    The claim must exist at the time at which the statutory demand is made ie in this case as at   August or perhaps   August    By reason of the terms of the definition of offsetting claim   the claim must be genuine   The concept of genuineness gives rise to the same considerations as those with which I have dealt in respect of the s  H a  ground  The first contention relied upon by BMG in support of this ground is that Adelaide Bank sold the property at an undervalue  This allegation amounts to an allegation that the bank breached the duty owed by it to BMG as mortgagee in possession when exercising its power of sale appliedEconomic Life Assurance Society v Usborne   AC  Whilst it seems to me that the provisions of cl     would entitle Adelaide Bank to charge interest at the contractual rate after judgment  the terms of that clause do not authorise the continued charging after judgment of late payment fees and penalty charges in accordance with other provisions of the loan agreements  Whatever rights Adelaide Bank had to levy such fees and charges under the covenants in the loan agreements were merged in the judgment which it obtained on   April    After   April   its rights were confined to recovering the amount of the judgment plus interest  albeit levied at the contractual rate if it so desired and its rights under its securities  see Economic Life Assurance Society v Usborne   AC     and Elders Trustee   Executor Co Ltd v Eagle Star Nominees Ltd     BPR       ANZ ConvR     NSW ConvR      A complete copy of the relevant mortgage was not tendered in evidence before me  I will therefore assume that  prior to   April   Adelaide Bank s rights in respect of interest and other charges were confined to the personal covenants in the loan agreements  In that event  those rights were merged in the judgment and ceased to

Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd     ACSR   at         ACLC     McLelland CJ in Eq said    It is  however  necessary to consider the meaning of the expression  genuine dispute  where it occurs in s  H  In my opinion that expression connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation  and raises much the same sort of considerations as the  serious question to be tried  criterion which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat  This does not mean that the court must accept uncritically as giving rise to a genuine dispute  every statement in an affidavit  however equivocal  lacking in precision  inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements by the same deponent  or inherently improbable in itself  it may be  not having  sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation as to  its  truth   cf Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan   AC   at   or  a patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence  cf South Australia v Wall     SASR   at      But it does mean that  except in such an extreme case  a court required to determine whether there is a genuine dispute should not embark upon an inquiry as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as giving rise to the dispute  There is a clear difference between  on the one hand  determining whether there is a genuine dispute and  on the other hand  determining the merits of  or resolving  such a dispute  In Mibor Investments  at     Hayne J said  after referring to the state of the law prior to the enactment of Div   of Pt     of the Corporations Law  and to the terms of Div    These matters  taken in combination  suggest that at least in most cases  it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute  All that the legislation requires is that the court conclude that there is a dispute and that it is a genuine dispute     In Re Morris Catering  Aust  Pty Ltd     ACSR   at   Thomas J said   There is little doubt that Div       prescribes a formula that requires the court to assess the position between the parties  and preserve demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine offsetting claim  That is not to say that the court will examine the merits or settle the dispute  The specified limits of the court s examination are the ascertainment of whether there is a  genuine dispute  and whether there is a  genuine claim     It is often possible to discern the spurious  and to identify mere bluster or assertion  But beyond a perception of genuineness  or the lack of it  the court has no function  It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more likely than the other to succeed  or that the eventual state of the account between the parties is more likely to be one result than another    The essential task is relatively simple   to identify the genuine level of a claim  not the likely result of it  and to identify the genuine level of an offsetting claim  not the likely result of it      I respectfully agree with those statements distinguishedIFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd v Shanghai Jerrys Candle Company Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu

submitted that no moneys were due from BMG to Adelaide Bank and that Adelaide Bank had an obligation to account to BMG for surplus funds of approximately      In IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd   FCA     Tamberlin J held that  in circumstances where the Act  Rules of Court and the Regulations made under the Act required a statement to the effect that the creditor believed that there was no genuine dispute about the existence or the amount of the debt to be made as part of the evidentiary requirements supporting a creditor s statutory demand  the failure on the part of the creditor to make such a statement on oath was fatal to the validity of the statutory demand  In my opinion  however  the circumstances of the present case are quite different from those in play in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd   FCA    In my view  Adelaide Bank was not required to verify the Statutory Demand at all and was not required to include a statement in the form urged by Mr Watts  Section  E  of the Act is in the following terms      Unless the debt  or each of the debts  is a judgment debt  the demand must be accompanied by an affidavit that   a  verifies that the debt  or the total of the amounts of the debts  is due and payable by the company  and   b  complies with the rules  In the present case  the amount asserted to be due from BMG to Adelaide Bank in the Statutory Demand is the balance of a judgment debt  Thus  the foundation for the claimed debt in the present case is the judgment  not the loan agreements or the mortgage security  That being so  in my view  the Statutory Demand was not required to be accompanied by an affidavit that complied with s  E  of the Act  It is only if such an affidavit were required that consideration needs to be given to the requirements of the Rules  It is only when those requirements are brought into play that the reasoning of Tamberlin J in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd   FCA   is apt  I reject the first contention made by BMG in support of this ground  The second contention advanced by BMG in support of this ground has not been supported by any evidence or argument  It too is rejected citedOlivieri v Stafford     FCR  In my opinion  this Court has the power to go behind a judgment in appropriate circumstances  even if the judgment was obtained by default and even if the debtors have unsuccessfully made application to set the judgment aside  This much is made clear in the Reasons for Judgment of Gibbs J in Re Johnson   Mann  Ex parte Greendale Engineering   Cables Ltd   ALR         FLR   at    It may be thought that certain observations made by Beaumont J in Olivieri v Stafford     FCR   are authority for the contrary proposition  In that case  his Honour said  at     As has been said  a court of bankruptcy is concerned to inquire into the  reality  of the matter in hand  Here the  reality  of the matter is that the merits of the respondents  claim have been demonstrated to the satisfaction of one judge of the District Court and another judge of that Court has declined to disturb the judgment  As a matter of substance  it is appropriate  in all the circumstances  for a court of bankruptcy to treat what happened in the two hearings in the District Court as a trial of the merits of the respondents  claim  That is to say  a court of bankruptcy should  I think  accept that a process of adjudication in the District Court has established that the underlying transactions created a true debt which could  in turn  provide a proper foundation for the entry of a judgment in respect of which a bankruptcy notice could properly issue  In my view  notwithstanding these remarks  his Honour nonetheless recognised that the Court retained a discretion to go behind a default judgment in an appropriate case even where attempts to set aside that judgment had failed  There is no principle which denies the existence of that discretion  In Olivieri   FCR     a judgment had been obtained in the District Court by default and two attempts to have it set aside had failed  The approach of Beaumont J was to look at the reality of the matter  In his Honour s view  by the time that the case before him had reached this Court  there was no reason for this Court to examine yet again the underlying basis for the judgment    In the same case  Gummow J reached the same result through a different process of reasoning with which  with respect  I agree  The natural justice arguments advanced by BMG in support of its application to set aside the judgment made in the Supreme Court cannot constitute a defence to the claim of Adelaide Bank for repayment of its loans and other moneys due under the loan agreements  The remaining two broad grounds relied upon by BMG in the Supreme Court  as to which see  b  and  c  above  are reminiscent of contentions advanced on behalf of BMG in the present proceedings appliedPendlebury v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFurther  the position in Australia remains that there is no common law duty in negligence by which a mortgagee can be found liable for damages if it fails to obtain a good price or the best price upon the sale of a mortgaged property  as to which see Fisher and Lightwood s Law of Mortgage     nd Australian edition    at          The duty of the mortgagee is one of good faith  That duty requires the mortgagee not to act fraudulently or wilfully or recklessly or to recklessly sacrifice the interests of the mortgagor   Pendlebury v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    BMG tendered no evidence to support its contention that the property was sold at an undervalue  Adelaide Bank  on the other hand  tendered the three valuations which it had obtained  The valuers were not cross examined  Their opinions were not challenged at all  In addition  Mr Watts  anecdotal recounting of the casual offer made to BMG in mid   of   tended to support the valuations which Adelaide Bank had obtained  Furthermore  the obvious difficulties which BMG had encountered in selling the property in   and early   and in procuring sufficient funds to refinance its debts to Adelaide Bank in the same period provide additional support for the conclusion that the property was not likely to have commanded a price much above     viewed from the perspective of a seller looking forward in late   and early   citedPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt was submitted on behalf of Adelaide Bank in support of a contention that no genuine dispute existed that  by reason of the application of the principles articulated by the High Court in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     BMG was estopped from arguing that there was any dispute in respect of the judgment and  further  was estopped from arguing in the present proceedings any matter which was in fact raised by it  or could have been raised by it  in support of the application made by it  Mr Watts and Mrs Watts in the Supreme Court to set aside the judgment  I do not think that these propositions are correct  There has been no adjudication on the merits and no occasion calling for such an adjudication  The exercise of considering and determining an application to set aside a default judgment involves the application of very different principles from those which would ordinarily be in play on a final hearing on the merits appliedRe Johnson   Mann  Ex parte Greendale Engineering   Cables

satisfied that there is a genuine dispute about the existence or about the amount of the debt  In order for a dispute of that kind to be raised  there must be more than the mere assertion of a dispute or the mere making of a claim  per Lindgren J in Rohalo Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v RP Scherer SpA   Pharmagel SpA     ACSR         ACLC   at     esp at      The dispute must have an objective existence

Pty Ltd v G   M Aldridge Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     a Full Court of this Court discussed the relevant principles by reference to a number of the relevant authorities  At  F G the Court said    In our view a  genuine  dispute requires that    the dispute be bona fide and truly exist in fact  the grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute are real and not spurious  hypothetical  illusory or misconceived  In her Reasons for Judgment published on   February   McCallum J recorded the following  at     Mr Watts does not dispute that there were defaults in the two loan agreements  nor that the penalty charges incurred as a consequence were calculated in accordance with the two loan agreements  In this Court  Mr Watts did not take a different position  In particular  he made no submission to the effect that the various components making up the judgment debt of     had not been charged in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements  His attack on the judgment was more fundamental  It was Mr Watts  submission that the penalty charges and fees levied against BMG by Adelaide Bank ought to be disregarded entirely  that the costs incurred by Adelaide Bank in selling the property ought to be disregarded entirely and that BMG should get the benefit of the higher purchase price  viz   apparently negotiated by Mr Watts with Mr Campbell  These views or submissions are reflected in the calculation which I allowed Mr Watts to advance by way of submission earlier this week appliedUpton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au

decisions of the High Court as to the content of the duty of good faith owed by a mortgagee to a mortgagor in the context of the exercise of a mortgagee s power of sale  In the passages referred to  the Full Court held that a mortgagee is entitled to exercise the power of sale for its own benefit but must take reasonable steps to obtain a fair price which in turn will involve taking reasonable steps to ascertain the value before selling
