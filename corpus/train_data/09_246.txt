cases cth FMCA  htmlThis proceeding is an appeal from orders of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia   Applicant S  v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA   dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  made on   November   and published on   November    By that decision  the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent to refuse the grant of a protection visa to the appellant  a national of Bangladesh  The appellant contends by his notice of appeal that his Honour  Federal Magistrate Cameron  erred in a way reflecting jurisdictional error by incorrectly  interpreting  the applicable law and incorrectly  applying  the relevant law to the facts of the case  Secondly  the Tribunal failed  it is said  to comply with s  A a  of the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   by relying on information not put to the appellant and not discussed with the appellant  in reaching its decision  Thirdly  the Tribunal failed  it is said  to comply with s  A b  of the Migration Act by failing to give the appellant particulars of  the derivation of adverse evidence which might affect a consideration of whether the information is reliable   Fourthly  it is said that the Tribunal failed to give the appellant any opportunity to contest or comment upon independent country information relied upon by the Tribunal in reaching its decision  These grounds of appeal  however  fail to identify the particular information said to have been relied upon by the Tribunal and not put to the appellant  The appellant was self represented before this Court with the assistance of an interpreter  The appellant has some understanding of English  He says that he can speak  read and write English although poorly  He speaks  reads and writes the Bengali language  Although these reasons are formulated for the benefit of all parties  the explanation of the basis for the Court s decision is set out with the appellant particularly in mind as the appellant is not represented by legal advisers and an interpreter will be called upon to explain to the appellant the reasons for the decision  I will seek to set out the reasons as plainly as possible  The appellant contends that the decision of the Tribunal is unfair as he has now been in Australia for   years  The appellant says he holds a genuine fear of harm should he return to Bangladesh  He says he seeks  a fresh look at his case  by this Court  He says that the first decision of the Tribunal made on   October   was set aside and thus his claims were shown to be genuine whereas the second Tribunal failed to examine and consider his claims of involvement in Bangladesh with a political party and claims of harassment of him in Bangladesh by opponents of that political party  To the extent that the appellant is seeking to say that the Tribunal failed to consider his claims of a well founded fear of persecution based upon his involvement with a political party in Bangladesh through which he gave expression to his political opinions  or that the Tribunal failed to examine evidence of his involvement in the affairs of that political party which he says is the factual foundation for his well founded fear of persecution  see ss             of the Migration Act and Articles   and  A  of the   Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the   Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees   the appellant is contending that the Tribunal failed to discharge its statutory duty of review conferred upon it by the Migration Act  see ss   and   of the Migration Act   citedS  of   v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe appellant arrived in Australia on   March   and applied for a protection visa on   April    The appellant lodged an extensive and detailed typewritten statement with his application  prepared by his migration agent based upon instructions given to the agent by the appellant  in which he explained why he left Bangladesh  the fear he held of what might happen to him should he return  the reasons for that fear  the groups who might harm him  and  why the authorities in Bangladesh might not be either able or willing to protect him  The Minister s delegate on   April   refused to grant him a protection visa  On   May   the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of that refusal  The appellant was invited to attend an oral hearing before the Tribunal on   May    The appellant said he would attend that hearing  The hearing was postponed to   June    The appellant attended the postponed hearing and gave oral evidence in support of his claims  On   April   the Tribunal wrote to the appellant regretting the delay in finalising a review of the delegate s decision to refuse a protection visa  The Tribunal said in its letter that a decision would be forthcoming within a few weeks and further said that if any new information relevant to his claims was available  appropriate documents should be submitted to the Tribunal in English  The Tribunal attached to its letter documents reflecting independent evidence obtained by the Tribunal after the hearing on   June   which was to be considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decision  The appellant was given an extension of time to   May   to provide any response and did so on   May    On   October   the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Minister s delegate  That decision was published on   October   and set aside by Federal Magistrate Smith   S  of   v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA   on   March    That proceeding had a long history commencing with an Order nisi in the High Court of Australia on   April   and remittal of the proceeding to the Federal Court of Australia and then to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia  Federal Magistrate Smith concluded that the Tribunal had denied the appellant natural justice in not putting to him for comment matters thought by the Tribunal to be relevant in reaching its decision namely  the impact for the appellant of the election in October   of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party  BNP  to government and the loss of government by the Awami League  although the Awami League had stepped aside according to interim arrangements in August    Federal Magistrate Smith also noted that the Tribunal in its reasons had made an error of fact by making references to claims made by the appellant concerning the intimidation in Bangladesh of his father  by Awami League supporters  by describing those events as references to the appellant s grandfather  Accordingly  Federal Magistrate Smith quashed the Tribunal s decision and made an order directing the Tribunal to determine the appellant s application for review according to law  The Tribunal constituted by a different member embarked upon a reconsideration of the appellant s application and on   July   the appellant gave oral evidence before the Tribunal  On   August   the Tribunal wrote to the appellant inviting him to comment upon information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or at least a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review  That letter was an extensive letter of seven pages sent to the appellant pursuant to s  A of the Migration Act   The letter called for comments by   September    On   September   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal advising that he was unable to provide a response by   September    He said that he would require evidence from members of the Freedom Party in Bangladesh with whom he said he had been associated and that he would require an extension of three months  time to collect the necessary documents to enable him to respond  The appellant said that he was communicating with the President of the Freedom Party  Colonel Faruk  who as at   September   was under arrest awaiting the carrying out of the death penalty by the Bangladeshi government  The appellant said that was seeking evidence from Colonel Faruk  The file copy of the letter is endorsed with a handwritten note by the Tribunal member signed and dated   September   by which an officer of the Tribunal is directed to advise the appellant by telephone and in writing that no extension would be granted  On   September   the Tribunal wrote to the appellant advising him that his request had been considered carefully but that a decision had been reached not to grant an extension of time  On   October   the Tribunal advised the appellant that a decision would be handed down on   November    On   November   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal advising that he had received a letter from the Freedom Party Leader on   October   by facsimile  A copy of that letter was attached to the appellant s letter  The appellant asked the Tribunal to consider that evidence prior to handing down its decision  The appellant also told the Tribunal in that letter    There is nothing to response or make any comments on the information sought from me in the tribunal s letter dated   August   because the information and incidents happened long   years ago and general human being may forgot various issues  There is nothing contradict for a fair minded observer to consider my fear of persecution in my home country Bangladesh       emphasis added The Tribunal in reaching its decision published on   November   considered the appellant s letter of   November   and the enclosure  Background facts put to the TribunalcitedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu

or consider  afresh  the decision reached by the Tribunal  it simply cannot do so  If the Tribunal misconceived the question to be addressed in conducting its review or failed to correctly identify

Durairajasingham   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt is clear from a consideration of the Tribunal s reasons that detailed consideration was given to the claims made by the appellant in the documentation lodged in support of his protection visa application of   April   and the oral evidence given in support of his application at each Tribunal hearing   June   and   July    The Tribunal having evaluated that material identified a number of inconsistencies which it describes as significant  It was open to the Tribunal to weigh the impact of the perceived inconsistencies and the appellant s explanation of them  The Tribunal was not satisfied that a loss of memory and the suffering of stress provided a compelling explanation for the inconsistencies  The Tribunal accepted that the passage of time might affect an individual s capacity to recall all relevant details relating to the particular claims  However  the Tribunal was not satisfied that this explanation was an answer to the inconsistencies the Tribunal identified  The conclusion that the appellant could not be believed in the light of those inconsistencies and that the appellant was not reliable and thus his claims were untrue represents a finding of fact as to credibility  squarely within the fact finding role of the Tribunal   Re Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA         ALR   per McHugh J at    Plainly  the Tribunal s findings were open to it for the reasons identified by it  There is no error of law or jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal in reaching those conclusions  In reaching its decision on   November   the Tribunal was plainly influenced by the inconsistencies it identified between the detailed statement of facts and circumstances lodged by the appellant with his application for a protection visa on   April   and oral evidence given before the Tribunal  particularly on   July    That evidence consisted of the appellant s recollection on that day of events that had occurred throughout his life but particularly events from   until his departure from Bangladesh to Australia in March    The oral evidence also consisted of the appellant s recollection or lack of recollection of events that he described in his detailed statement of   April   concerning the events surrounding the death of his father s brother  step brother  and events of harassment of his father which were said to have resulted in his becoming almost crippled in    By   July     years had elapsed since the formulation of his written statement of   April     years had elapsed since the events of   when his father was said to have been jailed and treated badly and   years had elapsed since the events in   when his father was said to have been almost crippled by a beating  Although it is not clear from the written statement precisely when the appellant says his uncle was killed  it seems to have occurred after August   and probably after mid   when  according to the appellant  contrived criminal charges were brought against the appellant  In describing why authorities would not be able to protect him he said in his written statement    If the protection and other facilities from the authority would  be  available in Bangladesh my uncle would not be killed brutally and the killers would not move around freely  Accordingly  by the time the appellant gave evidence on   July   either   years or   years had elapsed since the events concerning the contended brutal killing of his uncle had taken place citedSZBYR   Anor v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   Anor   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe appellant says that the Tribunal failed to comply with s  A a  of the Migration Act by relying on information not put to the appellant and not discussed with the appellant in reaching its decision  That contention fails to identify the information relied upon by the Tribunal and not put to the appellant  In that sense  the claim or ground of appeal is lacking any content at all  There is simply no information identified by the appellant which would fall within s  A   The Tribunal is not required to put its reasoning process to the appellant or the content of its proposed reasons to be published  to enable the appellant to comment before making the decision   SZBYR   Anor v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   Anor   HCA         ALR   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ at    In any event  the Tribunal by its letter of   August   put to the appellant the series of inconsistencies about which it was concerned  However  all of that information derived from material put by the appellant to the Tribunal citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW   Ors   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe appellant also contends that the Tribunal relied upon independent country information and to the extent that the appellant rests his belief that the Tribunal contravened s  A  because it failed to provide details of that information to him  it is clear that the Tribunal has no obligation to put independent country information to him under s  A a  as that information is information  not specifically about  the appellant  and is simply  about a class of persons of which  the appellant  is a member  and is thus within the exception in s  A a    Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW   Ors   FCAFC         FCR   per Beaumont J at   to   per Merkel and Hely JJ at   to    In any event  the Tribunal put to the appellant independent country information relating to formation of the Liberal Party and noted the inconsistency between that information and the appellant s evidence as to when and how he became involved with the Freedom Party  The appellant also contends that the Tribunal failed to provide him with details of  the derivation of adverse evidence which might affect a consideration of whether the information is reliable   That failure was said to be a contravention of s  A b  which is an obligation imposed upon the Tribunal to ensure  as far as is reasonably practicable  that the appellant understands why the information is relevant to the review and the consequences of the information being relied upon in affirming the decision under review  The Tribunal s letter of   August   makes very clear the identified inconsistencies  the Tribunal s concern about those inconsistencies and the consequences for the review of the delegate s decision should the Tribunal rely upon the inconsistencies in forming a view about the appellant s credibility  There is no basis in the claim that the Tribunal  in electing to issue its letter of   August   failed to properly draw these matters to the appellant s attention  The appellant by his notice of appeal contends that Federal Magistrate Cameron erred by incorrectly interpreting the relevant law and incorrectly applied the relevant law to the facts  There is simply no content to the ground of appeal and no demonstrated error on the part of Federal Magistrate Cameron
