Environment  Heritage and the Arts   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Recently I declined to make an order for costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation raising environmental issues  Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment  Heritage and the Arts   FCA         FCR   at     The present case  however  is not comparable  Unlike Blue Wedges   the present case did not raise any novel questions of general importance about the operation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act    Cth  or any difficult questions of construction

Full Court pointed out in Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth   FCAFC         ALR   at     the fact that the unsuccessful party was raising a matter of public interest does not necessarily warrant a departure from this rule  In the same vein Marshall J said in Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull   FCA         ALD   at     The real issue is not what is considered to be in the public interest or whether public interest considerations are a recognised exception to the usual rule  but rather  whether it can be said that there are sufficient public interest related reasons connected with or leading up to the litigation that warrant a departure from or outweigh the important consideration that a wholly successful respondent would ordinarily be awarded its costs citedWilderness Society Inc

Environment  Heritage and the Arts   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   May   I gave judgment for the respondents and directed written submissions as to costs  Your Water Your Say Inc v Minister for the Environment  Heritage and the Arts   FCA     The case against the first respondent  the Federal Minister  in my opinion had no arguable merit  It was plain that no relevant decision was made by the Federal Minister about the Preliminary Works  Neither respondent contended that the delegate s observation in the s   decision that the Preliminary Works did not  require approval under the EPBC Act  had any legal effect  The applicant submitted that it  won the point there was no  approval   But the respondents never suggested there was  It was not a case of  de facto approval  see   FCA   at       Reference was made in the costs submissions of the applicant to an  advertorial  in the South Gippsland Sentinel Times of   March   which stated  The Federal Government determined that these works in themselves would not have any significant environmental effects and subsequently decided that they would not need to be subject to the requirements of EES   Quite apart from the lack of proper proof  and consideration of the context  this does not add anything  As pointed out in the substantive judgment   FCA   at     if works do not have approval under the EPBC Act and in fact have significant impact on matters of national environmental significance  persons carrying out the works face criminal sanctions  However  as will shortly be mentioned in regard to the case against the State of Victoria  there was no proof that any such impact was likely   The case against the State of Victoria had even less merit  The only material adduced in support of an application to have the Court order the stopping of the Preliminary Works was a report by an unidentified individual as to the environmental effects of a wind farm some distance from the works in question  This was spectacularly irrelevant   Even if the applicant qualified for the special provision for standing in ss   and   of the EPBC Act  that does not carry any particular significance on the issue of costs  The general rule that the losing party pays the winner s costs necessarily assumes that the former has standing
