Woodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng  No     FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedWoodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the substantive judgment on the appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court   Woodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng   FCA   I upheld the appellant s appeal insofar as it was based on its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  but rejected its claims for copyright infringement  I assessed damages at      The questions of interest under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and costs were adjourned  The parties have now filed written submissions citedCalderbank v Calderbank     All ER   The trial before the learned Magistrate took place on   and   November    Earlier that year the respondents had made a number of Calderbank offers  see Calderbank v Calderbank     All ER   which are detailed in my judgment at    The last of those was on   June    It involved an undertaking to cease selling products with the offending packaging    for costs and   for damages  By a letter from its solicitors dated   June   the appellant rejected that offer and  in order to reach a commercial resolution to this dispute  made a counter offer of   including costs and the undertaking  The offer was to remain open for seven days  The appellant repeated its offer on   July and   August  In the last mentioned letter it declined mediation   In its costs submissions the appellant calculated its costs of the trial on the scale under Federal Magistrates Court Regulations    Cth  sch   at    However  the great bulk of those were for  preparation for final hearing for a   day matter for solicitor    and  counsel s fees  including preparation     By the stage of the last Calderbank offer the scale costs apparently were      Fee for commencing proceeding   Interim application   Counsel s fee   April     Although the appeal was successful  at the conclusion of the appeal the appellant has recovered less by way of damages and costs than it would have had it accepted the respondents  last Calderbank offer back in June     In arguing against giving any costs consequence to the Calderbank offer the appellant says that a term of the undertaking was that the proceeding would be settled on a confidential basis and the respondents were not willing to admit liability  It says that one of its main concerns was that the respondents had been former customers of the appellant  In an effort to stop the respondents  conduct     and to ensure other traders did not also try to trade off the appellant s reputation and name  the appellant engaged in litigation seeking a declaration from the Court which it could use as evidence of its actions taken to stop the respondents  or  alternatively  a settlement of the matter which would allow it to demonstrate that it had achieved its purpose of stopping the respondents from carrying on their wrongful actions   The short answer  as the respondents point out  is that the appellant did not in any counter offer raise the need of some public vindication of its rights  On the contrary  it said it was looking for a  commercial resolution    In any case  the claim on which the appellant finally succeeded was not an action in rem   It is not as though the appellant succeeded in establishing some public right  as for example as to the validity of a patent  As against the respondents  the proposed undertaking would have been readily enforceable  The loss of the potential use of a judgment or settlement in terrorem against third parties engaging in similar conduct seems theoretical  there is no evidence of any such conduct  whether existing or threatened  and remote from the practicalities of settling the instant litigation   There remains the issue as to what significance is to be given to the fact that the rejection of the Calderbank offer was followed by a successful appeal by the offeree  albeit one which produced an outcome less favourable than the offer  This situation has been considered by a number of decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal  Some of these were reviewed in by a five member bench of that Court in Fotheringham v Fotheringham  No    NSWCA         NSWLR    The general effect of that decision is that while an offer of compromise continues to have cost consequences for an appeal   Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd     NSWLR   at   the appellate court retains its own discretion  In the words of Stein JA at    with whom the other members of the Court agreed    by the time Judgment  at trial  comes to be delivered  it will no longer be open to a party to whom an offer of compromise has earlier been directed to accept that offer  it following that  in the event of the Judgment being affected by error  the only means of seeking to have that error corrected which  in the absence of a further offer of compromise  will be open to the recipient of the original offer of compromise  will be by way of appeal   His Honour said  ibid  that the fact that the appeal was upheld was not only relevant to costs but would  in the normal course  justify the relevant court otherwise ordering  for the purpose of the applicable New South Wales Supreme Court rule  The present case arises under the general discretionary power of this Court over costs and not under any rule of Court  Nevertheless  the New South Wales cases provide an important analogy   Here the rejection of the respondents  Calderbank offer was imprudent  I am inclined to think the appellant s approach was affected by unreasonable expectations of success on its copyright claim  On the appeal  and presumably at first instance also  the appellant argued strongly for an award of additional damages under s   of the Copyright Act    Cth   It was submitted that additional damages against both respondents should total no less than    submissions par    At best  the copyright claim was at the very limit of the law  If copyright infringement was not made out  recovery was always going to be for a modest sum  In final submissions on the appeal the appellant did not seek  apart from additional damages  more than the sum awarded        On the other hand  it is true to say that the appellant had to invoke the appeal process to remedy an erroneous judgment against it  It would not be fair to make an award of costs of the appeal against this successful appellant  still less on an indemnity basis   I will order that the respondents pay the appellant s costs at first instance up to   June    the last rejection of the respondents  offers  on a party and party basis and thereafter the appellant pay the respondents  costs at first instance on an indemnity basis  There will be no order for the costs of the appeal citedFotheringham v Fotheringham  No    NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  There remains the issue as to what significance is to be given to
