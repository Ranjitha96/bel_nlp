same power to punish contempts as the High Court possesses  The section effectively declares that this Court has the contempt powers which are inherent in the judicial power of the Commonwealth  Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J   The contempt charges in this case were laid in accordance with O   r   and r   of the Federal Court Rules   Counsel for Mr Spencer  Mr Bailey  argued that service of the Orders on Mr Spencer was irregular having regard to the provisions of O   r    However  that argument fails to take account of r    Sub rule   permits a judgment or order to be enforced against a person by committal for contempt  notwithstanding that service has not been effected in accordance with r   where the person has notice of the judgment or order either by being present when the judgment is pronounced or when the order is made  or by being notified of the terms of the judgment or order by telephone  telegram or otherwise  In this case  Mr Spencer was represented by counsel when the Orders were made by Weinberg J  He had previously consented to and signed copies of the relevant orders  And shortly after the Orders were made  he was notified by his solicitor of the terms of the Orders  There was no failure to comply with O   citedWitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant

document was the longer form in Annexure   but it proceeded to analyse Mr Spencer s compliance against the short form document in Annexure    It submitted that the document that Mr Spencer provided by way of a disclosure statement did not  on any view  comply with the requirements of Annexure    In particular  it submitted that it did not comply with Items   to       and   of Annexure   of the Code  In addition  the applicant argued that the previous franchise agreements contained ongoing obligations that survived termination  and it said that these obligations were not properly addressed in the

scope of his obligations in respect of the disclosure document  see ACCC v Hughes at     To some extent  the applicant acknowledged that there were difficulties with paragraph   of the Orders  Notwithstanding its contention that there are deficiencies in the disclosure document provided by Mr Spencer  it does not press for an order that a further revised disclosure document be provided by Mr Spencer   I am satisfied that there are difficulties with paragraph   of the Order  It is unclear what it requires of Mr Spencer  Once Mr Spencer appreciated the difficulties he confronted in

has been forced to take these extra steps to enforce its rights after they have already been adjudicated by the Court   Mr Spencer had a duty strictly to comply with paragraph   of the Orders  He failed to do so and he is still in breach  He failed to take the necessary steps to comply with the Orders  notwithstanding correspondence from the applicant s solicitors warning that his failure amounted to a contempt  He was given ample opportunity to comply with the Orders   I consider that it is appropriate in the interests of justice in this case to make an order that Mr Spencer pay the applicant s costs of and incidental to the notice of motion on an indemnity basis  I do not consider that my finding that the charge of contempt is not made out in respect of paragraph   of the Orders warrants me taking a different view as to costs   I will make a declaration that Mr Spencer is in contempt of paragraph   of the Orders   The remaining question is what course should be taken in relation to the further operation of paragraph   of the Orders  While the applicant submitted that paragraph   has been breached  it did not press for an order that would have the consequence that Mr

edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It must be borne in mind that the persons to whom Mr Spencer was required to provide the documents were former franchisees of Contact Plus  Those persons had had a very unhappy experience with Contact Plus and Mr Spencer  Mr Spencer had threatened to commence legal proceedings against a number of the former franchisees  see Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA   at     The content of the   April email shows that Mr Spencer maintained considerable ill will towards the intended recipients of the email  It also reveals that he felt aggrieved by the outcome of the proceedings and was antagonistic towards the applicant and the addressees of the email   Paragraph   of the Orders provided that the facts set out in the attached statement of agreed facts constitute findings of fact for the purpose of s   of the Act  An obvious purpose of paragraph   of the Orders was  therefore  to inform those persons to whom the Orders were to be sent of the findings of fact that had been made against the respondents  Once informed of the findings of fact  they could take them into account in determining whether any  and if so what  action should be taken by them against the respondents to protect or assert their rights  The excision of the agreed statement of facts from every copy of the Orders that Mr Spencer provided must be seen in this light  I find that the excision of the agreed statement of facts was intentional   In the course of cross examination  Mr Spencer was asked to explain why it would not have been easy for him to send the Orders by email  without being password protected  His answers were as follows     These people have been very  very difficult to deal with  Since   I have constantly had this thing on my back  Constantly  No let up  These people have vexatiously sent emails on mass distribution lists  The copies were submitted in all this paperwork  They have been vexatious about this whole case right through  They are Ms Ford and Byron are not part of the ACCC action but they have been watching  commenting and even appearing at the back of one of my pre motion hearings  They are aware of everything that has been going on and they cannot wait to stick it up me  Consequently this  To answer the question is that sending by email is not it is like throwing a dart  Closing your eyes and throwing at a dart board  Because the email address is alive today does not mean to say it has been redirected  It was a commercial email address  fordrec  I have no idea whether in the last two years I have had any contact with this lady whether she has moved  sold her business or whatever  If her email address was jillford bigpond my answer to this gentlemen would have been I would have been more at ease sending it to a personal email address but not a commercial email address      MR MOORE  My question could you explain to his Honour why it would not have been easy for you to send a document that was not password protected to the email address of Ms Ford      And my answer was I had no idea whether that email address was still active and I wanted to find out   Later in Mr Spencer s evidence  I asked him whether  in view of the feelings he had described towards Ms Ford and others  he had taken the view that he wanted to make it difficult for them to access the Orders  including the agreed statement of facts  His answer was   Absolutely not  your Honour  because I knew that they would do exactly what they did and use it against me   I reject the denial in the first part of this answer   Having carefully considered all of the evidence  I find that Mr Spencer took a series of steps  deliberately  to render it difficult for the recipients of the emails to access and read the terms of the Orders  He knew that the email recipients would be most unlikely to provide him with their personal details  including their current telephone number  He thought it most unlikely that they would take the steps he required to obtain access to the password  He knew that this would tend to defeat the purpose of the Orders  while allowing him to claim that he had technically complied with them  I am also satisfied that Mr Spencer deliberately excised the agreed statement of facts from the Orders  He did so because  as he said in evidence  he did not want the relevant persons to be able to use the agreed statement of facts against him citedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews     ACSR   The Court has a range of remedies

regard to my findings  I consider that the present case warrants a substantial penalty  There is an element in Mr Spencer s conduct that borders on defiance of the Orders  He deliberately adopted a series of steps that were designed to deny the benefit of the Court s Orders to the intended recipients of the documents  In my view  a penalty must be imposed that demonstrates to Mr Spencer  and to others  that the Court s orders cannot be disobeyed with impunity   In his affidavit  Mr Spencer proffered an apology in these terms     If  as a result of my misunderstanding  I have failed to comply
