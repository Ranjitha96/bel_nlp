 http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Customs argued that the question of construction addressed by its proposed declaration was not determinative in the Tribunal but would be likely to be determinative if the matter were remitted  I do not agree  The characterisation of the goods would remain a question of fact on any remitter  The construction in the proposed declaration does not clarify whether the goods are or are not  special insoles  or orthopaedic appliances outside Note   to Chapter   as I have held  Declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal

v Collector of Customs   HCA         CLR   at          the dutiable classification of an imported article must be ascertained by an examination of the article itself  in the condition in which it is imported  followedCollector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In characterising the goods the Tribunal was entitled to have recourse to common sense  as Brennan CJ  Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ emphasised in Collector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     It was for the Tribunal to evaluate  as a factual matter  the essential character which it perceived the goods to have  It also had to identify what the word  insole  meant as an ordinary English word  That is why it was open to the Tribunal to select its characterisation of the best description of the goods as being orthotic inserts of the kind described in the patent   I am of opinion that Customs  characterisation of the Tribunal s approach to its case is not correct  The Tribunal s reasons show that it proceeded in a conventional manner  First  it identified what the goods were in the condition in which they came to be imported into Australia  It found that they were orthopaedic appliances within the meaning of heading    It explained that this finding was made because the goods were  more properly defined  as an artificial external device such as a brace or splint which prevented or assisted relative movement in the limbs  In this finding the Tribunal was expressing its ascertainment of the essential character of the goods  It explained that the finding was based on the ordinary and natural meaning of an orthopaedic appliance  That meaning was one which Customs accepted was open to the Tribunal based on its earlier decision in JS Levy  unreported Tribunal decision No   dated   September   and the Oxford English Dictionary definition   In my opinion  the reasons given by the Tribunal informed the parties why it came to the conclusion that it did  It made a finding as to how the goods would be viewed by an informed observer when they arrived at the wharf in Australia  In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan CJ  Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ deprecated an attempt to scrutinise  overzealously on judicial review  the reasons of an administrative decision maker   It is difficult to conceive that Note   of Chapter   was framed with the intention to exclude every orthotic insert except one made to measure  Such a construction would render otiose the second category of  footwear  or  special insole  in Note    Customs did not point to a construction that gave any reality to the existence an orthotic insert which was not made to measure and which met the criteria in Note   of Chapter    That is a good reason for concluding that orthotic inserts are not  in general  to be characterised as  special insoles  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           The argument of Customs deprives Note  e  of Chapter   of any real content because all orthotics  except those made to measure  would be excluded from being characterised as an orthopaedic appliance  Such a view is contrary to the words used in the Act and to common sense   Agfa Gevaert   CLR at    I reject this argument   Customs  proposed amended notice of appeal and application for an order for review seeks leave to add the following prayer for relief     That it be declared that the last paragraph to Note   to Chapter   in the Tariff Act has effect such that  footwear and special insoles designed to correct orthopaedic conditions  are  orthopaedic appliances  only if such footwear and special insoles are  either   made to measure or   mass produced  presented singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either foot equally    In my opinion it would be inappropriate to grant such a declaration in this matter  The circumstances in which Note   of Chapter   can operate are varied  I am not in a position to review all of them or to assess the impact which any particular form of declaratory relief might have on other goods   What a  special insole  is in any particular case must be a question of fact  as must the question as to whether the good satisfies any of the criteria in Note   which might bring it to assessment under heading    The proposed declaration is loosely framed and objectionable in form  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ  Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ   I am of opinion that the proposed amendment does not raise a fairly arguable claim to final relief and ought be refused  Queensland v JL
