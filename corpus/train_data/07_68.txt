Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Alice Car   Truck Rentals Pty Ltd trading as Territory Rent a car   FCA   appliedGeneral Steel Industries v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I should approach this application on the basis that the PFASC should be allowed to be filed unless it is clearly made out that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action  at least against the second respondents  In that regard it would be appropriate to apply the test in General Steel Industries v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   at   and allow the pleading to be filed or  alternatively  in the case of the statement of claim of   September   not be struck out unless the cause of action is so untenable that it cannot possibly succeed  The provisions of s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  do not apply to this application because this is not an application for summary judgment   The statement of claim should contain in a summary form the material facts upon which the applicant relies but not the evidence upon which those facts are to be proved  The applicant must include sufficient particulars to enable the respondent to the proceeding to know and understand the case which is brought against him or her  The statement of claim should contain such material facts and particulars as will allow the respondent to prevent the respondent from being taken by surprise at the trial and to know the evidence that needs to be obtained   Essentially  three matters are put against the second respondents  First  that the second respondents are vicariously liable for conduct of the first respondent in using the applicant s confidential information in relation to the written quotes  Secondly  the second respondents knowingly participated in the first respondent s breach of his duty of confidence  Thirdly  the second respondents are accessorily liable because they aided  abetted  counselled or procured the first respondent to contravene s   of the Act or were knowingly concerned in that contravention  In that regard it is pleaded that the second respondents thereby contravened s   of the Act  citedPhoto Production v Securicor Transport Limited   UKHL       AC   The second respondents argued that the doctrine of vicarious liability was confined to a tort committed by an employee in the course of that employee s employment and that therefore that this plea should be struck out  In Photo Production v Securicor Transport Limited   UKHL       AC   at   Lord Diplock said that the expression  vicarious liability  should be confined to liability for tort  There is  however  authority contrary to the second respondents  proposition  In Coulthard v South Australia     SASR     Coulthard   the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia was concerned with the publication of confidential information  King CJ said at      No authority has come to my attention which establishes that vicarious liability of an employer can exist under the equitable doctrine of breach of confidence  Nevertheless a breach of the equitable obligation of confidence is analogous to a common law tort  It is to be expected that equity would follow the law in such circumstances and that the common law doctrine of the vicarious liability in tort of an employer for the acts of employees in the course of their employment would apply in equity to breaches of confidence  It is to be expected that equity would act upon the conscience of the employer by requiring the employer to accept responsibility for the employee s breach of confidence  citedCoulthard v South Australia     SASR   The second respondents argued that the doctrine of vicarious liability was confined to a tort committed by an employee in the course of that employee s employment and that therefore that this plea should be struck out  In Photo Production v Securicor Transport Limited   UKHL       AC   at   Lord Diplock said that the expression  vicarious liability  should be confined to liability for tort  There is  however  authority contrary to the second respondents  proposition  In Coulthard v South Australia     SASR     Coulthard   the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia was concerned with the publication of confidential information  King CJ said at      No authority has come to my attention which establishes that vicarious liability of an employer can exist under the equitable doctrine of breach of confidence  Nevertheless a breach of the equitable obligation of confidence is analogous to a common law tort  It is to be expected that equity would follow the law in such circumstances and that the common law doctrine of the vicarious liability in tort of an employer for the acts of employees in the course of their employment would apply in equity to breaches of confidence  It is to be expected that equity would act upon the conscience of the employer by requiring the employer to accept responsibility for the employee s breach of confidence   King CJ concluded that it was not established that any breach of confidence had occurred in the course of the employer s employment  Perry and Debelle JJ both assumed that the respondent employer could be liable for a breach by its employee of his duty of confidence but  like King CJ  found that what was done was not done in the course of employment  I am unable to find any other authority on that point   But see Jason Pizer  Holding an Appointor Vicariously Liable for its Nominee Director s Wrongdoing    an Australian Roadmap    Vol   Company and Securities Law Journal   However  this is not the time to decide whether the decision in Coulthard is correct  Having regard to that decision and the dicta of King CJ referred to  it cannot be said on an application of this kind that the pleas in par   are untenable   Paragraphs   and   plead actual knowledge on the part of the two male second respondents  Paragraph   also pleads actual knowledge on the part of the two male respondents but from a different time  apparently  to that asserted in par    In any event  all three paragraphs      and   plead actual knowledge on the part of two of the four second respondents   Paragraph   pleads a form of constructive knowledge by reason of the failure of the second respondents to do any of the matters particularised in that paragraph  Each of pars       and   plead a form of constructive knowledge on the part of the two female second respondents  the knowledge it is said being imputed to them  It is not pleaded how or why the acts and conduct and knowledge of each of the second respondents is imputed to all of them  It may be assumed that each partner s act or conduct or knowledge is imputed to the other by reason of their partnership  That may not be important  More importantly  the knowledge of the female second respondents and any imputed knowledge obtained by all respondents by reason of the acts or omissions in par   cannot rise above constructive knowledge citedHospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The plea that the first respondent breached his duty of trust and confidence is a plea of breach of fiduciary duty  Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation   HCA         CLR   at      The plea in par   is that the second respondents knowingly participated in that breach of fiduciary duty  As I have said  the knowledge relied on is both actual and  in the alternative  constructive citedConsul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is not suggested that the second respondents owed any fiduciary duty to the applicant  There is no suggestion  nor could there be  that there was any fiduciary relationship between the second respondents and the applicant  The second respondents are said to be liable to the applicant because they knowingly participated in the first respondent s breach of fiduciary duty  A person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty is liable to account to the person to whom the fiduciary duty was owed where that person obtains a benefit by that participation  Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     It was not put that the second respondents could not be liable without actual knowledge of the first respondent s breach of fiduciary duty  It was accepted that a plea that the second respondents knowingly participated in a breach by the first respondent of his duty of confidence with the kind of knowledge pleaded in par   of the PFASC could be allowed to stand   In Consul

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section   of the Act is in the same terms as s  B of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Trade Practices Act   which was considered by the High Court in Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR    Section  B plays a similar role in the Trade Practices Act to that played by s   in the Act   A person will be accessorily liable to a contravention of a provision of the Trade Practices Act if the person does any of the matters prescribed in s  B  In Yorke v Lucas the High Court considered each of the paragraphs in s  B  In respect to paragraph  a  the Court observed that these words have been taken from the criminal law and that to be liable under s  B a  a party needed to have intentionally participated in the contravention  The Court said at      The nature of the prohibition imposed by s    is  however  governed by the terms in which it is created and the context in which it is found  Section  B   on the other hand  in speaking of aiding  abetting  counselling or procuring  makes use of an existing concept drawn from the criminal law and unless the context requires otherwise  there is every reason to suppose that it was intended to carry with it the settled meaning which it already bore  cf  Barker v  The Queen   HCA         C L R     Nor is there any reason to suppose that because the application of s   B may occur in conjunction with a provision such as s      which requires no intent  it must also be construed so as to dispense with intent as an element of aiding  abetting  counselling or procuring  In Giorgianni v  The Queen it was held that secondary participation required intent based upon knowledge  notwithstanding that the statutory provision creating the principal offence imposed strict liability   The High Court held that a person will only be guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting or counselling and procuring the commission of an offence if the person intentionally participates in it  Therefore  to form the requisite intent the person must have knowledge of the essential matters which go to make up the offence  It determined that the same knowledge should be required for a contravention of s  B of the Trade Practices Act    The majority then addressed s  B c  and said at      There can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention  citedRe HIH Insurance Ltd  In Liq      ACSR   In my opinion  s   of the Act would be construed in the same way as s  B of the Trade Practices Act   see Re HIH Insurance Ltd  In Liq      ACSR     It follows therefore that a party cannot be involved in a contravention of s   of the Act unless the party has actual knowledge of the elements of s    The elements that must be established for a contravention of s   are that the person referred to in s   was an officer or employee of the corporation  that he or she acquired information because he or she was an officer or employee  that the person made improper use of that information  that the person did so to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to the corporation   In my opinion  the plea that the second respondents had constructive knowledge of the matters contained in par   or the female second respondents had constructive knowledge as pleaded in pars       and   could not support a claim that the second respondents contravened s   by being involved in a contravention of s    Those pleas are untenable citedFox v H Wood  Harrow  Ltd     QB   In my opinion  the applicant should be required to give particulars of the facts and circumstances which existed after the first respondent was employed by the second respondents which should have put the second respondents on notice to make the inquiries or take the steps pleaded in par   Fox v H Wood  Harrow  Ltd     QB     As I have already mentioned  in a number of the paragraphs which follow it is said that the acts  conduct and knowledge of each of the second respondents is imputed to all of them  In my opinion  that plea requires particularisation  The applicant ought to particularise the facts and circumstances which allow it to be said that  as a consequence  the acts  conduct and knowledge of each of the second respondents is imputed to all of them   Lastly  as the applicant conceded  the applicant needs to give particulars of the loss or damage which the applicants says that he suffered by reason of the respondents  breaches
