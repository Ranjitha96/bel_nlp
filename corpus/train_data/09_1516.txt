Hu v Commonwealth Ombudsman   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlA substantial proportion of Mr Hu s written submissions concerned the alleged failure of his Honour to identify apparently forged documents provided to Mr Hu by Ms Moser of MARA  The first point to note is that it was not the task of the Federal Magistrate to investigate whether documentation provided by MARA to Mr Hu was forged by the migration agent  In the circumstances of this case it was the task of the Federal Magistrate to consider whether there were grounds for an order of review of the decision of the respondent for any of the reasons set out in s   of the ADJR Act  cf comments of Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         ALR   at    Mr Hu s submissions in relation to this ground of appeal are  in substance  an attack on the qualifications and professional standards of his Honour in failing to identify forgeries claimed to exist by Mr Hu  In this respect this ground of appeal is completely without merit citedAvon Downs Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlNonetheless secondly  Mr Hu submits that the respondent failed to take into account relevant considerations in making the decision not to investigate  This is potentially a ground for an order of review in terms of s  f  of the ADJR Act  In particular I note comments of Dixon J in Avon Downs Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR   at       But it is for the commissioner  not for me  to be satisfied of the state of the voting power at the end of the year of income  His decision  it is true  is not unexaminable  If he does not address himself to the question which the subsection formulates  if his conclusion is affected by some mistake of law  if he takes some extraneous reason into consideration or excludes from consideration some factor which should affect his determination  on any of these grounds his conclusion is liable to review       cf Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Applicant S    HCA

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR   at     Buck v Bavone   HCA         CLR   at    citedHouse v R   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFirst  on the basis that his Honour had discretion to order discovery in this case  no satisfactory case has been made to me warranting interference with the decision of his Honour in circumstances contemplated by Dixon  Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v R   HCA         CLR   at    Second  and in any event  Mr Hu has not established that the interests of the administration of justice would have been served by his Honour making an order allowing discovery pursuant to s    I accept the submission of the respondent that  in light of the fact that the first time Mr Hu raised the issue of discovery was at the hearing itself before his Honour  it would not have contributed to the  fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings  for his Honour to have ordered discovery at such a late stage  Ground   Failure by Federal Magistrate to identify apparent forged information in documents from filed affidavitcitedNAQR   Anor  No    v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlIn NAQR   Anor  No    v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FMCA   Driver FM took the view that there is a rebuttable presumption in proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court that discovery and interrogatories will not be permitted  consistent with Parliament s direction under s   of the Federal Magistrates Act that the Court should act informally and use streamlined procedures  at    In my view this accurately represents the position in respect of s   of the Federal Magistrates Act   I also consider however that s   of the Federal Magistrates Act vests Federal Magistrates with discretion to order discovery in the circumstances prescribed by the section  In my view the fifth ground of appeal cannot be substantiated for two reasons citedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR  http www
