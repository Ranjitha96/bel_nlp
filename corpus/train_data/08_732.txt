HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission brought these proceedings for injunctive orders under s   and other relief under s  C of the Act against Terania and ARE for contraventions by each of them of s   of the Act  and for costs  The Court may make such orders only if the alleged contraventions are made out  Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR     The parties are agreed upon the orders which are sought  and upon the facts upon which those orders are sought  They have presented a statement of agreed facts  and proposed orders  The statement of agreed facts includes reference to allegations in the application which are admitted  and to specified paragraphs of the amended statement of claim which are also admitted  Indeed  Terania and ARE by the proposed agreed orders seek to withdraw their defence   I am prepared to make findings on the foundation of that material  The following represents my findings of fact   Clearly  by the admission of facts contained in the agreed statement of facts  including by reference to allegations in the statement of claim which are admitted  it is within power for the Court to make the orders which are sought  Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR   at    In my view  having regard to the nature and the present status of Terania and ARE  and the fact that the parties have agreed upon the nature of the conduct engaged in  and its contravention of the Act  it is also appropriate for the Court in the public interest and to encourage agreed resolution of enforcement proceedings to make the orders which are sought  see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v

Institute of Western Australia Inc   FCA         ALR   appliedTrade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd   ATPR     I have had regard to the types of conduct which have been admitted and to the findings which I have made as to its character  It is appropriate in a matter such as this to have regard to all the conduct which has been alleged and acknowledged  Clearly  misleading representations as to price are highly likely to mislead consumers and constitute a significant contravention of s   of the Act  It is acknowledged that the was price was simply created by the respondents and had no proper foundation  Consumers were likely to have been mislead into believing that the goods in question had previously been offered for sale at the was price  so that the sale price represented a significant reduction from the normal retail price  That may induce consumers to buy those products when they would not otherwise do so  As O Loughlin J said in Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd   ATPR       where a clothing retailer was using dual priced tags   T he natural and probable consequence of a dual priced swing tag is that members of the buying public would assume that the garment had previously been offered for sale at the higher of the two prices and was now available at the lower price      It was conduct that preyed on the gullibility of the public   Indeed  such conduct may do more than prey on the gullibility of the public  Members of the public do not routinely know the normal retail price of particular goods  And retail price may depend on the quality of the particular goods  The quality of particular goods may also not be readily apparent to some members of the public  It is not merely the gullible who may regard a was price as a real indication of the normal retail price of particular products  at least as offered by and sold by that retailer   I am a little more troubled about the duration representations  However  in my view  their combination with the pricing tags was likely to mislead the public  It was likely to mislead the public  or at least some members of the public  into the belief that sale prices at which they may be able to procure the particular goods will end at a specific time and so induce purchasing at or by that specific time rather than making a purchasing decision after reflection  It may induce purchases within or by the specified time because the  sale  also misleadingly presented particular goods as being available at a price significantly reduced from that at which they were normally on offer so that they would not be on offer at that  sale  price after the imminent end of the sale   The clearance representations do not present so obvious a contravention of s   of the Act  even when taken together with the duration representations and the was price sale price representations discussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA

Competition Commission v  WD Systems Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It is clear that I have power to make the injunctive orders sought if I consider it in the public interest to do so  Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v  WD Systems Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   and    I have considered the proposed injunctions  They are clear  they relate to the conduct which I have found to have been engaged in in contravention of s   of the Act  and there is no feature of them which  in my view  makes it inappropriate to make those orders   Similarly  I have considered the proposed compliance program  I had previously raised some issues about its terms  but they have been addressed   I am therefore prepared to make the proposed consent orders  The proposed orders are in the nature of injunctive relief  restraining the respondents from engaging in conduct of the nature which they have admitted they have engaged in in the past and which has contravened s   of the Act  and for costs  I have been informed by the parties that since the hearing of submissions  both Terania and ARE have ceased trading and the assets of Terania have been sold  including the sale of the business name  Gouger Rugs  and  Barry Solomon s Gouger Rugs  its stock and various fittings and fixtures  Bookings of venues for scheduled sale events to be conducted by Terania and ARE have been cancelled  Consequently  although it is not now appropriate for Terania and ARE to undertake a trade practices compliance program  the proposed orders contemplate that in the event that they resume similar trading activities in the future  they should undertake a trade practices compliance program  I think that is appropriate  It is also intended that Mr Solomon will give an undertaking that he will in any event undertake a Trade Practices Compliance Program seminar relating to the provisions of Pt   of the Act  He is prepared to do so and the ACCC is prepared to accept that undertaking  I will note his undertaking
