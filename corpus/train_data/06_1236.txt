Sharma   FCA         FCR   and Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    The Authority observed that in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency   Branson J considered that only limited assistance was gained from categorising decisions as cancellation decisions or entitlements decisions  at    Her Honour considered that it was necessary to consider the nature of the decision involved  In that case  the Tribunal was to review a decision to vary the period of accreditation for an aged care provider  this decision did not fit readily into the cancellation entitlement dichotomy   Her Honour considered that  in the legislation before her  the fact that a decision could be made only after an audit report was obtained and only within   days of receipt of that report was important  However  her Honour also applied the reasoning of Davies J in Freeman in concluding that the decision was not part of an administrative continuum  Her Honour also observed at               In my view  the Tribunal would be undertaking a quite different process from that which the Principles required the accreditation body to undertake were it to review a decision made under s     by reference to factual material remote in time from the review audit report  In particular  I consider that on review of a decision made under s     it is not open to the approved provider to seek to undermine the significance of the review audit report  and the recommendations included in it  by calling evidence of improvements in its practice and procedure implemented after the date of the decision and in response to the review audit report and recommendations        I conclude that the Tribunal would not be addressing the same questions as the applicant was required to address if it were to determine whether  at the time of the Tribunal s decision  the decision of the applicant under s     of the Principles can be seen to be the correct or preferable decision  This is not to say that the Tribunal cannot receive evidence of facts that occurred after the date of the decision under review  However  to be relevant to the Tribunal s decision  that evidence must  in my view  bear on the merits of the decision as at the time that it was required to be made  appliedDrake v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     FLR  The first ground of appeal agitated in the Authority s written and oral submissions focused on the cancellation decision  It was common ground that in relation to the review of the decision to cancel the respondent s registration  the question for the Tribunal was whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision  Drake v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     FLR   at   per Bowen CJ and Deane J  that is  whether it was the correct or preferable decision to conclude that the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance  The primary issue raised by this ground was whether the Tribunal asked itself this question in relation to the correct point in time  The Authority submitted that the Tribunal did not consider whether  on   July   the date of the Authority s decision the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the respondent s registration  rather  the question which the Tribunal asked itself was whether  on   September   the date of the Tribunal s decision the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance appliedFreeman v Secretary  Department of Social Security     FCR  The Authority submitted that there is a clear line of authority that in cancellation cases  such as the present  a review Tribunal is required to have regard to the circumstances at the time of the decision and not those that followed it  Freeman v Secretary  Department of Social Security     FCR   Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health  Housing and Community Services     FCR   Nong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma   FCA         FCR   and Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    The respondent submitted that the  clear line of authority  referred to by the Authority  beginning with the decision of Davies J in Freeman   in support of the submission that the correct point in time is the time of the decision under review  is not directly relevant to the present question and can be distinguished because those authorities relate to different legislative provisions  The respondent analysed the reasoning of the Court in Freeman   That case  it was said  is commonly cited as authority for the proposition that the relevant point in time at which the Tribunal is to determine a person s entitlement will differ  depending upon whether the decision under review was a decision refusing to grant an entitlement or whether it was one cancelling an existing entitlement  Where the decision is to refuse an entitlement  the point in time is the date of the Tribunal s decision  and where the decision is to cancel an entitlement  the Tribunal is limited to considering the state of affairs as it existed on the date of the decision under review  The respondent submitted that critical to the Court s reasoning in Freeman was that in that case the Tribunal had affirmed the decision under review to cancel the applicant s pension  This meant that  no further matter  remained  for the Tribunal s consideration   at   and any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would only  revive  when a fresh application for a pension had been made  at      The respondent submitted that Freeman should not be taken as authority for any general principle that administrative decisions may be categorized either as  cancellation  decisions or  refusal  decisions  to which vastly different regimes of review are applicable  If it does  then it was respectfully submitted that it was wrong and should not be followed  It was submitted that any attempt to apply such a universal categorisation to  cancellations  and  refusals  merely distracts from the primary question  which is to identify the issues required under the particular legislation  The question here  according to the respondent  should therefore focus on whether s  f  itself  fixes a point in time   The respondent submitted that there is nothing in s  f  of the Act to suggest that the point in time for the determination of the fitness and integrity issue is to be limited to the date of the Authority s decision  and that the Tribunal is not entitled to take account of developments which have occurred up until the date of the Tribunal s decision  The respondent said   Indeed  a consideration of the provision suggests that the point in time should be the situation as it has developed by the time of the Tribunal s decision  The respondent pointed out that the present case was  of course  factually different from Freeman  in that here the Tribunal set aside the Authority s decision to cancel the respondent s registration and substituted it with a decision to caution the respondent subject to conditions  whereas in Freeman the Tribunal had affirmed the decision to cancel the applicant s pension  so that  no further matter  remained  for the Tribunal s consideration    In Freeman  therefore  any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would  revive  only when a fresh application for a pension had been made  Here the decision had been set aside ab initio   so that the parties were placed in the position that they would have occupied had the decision never been made  so that the respondent had the benefit of the extant decision granting him registration  See Secretary  Department of Social Security v O Connell     FCR        The Tribunal therefore remained a part of the  continuum  of the administrative decision making process  and there was no impediment to it determining what were the appropriate orders to be made  as at the date of the Tribunal s decision  The respondent submitted that the only specific complaint made by the Authority as to  irrelevant  evidence taken into account by the Tribunal  related to the respondent s  current practice  and his  current success rate   When considered in the context of all the evidence before the Tribunal  both of these pieces of evidence were relevant either because they related to events that occurred before the cancellation decision  or they were after acquired evidence  The respondent submitted that  on any view of s  f    the Tribunal was therefore entitled to take account of the evidence referred to as the respondent s  current practice  and his  current success rate  in relation to the cancellation decision  In addition  the respondent submitted that whether or not the Tribunal was entitled to take the after acquired evidence into account in relation to the cancellation decision  it was undoubtedly required to take it into account in relation to the suspension decision and the two refusal decisions  On the Authority s case and the authority of Freeman   the point in time for those decisions would have been the date of the Tribunal s decision  Given that the Tribunal gave a joint decision on all four decisions under review  it was not possible for the Authority to establish with any degree of probability that the evidence of the respondent s  current practice  and his  current success rate  was necessarily taken into account in relation to the cancellation decision  The respondent noted that at no time during the Tribunal s hearing did the Authority object to the reception of the evidence relating to respondent s  current practice  and his  current success rate   It was put that this may be relevant to the issue of costs should the Authority succeed in this appeal  The Authority submitted that in Freeman the issue for determination by the Tribunal was whether the decision to cancel on the date of the original cancellation was the correct or preferable decision  not whether the applicant was entitled to a benefit at the time of the Tribunal s decision  The Authority submitted that that is the same in this case  The question for the Tribunal was whether its cancellation decision in July   was the correct or preferable decision  not whether the respondent might be eligible to be registered in September    In Freeman   Davies J indicated that it is important to have regard to the nature of the decision  The distinction his Honour saw as critical was between  a decision to refuse to grant a pension or benefit where there was an ongoing entitlement  which can be seen as part of a continuum  and a decision to cancel a pension made on a particular date  A decision of this kind has no ongoing nature  once made it is spent  Davies J noted that  under the Social Security Act    Cth  once a benefit is cancelled it may only be paid again following a fresh application  That is also the position in the present legislative context  Where a migration agent has had his registration cancelled  he would need to apply for registration afresh and cannot make such an application for five years  s    In this sense  the present case is even stronger than that considered by Davies J in Freeman   Davies J noted that a further distinction between entitlement decisions and cancellation decisions is that in the former case but not the latter the Tribunal can decide entitlement throughout the relevant continuum up to its decision  This is not possible in cancellation cases because if the cancellation decision was correct or preferable  there is no further step  That is also the position here  and probably in all cancellation cases   The Authority noted that the respondent had sought to distinguish this case on the basis that the legislation is different  However  the Authority argued  no material difference was identified  The only difference is the one noted above and it tends to show that this case is even more clear cut than that in Freeman   It was also observed that the power to cancel pensions in the Social Security Act was not restricted to being exercised at some point in time  This  it was said  was not part of Davies J s analysis  contrary to the respondent s submissions  The Authority noted that the Full Court in Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health  Housing and Community Affairs approved the analysis of Davies J in Freeman  at      In that case  the legislation tied the primary decision maker to a small period of time after certain rule changes were notified  The Court found that the Tribunal faced the same question as the primary decision maker  which required it to look at the time the original decision should have been made  The legislation in that case is different from that in the present  However  the Authority submitted  the core principle is that the Tribunal must answer the same question as was answered by the primary decision maker  For the reasons given by Davies J in Freeman   in a cancellation case  that involves whether the decision to cancel on the actual date of the cancellation was the correct or preferable decision  The Authority observed that this analysis was also endorsed and applied by Weinberg J in Sharma at         and  in the context of review of a decision to cancel a visa under the Act  by Katz J in Nong  albeit through reference to Weinberg J in Sharma   who applied Freeman   at           As I understood the submission  at least in the form in which it appeared in Mr Nong s written outline of submissions filed in advance of the hearing before me  it was that the MRT had erred in not concluding that  on   January   the date of its decision  Mr Nong was in compliance with condition          That submission may be dealt with quite briefly        The MRT was not concerned  in making its decision  with the issue whether Mr Nong was or was not in compliance with condition   on   January   the date of its own decision  Rather  it was concerned with the issue whether Mr Nong had or had not been in compliance with condition   on   March   the date of the delegate s decision  see  for example  the discussion of the nature of the review function of the MRT s predecessor in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma   FCA         FCR   at            Weinberg J    Emphasis added  The Authority observed that in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency   Branson J considered that only limited assistance was gained from categorising decisions as cancellation decisions or entitlements decisions  at    Her Honour considered that it was necessary to consider the nature of the decision involved  In that case  the Tribunal was to review a decision to vary the period of accreditation for an aged care provider  this decision did not fit readily into the cancellation entitlement dichotomy   Her Honour considered that  in the legislation before her  the fact that a decision could be made only after an audit report was obtained and only within   days of receipt of that report was important  However  her Honour also applied the reasoning of Davies J in Freeman in concluding that the decision was not part of an administrative continuum  Her Honour also observed at               In my view  the Tribunal would be undertaking a quite different process from that which the Principles required the accreditation body to undertake were it to review a decision made under s     by reference to factual material remote in time from the review audit report  In particular  I consider that on review of a decision made under s     it is not open to the approved provider to seek to undermine the significance of the review audit report  and the recommendations included in it  by calling evidence of improvements in its practice and procedure implemented after the date of the decision and in response to the review audit report and recommendations        I conclude that the Tribunal would not be addressing the same questions as the applicant was required to address if it were to determine whether  at the time of the Tribunal s decision  the decision of the applicant under s     of the Principles can be seen to be the correct or preferable decision  This is not to say that the Tribunal cannot receive evidence of facts that occurred after the date of the decision under review  However  to be relevant to the Tribunal s decision  that evidence must  in my view  bear on the merits of the decision as at the time that it was required to be made  In summary  the Authority submitted  by way of reply  that        Applying the principles stated in Freeman   the review of a decision to cancel a migration agent s registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date      Where a decision is made to cancel  say because an agent does not have the necessary ambit of knowledge of migration procedures at the time of the decision  as shown by a track record of failings in this regard  a review applicant cannot show that that was not the correct or preferable decision by acquiring the relevant knowledge thereafter  If the person has become eligible  he or she may then be able to apply for registration afresh      Similarly  where a decision is made to cancel because of massive and serious violations of the Code of Conduct  it would be absurd if a review applicant could seek to rely upon compliance with the Code after the date of the decision  Compliance achieved by enforcement proceedings is not what the legislation is designed to achieve  Agents are required to comply with the legislation when registered      For these reasons and the reasons outlined above  this Court should follow Freeman and the cases that have applied it and conclude that the question before the Tribunal  in relation to the cancellation decision  was whether the decision to cancel on   July   was the correct or preferable decision having regard to the circumstances pertaining up to that time      The respondent argued that it would be against the policy of the Act if the Tribunal were not permitted to have regard to events following the cancellation decision  He suggests there is no reason why the Tribunal should not find that it has become satisfied of s  e  if an agent becomes bankrupt during the review processes  The Authority says that this reasoning is flawed and not necessary  A later bankruptcy does not indicate that any earlier decision to cancel because of lack of integrity was the correct or preferable decision  It is irrelevant to that question  or without more would be   The Authority could  of course  cancel the registration afresh on the basis of the bankruptcy when it becomes aware that that has happened  A person whose registration was wrongfully cancelled should not have it affirmed simply because a reason to cancel it subsequently arises  There is also a fresh power to cancel when a proper reason arises  Likewise  a person whose cancellation was correct or preferable should not be able to avoid that proper consequence because of actions taken after the decision to rectify perceived deficiencies      Contrary to the respondent s submission  no part of the Authority s argument requires the notion of fitness or character to be narrowly construed  However  success rates in late   and   simply have no bearing on the respondent s fitness before that time  nor does any absence of subsequent breaches of the Code      It may be accepted that evidence of  character  after the date of the decision could be relevant because  character  has been held to involve the enduring moral qualities of a person  So  for example  evidence that a person has lied or not been frank in their evidence after the date of the decision would be relevant not directly as breaches of a rule requiring honesty but as an indicia of a person s enduring moral qualities  An inference would be available that an adult prepared to lie to or mislead the Tribunal  or just not be frank  at its hearing had the same moral qualities at the time of the decision  However  this reasoning does not mean that evidence relating to every criteria post the cancellation decision is relevant  For example  evidence that an agent has knowledge in   simply does not show that he had that knowledge in        The respondent s reliance upon Peko Wallsend is misconceived  The Authority does not say that the Tribunal may not have regard to the most up to date evidence at hand  However  it has to be evidence that is relevant to the question at hand  the position in July        Contrary to the respondent s submission  the absence of a time limit for the making of a decision to cancel does not have the result that the Tribunal is required to make its decision on the basis of all evidence up to the time of its decision  Freeman   Nong       The respondent seeks to get some assistance from extrinsic materials  It is said that his construction is consistent with the object stated in the passage quoted  However  without conceding that this is a proper use of extrinsic materials  it may be answered by noting that the Authority s construction is also consistent with that object      Contrary to the respondent s submission  it would not be inimical to the achievement of the objects of the provisions if the Tribunal could not have regard to adverse developments that happened after the making of the decision under review  The Authority would be having regard to such conduct and is ideally placed to take appropriate action even if a review is pending in relation to an earlier decision  indeed this happened in this very case  when the respondent s registration was suspended while the cancellation review was pending       It would  however  be inimical to the achievement of the objects if agents who have been cancelled for failing to comply with the Code of Conduct or failing to maintain necessary knowledge can avoid that legislated consequence by relying upon subsequent improved conduct and subsequent compliance  A system of this kind is less likely to be effective in ensuring that agents comply at all times if there is a perception that  the consequences of  breaches can be avoided      The respondent s submissions at   supra misconceive Davies J s reasons in Freeman   They did not turn upon the fact that the Tribunal had affirmed the cancellation decision but upon the nature of the decision under review  The respondent s argument is some kind of bootstraps argument  The Tribunal s decision is being challenged because it failed to appreciate the nature of its task  That task does not have a different nature according to the conclusion it reaches at the end of the task      The respondent submitted that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered  as at September   would have been available if it had asked itself the correct question  as at July    This is said to support a futility argument  This Court should not accept the proposition that the Tribunal s error  it is implicitly admitted by the respondent that it did answer the question as at September   and  on the Authority s submissions as to law this would be an error of law  could not have made a difference      First  some of the evidence was not relevant to   July          a   Is this form of file note taking     does this represent approximately what your current practice would be with taking files notes    Yes         AB    b   Is that representative of your current practice in relation to client agreements   AB    c   Mr Shi  do you now keep copies or is it your practice to keep copies of letters on file to your clients  Yes  yes    AB        d  The evidence of his success rate from the beginning of   until August   presented in a form that did not disclose that rate as at July     AB                       In any event  even if the evidence were all relevant it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were asked  The Court should remit the matter to the Tribunal if it finds that the Tribunal misunderstood its task      As the Tribunal dealt with all four review decisions together  the Court cannot be sure that the Tribunal did not have regard to the later evidence only in relation to the decisions of later dates  The point is  however  that the Tribunal dealt with them all together when it needed to separate the decision according to their nature and the evidence that was relevant to each  The fact that it did not do this proves the Authority s case rather than the reverse  After having considered the relevant provisions of the Act  the authorities to which I was referred and the respective submissions of the parties  I have concluded that the  clear line of authority  beginning with the decision of Davies J in Freeman   upon which the Authority relies  does govern the position in relation to the cancellation decision and that the question which the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether  on   July   the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the respondent s registration  in other words  the question which the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether  as at that date  the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance  I am of the view that the Tribunal did not ask itself this question  Rather  it asked itself whether  at the time of its decision  the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance  I am impelled to the view that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question by reference to the Tribunal s   September   reasons  in particular at       and   See the particular passages at   supra referred toHospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health  Housing and Community Affairs     FCR  The Authority submitted that there is a clear line of authority that in cancellation cases  such as the present  a review Tribunal is required to have regard to the circumstances at the time of the decision and not those that followed it  Freeman v Secretary  Department of Social Security     FCR   Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v

 FCA         FCR   and Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    The Authority noted that the Full Court in Hospital Benefit Fund of WA v Minister for Health  Housing and Community Affairs approved the analysis of Davies J in Freeman  at      In that case  the legislation tied the primary decision maker to a small period of time after certain rule changes were notified  The Court found that the Tribunal faced the same question as the primary decision maker  which required it to look at the time the original decision should have been made  The legislation in that case is different from that in the present  However  the Authority submitted  the core principle is that the Tribunal must answer the same question as was answered

correct or preferable decision appliedLu v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe respondent submitted that  notwithstanding these findings  the Court should exercise its discretion to decline to grant the appeal because it would be futile to remit the matter for re determination  The basis for this submission was that all of the matters taken into account by the Tribunal were open for it to consider  either because they pre dated the decision under review or because they were after acquired evidence  As such  any technical error in identifying the correct point in time would not have materially affected the Tribunal s decision  Lu v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     per Sackville J  I cannot agree with this submission  First  I do not accept that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered  as at September   would have been available if it had asked the correct question  as at July    Some of the evidence was not relevant to   July    Examples of that are to be found at   supra  In any event  as the Authority submitted   supra  even if the evidence was all relevant  it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were asked  Second  as Sackville J observed in Lu  at   the correct approach is that stated in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission   HCA         CLR   at   and adopted in Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   the test is whether the applicant could have been deprived of the possibility of a successful outcome by the decision maker s failure to observe the requirements of the statute   If so  the jurisdictional error could have had a bearing on the outcome and the applicant is not to be denied relief on the basis that the error was insignificant     The question is not whether the decision maker would probably have realised the same result even if the     consideration had  not  been taken into account  referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSuch an interpretation was  it was submitted  no more than an application of the  general principle  referred to in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J  Gibbs CJ and Dawson J agreeing  that           an administrative decision maker is required to make his decision on the basis of material available to him at the time the decision is made      which  is itself a reflection of the fact that there may be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of nearly every statute conferring power to make an administrative decision an implication that the decision is to be made on the basis of the most current material available to the decision maker  As was said by Mason J in Peko Wallsend  at        It would be a strange result indeed to hold that the      decision maker  is entitled to ignore material of which he has actual or constructive knowledge and which may have a direct bearing on the justice of      the case    and to proceed instead on the basis of material that may be incomplete  inaccurate or misleading  It was further submitted that an interpretation of s  f  which allows for the Tribunal to consider information up until the time of its decision is also consistent with the objects and purpose of the scheme for registration of migration agents  The Minister s Second Reading Speech described the scheme as  a registration scheme for migration agents designed to improve standards of professional conduct and quality of service  reflecting           the Government s concern over the level and nature of complaints made against incompetent or unscrupulous agents  complaints which would be familiar to many members of this chamber  It also recognises the fact that many of those who are likely to seek the assistance of agents are among the most vulnerable in our society  sometimes having a poor grasp of English  fear of authority or meagre financial resources    G  Hand  Second Reading  Migration Amendment Bill  No      House of Representatives Hansard    May   p     The object of the disciplinary provisions in Part     it was submitted  is to protect the public and to maintain proper standards in the migration profession rather than to take action by way of punishment  It would be inimical to this if the Tribunal was prevented from considering relevant information going to the issue of fitness to practice because the information had arisen after the decision under review  There was nothing  the respondent submitted  to suggest that the scheme would be promoted by restricting the Tribunal s consideration of an agent s integrity and fitness to practise to the earlier date of the decision under review  and to ignore the agent s current integrity and fitness to practise  In summary  the Authority submitted  by way of reply  that        Applying the principles stated in Freeman   the review of a decision to cancel a migration agent s registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date      Where a decision is made to cancel  say because an agent does not have the necessary ambit of knowledge of migration procedures at the time of the decision  as shown by a track record of failings in this regard  a review applicant cannot show that that was not the correct or preferable decision by acquiring the relevant knowledge thereafter  If the person has become eligible  he or she may then be able to apply for registration afresh      Similarly  where a decision is made to cancel because of massive and serious violations of the Code of Conduct  it would be absurd if a review applicant could seek to rely upon compliance with the Code after the date of the decision  Compliance achieved by enforcement proceedings is not what the legislation is designed to achieve  Agents are required to comply with the legislation when registered      For these reasons and the reasons outlined above  this Court should follow Freeman and the cases that have applied it and conclude that the question before the Tribunal  in relation to the cancellation decision  was whether the decision to cancel on   July   was the correct or preferable decision having regard to the circumstances pertaining up to that time      The respondent argued that it would be against the policy of the Act if the Tribunal were not permitted to have regard to events following the cancellation decision  He suggests there is no reason why the Tribunal should not find that it has become

decision to cancel because of lack of integrity was the correct or preferable decision  It is irrelevant to that question  or without more would be   The Authority could  of course  cancel the registration afresh on the basis of the bankruptcy when it becomes aware that that has happened  A person whose registration was wrongfully cancelled should not have it affirmed simply because a reason to cancel it subsequently arises  There is also a fresh power to cancel when a proper reason arises  Likewise  a person whose cancellation was correct or preferable should not be able to avoid that proper consequence because of actions taken after the decision to rectify perceived deficiencies      Contrary to the respondent s submission  no part of the Authority s argument requires the notion of fitness or character to be narrowly construed  However  success rates in late   and   simply have no bearing on the respondent s fitness before that time  nor does any absence of subsequent breaches of the Code      It may be accepted that evidence of  character  after the date of the decision could be relevant because  character  has been held to involve the enduring moral qualities of a person  So  for example  evidence that a person has lied or not been frank in their evidence after the date of the decision would be relevant not directly as breaches of a rule requiring honesty but as an indicia of a person s enduring moral qualities  An inference would be available that an adult prepared to lie to or mislead the Tribunal  or just not be frank  at its hearing had the same moral

conceding that this is a proper use of extrinsic materials  it may be answered by noting that the Authority s construction is also consistent with that object      Contrary to the respondent s

under review  The Authority would be having regard to such conduct and is ideally placed to take appropriate action even if a review is pending in relation to an earlier decision  indeed this happened in this very case  when the respondent s registration was suspended while the cancellation review was pending       It would  however  be inimical to the achievement of the objects if agents who have been cancelled for failing to comply with the Code of Conduct or failing to maintain necessary knowledge can avoid that legislated consequence by relying upon subsequent improved conduct and subsequent compliance  A system of this kind is less likely to be effective in ensuring that agents comply at all times if there is a perception that  the consequences of  breaches can be avoided      The respondent s submissions at   supra misconceive Davies J s reasons in Freeman   They did not turn upon the fact that the Tribunal had affirmed the cancellation decision but upon the nature of the decision under review  The respondent s argument is some kind of bootstraps argument  The Tribunal s decision is being challenged because it failed to appreciate the nature of its task  That task does not have a different nature according to the conclusion it reaches at the end of the task      The respondent submitted that all the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal in addressing the question it answered  as at September   would have been available if it had asked itself the correct question  as at July    This is said to support a futility argument  This Court should not accept the proposition that the Tribunal s error  it is implicitly admitted by the respondent that it did answer the question as at September   and  on the Authority s submissions as to law this would be an error of law  could not have made a difference      First  some of the evidence was not relevant to   July          a   Is this form of file note taking     does this represent approximately what your

should remit the matter to the Tribunal if it finds that the Tribunal misunderstood its task      As the Tribunal dealt with all four review decisions together  the Court cannot be sure that the Tribunal did not have regard to the later evidence only in relation to the decisions of later dates  The point is  however  that the Tribunal dealt with them all together when it needed to separate the decision according to their nature and the evidence that was relevant to each  The fact that it did not do this proves the Authority s case rather than the reverse  Noting the respondent s submission that the Authority was seeking something in the nature of merits review in its second ground  the Authority submitted that this was not the case because  here  the facts have been fully found  See Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ  Hope v Bathurst City Council   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason J  The Authority s case was that it was not open on the facts found by the Tribunal  see the Authority s principal submissions at   supra  to conclude otherwise than that the respondent was not a fit and proper person  Another way of identifying the same error was said to be highlighted by the respondent s submissions  The respondent was made subject to a supervisory obligation during the stay orders  This required him not to do protection visa work and to be supervised by another migration agent  This order is appropriate in circumstances where the Authority considered that the person is not fit and should be cancelled or suspended but a stay is put in place while the correctness of that decision is being reviewed  If however the Authority s decision to cancel or suspend was not correct  this must be because the person was fit and proper  On this conclusion  it was argued  no further supervision or restrictions would be appropriate  The Authority submitted that the very fact that the Tribunal considered that the public interest required the respondent to be supervised and to have his areas of work limited reveals that the Tribunal did not yet think he was fit and proper to be a migration agent  That is how the Court can readily conclude that the Tribunal has erred in its application of the law to the facts in this case  The Authority then turned to address the respondent s submission that the Act and the Code envisage that an agent who is not competent in certain areas of practice as a migration agent can nevertheless be fit to be an agent  Support for that proposition was said to be found in cl     and     of the Code  The Authority submitted that neither of those aspects of the Code accept a lack of competence  It envisages that agents may choose not regularly to practice in certain areas  which may lead an agent to be  unsure  of what is appropriate  Rather than spend time and money looking this up  an agent can refer the matter to another who does work regularly in the field  This does not warrant the notion that migration agents can be fit and proper if they cannot be trusted or are otherwise unable to work in certain areas of practice referred toMinister for Immigration and

nature of the review function of the MRT s predecessor in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sharma   FCA         FCR   at            Weinberg J    Emphasis added  In summary  the Authority submitted  by way of reply  that        Applying the principles stated in Freeman   the review of a decision to cancel a migration agent s registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date      Where a decision is made to cancel  say because an agent does not have the necessary ambit of knowledge of migration procedures at the time of the decision  as shown by a track record of failings in this regard  a review applicant cannot show that that was not the correct or preferable decision by acquiring the relevant knowledge thereafter  If the person has become eligible  he or she may then be able to apply for registration afresh      Similarly  where a decision is made to cancel because of massive and serious violations of the Code of Conduct  it would be absurd if a review applicant could seek to rely upon compliance with the Code after the date of the decision  Compliance achieved by enforcement proceedings is not what the legislation is designed to achieve  Agents are required to comply with the legislation when registered      For these reasons and the reasons outlined above  this Court should follow Freeman and the cases that have applied it and conclude that the question before the Tribunal  in relation to the cancellation decision  was whether the decision to cancel on   July   was the correct or preferable decision having regard to the circumstances pertaining up to that time      The respondent argued that it would be against the policy of the Act if the Tribunal were not permitted to have regard to events following the cancellation decision  He suggests there is no reason why the Tribunal should not find that it has become satisfied of s  e  if an agent becomes bankrupt during the review processes  The Authority says that this reasoning is flawed and not necessary  A later bankruptcy does not indicate that any earlier decision to cancel because of lack of integrity was the correct or preferable decision  It is irrelevant to that question  or without more would be   The Authority could  of course  cancel the registration afresh on the basis of the bankruptcy when it becomes aware that that has happened  A person whose registration was wrongfully cancelled should not have it affirmed simply because a reason to cancel it subsequently arises  There is also a fresh power to cancel when a proper reason arises  Likewise  a person whose cancellation was correct or preferable should not be able to avoid that proper consequence because of actions taken after the decision to rectify perceived deficiencies      Contrary to the respondent s submission  no part of the Authority s argument requires the notion of fitness or character to be narrowly construed  However  success rates in late   and   simply have no bearing on the respondent s fitness before that time  nor does any absence of subsequent breaches of the Code      It may be accepted that evidence of  character  after the date of the decision could be relevant because  character  has been held to involve the enduring moral qualities of a person  So  for example  evidence that a person has lied or not been frank in their evidence after the date of the decision would be relevant not directly as breaches of a rule requiring honesty but as an indicia of a person s enduring moral qualities  An inference would be available that an adult prepared to lie to or mislead the Tribunal  or just not be frank  at its hearing had the same moral qualities at the time of the decision  However  this reasoning does not mean that evidence relating to every criteria post the cancellation decision is relevant  For example  evidence that an agent has knowledge in   simply does not show that he had that knowledge in        The respondent s reliance upon Peko Wallsend is misconceived  The Authority does not say that the Tribunal may not have regard to the most up to date evidence at hand  However  it has to be evidence that is relevant to the question at hand  the position in July        Contrary to the respondent s submission  the absence of a time limit for the making of a decision to cancel does not have the result that the Tribunal is required to make its decision on the basis of all evidence up to the time of its decision  Freeman   Nong       The respondent seeks to get some assistance from extrinsic materials  It is said that his construction is consistent with the object stated in the passage quoted  However  without conceding that this is a proper use of extrinsic materials  it may be answered by noting that the Authority s construction is also consistent with that object      Contrary to the respondent s submission  it would not be

The Migration Institute of Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe Tribunal granted stays in respect of each of the Authority s decisions the subject of challenge  although the first refusal decision was only stayed by consent after the matter had been remitted from this Court to the Tribunal in Shi v The Migration Institute of Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR   and the cancellation decision was stayed subject to conditions that the respondent be supervised by another migration agent and that he undertake not to engage in any business relating to protection visas  The Tribunal split its decision making process  first by making findings of fact on the respondent s alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct prescribed by s   of the Act finding   such breaches  of which   related to protection visa cases  the   April   findings  and then  after receiving submissions on those findings  publishing its decision and reasons for decision on   September   making findings on whether the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance pursuant to s  f  of the Act  the   September   reasons   The Tribunal made the following findings of fact in the   April   findings        The Tribunal found that the respondent did not  encourage   in the sense of  incite  any visa applicant to lodge a protection visa application  It was  therefore  unnecessary to decide whether the applications made were  grossly unfounded  so as to breach cl     of the Code as it stood prior to   July    at    However  it found that the respondent s handling of these applications was relevant to other alleged breaches of the Code and to a determination pursuant to s  f       The respondent was unaware of the requirement in cl     of the Code  introduced in   that he obtain written acknowledgement of advice from his client where his advice had been that the visa application was grossly unfounded but the client  nevertheless  wished to lodge the application  at    The Tribunal characterised this as a  very serious breach  of cl     of the Code  concerning a sound working knowledge of the Act and Regulations  and a consequential breach of cl     of the Code  concerning a requirement to act in accordance with the law and competently and diligently   at       The respondent did not have a sound working knowledge of the Act and Regulations and was not diligent if he was unaware of provisions of the Code so long after they came into force  until they were brought to his attention in the course of investigations as to whether his registration should be cancelled in    at       The respondent conceded that a number of the applications he had lodged had no hope of success  at     and    The Tribunal found that he had made one application that was grossly unfounded  at       The Tribunal found that the respondent had on many occasions breached cl     of the Code  which requires file notes to be taken of all substantive and material communications between client and agent  at                   and    The Tribunal considered the massive failure in this regard to be serious  at    The respondent ultimately conceded that he had a systemic problem with keeping adequate file notes and that he had undoubtedly breached cl      at       The Tribunal noted instances where the respondent altered his evidence as he became aware of material which contradicted what he had previously said  at       and       The Tribunal also criticised aspects of the respondent s evidence as being speculative and unconvincing explanations proffered when he simply did not know what had occurred in relation to particular clients  at           and    It also found many instances where the respondent s evidence was designed to excuse his poor handling of an application or file keeping  at       and    These and other defects led to aspects of his evidence not being accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of his credit  at           and       Ultimately  the Tribunal  did not find Mr Shi a reliable witness  His evidence changed on numerous occasions so as to reduce his responsibility for various breaches of the Code or other failures within his practice   at       The Tribunal found that the respondent had failed to sufficiently address matters required by visa applications  which constituted a breach of cl     and      at       and    The Tribunal also noted that the respondent s applications under s   were defective in that they did not address the relevant criteria  which the Tribunal found as relevant to his fitness to be a migration agent  at       The Tribunal was critical of the respondent s approach that it was his job to state the facts and for the Department to link the facts to the law  It considered that it was part of his job to know the relevant criteria  at       The Tribunal found that the respondent had repeatedly breached cl     of the Code by failing to keep his clients informed of the progress of their matters and outcomes in writing  at         and       The Tribunal found that the respondent had systemically failed to comply with Part   of the Code  which required documentation of amounts of money paid  at   and    Moreover  it found that he had chosen not to comply with trust arrangements to save his own compliance costs  at       The Tribunal set out evidence about the respondent s inadequate supervision of his staff in relation to protection visa applications  He allowed cutting and pasting of personal claims  at         and    This constituted breaches of cl     and     of the Code  at       The respondent conceded and the Tribunal found that the respondent had repeatedly breached cl     of the Code  which required agents to obtain written acceptance of the terms of service as soon as possible after receiving instructions  at    The Tribunal further found that his failure to comply with this requirement  reinforce ed   its  view that he  had  paid scant attention to the Code at all  He ran his business in his own way  If a practice satisfied the Code  that was coincidental rather than intentional   at       The respondent conceded that his lodging review applications for three clients in the Tribunal  which had no jurisdiction in relation to the relevant decision  constituted breaches of cl    b         a iii  and cl     of the Code  at       The Tribunal noted an instance where the respondent did not appreciate the appropriate procedure  What he had done was inappropriate  He had no idea what needed to be done  at    Because what the respondent had done did not amount to the making of an  application  it did not breach the Code but it was still relevant to his fitness  The Tribunal found that this case revealed that the respondent  did not possess a sound knowledge of the Act and Regulations as they related to the circumstances of his client   at    In the   September   reasons the Tribunal concluded that it was not satisfied that the respondent was not a person of integrity or was not otherwise a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance  at    The Tribunal made orders setting aside the four decisions under review  at      The cancellation decision was substituted with a decision that the respondent be issued with a caution pursuant to s  c    to be lifted after three years provided that the respondent be supervised and not provide immigration assistance with respect to protection visas  see s  A   The first refusal decision was substituted with a decision that the respondent s repeat registration be approved  The suspension decision was substituted with a decision that the respondent s registration not be suspended  The second refusal decision was substituted with a decision to renew the respondent s repeat registration  The Tribunal s reasons for these decisions may be summarised as follows        The Tribunal noted the extent and nature of the respondent s breaches of the Code  at   in particular         i  that   of the alleged   breaches had been upheld by the Tribunal  and   ii  that   of the   sustained breaches related to protection visa cases during the period from September   to October   and the other four related to subclass   visa applications filed between October   and January            The Tribunal accepted the respondent s argument that there was no proven disadvantage to any of the respondent s clients because of his conduct  at       The breaches found by the Tribunal  considered as a whole  indicate that the respondent did not appreciate his obligation to know what the Code required and to comply with its terms as they existed from time to time  at   and that if his practice satisfied the requirements of the Code  that was coincidental rather than intentional  at       The Tribunal noted the respondent s contention that   per cent of the breaches found related to protection visas  an area in which he had ceased to practise  and occurred over four years ago  at       The Tribunal noted the respondent s argument that his  current practice  was most relevant when considering issues of public protection and maintenance of proper standards  The Tribunal characterised this factor as a relevant consideration  at         The respondent also sought to rely upon his  current success rate  a factor which the Tribunal accepted to be relevant  at       The Tribunal found that  in relation to his making s   and review applications in the Tribunal  the respondent s actions reflected a lack of understanding of the relevant law and  more importantly  a lack of judgment on his part   He seemed to just keep doing something to seek review of a decision  whether or not there was any real chance of success   at       The Tribunal gave some weight to its adverse findings on the respondent s credit  at       As mentioned above  having considered all the evidence  the Tribunal was not satisfied that the respondent was not a person of integrity or otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance within the meaning of s  f   at       The Tribunal took into account that the respondent had had a supervising migration agent for over two years who was a knowledgeable and experienced migration agent and who held the respondent in high regard  It also gave weight to the fact that there had been no breaches since the cancellation decision was made and the respondent s rate of success had been very high in recent years  at       The Tribunal concluded that cancellation was not appropriate in relation to the respondent s breaches of the Code  s  h   It considered that the appropriate decision was to issue a caution subject to
