SZLXP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA a htmlFollowing the invitation to the appellant under s  A in relation to the information from DFAT and the appellant s response  the Tribunal placed no reliance upon any information received from DFAT that was not put to the appellant in that invitation  Accordingly  there was no breach of s  A  The High Court s decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI These reasons were written prior to the decision of the High Court  handed down this morning  to allow the appeal in SZKTI   Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI   HCA    The High Court there accepted  at   the Minister s submissions  at     that s   does not operate to limit the general facultative power given by s   in aid of the inquisitorial functions of the Tribunal  The limitation on that general power is that the Tribunal   must have regard   to that information in making its decision  at    Procedural fairness is assured by  inter alia   the requirements of s  A  The High Court concluded  at   that the procedural restrictions on the specific power to issue an invitation to give additional information do not qualify the Tribunal s general power in s   to   get any information that it considers relevant    It follows that the method adopted by the Tribunal to obtain the information did not give rise to jurisdictional error  I see no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal or error on the part of the Federal Magistrate citedRe Ruddock  Ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs to the appellant s complaints about the Tribunal s use of independent country information  his Honour observed at   that  if there was particular information which the appellant considered relevant  it was up to him to bring that material to the Tribunal s attention  As his Honour observed  the Tribunal is not obliged to make the appellant s case for him   Re Ruddock  Ex parte Applicant S    HCA         ALR   at     citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     CLR  Federal Magistrate Scarlett concluded that the Tribunal had also complied with s   of the Act and with the procedures otherwise required by the Act and the Regulations  His Honour noted that the credibility of the appellant s claims  which had been an issue before the delegate  was also a significant factor in the Tribunal hearing and that   there was no issue that would have taken the  appellant  by surprise    In that respect also  his Honour found compliance with s   of the Act   SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   citedSZJHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  Otherwise  the grounds of the application were  his Honour said  seeking merits review or complaints as to the use of independent country information  the use of which was a matter for the Tribunal   SZJHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   per Tamberlin J   The ground of bias was not  his Honour said  made out citedSZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR  The s  A letter sent to the appellant following receipt of the response from DFAT did not fail adequately to set out clear particulars of the information obtained or fail to ensure  as far as reasonably practicable  that the appellant understood why it was relevant to the review  cf  SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         FCR   referred toSZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR  As to s  B  Scarlett FM considered that the request to DFAT about the authenticity of the document purportedly from the Supreme Court of Bangladesh should be distinguished from SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         FCR   and that there was no prejudice to the appellant  who had been given the opportunity to comment on the response from DFAT in accordance with s  A of the Act  His Honour did not explicitly find that s   had not been engaged by the request to DFAT about the authenticity of the document but that finding is implicit in his Honour s finding that SZKTI should be distinguished  Accordingly  given that s   was not engaged  there was no need for the Tribunal to comply with s  B in making that request  Federal Magistrate Scarlett found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal  The Federal Magistrates Court failed to follow the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness when making decision    The Federal Magistrates Court was in improper exercise of its power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported  therefore the decision on   th September   should be sat aside    The Federal Magistrates Court an error of law and jurisdictional error when it made its decision followedSZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR  As to his Honour s consideration of the Full Court decision in SZKTI   the decision of the Full Court in SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   at     and at     makes it clear that the request from the Tribunal to DFAT did not enliven s   of the Act  It was not an invitation to give  additional information  for the purposes of that subsection  as then in force   It was not an invitation for additional information from DFAT
