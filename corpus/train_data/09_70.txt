Worrell  In the matter of Storm Financial Limited  Receivers and Managers Appointed   Administrators Appointed    FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredRe Hayes  Estate Property Group Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAgainst this background  it can be seen that these proceedings raise what Gyles J described in Re Hayes   Estate Property Group Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA   at para   hereafter  Hayes  case  as       the familiar tension between  on the one hand  the objective of having the first stage of administration dealt with promptly so as not to unduly interfere with the rights of those whom a moratorium affects and  on the other hand  giving worthwhile information to the creditors so that sensible decisions can be made at the meeting  It is well understood that in complex administrations these two objectives can often be in collision  If they are in collision then  in many cases  priority will be given to obtaining sensible information and advice from the administrators to enable the creditors to have the material before them to make an informed decision  In Hayes  case  at para   Gyles J voiced a concern arising from the circumstances of that case  where a period of some months by way of extension of the convening period had been proposed  He used the term  prosaically with respect  a  substantial stretch of the statutory provisions  to describe it  His Honour noted that extensions of the order propounded in that case had been granted in other cases  In the result  his Honour reached the view that it was too early to commit to such a lengthy period before the creditors had what he described as  any real say  in the matter  His Honour continued  at para     A course which is taken in some of these matters and was  I notice  taken in Fincorp   NSWSC     is to provide for a lengthy period but also  by an order under section  A   permit foreshortening of the period if events warrant it  Other courses which can be taken are  if a case is made out  to utilise section  A to extend the period for which the creditors can adjourn the meeting pursuant to section  B or to utilise section  A to grant a further extension of the convening period under section  A  The latter course has been taken in a number of matters  It seems to me that would be the appropriate course to be taken in these matters if necessary  An order of the kind which Gyles J came to make in Hayes  case is one which has been submitted to be appropriate by ASIC  In Re Mentha  Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA     hereafter Mentha   Jacobson J had occasion to reflect upon whether  in the circumstances of the case before him  an order of the kind made in Hayes  case ought to be made  In the result  his Honour came to grant an extension of up to   days  as had been sought by the administrators  rather than to adopt a form of order akin to that made in Hayes  case  Regard to his Honour s reasons for judgment at para   and para   discloses that there were three particular reasons why  in the circumstances of that case  Jacobson J determined to grant an extension of up to   days to the administrators rather than to make an order similar to that made in Hayes  case  Those reasons were these   a  The first was that the cases indicate than an extension of two and a half to three months is not unusual where there is a relatively complex sale process  In this case  by way of contrast  there is no such sale process    b  The second reason evident in Mentha was that there was a disposition  sworn  it seems on behalf of the administrators  to convene a meeting in a shorter period of time than currently anticipated if the sale process concerned were able to be completed beforehand  Here  the administrators have a disposition likewise to convene a meeting earlier if  in their judgment  there is no advantage in delaying that particular meeting to the maximum permitted by the extension primarily sought  I have no doubt that that particular statement is one seriously made by responsible practitioners  In that sense  there is a similarity as between this case and Mentha   although  again  the occasion for the foreshortening is not  as it was in Mentha   the prospect or contingency of an earlier than anticipated completion of a sale process  but rather that of an earlier than anticipated completion  or at least practical completion  of investigations considered reasonably necessary    c  The third reason found in Mentha was that the administrators considered that there was sufficient cashflow to enable the post appointment liabilities to be met  Here  by way of contrast  the administrators have determined not to continue the trading operations of Storm Financial  In that sense  the outgoings  by way of wages and the like  have ceased upon the termination of staff  Nonetheless  the position  it seems to me  is different from Mentha in the sense that one does not have here the cost neutral situation of a business being continued and preserved for the purpose of sale by administrators  The question becomes whether or not the alternative proposal on behalf the administrators achieves a necessary or desirable degree of expedition in that regard or whether it might be better  as ASIC has submitted  to adopt a course similar to that undertaken in Hayes  case  ie  to fix  by way of an extension  a relatively short further period  but to make provision for the further extension of that period  Obviously enough  in the context of any further extension  the receipt by the administrators of a detailed proposal for a deed of company arrangement would be a material consideration  A concern which I have in relation to the alternative proposed by the administrators is that it may admit of some debate as to what constitutes a written proposal for a deed of company arrangement in the order as proposed  and further that it may admit  at the behest of the directors or some other promoter of a deed  of an extension of the administration period to   May   in respect of a deed which one might regard as but superficial in its content  Reflecting upon these considerations  the complexity of this particular company s operations  their spread  the need for an adequate report to be made to creditors and the statutory objects involved  it seems to me that the interests of creditors are best served by at least making provision for the prospect of a relatively early decision by them in relation to the choices offered under Pt    A   while at the same time giving the administrators some further weeks to undertake their necessary task of administration consideredRe Mentha  Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Re Mentha  Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA

have here the cost neutral situation of a business being continued and preserved for the purpose of sale by administrators  There are  thus  distinguishing features as between that which motivated  in what was undoubtedly a complex administration in Mentha   the granting of an extension of up to   days and the present case  Recognising this  the administrators  by way of an alternative  submitted that the Court might instead make orders which  in effect  hung off the receipt or otherwise of a written proposal for a deed of company arrangement on or before   March    If such a proposal were not received by that date  the submission was that the convening period be extended to   April  If such a proposal were received by the date suggested  the submission was that the convening period then be extended to   May    In a sense  the administrators and ASIC share a concern in relation to any proposal for a deed of company arrangement  That is that there is a need for the persons who would promote such a deed   be they the directors  insurers of Storm Financial or others   to act with the speed and dispatch envisaged by Parliament in the enactment of Pt    A  A leisurely process is not  in any way  envisaged by Parliament consideredRe Georges  Midas Australia Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe task for the court was recently summarised by Kenny J in the following way  in Re Georges  Midas Australia Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA   at para   as follows    The authorities establish that  where an application is made under section  A  for an extension of time  the court must strike a balance between the expectation that the administration be conducted relatively speedily and summarily and the need to ensure that undue speed not prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and shareholders citedStorm Financial Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe administrators report that the company  prior to its being placed in administration  had instituted proceedings in this Court against the Commonwealth Bank  The nature of those proceedings is described fully in a judgment delivered by Greenwood J  Storm Financial Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA    An application was made in those proceedings for interlocutory injunctive relief as against the bank  His Honour  for the reasons that he gave on   December   refused that application  The substantive proceedings remain on foot  In summary  the proceedings might be described as a claim for damages in respect of alleged contraventions of s  E and s  H of the Act by the bank in the despatch of correspondence to  and other communications with  clients of Storm Financial earlier in December   which are said to contain false  misleading or deceptive statements  Following adjournments  the application for leave to appeal in respect of the interlocutory injunctive aspect of the proceeding is to be heard in this Court on   March    The administrators report that they are presently in the process of seeking to form a view as to the prospects in respect of the substantive proceeding in the court  The position at the moment is that the administrators have not yet obtained legal advice on that subject  That is a matter that they are pursuing actively  The administrators also report  by way of Mr Worrell s affidavit  claims made by investors and clients and media coverage concerning the same and the prospect of the same  They are not yet in a position to give any further assistance to the Court or creditors concerning those claims  The administrators have already travelled to Townsville and undertaken considerable investigative work with Storm Financial s two chief financial officers  and also with the directors of Storm Financial  On   January   in the exercise of the judgment consigned to them as administrators  the administrators determined to close Storm Financial s business  In so doing  they were sensitive to the effects such a course had on the employees  The administrators report that  though unpleasant  the decision was one which  having regard to the financial information that they had obtained  was necessary  indeed  it seems  almost inevitable
