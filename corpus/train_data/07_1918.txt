QAAA of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAbebe v Commonwealth     CLR  Mr Bickford for the respondents submitted in summary as follows    the grounds of review sought to be advanced by the appellant are not open on a matter of this nature and in any event  there is no basis for any one of the grounds sought to be advanced by the appellant    the scope of jurisdictional error is very limited and a matter can easily fall out of focus when one spends too much time analysing the Tribunals reasons    it is not finally settled whether or not a decision which is unreasonable in the sense explained in Associated Provincial Picture Homes Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   is amenable to review for jurisdictional error    however  there is clear Full Court authority that states that a lack of logic in a Tribunal s reasoning does not  of itself  give rise to an error of law or jurisdictional error  NACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       in any event  the decision of the Tribunal was not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense or in the sense that it was so irrational or illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds  Even if these grounds gave rise to jurisdictional error they are not made out in this case    the argument that a finding unsupported by evidence amounts to an illogical finding is not supported by authorities  VWST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       the findings made by the Tribunal with respect to the appellant s United States navy service and how the Iranian authorities might view it were reasonably open to it and the Tribunal had regard to all the available evidence in forming its conclusions    the Tribunal clearly understood the test as to whether the combination of factors in the appellant s case  including his United States navy service  would give rise to a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  Further  the Tribunal stated the test correctly and applied the tests to the facts as found    it would be a wrong approach for this court  under the guise of attacking the Tribunal s reasons as being unreasonable or in some sense giving rise to jurisdictional error  to find that this court would not have reached the same conclusion  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR     the Tribunal applied the correct test with respect to whether there was a  real chance  of the appellant being persecuted and there is no basis for any contention to the contrary    the Tribunal dealt with the appellant s claims of persecution based on religion  and the Tribunal s findings that there was not a real chance that he faced persecution by reason of his religion in the reasonably foreseeable future was reasonably open on the available evidence  The Tribunal s findings in this regard were findings of fact and not reviewable by this Court    inevitably there will not be  perfect  evidence before the Tribunal in cases of this nature  The findings the Tribunal made were open to it on the evidence    even if the Tribunal s findings were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence  such a result does not give rise to an error of law    there is no basis for the assertion that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant evidence   As a general proposition  it is true that    it is for the appellant to advance whatever evidence or argument he wishes to advance in support of his claim   Abebe v Commonwealth     CLR at   re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Cassim   HCA   at     and    as

strictly necessary for me to consider the alternative issues raised by the appellant with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness and irrationality and want of logic of the Tribunal s decision  However  I note the findings of his Honour below that reasoning of the Tribunal was neither illogical nor irrational and  having reviewed the decision of the Tribunal  consider that there is no error in his Honour s findings in relation to these contentions  In any event  these grounds do not appear to support claims of jurisdictional defect in terms of Australian law  In particular  I note the decision

Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   citedAssociated Provincial Picture Homes Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   Mr Estcourt QC for the appellant submitted in summary as follows    the conclusion of the Tribunal that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution because      o he was only an apostate and not a Christian proslytizer  o he had not criticised the Islamic Revolutionary government since he first went to live in the United States   years ago  o he only reached the  lowly  rank of airman in the United States Navy and therefore he would not be a person the authorities in Iran would have any interest in punishing    was   Wednesbury unreasonable  and both irrational and illogical    it was illogical in the extreme  perverse and manifestly wrong in the sense discussed by Young J in VWFP and VWFQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   to conclude that the Iranian authorities would examine the appellants Navy service records and satisfy themselves that they did not disclose that the appellant was any threat to Iran    the Tribunals  conclusion in relation to the assertion that the appellant  can inform them that he was never properly rewarded for his study efforts in the navy  and other quantitative aspects of the appellants United States Navy serve was capricious  perverse and disclose manifest error going to jurisdiction    it was not relevant how long the appellant served in the United States Navy  or the level of his rank  or whether he felt sufficiently rewarded or appreciated by the United States Navy to whether he would be of interest to the Iranian authorities  What would be of moment was the authorities  perception of the political conduct of an Iranian opponent of the current government who evaded military conscription in the service of his own country and fled to and joined the armed services of Iran s enemy    the Tribunal s unreasonable approach failed to appreciate and decide upon the full import of the evidence before it concerning the position as to Iran    given that the Tribunal found that the appellant would come to the attention of the authorities in Iran and that the legal sanction for apostasy is the death penalty  and given the appellants overall history  the chance of him suffering serious persecution was not one which could be discounted as  farfetched   remote  or  insubstantial    the Tribunal failed to take into account the very relevant considerations of arbitrary arrest  imprisonment of people solely on account of their beliefs  torture and ill treatment of detainees  the refusal of Iran to adopt laws against torture and the role of  morality forces  in attacking opponents of the regime to determine whether the appellant  who has   years of residence in the United States and served in the United States Navy  has a well founded fear of persecution    the Tribunal accepted the appellant s characterisation of the United States as Iran s  sworn enemy    to have concluded otherwise than that the appellant had more than a  remote   insubstantial  or  farfetched  chance of a threat to his liberty or physical harassment or ill treatment at the hands of the Iranian authorities was so totally unreasonable that no reasonable Tribunal could arrive at such a conclusion and it is an irrational and illogical conclusion not based on any evidence or findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds   Mr Bickford for the respondents submitted

Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     It is clear that in reaching its decision  the Tribunal is not limited to the evidence that is formally put before it  s   Migration Act   As observed by the Full Court in SFGB   FCAFC   at        Subject to the other provisions of the Act  including the implied and express requirements of procedural fairness  the Tribunal can inform itself as it thinks fit  including acting on information that is  public   Nor should it be forgotten in this context that in the course of their duties Tribunal members may well come to have a relatively detailed understanding of the political and legal situation in various parts of the world  Within the limits imposed by the Act itself there is nothing to prevent members from using this information   In this case the Tribunal considered both information provided by the appellant  and  public  information  In summary  this information was    that the appellant  has been out of the country for   years  mostly living in a Christian country that is Iran s sworn enemy  he has worked in the United States Navy and will be imputed to be opposed to Iran for that reason  he has publicly supported the Shah and criticized the government that replaced him  he has avoided military service  and he has become a Christian    the appellant held the rank of  airman  in the United States Navy  that his role was to inspect aircraft  and that he had a low security clearance    that active monarchists who are associated with parties that wield influence outside Iran might encounter difficulties if they returned to Iran  The Tribunal noted a document entitled Final Report  Iran  published by the UNHCR and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin Asylum Research and Documentation  ACCORD  at the seventh European country of origin information seminar in Berlin     June     the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised on   March   that there was no evidence of Iranian authorities actively targeting supporters of the former Shah  although an individual caught handing out pro monarchist leaflets in Iran would likely be arrested    the UK Home Office report Iran Assessment October   which observed that the current regime in Iran has not in the past nor does it now act against Iranians simply because they or their relatives were members of the Rastakhiz Party  which was established by the Shah in   to run a one party State  The report also noted that       There is no evidence of any pattern of action by the regime today against Iranians simply because at one time they were middle level or low ranking functionaries of the Shah s bureaucracy           the UK Home Office report Country Assessment Iran  October   which noted that proselytising apostates who commence preaching Christianity are likely to face execution  although there had been no reports of persons being executed on the grounds of conversion from Islam since   and in practice Muslim converts to Christianity may face obstacles such as not being admitted to university or not being issued with a passport   The appellant submits that  in reaching its decision  the Tribunal erred in concluding that  once the appellant went back to Iran and was intercepted and interrogated by the authorities  they would accept his explanation about his United States military service  The appellant draws attention to the findings of the Tribunal that     It is likely that he will be questioned and his past will be examined and will disclose that his family members were supporters of the Shah  that the Applicant made some critical comments about the government some   years ago and that he worked in the USA Navy for more than two years  The Tribunal finds that the authorities will have no interest in punishing him for historical connections to the Shah s regime or for criticising the Revolutionary government when it first came to power  particularly as he has not been politically active or otherwise critical in the intervening   years  His service was   years ago and he only reached the relatively lowly rank of airman  He voluntarily left after a little more than two years  The Tribunal does not accept the argument that he will be imputed to be an enemy of Iran because he was employed by the Navy  The authorities can examine his service records and question him to satisfy themselves that his service does not disclose he is any threat of Iran  He can inform them that he was never properly rewarded for his study efforts in the Navy  It finds that he does not face a real chance of persecution related to his US Navy service  for that reason alone or in combination with other aspects of his claims     In particular  the appellant submitted that there was no material before the Tribunal as to how the Iranian authorities might react to the appellant s navy service  Accordingly  the findings of the Tribunal in relation to the view the authorities might take was based on no evidence  and amounted to jurisdictional error   In relation to this issue  at the hearing Mr Bickford for the first respondent submitted     So the fact that the Tribunal  in making its finding that he was in its view not likely to suffer a real chance of persecution related to his US naval service for that reason alone or in combination with other matters doesn t necessarily attract criticism by way of jurisdictional error simply because there was no direct evidence before the Tribunal as to what would happen if he was placed in that situation   In other words  inevitably in cases of this nature there won t be perfect evidence before the Tribunal  The Tribunal can t know for absolute certain what will happen in the event that this gentleman is returned to Iran and questioned about these matters  It can only make findings based upon the evidence that it does have and based upon its own experience and its own views  That s all it can do   So to say there s no evidence to support a finding that   the actual findings being that he would not be imputed to be an enemy of Iran because he was

v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at   citedVWFP and VWFQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Mr Estcourt QC for the appellant submitted in summary as follows    the conclusion of the Tribunal that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution because      o he was only an apostate and not a Christian proslytizer  o he had not criticised the Islamic Revolutionary government since he first went to live in the United States   years ago  o he only reached the  lowly  rank of airman in the United States Navy and therefore he would not be a person the authorities in Iran would have any interest in punishing    was   Wednesbury unreasonable  and both irrational and illogical    it was illogical in the extreme  perverse and manifestly wrong in the sense discussed by Young J in VWFP and VWFQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   to conclude that the Iranian authorities would examine the appellants Navy service records and satisfy themselves that they did not disclose that the appellant was any threat to Iran    the Tribunals  conclusion in relation to the assertion that the appellant  can inform them that he was never properly rewarded for his study efforts in the navy  and other quantitative aspects of the appellants United States Navy serve was capricious  perverse and disclose manifest error going to jurisdiction    it was not relevant how long the appellant served in the United States Navy  or the level of his rank  or whether he felt sufficiently rewarded or appreciated by the United States Navy to whether he would be of interest to the Iranian authorities  What would be of moment was the authorities  perception of the political conduct of an Iranian opponent of the current government who evaded military conscription in the service of his own country and fled to and joined the armed services of Iran s enemy    the Tribunal s unreasonable approach failed to appreciate and decide upon the full import of the evidence before it concerning the position as to Iran    given that the Tribunal found that the appellant would come to the attention of the authorities in Iran and that the legal sanction for apostasy is the death penalty  and given the appellants overall history  the chance of him suffering serious persecution was not one which could be discounted as  farfetched   remote  or  insubstantial    the Tribunal failed to take into account the very relevant considerations of arbitrary arrest  imprisonment of people solely on account of their beliefs  torture and ill treatment of detainees  the refusal of Iran to adopt laws against torture and the role of  morality forces  in attacking opponents of the regime to determine whether the appellant  who has   years of residence in the United States and served in the United States Navy  has a well founded fear of persecution    the Tribunal accepted the appellant s characterisation of the United States as Iran s  sworn enemy    to have concluded otherwise than that the appellant had more than a  remote   insubstantial  or  farfetched  chance of a threat to his liberty or physical harassment or ill treatment at the hands of the Iranian authorities was so totally unreasonable that no reasonable Tribunal could arrive at such a conclusion and it is an irrational and illogical conclusion not based on any evidence or findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds followedVWST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Mr Bickford for the respondents submitted in summary as follows    the grounds of review sought to be advanced by the appellant are not open on a matter of this nature and in any event  there is no basis for any one of the grounds sought to be advanced by the appellant    the scope of jurisdictional error is very limited and a matter can easily fall out of focus when one spends too much time analysing the Tribunals reasons    it is not finally settled whether or not a decision which is unreasonable in the sense explained in Associated Provincial Picture Homes Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   is amenable to review for jurisdictional error    however  there is clear Full Court authority that states that a lack of logic in a Tribunal s reasoning does not  of itself  give rise to an error of law or jurisdictional error  NACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       in any event  the decision of the Tribunal was not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense or in the sense that it was so irrational or illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds  Even if these grounds gave rise to jurisdictional error they are not made out in this case    the argument that a finding unsupported by evidence amounts to an illogical finding is not supported by authorities  VWST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       the findings made by the Tribunal with respect to the appellant s United States navy service and how the Iranian authorities might view it were reasonably open to it and the Tribunal had regard to all the available evidence in forming its conclusions    the Tribunal clearly understood the test as to whether the combination of factors in the appellant s case  including his United States navy service  would give rise to a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  Further  the Tribunal stated the test correctly and applied the tests to the facts as found    it would be a wrong approach for this court  under the guise of attacking the Tribunal s reasons as being unreasonable or in some sense giving rise to jurisdictional error  to find that this court would not have reached the same conclusion  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR     the Tribunal applied the correct test with respect to whether there was a  real chance  of the appellant being persecuted and there is no basis for any contention to the contrary    the Tribunal dealt with the appellant s claims of persecution based on religion  and the Tribunal s findings that there was not a real chance that he faced persecution by reason of his religion in the reasonably foreseeable future was reasonably open on the available evidence  The Tribunal s findings in this regard were findings of fact and not reviewable by this Court    inevitably there will not be  perfect  evidence before the Tribunal in cases of this nature  The findings the Tribunal made were open to it on the evidence    even if the Tribunal s findings were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence  such a result does not give rise to an error of law    there is no basis for the assertion that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant evidence   In view of my decision with respect to evidence in this case  it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the alternative issues raised by the appellant with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness and irrationality and want of logic of the Tribunal s decision  However  I note the findings of his Honour below that reasoning of the Tribunal was neither illogical nor irrational and  having reviewed the decision of the Tribunal  consider that there is no error in his Honour s findings in relation to these contentions  In any event  these grounds do not appear to support claims of jurisdictional defect in terms of Australian law  In particular  I note the decision of the Full Court in Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness  and the decisions of the High Court in Bond   CLR  particularly per Mason CJ at   with whom  on this point  Brennan  Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed  and the Full Court in VWST   FCAFC   that want of logic does not form a valid basis of judicial review
