austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is submitted for the respondent that this proceeding has already  commenced  and cannot be  commenced  again under Pt IVA  It is put on behalf of the applicants that the matter is covered by authority and  in particular  the decision of O Connor J in Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA         FCR   that decision having been referred to with approval by Tamberlin J in Sreika v Cardinal Financial Securities Limited   FCA    The respondent submits that the decision in Sreika   FCA   can be distinguished because the history of the proceeding was different  it having been intended to have been commenced as a representative proceeding it was  thus  simply a question of a wrong form being used   I cannot say that that the applicants  argument is without merit  It may well be correct  It does not appear to have been referred to in terms by O Connor J or by Tamberlin J who have  rather  concentrated upon what might be called the practicalities of the situation  Because of the brevity of the reasoning  particularly in Finance Sector Union   FCA       FCR   it cannot be said that this basis could not have been behind it  Therefore  I am not able to conclude that the decisions relied upon by the applicants are clearly wrong  although I have considerable doubt about their correctness  In view of that conclusion  I allow the amendment  Whether or not the applicants wish to pursue the amendment is a matter for them   There is no doubt that  in general principle  the parties seeking an amendment should pay the costs occasioned by that amendment  However  this is an unusual situation for the reasons that have been mentioned  The costs of the motion up to today should be borne by the applicants  but the costs of today should be their costs in the cause   I certify that the preceding seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles

submitted for the respondent that this proceeding has already  commenced  and cannot be  commenced  again under Pt IVA  It is put on behalf of the applicants that the matter is covered by authority and  in particular  the decision of O Connor J in Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA         FCR   that decision having been referred to with approval by Tamberlin J in Sreika v Cardinal Financial Securities Limited   FCA    The respondent submits that the decision in Sreika   FCA   can be distinguished because the history of the proceeding was different  it having been intended to have been commenced as a representative proceeding it was  thus  simply a question of a wrong form being used   It seems to me that the decision of O Connor J is directly in point  It also seems to me that the distinction sought to be drawn in relation to Sreika   FCA   is unconvincing  If the point made by the present respondent is correct  and a proceeding is only commenced once  then I do not think that Sreika   FCA   can be distinguished in the way to which counsel for the respondent refers  It is also clear enough that the basic proposition which is in issue here was in issue in those cases  It was not as if the decisions were made without regard to there having been a question to be determined  Quite what the actual substance of the argument was in those cases is not to the point  I should say that those cases are referred to in the commentaries as authorities for the proposition that there can be conversion of an existing proceeding to a Pt IVA proceeding  Thus  in order to accede to the respondent s opposition to this amendment based upon lack of power  I would have to find that both of those decisions were plainly wrong   The argument presented for the respondent has much to commend it  The approach  slightly over simplified  is that you can only have one  commencement  of a proceeding once commenced  always commenced  It is said that it makes no sense at all that something can be commenced more than once  A reading of s  C of the Act in the light of s  A supports the respondent s position  without a very subtle reading of both sections  Also  the other provisions of Pt IVA seem to me to assume that a proceeding under that Part cannot also be a proceeding of another nature  That is not to say that Pt IVA is a complete code for the conduct of the case  but it is to say that a Pt IVA proceeding is sui juris and not to be joined with any other kind of proceeding  That last point is not something which arises at this stage of the case   However  without reproducing all of the arguments put by the applicants  it does not seem that they can make good their argument unless the view is taken that s  C does not  as counsel put it  amount to a procedural definition of how things are to take place  but rather describes what must have taken place for the proceeding to be under the Part  Put another way  if the amendment here is granted  then a proceeding under Pt IVA   which does not exist at the moment  will exist and so be  commenced  once the amendment is made  To so conclude does not raise the question as to whether or not the backdating of an amendment to the commencement of the proceeding is part of that process
