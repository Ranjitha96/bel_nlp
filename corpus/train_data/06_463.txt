width of the meaning of the term creditor in the Deed is likely to bring SETL within the class of creditors to which s  D  and  E apply   See  Smith v Carr     ACSR   per Debelle J at    The material facts recited in the pleading show that notwithstanding the limited relief sought by SETL against London Partners in this proceeding  it is plainly arguable that SETL may be a person who has a cause of action against London Partners at law or in equity that sounds in damages albeit at this point it may be of uncertain measure  It may be a claim for equitable compensation or compensation under s  H of the Act for involvement in a contravention of s   that exists independently of rectification of the register  or it may be a contingent claim that  for example  may arise in the event that it is the fact that London Partners holds the securities on trust for a bona fide purchaser for value without notice and is unable to deliver up the securities  In either circumstance it would follow that SETL would be a creditor of London Partners in respect of an unliquidated sum   See  Re  R L Child   Co Pty Ltd     ACLR   per McLelland J at   FCT v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd     ACLC   per
