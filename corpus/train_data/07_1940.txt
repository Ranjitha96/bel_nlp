Akiba and Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedByron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People     ALR   On its merits the motion for review must fail  There is no basis upon which I could be satisfied that a determination over a Torres Strait regional sea claim area may affect any interest of Pastor Dorogori  In so concluding I have regard to the principles for the identification of relevant interests in Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People     ALR   and various cases in which that case has been followed  A relevant interest  as was said in Arakwal   ALR   must be  at           capable of clear definition and  equally importantly      of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the application   I took account of all the material relied upon by Pastor Dorogori  He asserts in reliance upon that material     That he has a link to the claim area     That he and the people he represents have a history in the Torres Strait claim area     That he is the owner of reefs  seas and waters in the claim area   The assertion of ownership of reefs  seas and waters is no more than that  No historical basis for such a claim is disclosed  The location of areas allegedly owned by Mr Dorogori and his people is not disclosed  The fact that he may be descended from people who came from an island in the Torres Strait does not  of itself  support the inference that there is some kind of interest which may be affected by a determination   In my opinion the motion should be dismissed    I certify that the preceding twenty   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr R Blowes SC Solicitor for the Applicant  David Saylor  Torres Strait Regional Authority Pastor G Dorogori appeared in person     Counsel for the Commonwealth  Ms R Webb QC Solicitor for the Commonwealth Counsel for the State of Queensland Solicitor for the State of Queensland   Counsel for various commercial fishing parties   Solicitor for the various commercial fishing parties Counsel for Mr P Gamogab Solicitor for Mr P Gamogab Counsel for Mr PN Sawabarri Solicitor for Mr PN Sawabarri  Australian Government Solicitor Mr G Hiley QC State Government Solicitor Mr P Gore Gore   Associates Mr T Fisher  Fisher Dore Mr D Kempton David Kempton Mr Songoro appeared for the Songoro family  Mr Gamia appeared for the Gamia family  Mr F Warapa appeared in person and for the Buzi and Ber villages Mr R Gibuma appeared in person and for Sigabaduru Village Mr G Neate appeared for the National Native Title Tribunal     Date of Hearing    November       Date of Judgment    December         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
