SZFBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredNBGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant argues that the RRT did not treat the views expressed by commentators as being the test for application of Article  C   In support of this  the appellant refers to the recent decision of the Full Federal Court in NBGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   where Allsop J  with whom a majority of other judges agreed  said     The approach is not to ask whether a claim of such a well founded fear has been made out  but to ask whether  in respect of someone who has been recognised as a refugee  that is who has made out that claim  circumstances have so changed as to warrant the conclusion that the well founded fear which previously existed can no longer be maintained as a basis for refusing to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality and  so  that the protection of the Convention should cease  A lack of demonstrable clarity in the reality and durability of the change in relevant circumstances will lead to the grounds for cessation not being established     Emphasis added  I accept that for the purpose of the present case the emphasised formulation of the test is appropriate and that this was the test addressed by the RRT   The appellant submits that the observation by the RRT that the expressions of the commentators  which were to similar effect as the approach later enunciated by Allsop J  do not constitute  legal tests  evidences that the wrong test was applied by the RRT   I do not accept this submission  The correct test is enunciated by the RRT  The RRT rightly notes that it is important to return the language of the Convention and there is no reason to doubt that the RRT has done this  The use of the expression  legal tests  does not signify that the RRT has adopted a different or inconsistent approach  but rather that it was conscious of the need to apply the language of the Act   On a fair reading of the reasons  I consider that the RRT has sought to apply and has formulated the correct approach to the question  while at the same time bearing in mind the importance of giving primacy to the language of the Convention   In addition  the appellant submits that in the application of the test to the circumstances of the case  the RRT has not correctly applied the test because it has ignored a number of relevant circumstances   The respondent relies on the recent decision of the Full Federal Court in NBGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    Black CJ  Mansfield and Stone JJ agreed that s      had to be satisfied in respect of an application for a permanent protection visa where the person had been previously accepted as a refugee at an earlier time  Black CJ at   referred to the concurrence of Mansfield J at   and Stone J at   in these terms           whilst there are two lines of reasoning leading to the majority conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed  there is a common conclusion about the task to be performed by the decision maker on an application for a permanent protection visa where the relevant circumstances are said to have changed since the appellant was granted a temporary protection visa   The majority would agree that s   mandates that the decision maker must be satisfied that  at the time the decision is made  the appellant for a permanent protection visa then has a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  The circumstance that a previous decision maker was satisfied that the applicant had such a fear when a temporary protection visa was granted is not sufficient to establish what s   requires    Emphasis added  In my view  the above statement of principle by the majority accords with a reasonable interpretation of the language of s       In terms  s   requires that whenever there is an application for a protection visa of any kind  the Minister must be satisfied that Australia has protection obligations to the applicant  Subsections     and   expressly exclude the operation of such obligations unless the person has a well founded fear of persecution on Convention grounds  These provisions are in terms calculated to enliven a requirement that there must exist a well founded fear where a new claim is made for a protection visa  The making of the claim expressly activates the requirement and this is not displaced by generalised overtones which are said to emerge inferentially from the terms of Article  C  when that provision did not contemplate legislative modifications of the type enacted in s     The above statement in NBGM is the most recent Full Court statement on the question as to the interpretation and interaction between s   as amended and Article  C  and I am bound by this expression of principle  I note that special leave has been granted by the High Court in relation to that proceeding  and that the High Court has recently heard the appeal and reserved its decision   In these circumstances  the appellant submits that the reasons of Wilcox and Madgwick JJ in the earlier Full Court case QAAH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   should be followed and applied  In that case  the majority held that if the decision maker is satisfied that an applicant has already been recognised as a refugee under Art  A  of the Convention and is not satisfied that this status has ceased under Art  C  then Australia will have protection obligations to the applicant  The appellant says that on a correct reading  NBGM has no ratio decidendi and therefore no application  or alternatively that it is authority contrary to the position of the respondent  It is argued that on a correct analysis  it can be seen that Stone J arrived at her decision in her separate reasons on a basis inconsistent with reasoning of Black CJ and Mansfield J  The appellant submits that for this reason  and notwithstanding her Honour s statement at   expressing her agreement with the proposition set out therein  the position as articulated in   of Black CJ s reasons should not be followed  Therefore  it is said  the majority decision in QAAH correctly expresses the law and must be applied   Where recently three members of a five member Full Court have expressly committed to a specific statement of principle as being applicable to the question before me  I consider that I should follow that statement  In my view  the position as stated by Black CJ in   cannot be said to be clearly wrong  The question before me is not to be resolved by arcane dissection and analysis of the chains of reasoning by each of the five different members of the Court of the type which has been adopted in the arguments in relation to the ratio decidendi of NBGM   The concurrence of the majority judges in the statement as to the interpretation and application of s   as amended is conclusive for the determination of the question before me on this issue   The consequence of this in the present case is that I am not persuaded the RRT has erred in requiring that it must be satisfied that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution  or in finding that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  Nor have I been pointed to any error in the reasons of Emmett FM that would warrant the setting aside of this decision  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs       I certify that the preceding forty one
