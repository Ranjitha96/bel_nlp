decisions tend to support the proposition that the connection between the conduct complained of and a supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer must be direct and obvious  However  the point was not specifically addressed in any of them and was not the subject of detailed consideration in any of them  In McCaskey   FCA       FCR     at      pp     French J  as he then was  explained s   of the Act  At    p     his Honour said        The elements of the conduct prohibited by s   are as follows      It is the conduct of a corporation or a person to whom the extended operation of the Act applies           It is conduct                 a  in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer     b  in connection with the payment for services by a consumer                   It is one or more of the following                 a  use of physical force     b  undue harassment     c  coercion  His Honour then referred to some matters of history and then gave a detailed exposition of the section at      pp     with which I respectfully agree  In those paragraphs of his judgment  his Honour said  It is the second limb of the conduct defined by s   namely  undue harassment or coercion in connection with the payment for goods or services by a consumer  that is in issue in this case  The words of the section are to be given their ordinary meanings relevant to the context in which they appear  The term  harass  as defined in the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines from the French  harasser  a pejorative derivation of the word  harer  meaning  to set a dog upon   The definitions of the word are thus           Trouble by repeated attacks  Now Freq  subject to constant molesting or persecution        Lay waste  devastate  Tire out  exhaust  Overwhelm with cares and misfortunes etc    Chiefly as harassed         The meaning of primary relevance here is the first  but it is important to have regard to context in considering its application in s    In this respect judicial exegesis  in other statutory settings  of concepts such as  sexual harassment  is of little assistance  Sexual harassment under the Sex Discrimination Act    Cth  does not require a demonstration of repeated unwelcome approaches  Hall v A   A Sheiban Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     FCA       ALR   at    Lockhart J  at      Wilcox J  at      French J   And see O Callaghan v Loder   EOC     at    That proposition derived from the language of s   of the Sex Discrimination Act   Certainly it is consistent with the ordinary meaning of  harass  as involving an element of repetition to speak of a harassed state of mind arising out of one or more events  Johnson v Collier     FLR   at    Anderson J   But there   harassed  is used in the fourth of the defined meanings and relates to the state of mind of a person induced by an event or events none of them necessarily amounting to harassment  A person can feel harassed because something has gone wrong for which nobody is to blame        The word  harassment  as used in s   must serve two broad purposes  It describes a range of conduct  in connection with the supply of goods or services which involve  inter alia  applying repeated pressure to a consumer who is under no pre existing obligation to acquire  It also describes conduct in relation to a consumer who is under an unfulfilled obligation to pay for goods or services  Given the range of cases that it can cover  the question whether or not there is harassment involves evaluative judgment  The word  undue  adds an extra layer of evaluation which is more relevant to the case of debt recovery than to the sale of goods or services  Repeated unwelcome approaches to a potential acquirer of goods or services could qualify as harassment and  so qualified  require very little additional evidence  if any  to attract the characterisation of  undue harassment   On the other hand a consumer who owes money to a supplier can expect repeated unwelcome approaches requesting payment of the debt if he or she does not pay  No doubt such approaches might also qualify as harassment  If legitimate demands are reasonably made  on more than one occasion  for the purpose of reminding the debtor of his or her obligation and drawing the debtor s attention to the likelihood of legal proceedings if payment is not made  then that conduct  if it be harassment  is not undue harassment  If  however  the frequency  nature or content of the approaches and communications associated with them is such that they are calculated to intimidate or demoralise  tire out or exhaust a debtor rather than convey the demand and an associated legitimate threat of proceedings  the harassment will be undue  Section   can also cover cases in which the conduct complained of lacks the element of repetition necessary to constitute harassment  undue or otherwise  This requires consideration of the term  undue coercion   The word  coercion  is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary thus           The action of coercing  constraint  restraint  compulsion        Government by force  the employment of force to suppress political disaffection and disorder  Physical pressure  compression  Coercitive power or jurisdiction         The verb  coerce  is defined as       To constrain or restrain by force  or by authority resting on force        To subject to restraint in the matter of  rare     To effect by compulsion   The collection of debts may involve coercion in the sense that the debtor is subjected to the pressure of the demand and the legitimate threat of civil process for recovery with the additional cost and damage to credit which that can involve  Such pressure may be thought of as coercion but is entirely legitimate and not  undue   Where the demand includes content which does not serve legitimate purposes of reminding the debtor of the obligation and threatening legal proceedings for recovery but is calculated otherwise to intimidate or threaten the debtor  then the coercion may be undue  So if a threat is made of criminal proceedings  or of the immediate seizure and sale of house and property  a remedy not available in the absence of retention of title or some form of security  the coercion is likely to be seen as undue  The threat of criminal proceedings itself may be an offence against State laws  Quite apart from content the manner or circumstances of a demand or communication  including the language used  the time and place at which it is made and the person to whom it is communicated  may go beyond the legitimate purposes of drawing attention to the existence of the obligation and the consequences for non compliance  Again such a communication may amount to undue coercion  Obvious examples include the use of personally abusive or obscene language  conveying the demand to uninvolved family members  particularly children  or conveying the demand through a third party in order to embarrass the debtor when the debtor could reasonably have been the subject of a direct communication  Each case will turn on its own facts  Some useful examples of situations that may give rise to contraventions of s   are set out in the ACCC guidelines entitled  Debt Collection and the Trade Practices Act   published in July    As pointed out of course that publication is not a statement of the law  It can only be a guide  The recovery of unpaid debts can be pursued with firmness  determination and civility  It can do all those things without resorting to bullying  bluff  misrepresentation or stand over tactics  If it does the first and avoids the second it is unlikely to contravene the law  His Honour did not specifically address the question of what is meant by   in connection with   in s   of the Act  At    p   his Honour did speak of pressure being applied to a consumer  The examples which his Honour gave were examples of pressure being applied to a consumer in that person s capacity as a consumer  But his Honour was not called upon to decide whether the expression   in connection with   should be construed widely  as is often the case  or narrowly by reference to the purpose for which s   was enacted  As the respondent submitted  correctly I think  there are only a handful of decisions in this Court which deal with s   of the Act  Most do not descend into any reasoned analysis of the section because the section appeared clearly to apply  There is no Full Court authority and no High Court authority on the meaning of the section  Rather  the focus of the argument was on the concept of   undue harassment    Harassment also involves conduct directed at the person harassed in an immediate and direct fashion  It usually involves repetition  The assessment of whether conduct is properly characterised as harassment involves an evaluative judgment  per French J in McCaskey   FCA       FCR   at    p    The word   undue   adds an extra layer of evaluation  per French J in McCaskey   FCA       FCR   at    p    To be   undue   the harassment must be disproportionate and patently unreasonable  These views as to the meaning of the core expressions in s   of the Act were supported by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia   FCA       FCR   at      pp      In Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     after referring to Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd   FCR     French J  as he then was   with whom Beaumont and Finkelstein JJ agreed  said  at      pp         It is also the case  on authority previously discussed  that the point of law could have been determined on a motion to strike out portions of the statement of claim raising the federal causes of action against the Territory respondents  In that sense it could properly have been said that the claim was not tenable as a matter of law  No relevant distinction could be drawn between the process of determining the point of law as a case stated or on a preliminary issue and determining it on a strike out motion  Indeed Burgundy Royale was cited by the Full Court in Unilan Holdings Pty Ltd v Kerin at   as authority for the proposition that the striking out of a portion of a pleading relating to a claim under the Trade Practices Act did not thereby deprive the Court of jurisdiction to hear a related claim in negligent mis statement  See also Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd at    The mere fact that a claim is found not to be tenable does not of itself deprive the Court of jurisdiction in non federal claims comprising part of the same matter  If there be no federal jurisdiction properly invoked then there can be no accrued jurisdiction Carlton   United Breweries Ltd v Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and see the discussion by Professor Zines   Federal Associated and Accrued Jurisdiction  in B Opeskin and F Wheeler  eds  The Australian Federal Judicial System   pp     and the apparent tension between Vietnam Veterans  Affairs Association of Australia New South Wales Branch Inc v Cohen   FCA         FCR   on the one hand and Post Office Agents Association Ltd v Australian Postal Commission     ALR   at    Davies J  and Buck v Comcare     FCR   at    Finn J   The Court in such a case of course does have a limited jurisdiction to determine whether its jurisdiction is properly invoked Mercator Property Consultants Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     Khatri v Price   FCA         FCR    In the ordinary course the contention that a claim is not tenable will not go to jurisdiction unless dependent upon a submission that the claim is outside jurisdiction  And indeed  within that class a claim may be untenable because its very nature denies its character as an element of any matter or controversy in respect of which the Court can exercise jurisdiction  So a proceeding based upon the proposition that the Commonwealth Constitution is invalid does not disclose a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation Nikolic v MGICA Ltd   FCA    A claim may also be a sham reflecting no genuine controversy and therefore establishing no matter in respect of which the Court may exercise its jurisdiction  There has been discussion of so called  colourable  claims made under the Trade Practices Act for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  The mere fact that a claim is struck out as untenable does not mean it is colourable in that sense  The pleading of the s   claim in this case advanced the legitimate forensic purpose of endeavouring to establish a cause of action which would not require proof of a duty of care  Notwithstanding its precipitate initiation and chequered history  I am not satisfied that it was colourable in the sense that would deprive this Court of jurisdiction to deal with the matter including any non federal claims that may form part of it  I agree with French J that the mere fact that a claim is struck out as untenable does not mean that it is colourable in the sense that it was made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  The respondent accepted these propositions  It nonetheless submitted that the applicant s claim was colourable because Factors  b   c  and  d  seem to me to be  at best  neutral  None of them  whether looked at on its own or in combination with one or more of the others  advances the respondent s submission appliedBourke v State Bank of New South Wales     FCR  In this context  the expression   interests of justice   should be given a wide interpretation  The Court is entitled to consider  in addition to issues concerning jurisdiction  remedies and enforcement          adjectival matters such as the availability of particular evidence  the procedures to be adopted  the desirable venue for trial and the likely hearing date       per Wilcox J in Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales     FCR   at    The respondent made the following submissions in support of its application that the whole of the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court   a  The proceeding is fundamentally a common law proceeding and  as such  is more appropriately dealt with in a State court  The dominant cause of action is the cause of action in defamation   b  All aspects of the proceeding  including the parties  the conduct alleged and the damage suffered are connected with New South Wales  There are no issues of a national character  nor any issues which would require consideration of the law of a place other than New South Wales  There are no factors referable to convenience which would render a hearing in New South Wales inappropriate  After all  were the matter to remain in this Court  the hearing would take place in Sydney  and  c  In substance  the proceeding is a defamation proceeding and  as such  is more appropriately dealt with in a State court which has specialist expertise  In particular  there are important procedural advantages available should the matter be transferred to the Supreme Court  including a specialist list for defamation matters  specialist defamation case management rules and a prima facie entitlement to a trial by jury   Were the matter transferred to the Supreme Court  the respondent would have an opportunity to elect to have a trial by jury  subject always to the overall control by the Supreme Court of whether  in fact  in any particular case  some or all of the issues involved should be tried with a jury  However  there was a strong likelihood that  if the respondent wished to have a trial with a jury  the trial would be with a jury citedCook v Pasminco Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Cook v Pasminco Ltd   FCA         FCR   at      pp     Lindgren J held that  because the federal claims pleaded in the case before him were hopeless and clearly untenable  those claims were not genuine and were colourable or fabricated in order to engage the jurisdiction of this Court and for no other purpose  there being no evidence to the contrary  The expressions used by his Honour in respect of the federal claims with which he was dealing were   obviously doomed to fail     clearly untenable   and   quite hopeless    In using those expressions  his Honour was seeking to convey the notions that In Cook v Pasminco Ltd   FCA       FCR     his Honour held  amongst other things  that toxic emissions from plants were not   supplied   by the respondents  The claim was that those emissions had been supplied by the respondents with a defect  in breach of s  AD and s  AG of the Act  His Honour had no difficulty in concluding that the claims were colourable  He did so because they were very obviously untenable  Not every claim which is ultimately held to have failed or which is struck out as untenable would justify the conclusion that it was colourable appliedDorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd     ALR       ATPR    In Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     FCR     a Full Court of this Court held that the Northern Territory and a statutory authority of the Territory were not bound by the Act  Nonetheless  the Court held that there was accrued jurisdiction in this Court in respect of the common law claims brought against them  The Court said   FCR at       It is true that in answering questions   and   in the negative  we have determined preliminary points of law in the claims under the Act brought against the second and third respondents  and that  in consequence  there will be no further trial of those issues  But it does not follow that the Court ever lacked jurisdiction to deal with such claims  Nor does it follow that the Court now loses its jurisdiction to deal with the attached common law claims  see Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers  Australia  Pty Ltd   ATPR         ALR     and Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd   ATPR         ALR    In principle  the position is no different than it would have been if the claims under the Act had proceeded to trial and had been dismissed on the merits  In that situation  it could not seriously be suggested that the dismissal of the claims under the Act had the effect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to deal with any attached non federal claim    The position may have been different if the claims under the Act had been  colourable  in the sense that they were made for the improper purpose of  fabricating  jurisdiction  see P H Lane  Lane s Commentary on the Australian Constitution   pp     and the cases there cited  There is no room for such a suggestion here  The applicants

correct  The interests of justice will be best served by the applicant s common law claims being tried in the court where they are usually tried  This is particularly so when  as here  the dominant claim is her claim in defamation  The circumstances of this case may be contrasted with those considered by Tamberlin J in Stalyce Holdings  Aust  Pty Ltd v Cetec Pty Ltd   FCA       ATPR      In that case  the federal claims were an important part of the case  remained on foot and  in part  involved parties not concerned with the alleged defamation  This is not to say that  were the proceedings retained in this Court  the trial would not be with a jury  The real point is that the Supreme Court is best equipped in terms of its procedures and expertise to hear and determine the present proceedings when sensible regard is had to the substance of the claims made in the proceedings  For these reasons  I propose to order that the whole of the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales  Other MattersappliedWorchild v Queensland Television Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlDowsett J in Worchild v Queensland Television Ltd   FCA   at   made several observations which generally support the approach to s   reflected in the submissions made by the respondent to which I have referred at   above  In that case  his Honour held that s   is intended to protect consumers  His Honour also held that the conduct about which complaint is made must be in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer  His Honour decided that the expression in connection with in s   requires a direct and close connection between the conduct complained of and the actual or possible supply  At   his Honour said      As to the claim pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act   the applicant has not pleaded that the alleged conduct was in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer  or the payment for goods or services by a consumer  It is likely that his case is that such supply was the delivery of news or other services by the respondent  which owns a television station  to consumers of such services  However  that has not been pleaded  I indicated to the applicant that he might be able to amend  but he said that he thought that it was rather a matter for particulars  Even if the pleading were amended  there would be a further difficulty in that the conduct of which he complains is not in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer  It is true that the expression    in connection with   can have a very wide import  It is also true that the taking of film is undoubtedly a step in the process of supplying news services to consumers  if that is a correct description of what a television station does in its news broadcast  However  in my view  the expression    in connection with   in s   should be read more narrowly as requiring a direct connection between the conduct complained of and the actual supply  In other words  conduct preparatory to supply is not sufficient  Clearly  the section is designed to protect consumers  Any broader interpretation of the section would go beyond that purpose  In Worchild   FCA     the applicant alleged that a news cameraman employed by Queensland Television Ltd had unlawfully entered his flat and had surreptitiously recorded pictures and sound of the applicant  In that sense  the actions of the cameraman might be said to have been conduct preparatory to the supply of news services to the public but was not sufficiently close to such supply to engage s    His Honour confined the scope of the expression   in connection with   in the way that he did because the interpretation given to the section by adopting that approach most appropriately accommodated the purpose of the section viz the protection of consumers  The respondent referred me to five decisions in this Court which it contended supported the narrow interpretation of the expression in connection with which found favour with Dowsett J in Worchild   FCA    The five cases in question were  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia   FCA         FCR   at   and    pp     Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Davis   FCA   at   and   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd   FCA     Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Capalaba Pty Ltd   ATPR     and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McCaskey   FCA         FCR    Those five decisions tend to support the proposition that the connection between the conduct complained of and a supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer must be direct and obvious  However  the point was not specifically addressed in any of them and was not the subject of detailed consideration in any of them  I should follow Dowsett J in Worchild   FCA   unless I am satisfied that his Honour was clearly wrong  I am not so satisfied  I will therefore approach the interpretation of s   upon the basis that the expression   in connection with   requires a direct connection between the conduct complained of and the actual or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer  I consider  however  that construing the expression in this way does not necessarily mean that  as a matter of law  in every case  the harassment of which complaint is made must be harassment of a consumer in that person s capacity as a consumer and can never be constituted by the harassment of another person  who may or may not also be a consumer  directed or aimed at a consumer under actual or possible arrangements of supply  The respondent submitted that the harassment of a supplier can never be conduct which is caught by s   of the Act  I am not convinced that this submission is correct  I do not think I have to go as far as the respondent submits in order to decide the present application  The respondent also submitted that the necessary connection between Mr Hadley s conduct and the supply or possible supply of goods or services to one or more consumers or the payment for such goods or services by one or more consumers was not pleaded and could not be pleaded  This second point depends to a large extent upon my accepting Dowsett J s relatively narrow interpretation of the expression   in connection with   in s    The respondent submitted that the applicant s case based upon s   of the Act was hopeless and was also colourable  Were I to conclude that the case was colourable  the proceedings should be dismissed with costs  The essence of Mr Hadley s on air remarks was the repeated denigration of the applicant and her husband and the repeated exhortation of their customers to boycott the Seafood Lovers business  In the pleading  the applicant also alleges that  in his on air remarks  Mr Hadley harassed and coerced GPT to terminate the lease  Further  I do not think that the flaws in the applicant s s   claim were or are so obvious that its untenability should weigh so heavily in the balance against the applicant as to lead me to conclude that her s   claim was colourable  There is a limited amount of authority on the correct interpretation of s   of the Act  There is only one case that expressly comes to grips with the meaning of the expression   in connection with   in s    The observations of Dowsett J in Worchild   FCA   were brief and made in the context of a strike out application  I am not necessarily in agreement with one of the respondent s principal legal submissions  namely  its submission that the harassment contemplated by s   must be of a consumer in that person s capacity as a consumer  The applicant was entitled to test the boundaries of s   for her own legitimate forensic advantage  In my view  that is what she did  The s   case was not colourable  I therefore reject the respondent s argument that the applicant s s   claims were colourable  The Appropriate Order It follows from the conclusions which I have so far reached that  notwithstanding that I have struck out the applicant s s   claims  I consider that the Court has jurisdiction to deal with the remaining claims made by her  They are all common law claims  the most dominant of which is her claim in defamation  They remain within the accrued jurisdiction of this Court
