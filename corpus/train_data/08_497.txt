Malouf v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAutomatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Limited v Watson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  These cases were applied by von Doussa J  with whose reasons Jenkinson and Spender JJ agreed  in Gasparin v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR    That case concerned the question as to when income was derived from the sale of allotments of land  It was held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement  After referring to McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   Sunbird Plaza and Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Limited v Watson   HCA         CLR   at      as to which case  see below  von Doussa J said at   that these cases reflected a general rule about unsettled contracts of sale  His Honours said that at the end of the year of income in question         there were no debts owing by the purchasers to the joint venturers  In each case the promise to pay the balance of the purchase price  at settlement  remained executory until settlement occurred at which time a conveyance was executed  accepted and delivered to the purchaser  Until these events there was no accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to pay the balance of the purchase price     emphasis added  Gasparin and the cases referred to therein are not determinative of the question as to what  incurred  means for the purposes of     of the   Act  They do reveal  however  the use  in a cognate area  of the distinction between a promise in an executory contract  and the debt  that is the present obligation to pay the purchase money  accruing on settlement  whether payable then or after some agreed time if credit be given  In this context  it is important to note that von Doussa J  though dealing with the contract for the sale of land  referred to Automatic Fire Sprinklers   HCA       CLR    That case concerned a question of wrongful dismissal under wartime regulations  Nevertheless  despite this context  what was said by Dixon J at     remains important for understanding the relationship between the executory contract and the entitlement to the price of the property or services contracted for    In certain forms of executory contract where the promise of one party is to pay the other money in consideration of his transferring property  of his doing work  of his serving the former as his master  and  perhaps  of his providing other tangible things or definite services  the money to be paid is regarded as the price of or reward for the property or service when and so often as the transfer of the one or the performance of the other affords an executed consideration  In these contracts the promise to pay the price or reward is not construed as a simple obligation to pay a sum or sums at a future date supported solely by a consideration consisting in the corresponding promise to transfer the property  do the work  serve  or provide the things or services by the other party  so that a mere readiness and willingness on the one side of the latter to perform his part is enough to entitle him to the payments  notwithstanding that  whether owing to the fault of the former  or without fault on either side  the property is not transferred  the work is not done  the relation of master and servant ceases  or the things or services are not provided  The most familiar example is that of the sale of goods  There the common understanding of an agreement to sell is that it is the goods and not the promises to deliver that are to be paid for  The result is that  if the seller tenders goods in accordance with his contract but the buyer rejects them in breach of his contract  the seller cannot sue for the price  his remedy is for unliquidated damages for non acceptance       In Woolcombers the taxpayer  in the year of income  entered forward contracts for the purchase of wool that had been shorn or was yet to be shorn  The standard form contracts provided for property in the wool to pass from the woolgrower to the taxpayer upon payment  being   days after delivery  The contract provided expressly for the possibility of the grower needing to dispose of the sheep because of drought  flood or disease  In such circumstances  failing agreement as to how many sheep to sell  the matter of disposal would be the subject of arbitration  Thus  the promise to pay for wool to be delivered in the future was made in the year of income    The wool was delivered and paid for in the following year of income  An indemnity as to delivery and quality was given by the grower  In the previous   years  all such forward contracts  with one exception  had been completed by the growers  The contracts were to meet contracts by way of on sales for export entered by companies related to the taxpayer   It is to be recalled  at this point  that the principle dealt with in Gasparin and Sunbird Plaza was not limited to contracts for the sale of land  The discussion by Dixon J in Automatic Fire Sprinklers   CLR at     made that clear  discussedCityLink Melbourne Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii

the   Act  it is first necessary to analyse  with some more precision  the nature of the obligation to pay the purchase price  This is necessary because the legal character of the outgoing must be the subject of focus  Coles Myer Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR     Special condition   of the contract  when read with relevant definitions and the Particulars of Sale

attempt an exhaustive definition of a term such as  incurred  New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd at   per Dixon J  Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      ATR   at         In considering whether a loss or outgoing is incurred the Courts in Australia have adopted what is described as a  legal  or  jurisprudential approach  and not what may be described as a  commercial approach  Coles

of Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      FLR   at     but see  however  Flood at       After this reference to Nilsen Development in   Crennan J at   referred to Deane J in Coles Myer   HCA       CLR     quoting the following passage of Deane J s reasons at   CLR at      T he weight of authority supports the conclusion that  depending upon the circumstances  a liability to pay money can constitute  or give rise to  a  loss or outgoing  which is  incurred  within the meaning of that subsection notwithstanding that the money is not payable until a future time and that the obligation to pay it is theoretically defeasible or contingent in that it is subject to a condition which remains unfulfilled   Footnotes omitted      Crennan J continued at     Deane J considered that the critical question was whether the taxpayer was  as a practical matter  definitively committed or completely subjected to discharge of the liability in the future   HCA         CLR   at      His Honour recognised that on some facts it would be apparent that a condition giving rise to a theoretical contingency could be treated  for practical purposes  as certain to be satisfied   HCA         CLR   at       At first instance  Lee J concluded that the obligation to pay the purchase price of all the wool on the forward contracts had been incurred in the year of income  The argument of the Commissioner was not that the estimate made of the sums meant that there was no incurrence  Rather  it was argued that the liability to pay had not  come home   Expert accounting evidence was led by both sides  something which did not occur here   The point of difference between the accountants was the truth and fairness of the accounts treating the payments as incurred or not  The expert called by the Commissioner relied heavily on the matching principle  Lee J put this evidence into context at   ALR at     Evidence from expert accountants does not supply the proper construction of s   of the Act but the evidence may assist the court to identify  and to understand the commercial significance of  the facts to which the subsection  duly construed  is to be applied  Commissioner of Taxes  SA  v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd  Carden s case    HCA         CLR   per Dixon J at     QBE Insurance Group Ltd v Australian Securities Commission     ALR       FCR   per Lockhart J at     Coles Myer Finance Ltd v FCT   HCA         ALR       ATC     per Mason CJ  Brennan  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ at        The construction of s   is a jurisprudential analysis and not a construction assisted by the application of commercial principles  see Coles Myer per Mason CJ  Brennan  Toohey  Gaudron JJ at ATC   per McHugh J at ATC     but commercial and accountancy practice may assist in ascertaining the true nature and incidence of the item claimed as a loss or outgoing under s   see FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Carden s case per Dixon J at      Furthermore  the manner of application of s   will depend upon the particular facts of each case   The Full Court rejected the argument  In so doing  it referred to and relied on the two passages from Raymor   FCR at   and   cited earlier  This was to support the conclusion that the entry into the obligation to pay for future goods was sufficient for there to be an incurring of the liability to pay for them  even if the obligation was defeasible  Coles Myer   HCA       CLR   was then referred to  At   FCR at     the Full Court expressed its reasons fully for coming to the view that there was an accrued obligation or present liability imposed by definite contractual commitment  The Court said that it was not necessary for the taxpayer to have an interest in the wool  though it was recognised that equity would give protection to the taxpayer s interests  Stern v McArthur   HCA       CLR   was referred to  The Court rejected the argument of the Commissioner based on the requirement of delivery to create a present and accrued liability to pay  It agreed with Lee J s analysis  The Full Court did conclude  however  with the following passage at   FCR at     In our view  much will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case at hand  If the defeasibility takes the form of a contingency such as drought or a similar frustrating event which ordinarily would be implied as a matter of business efficacy  it is difficult to argue that by reason of the existence of this contingency  no liability to pay the price has accrued   This was not a liability that accrued day to day  It was a once and for all contractual undertaking  As in Woolcombers   FCR at     there is here no complexity  as in New Zealand Flax   HCA       CLR     no day to day accrual  as in Coles Myer   HCA       CLR   or other appropriate financial apportionment  as in Australian Guarantee   FCA       FCR    The question of referability is not dictated by any principle of matching  Given the approach of the Full Court in Woolcombers to the virtually identical question  I would conclude that the outgoing incurred was referable to the   year of income   A deduction is referable to the year in which the advantage it secures is enjoyed  Coles Myer   CLR at   and New Zealand Flax at      The advantage secured and enjoyed was the binding of the vendor to an unconditional contract  in the sense first discussed  creating contractual rights capable of protection by a court of equity conformable with their extent  Stern v McArthur  This occurred in the   year of income

careful analysis of the course of authority from New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   to Commissioner of Taxation v Mercantile Mutual Insurance  Workers  Compensation  Ltd   FCA         FCR    Since   the Full Court of this Court and the High Court has each undertaken an analysis of the relevant authorities in CityLink Melbourne Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   and Commissioner of Taxation v CityLink Melbourne Limited   HCA         CLR     In the High Court in CityLink   HCA       CLR     Crennan J  with whose reasons Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ agreed  referred at     without disapproval  to the synthesis essayed by Hill J in Ogilvy   Mather  In her Honour s reasons  at     some analysis of the jurisprudence was made upon which the respondent here relied  After referring in   to New Zealand Flax   HCA       CLR   and James Flood   HCA       CLR   and  in particular  to the notions of  definitely committed  and  completely subjected  her Honour referred to the reasons of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR    The reference to that decision is important in that the Chief Justice  with whose reasons Mason J agreed generally  and Aickin and Wilson JJ agreed  together with the reasons of Mason J  said at   that the language of Dixon J in New Zealand Flax  need  ed  to be carefully perused and applied  and then went on to say the following       Granted that exhaustive definition of what may be denoted by the word  incurred  in s     may not be possible  there can be no warrant for treating a liability which has not  come home  in the year of income  in the sense of a pecuniary obligation which has become due  as having been incurred in that year  Sir John Latham s language in Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at p   clearly enough indicates that to satisfy the word  incurred  in s     the liability must be  presently incurred and due though not yet discharged   The  liability  of which Sir John speaks is of necessity a pecuniary liability and the word  presently  refers to the year of income in respect of which a deduction is claimed  It may not disqualify the liability as a deduction that  though due  it may be paid in a later year  That part of Sir Owen Dixon s statement in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     CLR  at p   which presently needs emphasis is that the word  incurred  in s      does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than pending  threatened or expected  and I would for myself add  no matter how certain it is in the year of income that that loss or expenditure will occur in the future      The language of Crennan J in   can be seen to revivify this passage from Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR   which did not form an express part of Hill J s synthesis in Ogilvy   Mather   though it was referred to in Raymor   It can be seen as a reiteration  perhaps  of the fourth proposition in Ogilvy   Mather supported by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR     a case in which Nilsen Developments and Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   were distinguished  Though Nilsen Developments was in respect of long service leave obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing   That said  the words of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development   CLR at     using the phrase of Latham CJ in Emu Bay Railway Co   CLR at   applied by Crennan J in CityLink   HCA       CLR   that the liability must be  presently incurred and due  in the context of the liability to pay the purchase moneys for the acquisition of land are a powerful basis to conclude that the outgoing  being the payment of the purchase moneys  has not been incurred at exchange and will not be incurred until settlement  To apply McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  Sunbird Plaza and Gasparin  a distinction could be made between the promise to pay the purchase price as part of an executory contract and the liability to pay the purchase price which accrues  and can be seen to be due  only at settlement  Thus  it could be said that the liability to pay the outgoing is not  incurred and due  just as the income for the seller is not derived  Gasparin   FCR   referred toCommissioner of Taxation v Mercantile Mutual Insurance  Workers  Compensation  Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases

in Ogilvy   Mather   ATR     the Full Court in Raymor   FCR at    Davies  Gummow and Hill JJ  expressed the relevant principles as follows    A loss or outgoing to be deductible under s   must be incurred in the year of income  What is meant by the word  incurred  in this context has been the subject of considerable discussion in the cases  Central to that discussion is the classic statement of Dixon J in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    HCA         CLR   at   referred to with approval by the court in Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v James Flood Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    His Honour there said     To come within that provision there must be a loss or outgoing actually incurred   Incurred  does not mean only defrayed  discharged or borne  but rather it includes encountered  run into  or fallen upon  It is unsafe to attempt exhaustive definitions of a conception intended to have such a various or multifarious application  But it does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than impending  threatened or expected     Some propositions are now well established  Outgoings may be incurred though the sum in question has not been paid or the liability discharged  New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd  supra  and James Flood Pty Ltd  supra   An outgoing may be incurred notwithstanding that it may be defeasible  Commonwealth Aluminium Corp Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      FLR   at     cited with approval in Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd   FCA         FCR     per Toohey J  at   RACV Insurance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    VR   and Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      FLR    An outgoing may be incurred notwithstanding that the amount of that outgoing is payable in the future  It is not necessary that the outgoing be one both due and owing at the time it is  encountered  James Flood Pty Ltd at   Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd  supra   However   a liability which has not  come home  in the year of income  in the sense of a pecuniary obligation which has become due  will not have been incurred until the year of income in which there is a presently existing liability  Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    HCA         CLR     per Barwick CJ  at   and per Gibbs J  at    As the Australian Guarantee Corp case demonstrates  evidence of commercial and accountancy practice may be relevant in determining whether an outgoing is referable to the accounting period in which it is claimed although such evidence will not be a substitute for the words of s   itself  per Toohey J  at     per McGregor J  at     see also Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      ALR   at      It may be noted that in the present case no evidence of this kind was adduced by the Commissioner   By and large this expression of principle is consistent with Ogilvy   Mather  though the propositions in the sixth bullet point in Ogilvy   Mather can be seen to be somewhat more qualified than as expounded in Raymor    In the High Court in CityLink   HCA       CLR     Crennan J  with whose reasons Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ agreed  referred at     without disapproval  to the synthesis essayed by Hill J in Ogilvy   Mather

  CLR   and  in particular  to the notions of  definitely committed  and  completely subjected  her Honour referred to the reasons of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR    The reference to that decision is important in that the Chief Justice  with whose reasons Mason J agreed generally  and Aickin and Wilson JJ agreed  together with the reasons of Mason J  said at   that the language of Dixon J in New Zealand Flax  need  ed  to be carefully perused and applied  and then went on to say the following       Granted that exhaustive definition of what may be denoted by the word  incurred  in s     may not be possible  there can be no warrant for treating a liability which has not  come home  in the year of income  in the sense of a pecuniary obligation which has become due  as having been incurred in that year  Sir John Latham s language in Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at p   clearly enough indicates that to satisfy the word  incurred  in s     the liability must be  presently incurred and due though not yet discharged   The  liability  of which Sir John speaks is of necessity a pecuniary liability and the word  presently  refers to the year of income in respect of which a deduction is claimed  It may not disqualify the liability as a deduction that  though due  it may be paid in a later year  That part of Sir Owen Dixon s statement in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     CLR  at p   which presently needs emphasis is that the word  incurred  in s      does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than pending  threatened or expected  and I would for myself add  no matter how certain it is in the year of income that that loss or expenditure will occur in the future      The language of Crennan J in   can be seen to revivify this passage from Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR   which did not form an express part of Hill J s synthesis in Ogilvy   Mather   though it was referred to in Raymor   It can be seen as a reiteration  perhaps  of the fourth proposition in Ogilvy   Mather supported by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR     a case in which Nilsen Developments and Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   were distinguished  Though Nilsen Developments was in respect of long service leave obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing   This argument and conclusion must contend  however  with a number of authorities  The first is Raymor   FCA       FCR    The taxpayer sold and distributed plumbing goods  including copper tubing  It purchased most of its supplies of copper tubing from a company  MML  for resale  The managing director of the taxpayer agreed with an officer of MML in the last days of each of three years of income  Each agreement was concerned with the purchase of a significant amount of copper tubing with payment being made in advance of delivery  It was in effect a forward purchase agreement with a discounted price and rise and fall clause  The contract was entered and payment was made before the end of June  with delivery in the next financial year   In Raymor  the Commissioner argued that where an outgoing was incurred for trading stock  the stock must be on hand at the end of the year of income  This mirrored when the income was derived from disposal of trading stock  J Rowe and Son   CLR    The Commissioner argued that the outgoings were properly to be regarded as characterised as having been incurred in the year of income not for trading stock or in the purchase of trading stock  but for the right to acquire trading stock on capital account  Having referred to the principles dealing with  incurred   see above  the Court concluded that the outgoing was incurred in the year of income  saying at     It follows  therefore  that at the point of time at which the respondent bound itself as a party to each of the contracts  and so became committed to pay the amount shown in each contract to MML  it incurred the respective amount  notwithstanding that its obligation could be increased or reduced under the rise and fall provisions of the contract  cl    Payment thereafter was strictly irrelevant to the time at which the outgoing was incurred   It merely operated to discharge in the year of income the outgoing already incurred in that year  In this sense it is strictly incorrect to speak of the payment here in question as a prepayment  A presently existing obligation had arisen and had been discharged       emphasis added  The Full Court rejected the argument  In so doing  it referred to and relied on the two passages from Raymor   FCR at   and   cited earlier  This was to support the conclusion that the entry into the obligation to pay for future goods was sufficient for there to be an incurring of the liability to pay for them  even if the obligation was defeasible  Coles Myer   HCA       CLR   was then referred to  At   FCR at     the Full Court expressed its reasons fully for coming to the view that there was an accrued obligation or present liability imposed by definite contractual commitment  The Court said that it was not necessary for the taxpayer to have an interest in the wool  though it was recognised that equity would give protection to the taxpayer s interests  Stern v McArthur   HCA       CLR   was referred to  The Court rejected the argument of the Commissioner based on the requirement of delivery to create a present and accrued liability to pay  It agreed with Lee J s analysis  The Full Court did conclude  however  with the following passage at   FCR at     In our view  much will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case at hand  If the defeasibility takes the form of a contingency such as drought or a similar frustrating event which ordinarily would be implied as a matter of business efficacy  it is difficult to argue that by reason of the existence of this contingency  no liability to pay the price has accrued   As I have said earlier  the application of the principles in Sunbird Plaza to the question of  incurred  has force  unconstrained by authority  So to conclude would lead to a certain harmony in timing between recognition of derivation of income and the incurring of an outgoing  It would give expression to the long recognised underlying legal analysis in cases such as McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  and Sunbird Plaza   It would conform more clearly with the views of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR    Nevertheless as a single judge  I am clearly bound by Raymor and Woolcombers  The essence of the argument  as I apprehend it  that was put to the Full Court in Woolcombers   was put to me  though  perhaps  in a somewhat more developed form  Unless the last passage that I have quoted above entitles me to find differently  on the authority of both Raymor and Woolcombers   I should find that the obligation to pay the purchase price on settlement was incurred at the time of the exchange of contracts   In my view  I am bound to apply the analysis found in Raymor and Woolcombers   Doing so by reference to the particular contract here  I conclude that the obligation to pay the residue was incurred in the   year of income applieddiscussedCommissioner of Taxation v Woolcombers  WA  Pty Limited   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In particular  reliance was

Administrative Appeals Tribunal which had seen no distinction between a sale and delivery and giving time to pay by way of credit  on the one hand  and a contract such as the one there to buy land to be paid for at settlement on the other  von Doussa J said at       With respect to the Tribunal  I am unable to agree that there is no difference in the present case from a Department store sale of articles on   days terms  In that example there has been a delivery of the articles sold  The contract of sale is no longer executory  A debt has accrued due  the debtor has become subject to an obligation to pay a sum certain in money even though the debt may not be payable forthwith  cf Carden at       emphasis added   Notions of loss of dispositive power over the goods were also important  see Gasparin   FCR at     At first instance  Lee J concluded that the obligation to pay the purchase price of all the wool on the forward contracts had been incurred in the year of income  The argument of the Commissioner was not that the estimate made of the sums meant that there was no incurrence  Rather  it was argued that the liability to pay had not  come home   Expert accounting evidence was led by both sides  something which did not occur here   The point of difference between the accountants was the truth and fairness of the accounts treating the payments as incurred or not  The expert called by the Commissioner relied heavily on the matching principle  Lee J put this evidence into context at   ALR at     Evidence from expert accountants does not supply the proper construction of s   of the Act but the evidence may assist the court to identify  and to understand the commercial significance of  the facts to which the subsection  duly construed  is to be applied

relied  After referring in   to New Zealand Flax   HCA       CLR   and James Flood   HCA       CLR   and  in particular  to the notions of  definitely committed  and  completely subjected  her Honour referred to the reasons of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR    The reference to that decision is important in that the Chief Justice  with whose reasons Mason J agreed generally  and Aickin and Wilson JJ agreed  together with the reasons of Mason J  said at   that the language of Dixon J in New Zealand Flax  need  ed  to be carefully perused and applied  and then went on to say the following       Granted that exhaustive definition of what may be denoted by the word  incurred  in s     may not be possible  there can be no warrant for treating a liability which has not  come home  in the year of income  in the sense of a pecuniary obligation which has become due  as having been incurred in that year  Sir John Latham s language in Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at p   clearly enough indicates that to satisfy the word  incurred  in s     the liability must be  presently incurred and due though not yet discharged   The  liability  of which Sir John speaks is of necessity a pecuniary liability and the word  presently  refers to the year of income in respect of which a deduction is claimed  It may not disqualify the liability as a deduction that  though due  it may be paid in a later year  That part of Sir Owen Dixon s statement in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     CLR  at p   which presently needs emphasis is that the word  incurred  in s      does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than pending  threatened or expected  and I would for myself add  no matter how certain it is in the year of income that that loss or expenditure will occur in the future      The language of Crennan J in   can be seen to revivify this passage from Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR   which did not form an express part of Hill J s synthesis in Ogilvy   Mather   though it was referred to in Raymor   It can be seen as a reiteration  perhaps  of the fourth proposition in Ogilvy   Mather supported by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR     a case in which Nilsen Developments and Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   were distinguished  Though Nilsen Developments was in respect of long service leave obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing   That said  the words of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development   CLR at     using the phrase of Latham CJ in Emu Bay Railway Co   CLR at   applied by Crennan J in CityLink   HCA       CLR   that the liability must be  presently incurred and due  in the context of the liability to pay the purchase moneys for the acquisition of land are a powerful basis to conclude that the outgoing  being the payment of the purchase moneys  has not been incurred at exchange and will not be incurred until settlement  To apply McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  Sunbird Plaza and Gasparin  a distinction could be made between the promise to pay the purchase price as part of an executory contract and the liability to pay the purchase price which accrues  and can be seen to be due  only at settlement  Thus  it could be said that the liability to pay the outgoing is not  incurred and due  just as the income for the seller is not derived  Gasparin   FCR   referred

Raymor   FCR at    Davies  Gummow and Hill JJ  expressed the relevant principles as follows    A loss or outgoing to be deductible under s   must be incurred in the year of income  What is meant by the word  incurred  in this context has been the subject of considerable discussion in the cases  Central to that discussion is the classic statement of Dixon J in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    HCA         CLR   at   referred to with approval by the court in Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v James Flood Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    His Honour there said     To come within that provision there must be a loss or outgoing actually incurred   Incurred  does not mean only defrayed  discharged or borne  but rather it includes encountered  run into  or fallen upon  It is unsafe to attempt exhaustive definitions of a conception intended to have such a various or multifarious application  But it does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than impending  threatened or expected     Some propositions are now well established  Outgoings may be incurred though the sum in question has not been paid or the liability discharged  New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd  supra  and James Flood Pty Ltd  supra   An outgoing may be incurred notwithstanding that it may be defeasible  Commonwealth Aluminium Corp Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      FLR

and Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      FLR    An outgoing may be incurred notwithstanding that the amount of that outgoing is payable in the future  It is not necessary that the outgoing be one both due and owing at the time it is  encountered  James Flood Pty Ltd at   Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd  supra   However   a liability which has not  come home  in the year of income  in the sense of a pecuniary obligation which has become due  will not have been incurred until the year of income in which there is a presently existing liability  Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    HCA         CLR     per Barwick CJ  at   and per Gibbs J  at    As the Australian Guarantee Corp case demonstrates  evidence of commercial and accountancy practice may be relevant in determining whether an outgoing is referable to the accounting period in which it is claimed although such evidence will not be a substitute for the words of s   itself  per Toohey J  at     per McGregor J  at     see also Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      ALR   at      It may be noted that in the present case no evidence of this kind was adduced by the Commissioner   In the High Court in CityLink   HCA       CLR     Crennan J  with whose reasons Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ agreed  referred at     without disapproval  to the synthesis essayed by Hill J in Ogilvy   Mather  In her Honour s reasons  at     some analysis of the jurisprudence was made upon which

  FCA         FCR     a case in which Nilsen Developments and Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   were distinguished  Though Nilsen Developments was in respect of long service leave obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing   This was not a liability that accrued day to day  It was a once and for all contractual undertaking  As in Woolcombers   FCR at     there is here no complexity  as in New Zealand Flax   HCA       CLR     no day to day accrual  as in Coles Myer   HCA       CLR   or other appropriate financial apportionment  as in Australian Guarantee   FCA       FCR    The question of referability is not dictated by any principle of matching  Given the approach of the Full Court in Woolcombers to the virtually identical question  I would conclude that the outgoing incurred was referable to the   year of income discussedGasparin v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   These cases were applied by von Doussa J  with whose reasons Jenkinson and Spender JJ agreed  in Gasparin v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR    That case concerned the question as to when income was derived from the sale of allotments of land  It was held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement  After referring to McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   Sunbird Plaza and Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Limited v Watson   HCA         CLR   at      as to which case  see below  von Doussa J said at   that these cases reflected a general rule about unsettled contracts of sale  His Honours said that at the end of the year of income in question         there were no debts owing by the purchasers to the joint venturers  In each case the promise to pay the balance of the purchase price  at settlement  remained executory until settlement occurred at which time a conveyance was executed  accepted and delivered to the purchaser  Until these events there was no accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to pay the balance of the purchase price     emphasis added  These comments were made in the context of derivation of income on an accruals basis  a different though obviously cognate subject matter from the notion of incurring in s   or s      In the context of Carden s Case  Commissioner of Taxes  SA  v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR   and J Rowe and Son Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      CLR   and in the absence of evidence about business or accounting practice  von Doussa J said  at   that stress should be placed on the prominence given in both Carden and Rowe to there being a debt in existence   von Doussa J rejected the approach of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which had seen no distinction between a sale and delivery and giving time to pay by way of credit  on the one hand  and a contract such as the one there to buy land to be paid for at settlement on the other  von Doussa J said at       With respect to the Tribunal  I am unable to agree that there is no difference in the present case from a Department store sale of articles on   days terms  In that example there has been a delivery of the articles sold  The contract of sale is no longer executory  A debt has accrued due  the debtor has become subject to an obligation to pay a sum certain in money even though the debt may not be payable forthwith  cf Carden at       emphasis added   Notions of loss of dispositive power over the goods were also important  see Gasparin   FCR at     Gasparin and the cases referred to therein are not determinative of the question as to what  incurred  means for the purposes of     of the   Act  They do reveal  however  the use  in a cognate area  of the distinction between a promise in an executory contract  and the debt  that is the present obligation to pay the purchase money  accruing on settlement  whether payable then or after some agreed time if credit be given  In this context  it is important to note that von Doussa J  though dealing with the contract for the sale of land  referred to Automatic Fire Sprinklers   HCA       CLR    That case concerned a question of wrongful dismissal under wartime regulations  Nevertheless  despite this context  what was said by Dixon J at     remains important for understanding the relationship between the executory contract and the entitlement to the price of the property or services contracted for    In certain forms of executory contract where the promise of one party is to pay the other money in consideration of his transferring property  of his doing work  of his serving the former as his master  and  perhaps  of his providing other tangible things or definite services  the money to be paid is regarded as the price of or reward for the property or service when and so often as the transfer of the one or the performance of the other affords an executed consideration  In these contracts the promise to pay the price or reward is not construed as a simple obligation to pay a sum or sums at a future date supported solely by a consideration consisting in the corresponding promise to transfer the property  do the work  serve  or provide the things or services by the other party  so that a mere readiness and willingness on the one side of the latter to perform his part is enough to entitle him to the payments  notwithstanding that  whether owing to the fault of the former  or without fault on either side  the property is not transferred  the work is not done  the relation of master and servant ceases  or the things or services are not provided  The most familiar example is that of the sale of goods  There the common understanding of an agreement to sell is that it is the goods and not the promises to deliver that are to be paid for  The result is that  if the seller tenders goods in accordance with his contract but the buyer rejects them in breach of his contract  the seller cannot sue for the price  his remedy is for unliquidated damages for non acceptance       That said  the words of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development   CLR at     using the phrase of Latham CJ in Emu Bay Railway Co   CLR at   applied by Crennan J in CityLink   HCA       CLR   that the liability must be  presently incurred and due  in the context of the liability to pay the purchase moneys for the acquisition of land are a powerful basis to conclude that the outgoing  being the payment of the purchase moneys  has not been incurred at exchange and will not be incurred until settlement  To apply McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  Sunbird Plaza and Gasparin  a distinction could be made between the promise to pay the purchase price as part of an executory contract and the liability to pay the purchase price which accrues  and can be seen to be due  only at settlement  Thus  it could be said that the liability to pay the outgoing is not  incurred and due  just as the income for the seller is not derived  Gasparin   FCR     In Woolcombers the taxpayer  in the year of income  entered forward contracts for the purchase of wool that had been shorn or was yet to be shorn  The standard form contracts provided for property in the wool to pass from the woolgrower to the taxpayer upon payment  being   days after delivery  The contract provided expressly for the possibility of the grower needing to dispose of the sheep because of drought  flood or disease  In such circumstances  failing agreement as to how many sheep to sell  the matter of disposal would be the subject of arbitration  Thus  the promise to pay for wool to be delivered in the future was made in the year of income    The wool was delivered and paid for in the following year of income  An indemnity as to delivery and quality was given by the grower  In the previous   years  all such forward contracts  with one exception  had been completed by the growers  The contracts were to meet contracts by way of on sales for export entered by companies related to the taxpayer   It is to be recalled  at this point  that the principle dealt with in Gasparin and Sunbird Plaza was not limited to contracts for the sale of land  The discussion by Dixon J in Automatic Fire Sprinklers   CLR at     made that clear  citedIbrahim v Pham   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  In due course  on   February   a Judge of this Court  Goldberg J  made a declaration that

  emphasis added   Notions of loss of dispositive power over the goods were also important  see Gasparin   FCR at     In Raymor  the Commissioner argued that where an outgoing was incurred for trading stock  the stock must be on hand at the end of the year of income  This mirrored when the income was derived from disposal of trading stock  J Rowe and Son   CLR    The Commissioner argued that the outgoings were properly to be regarded as characterised as having been incurred in the year of income not for trading stock or in the purchase of trading stock  but for the right to acquire trading stock on capital account  Having referred to the principles dealing with  incurred   see above  the Court concluded that the outgoing was incurred in the year of income  saying at     It follows  therefore  that at the point of time at which the respondent bound itself as a party to each of the contracts  and so became committed to pay the amount shown in each contract to MML  it incurred the respective amount  notwithstanding that its obligation could be increased or reduced under the rise and fall provisions of the contract  cl    Payment thereafter was strictly irrelevant to the time at which the outgoing was incurred   It merely operated to discharge in the year of income the outgoing already incurred in that year  In this sense it is strictly incorrect to speak of the payment here in question as a prepayment  A presently existing obligation had arisen and had been discharged       emphasis added citedKarl Suleman Enterprizes Pty Limited  in liq  v Babanour   NSWCA         ACSR

cases cth HCA  html  The proper identification of this promise and its relationship to the payment of the purchase price is to be found in a number of cases of the highest authority  In McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Dixon J  as he then was  quoted Sir John Salmond in Ruddenklau v Charlesworth   NZLR   at     in expressing the relevant principle      If the purchaser refuses to complete the executory contract to buy the land  the vendor is not entitled to sue for the purchase money as a debt   He is entitled to sue for specific performance or for damages for the loss of his bargain     emphasis added   Sir John Salmond continued    It is only when the contract has been completed by the execution and acceptance of a conveyance that unpaid purchase money may become a debt and can be recovered accordingly     emphasis added   This general rule could be rebutted by clear intention in the contract for the payment of the purchase price  or part of it  on a fixed day  other than the day for completion   That the obligation  subject to a revealed contrary intention  to pay the purchase price accrues fully only on settlement was reiterated in Sunbird Plaza Pty Limited v Maloney   HCA         CLR    In that case  the vendors sought recovery against guarantors of a contract for the sale of land in respect of which an order for specific performance had been made consequent upon repudiation by the purchaser  The proper construction of the guarantee was held not to support a conclusion that the guarantors were liable  Mason CJ  with whom Deane  Dawson and Toohey JJ agreed  said the following at       The general rule  stated by Dixon J in McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd   HCA         CLR     at p   is that a vendor of land cannot sue for the price before the contract is completed by conveyance  unless the price is expressed to be payable on a fixed day  not being the day fixed for completion  Here the balance of the purchase price was payable  upon settlement   Settlement has not taken place and there has been no conveyance of the property sold  Once this is accepted  the appellant is faced with a daunting task in making good the submission that the respondent guarantors are liable under their joint and several guarantee to pay the balance of the purchase price and interest thereon  notwithstanding the absence of an accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to make the payment      emphasis added   In the same case  Gaudron J  with whose reasons in this respect Mason CJ  and so also the other members of the Court  agreed  at     also referred to McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   HCA       CLR     Thus  whilst there is a promise in an executory contract to pay the balance of the purchase price on settlement  there is no  debt    McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   and no  accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to make the payment   see Mason CJ in Sunbird Plaza   CLR at   until completion  This is not to deny  however  that the purchaser s interests will be protected in equity consistent with the nature and extent of the terms of the contract of sale  Stern v McArthur   HCA         CLR   at     and that the promise can be otherwise seen as unqualified   These cases were applied by von Doussa J  with whose reasons Jenkinson and Spender JJ agreed  in Gasparin v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR    That case concerned the question as to when income was derived from the sale of allotments of land  It was held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement  After referring to McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   Sunbird Plaza and Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Limited v Watson   HCA         CLR   at      as to which case  see below  von Doussa J said at   that these cases reflected a general rule about unsettled contracts of sale  His Honours said that at the end of the year of income in question         there were no debts owing by the purchasers to the joint venturers  In each case the promise to pay the balance of the purchase price  at settlement  remained executory until settlement occurred at which time a conveyance was executed  accepted and delivered to the purchaser  Until these events there was no accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to pay the balance of the purchase price     emphasis added discussedMerrill Lynch International  Australia  Limited v

subjected  her Honour referred to the reasons of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR    The reference to that decision is important in that the Chief Justice  with whose reasons Mason J agreed generally  and Aickin and Wilson JJ agreed  together with the reasons of Mason J  said at   that the language of Dixon J in New Zealand Flax  need  ed  to be carefully perused and applied  and then went on to say the following       Granted that exhaustive definition of what may be denoted by the word  incurred  in s     may not be possible  there can be no warrant for treating a liability which has not  come home  in the year of income  in the sense of a pecuniary obligation which has become due  as having been incurred in that year  Sir John Latham s language in Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at p   clearly enough indicates that to satisfy the word  incurred  in s     the liability must be  presently incurred and due though not yet discharged   The  liability  of which Sir John speaks is of necessity a pecuniary liability and the word  presently  refers to the year of income in respect of which a deduction is claimed  It may not disqualify the liability as a deduction that  though due  it may be paid in a later year  That part of Sir Owen Dixon s statement in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     CLR  at p   which presently needs emphasis is that the word  incurred  in s      does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than pending  threatened or expected  and I would for myself add  no matter how certain it is in the year of income that that loss or expenditure will occur in the future      The language of

  FCA         FCR     a case in which Nilsen Developments and Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   were distinguished  Though Nilsen Developments was in respect of long service leave obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing   This was not a liability that accrued day to day  It was a once and for all contractual undertaking  As in Woolcombers   FCR at     there is here no complexity  as in New Zealand Flax   HCA       CLR     no day to day accrual  as in Coles Myer   HCA       CLR   or other appropriate financial apportionment  as in Australian Guarantee   FCA       FCR    The question of referability is not dictated by any principle of matching  Given the approach of the Full Court in Woolcombers to the virtually identical question  I would conclude that the outgoing incurred was referable to the   year of income   A deduction is referable to the year in which the advantage it secures is enjoyed  Coles Myer   CLR at   and New Zealand Flax at      The advantage secured and enjoyed was the binding of the vendor to an unconditional contract  in the sense first discussed  creating contractual rights capable of protection by a court of equity conformable with

obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing   After this reference to Nilsen Development in   Crennan J at   referred to Deane J in Coles Myer   HCA       CLR     quoting the following passage of Deane J s reasons at   CLR at      T he weight of authority supports the conclusion that  depending upon the circumstances  a liability to pay money can constitute  or give rise to  a  loss or outgoing  which is  incurred  within the meaning of that subsection notwithstanding that the money is not payable until a future time and that the obligation to pay it is theoretically defeasible or contingent in that it is subject to a condition which remains unfulfilled   Footnotes omitted      Crennan J continued at     Deane J considered that the critical question was whether the taxpayer was  as a practical matter  definitively committed or completely subjected to discharge of the liability in the future   HCA         CLR   at      His Honour recognised that on some facts it would be apparent that a condition giving rise to a theoretical contingency could be treated  for practical purposes  as certain to be satisfied   HCA         CLR   at       That said  the words of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Development   CLR at     using the phrase of Latham CJ in Emu Bay Railway Co   CLR at   applied by Crennan J in CityLink   HCA       CLR   that the liability must be  presently incurred and due  in the context of the liability to pay the purchase moneys for the acquisition of land are a powerful basis to conclude that the outgoing  being the payment of the purchase moneys  has not been incurred at exchange and will not be incurred until settlement  To apply McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  Sunbird Plaza and Gasparin  a distinction could be made between the promise to pay the purchase price as part of an executory contract and the liability to pay the purchase price which accrues  and can be seen to be due  only at settlement  Thus  it could be said that the liability to pay the outgoing is not  incurred and due  just as the income for the seller is not derived  Gasparin   FCR     As I have said earlier  the application of the principles in Sunbird Plaza to the question of  incurred  has force  unconstrained by authority  So to conclude would lead to a certain harmony in timing between recognition of derivation of income and the incurring of an outgoing  It would give expression to the long recognised underlying legal analysis in cases such as McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  and Sunbird Plaza   It would conform more clearly with the views of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR    Nevertheless as a single judge  I am clearly bound by Raymor and Woolcombers  The essence of the argument  as I apprehend it  that was put to the Full Court in Woolcombers   was put to me  though  perhaps  in a somewhat more developed form  Unless the last passage that I have quoted above entitles me to find differently  on the authority of both Raymor and Woolcombers   I should find that the obligation to pay the purchase price on settlement was incurred at the time of the exchange of contracts discussedOgilvy   Mather Pty Limited v Federal

Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR   which did not form an express part of Hill J s synthesis in Ogilvy   Mather   though it was referred to in Raymor   It can be seen as a reiteration  perhaps  of the fourth proposition in Ogilvy   Mather supported by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR     a case in which Nilsen Developments and Emu Bay Railway Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   were distinguished  Though Nilsen Developments was in respect of long service leave obligations in a specific statutory context  it is clear that the lack of a liability to make a payment until leave was taken or cessation of employment meant that there was no incurring of the outgoing referred toPerri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The above said  there was nothing qualified or inchoate about the promise in special condition   of the contract  There was no condition precedent to the coming into existence of the promise there stated  It was  from exchange of contracts  a legal obligation intended to have effect  but it is to be construed  as its words make plain  as an obligation to pay a certain time after tender of the transfer on settlement  After the contract was made  it was a promise that was part of an executory contract  but  of course  it could not be withdrawn  The point of the above authorities is that until delivery  here  of the transfer  there is no accrued obligation to pay  no debt  What exists beforehand is a promise to pay  but in one sense dependent or conditional upon delivery  Delivery can  perhaps  be seen as the condition precedent to performance  cf Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR    The use  however  of the words  conditional  or  unconditional  in this context is apt to cause confusion  A better way of expressing the analysis from the above cases is that the mutual promises  here  to build and transfer  on the one hand  and to pay  on the other  are unconditional  but dependent  and calling for concurrent performance  Neither promise was conditional on a contingency  they were mutually dependent  see generally Carter JW and Harland DJ  Contract Law in Australia   th ed  Butterworths    at     and     It is necessary to seek to place this analysis into the context of the words of s     and their surrounding jurisprudence   Section     of the   Act is  relevantly  in the following terms    You can deduct from your assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that     a  it is incurred in gaining or producing your assessable income  or    b  it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income     emphasis added referred toRuddenklau v Charlesworth   NZLR   The proper identification of this promise and its relationship to the payment of the purchase price is to be found in a number of cases of the highest authority  In McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Dixon J  as he then was  quoted Sir John Salmond in Ruddenklau v Charlesworth   NZLR   at     in expressing the relevant principle      If the purchaser refuses to complete the executory contract to buy the land  the vendor is not entitled to sue for the purchase money as a debt   He is entitled to sue for specific performance or for damages for the loss of his bargain     emphasis added   Sir John Salmond continued    It is only when the contract has been completed by the execution and acceptance of a conveyance that unpaid purchase money may become a debt and can be recovered accordingly     emphasis added   This general rule could be rebutted by clear intention in the contract for the payment of the purchase price  or part of it  on a fixed day  other than the day for completion referred toStern v McArthur   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Thus  whilst there is a promise in an executory contract to pay the balance of the purchase price on settlement  there is no  debt    McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   and no  accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to make the payment   see Mason CJ in Sunbird Plaza   CLR at   until completion  This is not to deny  however  that the purchaser s interests will be protected in equity consistent with the nature and extent of the terms of the contract of sale  Stern v McArthur   HCA         CLR   at     and that the promise can be otherwise seen as unqualified   The Full Court rejected the argument  In so doing  it referred to and relied on the two passages from Raymor   FCR at   and   cited earlier  This was to support the conclusion that the entry into the obligation to pay for future goods was sufficient for there to be an incurring of the liability to pay for them  even if the obligation was defeasible  Coles Myer   HCA       CLR   was then referred to  At   FCR at     the Full Court expressed its reasons fully for coming to the view that there was an accrued obligation or present liability imposed by definite contractual commitment  The Court said that it was not necessary for the taxpayer to have an interest in the wool  though it was recognised that equity would give protection to the taxpayer s interests  Stern v McArthur   HCA       CLR   was referred to  The Court rejected the argument of the Commissioner based on the requirement of delivery to create a present and accrued liability to pay  It agreed with Lee J s analysis  The Full Court did conclude  however  with the following passage at   FCR at     In our view  much will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case at hand  If the defeasibility takes the form of a contingency such as drought or a similar frustrating event which ordinarily would be implied as a matter of business efficacy  it is difficult to argue that by reason of the existence of this contingency  no liability to pay the price has accrued   A deduction is referable to the year in which the advantage it secures is enjoyed  Coles Myer   CLR at   and New Zealand Flax at      The advantage secured and enjoyed was the binding of the vendor to an unconditional contract  in the sense first discussed  creating contractual rights capable of protection by a court of equity conformable with their extent  Stern v McArthur  This occurred in the   year of income discussedSunbird Plaza Pty Limited v Maloney   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  That the obligation  subject to a revealed contrary intention  to pay the purchase price accrues fully only on settlement was reiterated in Sunbird Plaza Pty Limited v Maloney   HCA         CLR    In that case  the vendors sought recovery against guarantors of a contract for the sale of land in respect of which an order for specific performance had been made consequent upon repudiation by the purchaser  The proper construction of the guarantee was held not to support a conclusion that the guarantors were liable  Mason CJ  with whom Deane  Dawson and Toohey JJ agreed  said the following at       The general rule  stated by Dixon J in McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd   HCA         CLR     at p   is that a vendor of land cannot sue for the price before the contract is completed by conveyance  unless the price is expressed to be payable on a fixed day  not being the day fixed for completion  Here the balance of the purchase price was payable  upon settlement   Settlement has not taken place and there has been no conveyance of the property sold  Once this is accepted  the appellant is faced with a daunting task in making good the submission that the respondent guarantors are liable under their joint and several guarantee to pay the balance of the purchase price and interest thereon  notwithstanding the absence of an accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to make the payment      emphasis added   In the same case  Gaudron J  with whose reasons in this respect Mason CJ  and so also the other members of the Court  agreed  at     also referred to McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   HCA       CLR     Thus  whilst there is a promise in an executory contract to pay the balance of the purchase price on settlement  there is no  debt    McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   and no  accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to make the payment   see Mason CJ in Sunbird Plaza   CLR at   until completion  This is not to deny  however  that the purchaser s interests will be protected in equity consistent with the nature and extent of the terms of the contract of sale  Stern v McArthur   HCA         CLR   at     and that the promise can be otherwise seen as unqualified   These cases were applied by von Doussa J  with whose reasons Jenkinson and Spender JJ agreed  in Gasparin v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR    That case concerned the question as to when income was derived from the sale of allotments of land  It was held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement  After referring to McDonald v Dennys Lascelles   Sunbird Plaza and Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Limited v Watson   HCA         CLR   at      as to which case  see below  von Doussa J said at   that these cases reflected a general rule about unsettled contracts of sale  His Honours said that at the end of the year of income in question         there were no debts owing by the purchasers to the joint venturers  In each case the promise to pay the balance of the purchase price  at settlement  remained executory until settlement occurred at which time a conveyance was executed  accepted and delivered to the purchaser  Until these events there was no accrued liability on the part of the purchaser to pay the balance of the purchase price     emphasis added  In Woolcombers the taxpayer  in the year of income  entered forward contracts for the purchase of wool that had been shorn or was yet to be shorn  The standard form contracts provided for property in the wool to pass from the woolgrower to the taxpayer upon payment  being   days after delivery  The contract provided expressly for the possibility of the grower needing to dispose of the sheep because of drought  flood or disease  In such circumstances  failing agreement as to how many sheep to sell  the matter of disposal would be the subject of arbitration  Thus  the promise to pay for wool to be delivered in the future was made in the year of income    The wool was delivered and paid for in the following year of income  An indemnity as to delivery and quality was given by the grower  In the previous   years  all such forward contracts  with one exception  had been completed by the growers  The contracts were to meet contracts by way of on sales for export entered by companies related to the taxpayer   It is to be recalled  at this point  that the principle dealt with in Gasparin and Sunbird Plaza was not limited to contracts for the sale of land  The discussion by Dixon J in Automatic Fire Sprinklers   CLR at     made that clear   As I have said earlier  the application of the principles in Sunbird Plaza to the question of  incurred  has force  unconstrained by authority  So to conclude would lead to a certain harmony in timing between recognition of derivation of income and the incurring of an outgoing  It would give expression to the long recognised underlying legal analysis in cases such as McDonald v Dennys Lascelles  Automatic Fire Sprinklers  and Sunbird Plaza   It would conform more clearly with the views of Barwick CJ in Nilsen Developments   HCA       CLR    Nevertheless as a single judge  I am clearly bound by Raymor and Woolcombers  The essence of the argument  as I apprehend it  that was put to the Full Court in Woolcombers   was put to me  though  perhaps  in a somewhat more developed form  Unless the last passage that I have quoted above entitles me to find differently  on the authority of both Raymor and Woolcombers   I should find that the obligation to pay the purchase price on settlement was incurred at the time of the exchange of contracts referred toWalstern Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On the above conclusions  no question of penalty arises  I should  however  express my views  Mr Malouf was cross examined with some vigour  I do not criticise counsel  The object was  amongst others  to show that Mr Malouf entered the scheme without giving proper consideration to the issues that might bear upon the taxation treatment and his returns  I disagree  The Commissioner was responsible for the ruling which clearly made the outgoing on revenue account  Well known junior counsel skilled in the revenue field gave a considered and careful advice  It did not touch the corporations aspects of the scheme which led to the winding up of the scheme  but those issues are not determinative of the liability  Taking into account s  G of the   Act  for the   year of income  and s     item   of Part     of the Taxation Administration Act  for the   year of income  and the cognate principles in Walstern Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR     in my view a penalty was not legally warranted  Mr Malouf exhibited sufficient care and displayed no impropriety   For the above reasons the decision of the Commissioner disallowing the objection will be set aside  No order for costs is necessary as the proceeding had test case funding  I will provide the parties with an opportunity to agree precise consequential orders dealing with the taxpayer s assessment  if that be
