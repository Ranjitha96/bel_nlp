SZKET v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedMinister for Immigration   Citizenship v SZKKC     FCR   However  the decision of Scarlett FM was handed down before the decision of a Full Federal Court in Minister for Immigration   Citizenship v SZKKC     FCR    That case is authority for the proposition that s   of the Act requires actual notification of the written statement required by s    Buchanan J  with whom Gyles J and I agreed  said at   that the sole method of actual notification is physical delivery by hand   His Honour also said at   that     Before their  i e  the applicants  right to apply for judicial review of a decision of the RRT which is alleged to be beyond jurisdiction is extinguished it will be necessary for the periods of time prescribed by s   to pass after an applicant is given personally the written statement required by s   of the Act     Justice Gyles  at   and   pointed to the serious practical difficulties which flow from the reasons of the Full Court   The decision in SZKKC is now the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court  However  plainly enough  I am bound by the decision of the Full Court unless and until it is overturned by the High Court   The Minister  in his written submissions  pointed to a number of discretionary considerations as to why I ought not to grant leave to appeal  Mr Chami also pointed to the fact that ordinarily presumptions would be raised against the applicant on the question of receipt of the reasons of the Tribunal  However  it seems to me that none of the matters to which reference is made in the Minister s submissions go to the question which was before Scarlett FM as to whether the Federal Magistrates Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for judicial review   In light of the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC there can be no real argument but that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave to appeal  There would  of course  be an injustice to the applicant if leave were denied because he would be shut out from a substantive hearing of his application for review   It follows that I propose to grant leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM  Moreover  it seems to me that the practical course is to allow the appeal because the matter cannot be distinguished from the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC    After some debate  Mr Chami accepted the inevitability of this outcome and did not really oppose an order that the appeal be allowed because the effect of this will be that the matter is to be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing of the application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal   In his reasons for judgment Scarlett FM drew attention to the delays in this matter  He expressed the view that the delays on the part of the Minister s Department are  nothing short of astonishing   Whether or not this is so  it does seem to me that this is a case which calls out for an urgent hearing  I would therefore make the following orders      Leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM of   June   be granted        The appeal be heard instanter        The appeal be allowed  to the intent that the decision of Scarlett FM that the application be dismissed as incompetent is to be set aside        The order made by Scarlett FM on   June   be set aside        The application in this matter be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing
