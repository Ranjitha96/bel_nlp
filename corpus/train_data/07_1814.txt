federal ct  html  The following passage from Merkel J s sentencing remarks in Siminton  No   is relevant for present purposes     The court has a broad discretion as to penalty  Having regard to the factors set out above  those noted at   of these reasons  and the matters put forward by counsel on behalf of Siminton  the appropriate term of imprisonment for the disposal contempt is   weeks  I would add that had there been any prior contempt convictions  the penalty would have been significantly greater  I am not prepared to accede to Siminton s submission that any sentence of imprisonment should be suspended    See Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA         ALR   at   referred toAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   November   I found that Mr Siminton had committed eight contempts of Court involving contraventions of an order made by Gray J on   January   see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA    These reasons should be read in conjunction with those in Siminton  No      Gray J s order restrained Mr Siminton from dealing with  withdrawing or disposing of moneys held in various accounts  The contempts were committed when Mr Siminton either caused the funds to be transferred from such accounts into an account held by a Mr   Mrs Holzheimer in the Bank of Adelaide or he withdrew transferred funds from the Holzheimer s account  Mrs Holzheimer had obtained a Visa card which she provided to Mr Siminton  The card enabled Mr Siminton to draw on the account at automatic teller machines and  by presenting the card  to undertake credit card transactions with merchants  He used the card for these purposes   Charges     to     related to transfers into the Holzheimer s account from a Mobile EFT Pty Ltd account controlled by Mr Siminton  The dates on which the transfers occurred and the amounts involved were as follows      Charge       May             Charge       May             Charge       May             Charge       May             Charge       May           Charge     related to the use  by Mr Siminton  of moneys transferred into the Holzheimer s account  Between   May and   August   over   was withdrawn from the Holzheimer s account by Mr Siminton and applied by him for various purposes including the payment of legal fees   On   March   Mr Siminton had been found guilty of various contempts  On   April   Merkel J sentenced him to imprisonment for a period of   weeks for transferring over   from one account to another and attempting to withdraw   from the account into which the money had been transferred  This conduct constituted a breach of an order made by Sundberg J which was in substantially the same terms as the order of Gray J which Mr Siminton subsequently contravened  Mr Siminton was also fined   for failing to comply with orders made by Sundberg J that he post notices on two websites   APRA contends  and I accept  that Mr Siminton s conduct  in each case  was  deliberate  calculated and disguised   He was well aware of the orders made by Gray J and the constraints which those orders imposed on him  Nonetheless  he continued to draw on funds which he knew were the subject of his Honour s orders  On   April   the day after Merkel J sentenced Mr Siminton for having breached orders made by Sundberg J  Mrs Holzheimer reported to the Adelaide Bank that her Visa credit card had been lost  A replacement card was issued to her on the same day  It was that card which Mr Siminton used to make the withdrawals or incur the expenses which are the subject of Charges     and      The arrangements with the Holzheimer s  pursuant to which Mr Siminton was able to obtain a card to operate their account and was able to transfer funds into it and withdraw funds from it  was designed to mask the fact that Mr Siminton was  as he well knew  acting in breach of Gray J s orders   The only evidence called by Mr Siminton in mitigation of his conduct was provided by Mr Peter Dodson and his sister Miss Susan Dodson  They testified to what they regarded as his  honesty   Miss Dodson also described him as  trustworthy  and  decent   She was prepared to concede that an honest person would not deliberately flout an order of the Court  Mr Dodson was not prepared to make that concession  Neither witness had a clear appreciation of Mr Siminton s conduct  Neither had read my reasons for decision in Siminton  No       One of the defences raised by Mr Siminton  when he was dealing with the charges  was that Gray J s order lacked clarity  I dealt with this aspect of his defence in Siminton  No    at      I noted that  on the authorities there cited  it would be a relevant factor  in sentencing Mr Siminton for any contempt which he might be found to have committed  that he had a bona fide misunderstanding of Gray J s order  Mr Siminton gave no evidence at the penalty hearing  He did not  therefore  make any attempt to suggest that  in fact  he laboured under any misunderstanding of Gray J s order when engaging in the impugned conduct   Despite numerous opportunities to do so Mr Siminton has failed to provide evidence of his personal and financial circumstances  What is known is that  since   he has been an undischarged bankrupt and that he has failed to provide a statement of affairs in accordance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Counsel for Mr Siminton advised the Court  on instructions  that his client is impecunious  He also advised that a friend of Mr Siminton s might be disposed to provide money to meet any fine imposed by the Court  No indication was given of the maximum amount which the friend might be minded to advance for this purpose   It is also notable that Mr Siminton did not apologise  express regret or in any other way seek to purge his contempt   I have concluded that Mr Siminton s conduct constituted wilful disobedience and contumacious disregard of Gray J s orders  His multiple contraventions are rendered all the more serious by reason of the fact that he had  by the time at which they were committed  been found guilty of a number of contempts constituted by breaches of orders which related to the same funds which are the subject of the present charges  Each of the contraventions constituted a criminal contempt   It cannot be gainsaid that the contempts presently under consideration fall into the most serious category  Having given careful attention to the various considerations referred to in para   above  I have concluded that there is no alternative but to sentence Mr Siminton to a period of imprisonment  The eight contempts formed part of a scheme  devised and implemented by Mr Siminton  to contravene Gray J s orders in a way that  he no doubt hoped  would not be detected  Although it is appropriate that a particular penalty be attached to each contempt  those penalties should  therefore  be served concurrently   The copy of the orders  made by Gray J on   January   which was first served on Mr Siminton  did not contain the endorsement required by O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   Once this deficiency was recognised by APRA  an endorsed copy of orders was served on Mr Siminton  This occurred on   May    In Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR   at     the Full Court held that  in the absence of an endorsement or a dispensation granted by the Court  the Court could not order the contemnor to be imprisoned  The Court held that a dispensation might be given  inter alia  where the contemnor had been in Court at the time at which the orders were pronounced or where there was evidence that the contemnor had knowledge of the need to obey the order  see at     Mr Siminton was present in Court on   January   when Gray J made his orders  On   December     January   and   January   APRA had filed notices of motion and statements of charge seeking orders that Mr Siminton be punished for contempt of the orders made by Sundberg J on   December    The relevant part of Sundberg J s orders was in substantially the same terms as the relevant part of Gray J s orders  Those charges were heard before Merkel J on   and   March    On   April   Merkel J ordered that Mr Siminton be imprisoned for contempt of Sundberg J s orders  It may  therefore  readily be inferred that Mr Siminton was well aware  before   May   of the need for him to obey Gray J s orders and of the potential consequences if he failed to do so  In my view this is an appropriate case in which to grant a dispensation under Order   r   and I do so   Although the amounts of money involved in the various contempts varied between     and over   I treat them all as warranting the imposition of the same term of imprisonment  I do so because the larger sums involved in Charges     and     are  in each case  aggregations of the sums involved in numerous smaller transactions  The money which was transferred from Austria and is the subject of Charge     was used to facilitate many of the smaller transactions which were dealt with in Charge       I have determined that the appropriate penalty for each offence is a sentence of imprisonment for   months  with each sentence to be served concurrently with each other sentence   APRA seeks an order that Mr Siminton pay its costs on a solicitor client basis  It does so because it has expended public funds in seeking to protect the interests of members of the public who have contributed to the funds which were subject to Gray J s order and in seeking to vindicate the authority of the Court  Such an order is  in my view  appropriate in the circumstances  APRA should not have to bear the costs incurred by it in prosecuting the contested contempt charges   Counsel for Mr Siminton advised the Court that Mr Siminton proposes to file an appeal against my contempt findings and any penalties which I might impose  I will  therefore  hear the parties as to whether or not the warrant for the committal of Mr Siminton to prison should lie in the Registry of the Court until his proposed appeal has been heard and determined   I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable

that the liberty of the subject is at stake the Court will not lightly exercise its power under Order   r   and dispense with the requirement of service of a properly endorsed order  It will not do so unless  the evidence shows that the requirements of and the purpose of a particular rule have been fulfilled in a manner otherwise than in the form provided  see Clifford v Middleton   VR   at   a
