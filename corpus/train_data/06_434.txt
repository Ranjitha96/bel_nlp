Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRogers Trading as Living Space Building v Dale   Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Various disputes arose in relation to the deed of settlement and the implementation arrangements contemplated by the deed which resulted in further controversy between the Applicant and the Respondents  In particular  controversy arose concerning the requirement contained in the deed of settlement of   August   for Mr Rogers to sell the Toogoom property to ALCPL by  on or about   August   with clear title  It seems that the title was subject to enforcement processes in respect of two writs  one issued by Dale   Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd and the other by Mr Scott Petersen seeking the recovery of certain debts  ALCPL had discharged the first mortgage but could not secure clear title due to the writs of attachment  The second matter of controversy concerned arrangements in relation to the purchase by Mr Rogers of two further lots at Toogoom located within an estate called Fraser Waters Estate  Lots   and   and the arrangements between Mr Rogers  Mr Hare and Mrs Judith Hare concerning the payment of deposits for the purchase of those lots  the ultimate settlement of the purchase for each lot and the basis upon which the title would be held and by whom   On   September   a second deed of settlement was entered into between Mr Rogers  ALC  ALCPL  Mr Hare and Mrs Judith Hare which provided for certain loans to be made to Mr Rogers  the acquisition and on sale of Lots   and   and the distribution of the ultimate net proceeds of sale of Lots   and   after the payment of identified outgoings with ultimately the net profit  so defined  to be distributed equally between Mr Rogers and Mr Hare  One of the outgoings to be discharged from the proceeds of sale of Lots   and   was the performance of an indemnity obligation assumed by Mr Rogers in favour of ALCPL concerning the discharge of the writs of attachment which Mr Rogers had either failed to discharge or had not been able to originally discharge   Otherwise  the deed of   September   preserved the operation of the deed of   August     On   February   Deputy Registrar Baldwin made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Mr Rogers based upon a failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice founded upon a default judgment in favour of a creditor  An application for review of that order was filed on   February   in the Federal Magistrates Court  On   March   Federal Magistrate Baumann made an order staying the sequestration order pending the determination of the application for review  On   May   Federal Magistrate Baumann dismissed the application for review and discharged the stay order of   March    On   May   Mr Rogers appealed to the Federal Court from the order of Federal Magistrate Baumann dismissing the application for review  Mr Rogers made a further application for a stay of the sequestration order pending the determination of the appeal  His Honour Justice Dowsett on   June   dismissed the motion for a stay  ordered Mr Rogers to pay the costs of the motion and made directions in relation to the appeal  Rogers Trading as Living Space Building v Dale   Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd   FCA    On

McHugh JJ at page     As to the question of whether any of these claims either for final or interlocutory relief fall within the exemption of s g  of the Bankruptcy Act thus entitling Mr Rogers to maintain a claim and more particularly a claim for an interlocutory injunction to restrain an exercise of a power of sale by a secured creditor in connection with the property at   or   Moreton Street  Toogoom  the position seems to be this  In Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales     ALR   Kirby P at page   made the following observation concerning the phrase  wrong s  done to the bankrupt     It is understandable that a person unversed in the principles of statutory construction and unaware of legal authority on the meaning of  the relevant phrase  should have taken the words  wrong done to the bankrupt  in isolation and concluded as the claimant did about their meaning  However  the words cannot be taken in isolation  They must  in accordance with the ordinary cannons of construction  be read in the context in which they appear         And at page        The exemption  relating to proceedings concerning a wrong done to the bankrupt  is limited to those cases where it has been considered appropriate to sever the personal interests of the person subsequently made bankrupt from his property and to reserve to him the prosecution of and benefits derived from such litigation as not being legitimately entitlements of the creditors  quotedappliedCox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Cox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR   at   Sir Owen Dixon  explained the test to be applied to determine whether the character of the claim is one properly falling within the exemption  His Honour said this     The plaintiff says that he himself is entitled to prosecute  the claim  under the proviso as an action for personal injury or wrong done to himself  The test appears to be whether the damages or part of them are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind  body or character and without reference to his rights of property  Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd   A C    at pp  and      quotedappliedFaulkner v Bluett     FLR   Lockhart J  after considering a number of the early cases and the orthodox approach to a scope of the exemption based upon a wrong done to the bankrupt made this observation in Faulkner v Bluett     FLR   at      The common thread running through these cases is that where the primary and substantial right of action is direct pecuniary loss to the property or estate of the bankrupt  the right to sue passes to the trustee notwithstanding that it may have produced personal inconvenience to the bankrupt  Where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt  the right to sue remains with the bankrupt   Where the claim for final relief arising out of the conduct of a respondent reflects a claim with respect to both the rights of the bankrupt in property and a claim with respect to a wrong done to the bankrupt characterised as a claim by reference to the anxiety  stress and pain felt by the bankrupt  the rights of action in respect of the bankrupt s interests in property vest in the trustee and those rights of action where the essential cause is emotional injury done to the bankrupt  in respect of a recognised cause of action  remain with the bankrupt   It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding  a claim might emerge which  in terms of its material facts  reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss     AC or   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee  At the moment  the material does not establish any such right  The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee appliedRe Wakim  Ex Parte McNally   Anor   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am not prepared to accept the submission that no question of Federal jurisdiction arises in relation to that matter  If appropriate affidavit material or a properly formulated statement of claim raised a question of relief based upon Federal causes of action such as contraventions of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and a question arose justiciable at the suit of Mr Rogers  which presently seems unlikely  concerning compliance by the secured creditor with a State Act and that matter arose from a common substratum of fact giving rise to the Federal claims  the accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia would be enlivened  Re Wakim  Ex Parte McNally   Anor   HCA         CLR   at paragraphs   to     The question of whether the secured creditor has complied with pre conditions to the exercise of power of sale is a matter to be considered by the trustee  So too is the question of whether the secured creditor in publishing advertisements for the sale of the property has mis described the property at Moreton Street  Toogoom as simply land rather than land upon which a house is built  Ultimately  to the extent that there may be a surplus after realisation of the securities  the trustee has an interest on behalf of the unsecured creditors in that surplus or the interests of the bankrupt in that surplus  Similarly  to the extent that Mr Rogers has an interest in the Fingal Head property  that interest is vested in the trustee and no doubt the trustee would take steps to determine whether an order of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as entered properly reflects the order as made especially if giving effect to the order entered will prejudice the interests of the unsecured creditors  Mr Rogers contends that the order as made by His Honour based upon the notice of motion in the Supreme Court of New South Wales is not reflected in the terms of the order entered by the Respondents  Although Mr Rogers makes the assertion  the relevant material is not incorporated in the affidavit material  In any event  the issue is either one to be agitated by the trustee or a party who holds the interest affected by the conduct  which may be Mrs Lynne Rogers   One further matter raised by the trustee concerns the precise status of the deed of settlement dated   September    At the moment in time when Mr Rogers entered into that agreement he remained an undischarged bankrupt  His application for review had at that time been dismissed by Federal Magistrate Baumann  the Stay Order of   March   had been discharged and Dowsett J had refused a further motion for a stay pending appeal  At   September   when Mr Rogers entered into the deed of settlement  he had no standing to deal with any real or personal property of any description or any estate  interest or profit whether present or future  vested or contingent arising out of or incidental to any such real or personal property  Any rights and powers in relation to that property that would have been exercisable by Mr Rogers had he not become bankrupt  became  upon bankruptcy  property of the bankrupt divisible among the bankrupt s creditors and vested in the trustee   It is not necessary for the present purposes to resolve the question of the status of the deed except to say that to the extent that Mr Rogers seeks to rely upon it as the source of rights  the status of the document further weakens a claim which is not otherwise established on the evidence or as a matter of law   There are discretionary factors which influence whether an order for an interlocutory injunction might otherwise be made  In this case  because the Applicant is an undischarged bankrupt  the undertaking as to damages is essentially meaningless  Secondly  in order to restrain an exercise of a power of sale on the part of a secured creditor  an injunction order would not ordinarily be made unless the amount secured by the mortgage is paid into Court or  in a case where the amount owing is disputed  the undisputed portion of the debt is paid into Court  The Applicant for interlocutory relief is not in a position to make any payment into Court of the monies secured by the equitable charge   For the above Reasons  I propose to dismiss the application for interlocutory relief   I reserve the question of costs  I will seek to deal with those costs at the directions hearing on   May      I certify that the preceding fifty nine   numbered paragraphs are a
