federal ct  html  On   October   I ordered that the separate question to be determined be answered in the negative with judgment for the respondents with costs  Salfinger v Niugini Mining  Australia  Pty Ltd  No     FCA    I found that the applicant s claim was entirely without merit and fraudulent  I gave the applicant leave to file written submissions within seven days to show cause why costs should not be on an indemnity basis   The applicant filed three submissions  each bearing the date   October  although they were in fact filed later   Essentially the applicant s arguments against indemnity costs were based on his status as an unrepresented litigant who was not legally qualified  He made various complaints about the substantive merits of my decision and alleged procedural

false  making of irrelevant allegations of fraud  commencing proceedings in wilful disregard of known facts  the making of allegations which ought never to have been made and the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions  In these circumstances a party s behaviour in the conduct of the proceeding means it is so unreasonable as to be unjust that the innocent party is limited in its recovery to party and party costs  Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Dannoun  No     FCA   at    citedRuddock v Vadarlis  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth
