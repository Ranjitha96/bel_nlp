Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKJT   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA a htmlThe appeal was fixed for hearing on   August    On the preceding day    August   the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI   HCA     SZKTI   by which the High Court allowed an appeal from a Full Court of this Court in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         FCR     SZKTI  Full Court decision   Contemporaneously  the High Court heard an appeal in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX   HCA     SZLFX   because a common issue of statutory construction was involved in the two appeals  The reasons given in SZKTI were also applicable to SZLFX and the Minister s appeal in the latter case was also allowed  In the present case the Federal Magistrates Court based its decision the subject of the present appeal on the decisions of Full Courts of this Court in SZKTI  Full Court decision  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX   FCAFC     and SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         FCR    The first two of those three cases were the subject of the appeals to the High Court referred to above  The consequence of the High Court s reversals of the Full Court decisions in SZKTI and SZLFX is that the present appeal by the Minister must be allowed  As will appear below  it was after the Federal Magistrate reserved judgment that the three Federal Court Full Court judgments were delivered  and his Honour based his decision favourable to SZKJT on them and not on the grounds which SZKJT had raised  His Honour allowed the parties an opportunity to make further submissions on the s   issue the subject of the three Full Court decisions  The Minister did so  submitting  at     that for any one of several reasons  s   of the Act was not engaged  For reasons that appear below  the appropriate order is that the matter be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for determination of the outstanding issues  SZKJT is a citizen of the People s Republic of China  China   He arrived in Australia on   April   and applied for a protection visa on   May    SZKJT s claims were to the effect that he had had to pay certain fines and debts  and had been active in questioning Chinese authorities in respect of  donations  that he and others had had been compelled to pay  He claimed that as a result of a belief by Chinese authorities that he had encouraged his fellow villagers not to pay these donations  he had been harassed  detained and physically abused by those authorities  He claimed that he had encouraged local people also to protest  and that  as a result  he had been questioned by police  who he had heard were planning to detain him again  On   August   the Delegate refused to grant the visa  In SZKTI the High Court has held that the power to  get  information referred to in s   of the Act is to be distinguished from the power to  invite a person to give additional information  referred to in s     and that exercise of the former power does not attract the constraints that are attached to an invitation to a person to give additional information referred to in s   by ss      B and  A   The conclusion is inescapable that the Federal Magistrates Court erred  through no fault of its own  in its finding of jurisdictional error  That finding was founded on the proposition that the telephone call and the written inquiry of DFAT did not comply with ss      B and  A   It suffices to say that the effect of the High Court decision in its application to the facts of the present case is that the Tribunal was at liberty to get the information in question from the friend and from DFAT without complying with those provisions  I do not think that   of their Honours  reasons for judgment was intended to confine the ratio decidendi to the getting of information over the telephone  It is not necessary to explore other issues  although I note in passing that the inquiries made by the Tribunal of the friend and of DFAT were first time inquiries of those sources and could not be characterised as invitations to them to provide information additional to information that they had previously given to the Tribunal  cf SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR   at       SZKTI at   distinguishedSZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR  http www
