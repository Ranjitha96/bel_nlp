cases cth HCA  html  The plaintiffs requested that Mr Fisher be ordered to pay the costs incurred in relation to the hearings after the conclusion of the hearing on   July    on the principles set out in Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR   because      a considerable portion of time was wasted on the application to remove Saxbys which application was without merit    the application for leave to reopen APM s case was seeking an indulgence and was without merit   Further  I am not satisfied that the interests of justice require an order to be made against Mr Fisher where costs can be accommodated in accordance with the statutory regime or as part of the costs in the winding up see generally Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR   and Symphony Group Plc v Hodgson   QB

    Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd v De Jager   VR   at   citedWhite Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd v Flower   Hart  a firm      ALR   It was contended that Mr Fisher s conduct was unreasonable in the sense used by Goldberg J in White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd v Flower   Hart  a firm      ALR   in that      the applications were hopeless      Mr Fisher conducted and managed the proceeding in disregard of any proper consideration of the prospects of success  and     no practitioner who was reasonably well informed and competent would have so acted   The application by APM to re open was permitted on a limited basis  although the application by APM to remove Saxbys was unsuccessful  However  I am not satisfied that it is appropriate in the context of the applications made on behalf of APM or in the conduct of the proceedings generally  that I should make a cost order directly against Mr Fisher  I do not consider that Mr Fisher s own conduct has been demonstrated to be so unreasonable  or even that if the application against Saxbys was obviously without merit  that a costs order against Mr Fisher would be appropriate  I appreciate that Mr Fisher  as the director of APM  was granted leave to appeal the decision of Registrar Musset  but the hearing was to be treated de novo to consider the solvency of APM
