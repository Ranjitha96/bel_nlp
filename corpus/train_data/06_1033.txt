conferred on the Court by O   r   is to be exercised to ensure that a party complies with the rules of pleading   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes   Associates Pty Ltd   FCA      Fox Symes    at    Ordinarily the party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules   Fox Symes at    However  if a party s pleading is repeatedly struck out  it may be inferred that the party is unable to plead a reasonable cause of action as required by the rules   Fox Symes at     The principal rules of pleading are  for present purposes  to be found in Orders   and   of the FCRs  Order   r   provides     Subject to these Rules        a  a pleading of a party shall contain  and contain only  a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party relies  but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved     b  paragraph  a  has effect subject to this Order and to Order    which relates to commencement of proceedings  and to Order    which relates to particulars       Order   r   provides     Where any document or spoken words are referred to in a pleading  it is permissible to state the effect of the document or spoken

a claim pursuant to s  AA of the Trade Practices Act  It is therefore unnecessary for me to give detailed consideration to pars   and   of the Statement of Claim  I am  however  inclined to doubt that par   adequately pleads circumstances of  special disadvantage  for the purpose of the unconscionable dealings doctrine expounded by the High Court in Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v Amadio

the argument that such conduct was  conduct in trade and commerce  could not be characterised as clearly untenable  see  for example  Stoelwinder v Southern Health Care Network     ALR    However  par

     SASR   The University further complained of Dr Wearne s failure to identify the basis upon which an implication of the kind which she alleges may be made  However  as I understand Dr Wearne s case  she will contend that the implied term presently pleaded in par   of the Statement of Claim is to be implied as a matter of law into every employment contract  She does not accept that the necessary implication depends upon the express terms of the contract and the actual intention of the parties  cf Griggs v Noris Group of Companies  Including SA Helicopters Pty Ltd and Captured Pty Ltd      SASR    Again it would not be appropriate to foreclose argument on this important question   Although par   of the Statement of Claim will be struck out for the reason identified in   above  it is appropriate that Dr Wearne be granted leave to replead the implied term  I am not satisfied that her case in this respect is clearly untenable   The Statement of Claim does not plead as a material fact that the University breached the implied term in one or more specified ways and then particularise the specified breach or breaches  Rather the Statement of Claim provides a narrative of Dr Wearne s experiences as an employee of the University and her dealings with other employees of the University  The narrative concludes with par   of the Statement of Claim which opens as follows     The respondent breached the term of the contract set out in paragraph   above in that the following conduct of the respondent  was  separately and cumulatively  calculated or likely to damage or destroy the relationship of trust and confidence between the parties          referred toHeptonstall v Gaskin  No       IR   The University submitted that while an implied term of mutual trust and

Reform Act    Cth  consideredMurphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is premature  in my view  to give detailed consideration to whether the Statement of Claim adequately pleads an appropriate nexus between the losses allegedly suffered by Dr Wearne and the relief claimed by her  I note  however  that the High Court observed with respect to the Trade Practices Act in Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   at        The Act s references to  loss or damage  can be given no narrow meaning  Section  K of the Act provides that loss or damage includes a reference to injury  It follows that the loss or damage spoken of in ss   and   is not confined to economic loss  What kinds of detriment constitute loss or damage  when a detriment is to be identified as occurring or likely to occur  and what remedies are to be awarded  may all raise further difficult questions  Especially is that so when it is recalled that remedies may be awarded to compensate  prevent or reduce loss or damage that has been or is likely to be suffered by conduct in contravention of the Act    citation omitted  I am not satisfied that Dr Wearne does not have a reasonable cause of action  or reasonable causes of action  against the University  The application for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed therefore fails   However  I conclude that the Statement of Claim does not comply with the rules of pleading  Its deficiencies are so extensive that it would be counterproductive  in my view  for individual paragraphs or groups of paragraphs to be struck out  The Statement of Claim will therefore be wholly struck out  However  in my view it is appropriate that Dr Wearne have one final opportunity to plead her case against the University citedPerkins v Grace Worldwide  Aust  Pty Ltd     IR   The University submitted that while an implied term of mutual trust and confidence is part of the law of
