  CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlGleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ returned to the question in Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Butcher   at         The relevant class addressed  Questions of allegedly misleading conduct  including questions as to what the conduct was  can be analysed from two points of view  One is employed in relation to  members of a class to which the conduct in question  is  directed in a general sense   The other  urged by the purchasers here  is employed where the objects of the conduct are  identified individuals to whom a particular misrepresentation has been made      they are considered quite apart from any class into which they fall  Adoption of the former point of view requires isolation by some criterion or criteria of a representative member of the class             The former approach is common when remedies other than those conferred by s    or s   of the Act are under consideration  But the former approach is inappropriate  and the latter is inevitable  in cases like the present  where monetary relief is sought by a plaintiff who alleges that a particular representation was made to identifiable persons  of whom the plaintiff was one  The present case requires what in Butcher their Honours called the former approach looking at the impugned conduct through the eyes of members of the class to which it was directed in a general sense  Polaris is not complaining that it was misled by the representations in the comparison report  It is worried that whoever might have received the report could be misled  Thus it is necessary to identify the class of persons who  having received the report  are likely to be influenced by it  The market for noise suppression devices of the kind referred to in the report consists of businesses which conduct call centres in Australia  Telstra is one such business  Mr Gherbaz  Plantronics  managing director  said the M D was being developed for both the forthcoming Telstra RFT and for the general market  The comparison report was intended to be used and was used for the general market as well as to assist Plantronics in relation to the tender  He said the potential readers of the report would be Occupational Health and Safety  OH S  managers in organisations and call centre managers  They were the officers with whom Plantronics would deal in connection with enquiries about its devices and sales of them  Thus it was the OH S manager of Westpac who enquired of Mr Gherbaz about its products and what path to go down  He sent her a copy of the report  The report was not made available to the general public appliedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlPlantronics relied on a passage in Mr McNeill s second affidavit in which he said that from his role in leading the design team for the M D  he was aware that  the limiting regime provided for by limiting mode   causes the  ms RMS speech average for the M D to be limited to  dB SPL at the drum reference point   Mr McNeill provided no reasoning or explanation to support this bald assertion  He was not in this affidavit relying on his February   test  which had since his earlier affidavit been subjected to criticism by Mr Fisher  In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at   the Full Court said      unless a witness states in his or her evidence in chief the grounds and reasoning that have led to the opinion  the opinion is valueless  Before the Court can assess the value of an opinion  it must know the facts on which it is based  If the opinion is based on irrelevant facts or facts that are clearly not going to be proved  the opinion is likely to be valueless  It should not be for a cross examiner to endeavour to elicit the facts or assumptions upon which an opinion is expressed  and it would be unfair to leave such matters to the cross examiner  Except in a straightforward  uncomplicated case  where the facts are admitted or otherwise readily identified  opinion evidence would normally be rejected under s   if the facts or assumptions upon which the opinion is based are not expressly stated          It is for the Court to judge the reliability of  and the weight to be given to  particular evidence  Opinion evidence  like any other evidence  must be comprehensible and reach conclusions that are rationally based  The process of inference or reasoning that leads to conclusions ought to be stated or revealed in a way that enables the conclusions to be tested and a judgment to be made about their reliability and the weight that should be given to them  Polaris urged me to attach no weight to Mr McNeill s statement of his  awareness   This is far from being a  straightforward  uncomplicated case  and the evidence in issue is of central importance to the lowest limiting setting issue  Mr McNeill s assertion amounts to no more than that he knows something because of his expertise  I attach no weight to the assertion  Loudness and intelligibility The difference between the two limiting settings was relied on by Polaris to show that louder sound was being heard on the M D  which would have enhanced intelligibility compared with the sound heard at a lower level on SoundShield appliedCampomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive is a question of fact to be determined having regard to the entire context of the conduct including the background of all surrounding circumstances  One of those circumstances  in a case such as the present  is the class of persons to whom the conduct was directed  In Campomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   the whole Court said      Where  the class of consumers  are not identified individuals to whom a particular misrepresentation has been made     but are members of a class to which the conduct in question was directed in a general sense  it is necessary to isolate by some criterion a representative member of that class  The inquiry thus is to be made with respect to this hypothetical individual why the misconception complained of has arisen or is likely to arise if no injunctive relief be granted followedGardam v George Wills   Co Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI am satisfied that the report was prepared by Dynamic in consultation with Plantronics  Mr Gherbaz suggested amendments and modifications to the document initially proposed by Dynamic  Plantronics was not a mere conduit for the carriage of information to those who received the report  The recipients would regard Plantronics as having adopted its contents  and thus as having made the representations contained in it  See Gardam v George Wills   Co Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    I did not understand this matter to have been in dispute  I will not at this stage make final orders  I will stand the matter over in order that the parties have an opportunity to consider the orders that should be made to give effect to these reasons  and to deal with the question of costs  If by   August   the parties are unable to agree on the orders that should be made  Polaris should within seven days of that date file and serve a notice of the orders it proposes should be made together with an outline of submissions in support thereof  not to exceed five pages in length  Dynamic and Plantronics should each  within seven days of receipt of Polaris  notice and outline  file and serve a notice of the orders it proposes should be made together with an outline of submissions in support thereof  not to exceed five pages in length   I certify that the preceding two hundred and forty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of

Energizer Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC         ALR   the Full Court made some helpful observations about comparative advertising  Gillette and Energizer manufactured and distributed batteries  Gillette used the brand name  Duracell  and supplied alkaline batteries  Energizer used the brands  Energizer  and  Eveready   It supplied both alkaline and carbon zinc batteries  Alkaline batteries last longer but are more expensive than carbon batteries of the same size  Energizer sought to restrain Gillette s television advertisement which claimed that the Eveready Super Heavy Duty Battery  a carbon zinc battery   just can t keep up  and that  with up to three times more power Duracell will always win  on grounds that included that the advertisement did not reveal that there was a substantial price differential between the two batteries  and thus consumers could be misled in comparing the value of the two  On that basis the trial judge granted an injunction  The Full Court allowed Gillette s appeal  Heerey J said at       The characterisation of advertising as comparative does not of itself have legal significance  or create any kind of presumption in favour of a party alleging a breach of Pt V of the TPA  There is no basis in the TPA for regarding comparative advertising as an inherently disreputable form of commercial conduct  to be viewed with suspicion by the courts  On the contrary  to the extent that comparative advertising provides consumers with accurate hard facts about competing products  it assists in the making of better informed consumer choices and thereby results in more effective competition  Of course  the more actual comparisons that are used  the more potential there is for error  and half truth   So advertisers have to be careful     Assertions of factual inaccuracy have to be carefully considered by courts in comparative advertising cases  no differently from any other cases  Heerey J then rejected Energizer s contention that to compare the products without mentioning the price was not to make a full comparison and was thus unfair  His Honour said at        The  textual basis  for the contention  is the heading of Div   of Pt V    Unfair practices   But to use general notions of unfairness  which bring to mind the concept of unconscionable conduct appearing elsewhere in the TPA  is to put an unwarranted gloss on the plain words of provisions of Pt V such as ss   and    a   Provided the factual assertions are not untrue  or misleading half truths  an advertiser can lawfully compare a particular aspect of its product or service favourably with the same aspect of a competitor s product or service  His Honour then considered an example that had been discussed in argument where airline X advertised that its economy class seats provide   cm more leg room than those of airline Y  If that claim is true  s   does not oblige airline X to provide in its advertisement detailed information as to the other factors which might influence consumers choosing between airlines  And if airline Y wanted to advertise that its fares were cheaper  its aircraft more modern  and its flights more frequent  that would be legitimate so long as  no untruths or misleading half truths are stated  at    Returning to the facts before him  Heerey J concluded at       A consumer  informed by the advertisement  correctly  it must be assumed for present purposes  that the Duracell battery lasts three times longer than the Eveready Super Heavy Duty battery  can make his or her decision at the point of sale whether the extra power of the Duracell is worth the higher price  I do not see how it could be said that such a consumer has been misled or deceived  Indeed  it would be inconsistent with the policy and objectives of the TPA to restrict a trader from publicising  truthfully  a feature of its product which is superior to the same feature of a competitor s product       His Honour went on to explain why that was so  The other members of the Full Court were of the same opinion  Lindgren J at    pages     point   and Merkel J at     and    THE WITNESSES   Polaris Trevor Guest established Polaris in    It first manufactured SoundShield in    Mr Guest has over   years experience in the sale of telecommunications equipment in Australia  He has no formal technical or scientific qualifications  However his experience in the manufacture  importation and sale of this equipment has exposed him to a wide variety of technical matters associated with sound regulation  He said he is familiar with the various technical standards that apply to telecommunication devices in Australia  He has personally installed SoundShields and other telecommunications equipment in a range of customer premises  has programmed SoundShield on numerous occasions and is familiar with the device and the settings contained within it  Mr Guest swore four affidavits and wascross examined at length  He came across as an honest witness  On one occasion  when he was describing a test he had done of SoundShield  he seemed to gild the lily by describing it as a comparative test of SoundShield and M D  However  I think this was attributable to confusion on his part and was not an attempt to mislead the Court  He conceded that he was wrong to characterise his test as a comparative one  Mr Guest accepted that his lack of formal technical qualifications meant he could not express authoritative opinions about scientific  electronic and audiological matters  However  his long involvement in the acoustic protection device industry  his participation in the formulation of industry standards  and his hands on experience  provided sufficient basis for the evidence he gave as to the industry  the general effect of the standards and the mechanisms of SoundShield  I have emphasised the word  general  because Mr Guest was not seised of the detail of the standards or of the technical attributes of the various devices  The best example of this was his confusion about the headset profiles  when he was at odds with his own experts  In addition  Professor Blamey took exception to many of Mr Guest s measurements  in particular his unexplained transition between the different types of decibels dB  dBA  dB SPL at DRP as though they were all the same  Thus  on matters of a technical nature  I do not regard him as having the expertise to express opinions that can compete with those of acknowledged experts  Ben Minski joined Polaris in   as an account manager  More recently he has been the project implementation manager of the major roll outs of SoundShields into call centres nationally  His experience includes installing over   SoundShields in approximately   call centres Australia wide  and he was consequently familiar with the device  the different technical settings contained within it  which settings best suit particular technical environments and users  and what happens if a device is not correctly customised to its particular environment and user  His evidence was largely uncontroversial  He was cross examined  I thought him an honest witness  a conclusion that was confirmed by the fact that on one topic his evidence did not assist Polaris  case  Rodney Thompson was in charge of the technical side of Polaris  business  He has tertiary electronic engineering qualifications  and experience as an engineer with Telstra and since   with Polaris  He is familiar with the measurement of sound signals and signal levels generally  the various telecommunications standards in use in Australia  and what those standards mean in technical terms for the Australian telephone network and devices that operate in conjunction with it  He was cross examined  and the concessions he made in the course of his evidence made it clear that he was giving a truthful account of matters on which he spoke citedHoover  Australia  Pty Ltd v Email Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au
