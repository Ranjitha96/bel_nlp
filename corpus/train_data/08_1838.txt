Applicant M   of   v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSchlieske v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   As the respondent acknowledged  the Minister doubtless knew that  if the applicant were removed from Australia  he would be returned to China since he was a citizen of that country  It might reasonably be assumed that  on his return  he would be arrested and face the charges to which the Interpol Red Notice referred  It does not follow from this  however  that the Minister s purpose in cancelling the applicant s visa under s   was to effect his extradition to China  Unless it can be said that the Minister s purpose in exercising power under s   was to bring the applicant to justice in China  the exercise of power was not an improper one  see Schlieske v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at   per Wilcox and French JJ  In Schlieske   ALR at   a case concerned with the lawfulness of a Ministerial deportation order  their Honours said    The golden rule is that the Australian authorities are entitled  notwithstanding their knowledge that a particular deportee is wanted in the country of destination  to do everything which is necessary for the enforcement of the Migration Act     But they are not entitled to go beyond that  and in purported exercise of powers under that Act  to take steps whose only purpose is the bringing to justice of the deportee in a foreign country  At that stage the Australian authorities would not be exercising deportation powers  they would be involved in an unlawful extradition referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Gunner     FCR   The reasons that the Minister gave for the decision to cancel the applicant s visa under s   do not provide any sufficient basis for an inference of improper purpose  The cogency and weight of the material before the Minister was for the Minister to assess  Provided there was a probative basis for the decision  it is not open to the Court to second guess the Minister in this regard and  in so doing  impute an improper purpose  Further  the fact that the Minister s decision followed almost immediately on the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal cannot be regarded as indicative of improper purpose since the Minister s powers under s   of the Migration Act are separate and distinct from those of the Tribunal  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Gunner     FCR   at     per Heerey  Lindgren and Emmett JJ

challenge is not one that falls within the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness referred toPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As the respondent contended  however  the principle in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   was applicable to this proceeding and  unless there were special circumstances shown  the applicant was estopped from bringing this further judicial review proceeding   It will be recalled that the applicant had previously sought judicial review of the Minister s cancellation and non revocation decisions in the Federal Magistrates Court on the ground that the decisions disclosed jurisdictional error in that the Minister    failed to take into account a relevant matter  and   breached the rules of natural justice  Further  the applicant alleged jurisdictional error in that  Given the circumstances surrounding the allegations against the Applicant and the absence over a seven and a half year period of any attempt to execute the warrants or initiate extradition proceedings  each of the decisions amounted to a misuse of the cancellation power   A Federal Magistrates dismissed the judicial review application on   May   and the applicant did not seek to appeal against the judgment  In the circumstances  the Anshun principle applied  see Anshun   HCA       CLR   at    The applicant submitted  however  that he ought not be precluded from raising new grounds of judicial review as there were  special circumstances  within the meaning of the Anshun principle to justify him doing so   These special circumstances included that   a  There was no special disadvantage for the respondent but there was a significant adverse consequence for the applicant  being  a real risk to his life and liberty     b  The Minister did not take into account the applicant s concerns  including his complaints about the application of s  A  although the applicant had raised them with the Minister     c  There was a public interest in ensuring that the process of cancellation was a fair one  In this case  the Minister s decision was vitiated as a  disguised extradition  or for unreasonableness    d  The Minster and or her department became aware of these serious allegations in   but they were not put to the applicant until      e  The applicant had unsuccessfully sought redress through other legal avenues    f  The applicant had been in immigration detention since May   and had been diagnosed as having a major depressive disorder referred toWong v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  For the following reasons  I consider that this submission should be rejected  First  as the Court said in Wong v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   There may be sound reasons of policy for arguing that Anshun estoppel not apply for the benefit of the executive government and its representatives  but only to individuals  This is because the executive is a respondent by force of statute or of the Constitution and is not subject to the same psychological burden that may weigh on individual litigants  they cannot be  vexed  in the same way by instigation of subsequent proceedings  That may be a more appropriate basis  namely that of accepted public policy  to ensure that representatives of the executive government cannot rely on the principle of Anshun estoppel to frustrate  in effect  the intended legislative mandate  However that proposition does not sit well with the authorities that apply the principle of Anshun estoppel equally to judicial review of administrative action referred toBC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Secondly  the grounds of review upon which the applicant would seek to rely were available to him when the Federal Magistrate heard the earlier proceeding  There was no relevant uncertainty in the law  which might explain and justify the failure to raise them at the earlier time  compare BC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at       per Carr  Tamberlin and Conti JJ  Further  although the applicant s written submissions questioned the application of s  A  the applicant abandoned this argument at the hearing  see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball   FCAFC         FCR   at       per Jacobson and Bennett JJ  It is also to be borne in mind that  in the Federal Magistrates Court  although not the subject of oral submissions  the applicant s amended application included a ground that resembled the  disguised extradition  ground  which the applicant sought to raise in this proceeding  see   above  citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au

see   above  citedBodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Given that the applicant is estopped from bringing this application  it is probably unnecessary to say much about the time limits made applicable by the order remitting the proceeding to this Court  The applicant applied in the High Court for orders to show cause why writs of certiorari  prohibition and mandamus should not issue  although he did not include a claim for mandamus in his amended application filed on   August    The High Court Rules   relevantly limit the time for making application for certiorari and mandamus  Rule       provides that an application for an order to show cause why a writ of certiorari should not issue must be made within six months after the date of the relevant judgment  order  conviction or other proceeding  Rule       provides that an application for an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue to a judicial tribunal must be made within two months of the date of the refusal to hear or within such time as is  under special circumstances  allowed by the Court or a Justice  Assuming that the time limits in rule       and       apply  see Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR   at   indicating that r       does not  they may be enlarged under rule     referred toRe Commonwealth  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The application was made in the High Court some two years after the Minister made her decision not to revoke her cancellation decision  The applicant conceded that he had given no satisfactory explanation for the delay  see Re Commonwealth  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR   at   per McHugh J  Further  the applicant did not proffer any explanation as to why the grounds pursued in this proceeding were not pursued in the earlier proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court  Just as importantly  as the forgoing discussion shows  the prospects of success on the application are not such as to warrant an extension of time  An extension of time for seeking relief of this kind  can only be granted if it is necessary to do justice between the parties  see Marks   ALR at    An extension of time is not necessary to do justice in this case  Accordingly  I would refuse the application for an enlargement of time   For the reasons stated  the application should be dismissed  with costs  Application to enlarge time should also be refused    I certify that the preceding
