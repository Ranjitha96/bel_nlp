Given v CV Holland  Holdings  Pty Ltd     FLR   at   citedLeeks v FXC Corporation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Dynamic Supplies submits that Brother Japan was engaged in  trade and commerce  within the meaning of s   of the TPA because the provenance of the units can be traced from Australia back though America and ultimately to their manufacturer in Japan  It submits that it there is sufficient evidence of defectiveness of the units  Mr Piccinini deposed that the units were returned to Dynamic Supplies by customers  who then received a refund  Counsel for Dynamic Supplies submitted that the only commercially sensible inference is that the refund was paid because the units were defective  This evidence is supported  it is said  by inferences to be drawn from a consistent pattern according to which defective units were replaced by Brother Australia and the thoroughness of the practices by which Mr Dobrowolski of Brother Australia inspected and tested the units  Dynamic Supplies also submits that  since it is agreed that Brother Japan manufactured the products  there is no difficulty in establishing that Brother bears the liability rather than Dynamic Supplies  see Leeks v FXC Corporation   FCA         FCR   at     The cross claim must fail in this case due to the lack of sufficient evidence establishing the defectiveness of the units  The assertion by Mr Piccinini that Dynamic Supplies provided refunds to its consumers is not sufficient evidence of the defectiveness of the units  There are no details of specific defects or their nature and extent  Refunds may be given for many reasons other than discovery of a fault in the product  for example  to maintain goodwill  for public relations purposes  to enhance reputation  or as a matter of general corporate policy when goods are claimed to be defective  Normally  a retailer making a claim under ss  D and  H will adduce some specific evidence in the form of documents  photographs or statements  as to the fault and give evidence as to how the product fails to function properly and why it has been deemed defective  In cases such as the present where the product can no longer be obtained  at least some evidence identifying the type of defect  and when and how the defect was ascertained in the particular products  should be adduced  This evidence may be in the form of  for example  test sheets  affidavits by the person who inspected and identified the defect  or documentation which identifies the defective product and its defects  The inferences which Dynamic Supplies submits should be drawn in this case are not open on the sparse evidence adduced   In light of my finding that the evidence does not establish the defectiveness of the units  it is not necessary for me to express an opinion on Brother s submission that it has not engaged in  trade and commerce  for the purposes of TPA  Accordingly  I do not propose to deal with that question in these reasons   For these reasons  the cross claim should be dismissed   I allow the applicants  claim that the respondent has infringed the registered trade marks  and has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of ss   and   of the TPA and the tort of passing off  I dismiss the respondent s cross claim  I direct the applicants to draft  file and provide to the respondent

the appellant s approval  It is not necessary to be more precise  provided the association is more than de minimis  citedNokia Corporation v Truong     IPR   The central question arising is whether the term  consumables  falls within the ordinary dictionary meaning or terms in the specifications of Brother s Australian trade marks  in particular  the terms  parts   accessories  and  attachments   The dictionary definition of  accessory  has been considered in the authorities and has been described as   an additional or subordinate thing  an adjunct  an accompaniment  a minor fitting or attachment   see Nokia Corporation v Truong     IPR   at     I accept Brother s submissions that printer drum units are apparatus for the transmission or reproduction of images  and that the categorisation of a printer drum unit as a  consumable  does not take it outside the description of a  part   accessory  or  attachment   The evidence of both parties  witnesses indicates that printer drum units are part of the internal working of printers  facsimiles and multi function devices  They are called consumables because they are parts or accessories with a limited life span  which is generally shorter than the life span of the machine in which they function  Although printer drum units are not fixed permanently within the machines and are removable for replacement  the machines cannot function without them  Given this essential role of the printer drum units  it is wrong to characterise them on the basis they are not a part of or an accessory to those machines  Accordingly  the proper conclusion is that trade marks     and   are registered in respect of Brother s printer drum units  such as the Brother DR    I also accept Brother s submission that the cardboard box in which a printer drum unit is packaged is itself a  good  made of cardboard falling within the scope of both class   and the specifications of registered trade mark    Indeed  there was little genuine dispute on this point   However  despite my finding that printer drum units are covered by the specifications of trade marks     and    and cardboard packaging by the specifications of trade mark   in my view  Dynamic Supplies  submission that registered trade mark   was registered only after the conduct of Dynamic Supplies impugned by Brother  and therefore was not breached by that conduct  is correct  The trap purchases in this case were made in late February and early March   and Brother did not register trade mark   until   April    It is not possible  therefore  for registered trade mark   to be infringed by Dynamic Supplies  conduct in the same way the remainder of Brother s Australian trade marks have been   For these reasons  I find that both the Brother DR   units and Brother DR   packaging are goods in respect of which Brother s Australian trade marks are registered  but that trade mark   has not been infringed by the Dynamic Supplies  conduct   A respondent which uses an applicant s registered trade mark in the course of trade in relation to goods which fall within the scope of the mark s specifications will not infringe the mark if the use was with the consent of the applicant  see s   of the Act  consideredPioneer v The Registrar of Trade Marks   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In R   A Bailey   Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd

citedRevlon Inc v Cripps and Lee   FSR   In any event  a finding that Brother America was part of the supply chain of the impugned products would not allow Dynamic Supplies to rely on s   of the Act because it is the consent of the registered owner which must be acquired  Here  Brother Japan is the registered owner of Brother s Australian trade marks  There is no evidence  and Dynamic Supplies submitted that it should not be expected to adduce such evidence  that Brother Japan  rather than Brother America  consented to the application of its mark to or in relation to the products in question  The fact that Brother America and Brother Japan are related entities within the same corporate group does not affect the clear and ordinary meaning and operation of s   of the Act   The consent to apply Brother s Australian trade marks to or in relation to a product must be acquired from Brother Japan  The situation where consent is not acquired from the registered owner of the trade mark but from a related entity in its corporate group has not  so far as I am aware  been considered in Australian law  cf the decision of the English Court of Appeal  which was decided on the basis of significantly different legislation in Revlon Inc v Cripps and Lee   FSR    I am of the view that Brother Japan s consent for the purposes of s   of the Act is not to be implied from the fact that another member of the Brother corporate group may have  contrary to my finding  given its consent   Accordingly  Dynamic Supplies  use of the  BROTHER  trade mark was not done with the licence or authority of Brother Japan  I therefore find that its infringement of Brother s Australian trade marks is not excused by s   of the Act    Although there was some uncertainty during the hearing as to whether Dynamic Supplies had conceded that Brother had a reputation for the purposes of ss   and   of the TPA  Dynamic Supplies  ultimate position was that it acknowledged Brother s reputation  but said that its acknowledgment did not constitute a concession as to Brother s trade practices claim  There was no substantial dispute between the parties on this  nor was there significant cross examination by counsel for Dynamic Supplies on the issue  The uncontested evidence led by Brother showed that Brother Australia has been active in Australia since   and that its sales run into the tens of millions of dollars  Advertisement of its products has been extensive  In cross examination  Mr Piccinini acknowledged that Brother is a   well known brand   citedThunderbird Products Corp v

registered owner of the relevant trade marks  expressly or impliedly consented to the application of its trade mark to or in relation to the goods in question  Although the Full Court of this Court in Transport Tyre   FCR at   found that the sale of the goods in question constituted a  use  which was excused by s   of the Act   that decision is distinguishable  In that case the registered owner of the trade mark applied it to the goods which were subsequently sold  The chain of supply could be traced back from the retailer of the goods to the registered owner of the trade marks which were applied to or in relation to those goods  The registered owner s consent for the purpose of s   was  in the opinion of the Full Court  necessarily implied in those circumstances  No such chain of supply exists in the present case  The Sample Units were not branded by Brother with its mark  and the Sample Packaging was counterfeit  No consent  whether express or implied  was given by Brother to any person or entity to apply its registered trade mark to the products  To the contrary  Brother has distanced itself from the OEM products  manufacturing them only as unbranded products and selling
