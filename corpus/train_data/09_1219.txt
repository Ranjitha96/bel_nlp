v Smart   NSWR   citedSlack v Bottoms English Solicitors   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt is clear that a power of attorney as held by Mr Kerr from Ms Kerr does not provide a lawful basis for a non lawyer to act for a party in litigation in a Federal Court  cf Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors   FCA    However the Court has discretion to grant leave to a person who is not a qualified legal practitioner to represent a litigant  Such a person is commonly known as a  Mackenzie friend   I note that I consider it inappropriate that an application should be made by Mr Kerr to represent Ms Kerr without Ms Kerr being present  However I understand that in previous proceedings in this Court Mr Kerr has represented Ms Kerr in her absence  For the purposes of today s hearing  which is procedural only  I am prepared to entertain Mr Kerr s application to represent Ms Kerr citedTeese v State Bank of New South Wales   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlAs pointed out by Ipp AJA in Teese v State Bank of New South Wales   NSWCA   at     the usual ground for granting leave to a person  not properly qualified  to represent a litigant is impecuniosity  namely where the litigant cannot afford to pay a properly qualified lawyer  In this case Ms Kerr s impecuniosity was the reason for seeking that Mr Kerr should speak for her in Court  In the circumstances I was prepared to grant leave to Mr Kerr to represent Ms Kerr for the purposes of today s proceedings  There was no appearance in Court by either American Express or the Insolvency Trustee Service Australia  ITSA  which is Ms Kerr s trustee in bankruptcy  I understand that American Express has informed Deputy District Registrar Baldwin of the Queensland Registry of this Court that it would not appear either in respect of this notice of motion or in the appeal more generally having regard to the substantial costs already incurred by the company to date  and in light of the fact that Ms Kerr s estate has no funds  At my request Deputy District Registrar Belcher informed the appellant prior to today s hearing that I currently hold an American Express credit card  and inquired whether  from the appellant s perspective  this gave rise to any concerns as to perceived bias on my part  I understand that my possession of this card has not caused the appellant any concern in relation to me hearing this notice of motion citedThornberry v R     ALJR  The decision of a judge to adjourn a hearing is not only an interlocutory decision  it is a discretionary decision
