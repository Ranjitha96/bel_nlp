Chamberlain  in the matter of South Wagga Sports and Bowling Ltd  Administrator Appointed   No     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedRe Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlMore recently  in Re Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd   NSWSC     Young CJ in Eq came to the view that the power under section  A is wide enough to authorise an adjournment for a further   days from the period set out in the statute  His Honour said that that is the maximum which should ordinarily be allowed  Section  B  now states that the period of the adjournment  or the total periods of adjournment  must not exceed   business days  Here  the section  A meeting was convened on   February   and there have been further adjournments as mentioned above followedRe LOCM Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed      FCR  In Re LOCM Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed      FCR     Goldberg J came to the view that the court has power under section  A to make an order extending the time fixed by section  B   His Honour was of the view that the effect of the authorities was that it was not appropriate to extend the period for more than the   days which was then the maximum provided under section  B   Goldberg J considered in some detail the authorities which have dealt with the power under section  A  The adjournment which is now sought is   business days from   April    It may be argued that this period is a significant extension of the period of   business days from the date of the meeting prescribed by s  B    but even if that is so  it is my view that the authorities to which Goldberg J referred in Re LOCM are wide enough to permit the order which is sought  His Honour observed that the power under section  A is not limited to the operation of filling in gaps in the legislative scheme but that its operation enables the alteration of the operation of a provision in Part    A in relation to a particular company  in particular circumstances referred toMann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd     ACSR  It is true  of course  as the authorities have established  that the legislative intention is that administrations under Part    A are to proceed expeditiously and that the spirit of Part    A is to prevent administrations from being unduly extended  Nevertheless  that needs to be balanced against the policy expressed in a number of the leading authorities that the court ought also to bear in mind the interest of the creditors in obtaining the possibility of a greater dividend than that which would follow from a making of a winding up order  see for example Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd     ACSR   at    Here  the creditors have requested the administrator to grant an extension up to   June but for reasons mentioned above  the administrator has taken the view that a slightly longer period may be required  In the particular circumstances of this case  it seems to me to be appropriate to exercise the power conferred under  A to make the order which is sought  I will therefore make orders in accordance with the draft orders provided to me  I will sign and date the orders  in accordance with the draft dated   April   and that will be placed with the court papers    I certify that the preceding eighteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson      Associate     Dated    April     Solicitor for the Plaintiff  Shaw Reynolds Bowen   Gerathy   Date of Hearing    April       Date of Judgment    April         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
