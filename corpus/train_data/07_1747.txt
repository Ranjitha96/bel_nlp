HCA  html  The notice of appeal raises ten grounds of appeal  These grounds are as follows     The Federal Magistrate had failed to find error of law  jurisdictional error  procedural fairness and relief under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth       The Federal Magistrate had dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors in the Tribunal decision      The Federal Magistrate made a legal  factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down in Randhawa   FCR        The Federal Magistrate failed to take into consideration that the Tribunal decision was unjust and made without taking into account the full gravity of the appellant s circumstances and consequences of the claim      The Tribunal had ignored relevant material as to the appellant s Shi a background which put his life at risk  relied in part on irrelevant material and made a finding which was erroneous or mistaken      There had been a lack of procedural fairness in his case along the same line as Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA         ALR    In particular  the appellant claimed that his case was identical to Muin   HCA       ALR   where the Tribunal had misled the applicant before it in that case to believe that the Tribunal had read some material      The Federal Magistrate did not consider the appellant s application dismissed on the date of hearing the application  and the appellant was not legally represented at the hearing before the Federal Magistrate      The Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal did not take into account certain relevant considerations or  integers  central to the appellant s claim      The Tribunal failed to carry out its review function and exercise its jurisdiction in that        it did not consider the immense and intimidating pressure on the appellant by Sunnis because of his Shi a background    it did not consider the appellant s claim that Sunnis would kill him if he returned to Pakistan       The Tribunal had applied the wrong test  in particular        by requiring independent evidence of facts before the Tribunal would accept a claim being made by the appellant the Tribunal was  in fact  placing high onus of proof on the appellant and failing to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt    the Tribunal left out individual elements of the appellant s claims and tested whether they individually amounted to persecution rather than looking at the claim as a whole to determine whether the claim amounted to persecution   In Muin   HCA       ALR   the majority of the High Court held  inter alia   that where the Tribunal indicated to a claimant for refugee status that it had considered all material relating to his application  but in fact had not because the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs had not transferred all relevant material to the Tribunal  there was a failure in the Tribunal to accord procedural fairness to the claimant in relation to such material   With respect to the appeal before me  it is not clear as to which material the appellant is referring in relying on principles articulated in Muin   HCA       ALR    In the circumstances  this ground of appeal is not sustainable   Seventh ground of appeal  This ground of appeal does not evince a jurisdictional error   Eighth ground appeal  In the absence of further particularisation

the absence of particularisation this ground of appeal cannot be substantiated  In any event  the Court cannot engage in review of the merits of the appellant s claims  NAHI v MIMIA   FCAFC   at      Fifth ground of appeal  It is clear that  notwithstanding the claim of the appellant  the Tribunal did consider his claims concerning his position arising from his Shi a background  and the potential danger to the appellant should he return to Pakistan  and made findings adverse to the appellant with respect to these claims  As I indicated earlier in this judgment  the Court cannot engage in review of the merits of the appellant s claims  NAHI v MIMIA   FCAFC   at      Tenth ground of appealcitedO Brien v Komesaroff   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A number of these grounds were not raised before Driver FM  Although as a general proposition the appellant must demonstrate that it is expedient and in the interests of justice that new grounds of appeal be raised   O Brien v Komesaroff   HCA         CLR   at   Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR   at     I am prepared to consider them in this appeal consideredQBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance Workers Compensation  NSW  Ltd     ALJR   This is clearly of concern  Failure by a court of first instance to consider a claim clearly raised by a litigant can give rise to a miscarriage of justice  So  for example  in the High Court decision QBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance Workers Compensation  NSW  Ltd     ALJR   on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ held that  in circumstances where a ground of cross appeal was plainly arguable  and the judgment of the court below gave no indication that it had considered that ground  and  if it did  the reasons given by the court could not be regarded as proper reasons for rejecting that ground  there had been a miscarriage of justice calling for the intervention of the High Court  In those circumstances the High Court ordered that that the matter be remitted for re determination to the Court of Appeal   At the hearing before me  Mr Foreman submitted that  in relation to the issue of relocation as claimed by the appellant before the Federal Magistrate    the appellant had no prospect of success    in any event  the issue of relocation was not relevant in the context of this appeal because the appellant had  as found by the Tribunal  actually relocated from his village over ten years ago  Accordingly this is not a case where either the Tribunal  or the Court on judicial review  is required to consider whether relocation within Pakistan is a feasible option for the appellant   In this case  I consider that this error of the Federal Magistrate is not a reason to allow the appeal from his Honour s decision or to remit the case to the Federal Magistrate for re hearing  I take this view because I accept the submission of Mr Foreman that the appellant had no prospect of success in relation to this ground of judicial review before his Honour  To use the terminology of the High Court decision in QBE   ALJR   this ground of review was not  plainly arguable  in light of the findings of the Tribunal with respect to relocation of the appellant elsewhere in Pakistan consideredRandhawa v The Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   The appellant has obliquely raised this issue in his third ground of appeal before me  namely that     The Federal Magistrate made a legal  factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR      The Full Court decision in Randhawa   FCR   clearly raises issues of relocation  as I outline later in this judgment   To a lesser extent  the issue is also raised by the appellant in his second ground of appeal  namely     The Federal Magistrate had dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors in the Tribunal decision    In Randhawa   FCR   the facts demonstrated that the appellant in that case  a Sikh from the Punjab region of India  would have had a well founded fear of persecution were he required to return to his family s home in the Punjab  However the Full Court in Randhawa   FCR   held that the Convention definition of  refugee  does not support a claim to refugee status in circumstances where the appellant  although having a well founded fear of persecution in one region of a country  could avail themselves of protection elsewhere within that country  This is only the case  however  if it is reasonable in the circumstances to expect a person with a well founded fear of persecution in relation to that part of the country from which they have fled to relocate to another part of the country of nationality  If it is not reasonable  their fear of persecution in relation to the country as a whole is well founded  per Black CJ at     and   Beaumont J at   Whitlam J at     The principles articulated by the Full Court in Randhawa   FCR   were recently affirmed by the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR    In that case at pages     Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ agreed with the reasoning of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Januzi v Secretary of State for the Home Department   UKHL         AC   where his Lordship said    The  Convention  does not expressly address the situation at issue in these appeals where  within the country of his nationality  a person has a well founded fear of persecution at

  FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Full Court held in WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   that where the finding of fact made does not turn upon the credibility of the appellant and where there is nothing on the face of the documents themselves to alert the decision maker that they are forgeries  it is inherently unfair that the decision maker conclude that they are not genuine without affording the person affected by that conclusion the opportunity of addressing the issue of possible fabrication  In this case  however with respect to a document purporting to be a copy of a First Information Report  referring to a crime by the appellant allegedly occurring after he had left Pakistan  and which the Tribunal concluded was not a reliable source of evidence  it is clear from the Tribunal decision that the Tribunal had questioned the appellant in relation to the document and expressed doubt at the hearing as to its provenance  In my view  there has been no absence of procedural fairness provided to the appellant in relation to that document or any claims he may have with respect to that document   In the circumstances the appropriate order is that the appeal should be dismissed   I certify that the preceding thirty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the
