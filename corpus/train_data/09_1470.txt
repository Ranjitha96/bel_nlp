SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredSZLGP v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe appeal came on for hearing before Gordon J  On   September   for reasons which her Honour then published  the appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court was allowed  The matter was remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law  SZLGP v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA    On   February   a differently constituted Tribunal decided to affirm the refusal decision made by the Minister s Delegate  The Appellants made a further judicial review application to the Federal Magistrates Court  On   June   for reasons given that day  the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the Appellants  judicial review application  It is from that decision that the Appellants appeal once more to this Court  The basis upon which the male Appellant claimed a protection visa was set out in a statement annexed to the visa application  In her judgment in the first appeal Gordon J offered  at   the following summary of the basis of the claim  which I gratefully adopt  The first appellant was born in    He claimed he owned and ran a freshwater fish farm in Fujian province near Fuqing city and that his life was uneventful until he was contacted by a distant cousin in August    That cousin was in dispute with local authorities from Putian city over the alleged confiscation of his land and a failed promise by the government to deliver compensation to the landholders whose land had been confiscated  The first appellant claimed that at that time he gave this cousin a job working on his fish farm   In October   the first appellant claimed that his cousin s brother  who had organised for local farmers near Putian city to protest about the confiscation of his land  had been arrested by the Public Security Bureau  the PSB   The first appellant s cousin was required to return to his hometown  The first appellant gave his cousin some money   Yuan  and a letter to a friend  Mr Zhou  whom the first appellant knew in Putian City  and who worked for the local government  The first appellant also telephoned Mr Zhou to plead for his help  to save  the cousin s brother  who was soon released   The cousin and his brother continued to be embroiled in disputes with the local authorities over the land confiscation  On   November   the first appellant was contacted by Mr Zhou who informed him that there had been a major conflict and that some farmers had been injured  Later that day the first appellant s cousin contacted him and told the first appellant that he and his brother were in hiding  The first appellant picked them up and took them to a  secret place    The next day   November   the police attended the first appellant s farm and questioned him for two hours  The police came again five to six times  but they could not find anything  The first appellant told them nothing  The first appellant was scared and  had to start applying  to go overseas for his own safety   The first appellant helped to arrange for the safe passage for his cousin and cousin s brother out of China to Taiwan on a fishing boat  However  the cousins were discovered by the navy and immediately arrested   The first appellant was concerned that he would be exposed by his cousins and immediately went to Guangzhou  On   December   the first appellant left China from Guangzhou   The first appellant claimed that since leaving China the police have come to his home with an arrest permit on three occasions and he has been denounced as a protector of political dissidents    The first appellant claimed he is on the blacklist of the PSB and will be arrested as soon as he returns to China   I have chosen to refer to the person whom her Honour has described as the  first appellant  in the passage quoted as the  male Appellant   No different claim was made before the Tribunal on the second review hearing  However  as will be seen  the evidentiary foundation for that claim at that hearing differed in a crucial respect from that provided to the Tribunal at the time when it first reviewed the Minister s Delegate s visa refusal decision  On this occasion  the Appellants advanced the following grounds of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court      Grounds         The Federal Magistrates erred in law   The Federal Magistrates was wrong in finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  acted properly in its findings          Particulars         The Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s  A of the Act   The Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s   of the Act   The Tribunal failed to consider my claims properly and fairly  Tribunal made its finding actually based on unwarranted assumption  the Tribunal ignored or failed to consider a claim I made to it  the Tribunal ignored other relevant materials which was before it  and the Tribunal misunderstood my claim or made a mistake in relation to an important finding of fact           sic The so called grounds of appeal are so vaguely stated as to be devoid of meaning  That position is not really ameliorated by the so called particulars  which are noteworthy not only for their generality of expression but also for their failure to focus upon what is alleged to be error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court  as opposed to the Tribunal citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe learned Federal Magistrate  at para   had observed   There was no obligation on the Tribunal to make a disclosure pursuant to s  A in this case  That is because the Tribunal decision turned upon the applicants  own evidence  both oral and written   The reason assigned by the Tribunal accurately  if generally  describes what came to govern the fate of the Appellants  review application before the Tribunal  A more precise description was offered by the Minister in his submissions   The Tribunal relied upon internal inconsistencies and inconsistencies in the oral evidence provided by the  male Appellant  to the differently constituted Tribunals   As the Minister correctly submitted   such reliance does not invoke s  A obligations  SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR    There was no error in the learned Federal Magistrate s dismissal of the judicial review application insofar as it relied upon an alleged breach of s  A of the Act by the Tribunal  Subject to exceptions not presently relevant  s   of the Migration Act obliged the Tribunal to invite the Appellants to appear before it   to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   The Tribunal extended such an invitation to the Appellants  They accepted that invitation and appeared before the Tribunal  The learned Federal Magistrate s description of and conclusion with respect to what then transpired was as follows  at para       It is plain from the record of what occurred at the hearing that the Tribunal entertained serious credibility concerns about the first applicant s claims and his evidence  The Tribunal proceeded on a somewhat different basis than the delegate  The delegate s decision centred on the vagueness of the applicants  claims and the lack of supporting detail  The first applicant attempted to deal with that defect before the Tribunal by providing details  both orally and in the form of documents  The Tribunal did not accept either the plausibility of his evidence or the authenticity of his critical documents  I am satisfied from the detailed recitation of what occurred at the Tribunal hearing that the Tribunal put the applicants on notice of the essential and significant issues upon which the review would turn     On this basis  the learned Federal Magistrate concluded that the Appellants had been given a fair opportunity to present their case and expressed satisfaction that there had been no breach by the Tribunal of s   of the Migration Act   It is evident from the learned Federal Magistrate s reasons for judgment that the Appellants filed no written submissions in advance of the hearing and that the male Appellant made a general complaint about a lack of fairness attending the proceedings before the Tribunal citedH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural

cth FCAFC  htmlLeave to add a ground of appeal not raised below should only be granted where it is expedient in the interests of justice so to do  VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     Inevitably  whether or not to grant leave to add such grounds to the notice of appeal requires some exploration of their merits  For reasons which follow  that exploration persuades me that  in the particular circumstances of this case  the Appellants should have leave to raise the grounds identified in para   above  The consideration arising from the letter of   March   which prompted me not to dismiss the appeal peremptorily but rather to adjourn the hearing so as to afford the Minister an opportunity to make further submissions and thereafter to reserve my decision arose from the words emphasised at the foot of the letter of   March    It is evident on the face of this letter that  at least purportedly  it was created after the Appellants had both left China and lodged their protection visa application here  that it is referring to steps which have just been taken in light of recent events with which the male Appellant was concerned and that a duplicate of the letter is to be sent  materially  to him as well as to the addressees of the letter  While  if genuine  the letter of   March   does not corroborate the detail of the claim made by the Appellants  it does corroborate the claim in the general sense of confirming that the male Appellant had held a responsible position at the Aquatic Farm  had been involved in some sort of  dissident  activity and had  in so doing  come to the adverse attention of the People s Security Bureau  PSB   It is truly  in this sense  a  critical document  consideredRe Minister for Immigration

v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWith all due respect to the Tribunal and in the sense they are used by Lee J  the adjectives  ignorant   arbitrary  and  perverse  aptly apply to a process of reasoning which damns a man s credibility by reference  materially  to a false factual premise concerning a critical document  What follows from this  to take up sentiments voiced by Allsop J  in SZDFO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     in the passage I have quoted from Judicial Review of Administrative Action   is that the Tribunal has failed to attend conscientiously and appropriately to its statutory obligations and the Federal Magistrates Court has failed to apprehend this  An alternative way of approaching matters is also exposed by the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action under the heading  Fact review by the imaginative uses of other grounds   at p   et seq   While I should respectfully question the aptness of the descriptor   imaginative  it is nonetheless  in my opinion  a denial of procedural fairness to a visa applicant for the Tribunal to subject him to questioning  upon the answers to which findings as to credibility come to be made  upon a false factual premise with respect to a critical document  That false premise is that the letter of   March   was not addressed to him  In a narrow sense that is true but  reading the letter as a whole  it is plain on its face that he was an intended addressee insofar

discussion of Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALJR     Dranichnikov   in the passage in their work to which I have drawn attention  the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action observe  at p   that this decision  has the effect of extending the procedural fairness rule to the situation where the decision maker has substantially  switched off  during an important phase of the pre decisional process   I respectfully agree  That  with respect  is precisely what the Tribunal as constituted for the rehearing in this case did  To make that observation is not in any way to diminish the very real difficulty under which a tribunal dealing with an unrepresented layperson not fluent in English must labour when conducting a review on the merits but is to acknowledge that such a tribunal must nonetheless at least come to grips with the claim as made  In a footnote  p   fn   in this part of their work the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action instance SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         ALR     SZIFI   as a case which  even though Dranichnikov is not mentioned  offers a good example of the type of procedural fairness error for which they contend Dranichnikov stands  In SZIFI Greenwood J observed  at           Once it is established that the

Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI   HCA         ALJR     SZIAI   judgment in which came to be delivered on   September    The outcome in that case served to underscore the correctness of the submission made on behalf of the Minister in the present case  which was that  though the Tribunal was a type of inquisitorial forum  it was not under any general duty to conduct inquiries of its own motion  Given the reasoning and outcome in SZIAI   it is not necessary to refer to the predecessor authorities which the Minister called in aid in support of that submission in the present appeal  It was further submitted for the Minister that  insofar as the male Appellant had invited the Tribunal so to do  it did not follow from this that the Tribunal was bound to take up that invitation  although it was evident that the Tribunal had given the invitation due consideration  I agree that the mere extending by a visa applicant of an invitation to the Tribunal to conduct inquiries itself does not thereby convert a course of action that it would be permissible but not obligatory for the Tribunal to undertake into one which it is bound to undertake  Rather  the singular circumstances of a particular case may  exceptionally  give rise to an obligation on the part of the Tribunal in that case to make its own inquiry with respect to a critical fact  A failure so to do could in such a circumstance give rise to a conclusion that the Tribunal had failed to exercise the review jurisdiction consigned to it and thereby made a jurisdictional error  SZIAI at    In allowing for the possibility of such a jurisdictional error the language employed in the joint judgment in SZIAI counsel s restraint in concluding that it is present   a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact  the existence of which is easily ascertained   In practice  with respect  whether such restraint has been observed by a reviewing court may be controversial for  in cases at the margin  reasonable minds might reasonably differ as to whether a particular inquiry was  obvious   The present may well be a case in point  The Tribunal had before it evidence in the form of the Departmental file notes to which I have referred of the facility with which telephonic inquiries had been able to be made at the fish farm in respect of the male Appellant s employment status in relation to what must have been the routine processing student visa applications  Especially given the nature of the class of visa sought by the Appellants and the impact which it would have on an assessment as to whether the Tribunal was satisfied in the way the Migration Act required for the granting of such a visa  it does not seem to me a transgression of the restraint counselled in SZIAI to hold that the making of a telephonic inquiry of the fish farm as to whether there had been a forfeiture or confiscation of an interest which the male Appellant had at that farm or perhaps just as to why he was no longer employed there was an obvious inquiry about a critical fact  As it happens  there are  for the reasons set out above  other bases upon which it is possible to conclude that the Tribunal s decision was tainted by jurisdictional error  However  this is also  in my opinion  one of those exceptional cases in which it is possible in the circumstances to conclude that the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise the review jurisdiction consigned to it by s   of the Migration Act because it failed to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact  For these reasons  the appeal must be allowed  the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal to hear and determine the review application according to law  For that purpose  the Tribunal should not be constituted by a member who has hitherto heard and determined that review application  I certify that the preceding fifty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
