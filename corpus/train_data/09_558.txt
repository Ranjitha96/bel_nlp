Pearson v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBRK  Bris  Pty Ltd v FCT   FCA       ATC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn relation to recklessness in the context of s  H  Cooper J observed in BRK  Bris  Pty Ltd v FCT   FCA       ATC   at     Recklessness means to include a tax statement material upon which the Act or regulations are to operate  knowing that there is a real  as opposed to a fanciful  risk that the material may be incorrect  or be grossly indifferent as to whether or not the material is true and correct  and that a reasonable person in the position of the statement maker would see there was a real risk that the Act and the regulations may not operate correctly to lead to the assessment of the proper tax payable because of the content of the tax statement  So understood  the proscribed conduct is more than mere negligence and must amount to gross carelessness  For the Commissioner  it was contended that recklessness was established by the following considerations        the Applicant s signing of commercial documents without understanding the general effect that signing those documents would have          the Applicant s acceptance of her husband s advice to take certain actions  without independent enquiry of the effect of those actions          the applicant s accepting appointment as a director of a company which was trustee for a trust of which she was a beneficiary  the operations of which she professed little knowledge          her swearing of affidavit material without personal knowledge of the factual matters contained therein          vesting of trust assets of the Jancy Trust into a separate trust  without informing audit officers of that transaction  I am not prepared to infer that the appellant was reckless for the purposes of the imposition of additional tax under s  H having regard to these considerations citedCarr v Finance Corporation of

Kajewski v FCT   ATC    In my opinion  it is not competent for the Federal Court to conduct a merits review of the exercise of the discretion by the Commissioner to remit  As my reasons at first instance indicate  the appellant was actively involved with Jancy Pty Ltd  the trustee of the Jancy Trust  of which she was the primary beneficiary  She had extensive involvement in the refinancing of property owned by Jancy Pty Ltd with the ANZ Bank citedPearson v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlOn   July   the Full Court of the Federal Court  Dowsett  Allsop and Edmonds JJ  allowed the appellant s appeals in part  Pearson v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC    In my reasons of   March   I said  at     There is no dispute in these proceedings as to the Commissioner s power to issue amended assessments and his approach to the quantification of additional tax payable by the appellant  should his contentions concerning the income and the asserted disclaimers be accepted  And  at   I said    The parties are agreed that if I should find for the Commissioner in respect of the issues concerning the trust income of  Corplan Financial Network Unit Trust  CFNUT  and  Corplan Financial Group Unit Trust  CFGUT  in the relevant years and find against the appellant on the question of disclaimers  the monetary amounts should be as in the table annexed to these reasons  The judgment of Edmonds J  with whom Dowsett and Allsop JJ agreed  said concerning this issue  On the hearing of the appeal  Senior Counsel for the appellant accepted that   and   accurately reflect what his Honour was asked to do  He also accepted  although as it subsequently transpired he should not have  that no submission  written or oral  was put below as to the absence of a basis for recklessness and moreover  that he did not even draw his Honour s attention to the allegedly live question of additional tax  He said that the matter was raised as an issue in the initiating application to the Court  although it seems it was not raised as an issue in the statement of facts  issues and contentions filed by the parties as part of the interlocutory processes   If these were the only facts then  in my opinion  by the time the case came on for hearing before his Honour below  the issue of additional tax was no longer a live discrete issue  it may have remained an issue in name  but only on the basis that it stood or fell by reference to the outcome of the substantive issue   While  on the hearing of the appeal  Senior Counsel for the appellant did not accept this view of the matter  he did accept that it would be more appropriately framed as an application for leave to agitate the issue rather than as a challenge to his Honour s disposition of the matter  I tend to agree and on those facts and concessions  I would not be prepared to grant leave   However  following the hearing of the appeal  papers  including transcript below  were filed with the Court which indicate that the factual basis of the imposition of additional tax  namely recklessness  was still an issue so far as the appellant was concerned  even if the respondent and the Court thought otherwise    appliedReliance Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v FCT     FLR  The word  false  in the former s   means  wrong  Reliance Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v FCT
