www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Members of the High Court were at pains in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at    per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  to affirm that failure by a public officer to comply with a statutory obligation  while it may or may not affect the validity of an act or decision in question  may nevertheless be attended by legal consequences and that a court may restrain subsequent administrative action predicated upon supposed compliance with the unmet statutory condition until the default has been remedied   I add that the appellant sought to raise some new grounds without descending to particulars  There appears to be nothing in any of them   The appeal will be dismissed with costs assessed at     I certify that the preceding ten   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick    Associate Dated    July   Counsel for the Appellant  The appellant

of time for the purposes of the statutory time limits on judicial review and that no jurisdictional error arose  In this regard his Honour followed WACB v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   and SZICO v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FMCA   at     As his Honour pointed out at    The potential mischief resulting from a failure to comply with sub section  B  is that an applicant may hypothetically be deprived of the opportunity of seeking judicial review of a tribunal decision          His Honour continued at       However  as was made clear by the High Court in WACB   that mischief does not in fact arise because time does not run for the purposes of statutory time limits on access to the courts until the required notification is given  Hypothetically  an applicant might challenge a purported notification of a tribunal decision which did not meet the requirements of s  B  but there would be no point in doing so  given that in the absence of the required notification  it remains open to an applicant to apply in this Court or the High Court to challenge the Tribunal decision  not simply the notification     It follows  and I find that  compliance with s  B  is not generally a condition subsequent to the making of a lawful decision in accordance with Part   of the Migration Act   It is a separate and enforceable statutory obligation on the Tribunal and a failure to comply with it  in accordance with the High Court decision in WACB  will render inoperative current statutory time limits on judicial review applications to the courts  The point is academic in this case as the judicial review application was filed within the prescribed time limit referred toWACB v The
