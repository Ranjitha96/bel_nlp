Akai Pty Limited  in liq  v Ho   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedBluebird Investments Pty Ltd v Graf     ACSR   In my opinion  no such prima facie case has been established  The Agreement is not capable of any reasonable construction which would give Grande Group any power of control of the composition of the Board or any power to cast or control the casting of votes at a general meeting of Akai Australia  Any suggestion that this could be achieved through Akai Electric is speculation not supported by any reasonable evidentiary base  I do not regard the decision of Santow J in Bluebird Investments Pty Ltd v Graf     ACSR   at     as providing any support to Akai in that respect  The case against Grande Holdings cannot rise above that against Grande Group  This affects the whole of paragraph   of the Details of Claim in the Application   It is alleged in Paragraph   of the Details of Claim that each of Grande Group and Grande Holdings are vicariously liable for the conduct of Ho and Binney as employers and principals  Paragraph   of the Statement of Claim carries that allegation no further in substance  There have been no detailed submissions addressed to the point and no authorities cited in support of it  As submitted on behalf of the respondents  vicarious liability is a principle of the law of torts and its application in these circumstances is far from self explanatory  In the absence of an explanation  no prima facie case is established   There is now no challenge to the paragraph   of the Details of Claim  being the

is a review of the original decision to grant leave by way of rehearing   Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at      Evidence has been tendered which was not before the judge who made the original order and I have had the benefit of detailed submissions from both sides  The substance of the motion requires the application of O   r   and  in particular  O   r    The applicants on the motion do not raise any issue as to compliance with to O   r  a  or  b   It is submitted that the applicants in the proceeding  together called Akai  do not have a prima facie case for the relief sought within the meaning of O   r  c   The burden of establishing a prima facie case lies upon Akai who obtained leave to serve out of the jurisdiction     Akai initially took a preliminary point based upon lack of evidence which was overtaken by events  but which  in any case  did not take account of the nature of the proceeding on the motion   It is necessary to bear in mind that the requirement of a prima facie case has to be met at the outset of proceedings  usually on an ex parte basis  A prima facie case in this sense does not amount to a prediction of an outcome or a conclusion that a finding for the applicant is the likely ultimate result of a case  It is necessary that there be a foundation established for an arguable case   WSGAL Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   per Beaumont J at   Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at    It has been said that  a prima facie case is made out if  on the material before the court  inferences are open which if translated into findings of fact  would support the relief claimed    Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd  In liq   Receiver and Manager appointed      FCR

liquidation  v New Zealand Guardian Trust Ltd   FCA        What the Court must determine is whether the case made out on the material presented shows that a controversy exists between the parties that warrants the use of the Court s processes to resolve it and whether causing a proposed respondent to be involved in litigation in the Court in Australia is justified   Counsel for Akai submits that there is a body of evidence which points to the inference that Messrs Binney  Yuen and Lam were each  in fact  acting upon instructions given to them by Ho on behalf of Grande Holdings  There is a sound factual basis for the submissions by counsel for Akai bearing in mind the interlocutory nature of this proceeding and the admissibility of hearsay evidence   Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  above  at     Binney made it clear at his public examination that he acted upon the instructions of  and reported to  Ho in connection with the affairs of Akai Australia  There is documentary evidence of the direct involvement of Ho in decision making in relation to the Silver Phoenix transaction  There is also documentary evidence that Ho was effectively in charge of negotiations concerning the refinancing and restructuring of the whole Akai group  including Akai Australia  Paragraph   of the Statement of Claim particularises a number of actions of officers connected with the Grande companies other than Binney related to the giving of instructions to officers of Akai Australia  Although there appears to be an error in describing Mr Tony Lam as a director of Grande Holdings  there is material in the evidence to support the contention that each of the parties particularised  including Mr Tony Lam  was acting as an officer of Grande Holdings or upon the instructions of Grande Holdings in relation to the affairs of Akai Australia  In particular  this applies to Yuen   Nonetheless  the point remains that the Agreement underpinned the dealings and can be seen as the legal foundation for giving and receiving the instructions  Counsel for Ho and Grande Holdings makes the point that the involvement of Ho and Grande Holdings in negotiations concerning the overall restructure of the worldwide Akai Group  including the relevance of that restructure to Australia  is a different subject from  and should not be confused with  the day to day administration of the Agreement which it is submitted formed the basis of the dealings with Akai Australia   A prima facie case of one sort or another has been found against each of Ho  Grande Group and Grande Holdings  It is submitted for Akai that this is sufficient to lead to dismissal of the motion as a whole in view of the decision of the Full Court in Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  above    Counsel for the Grande parties accepts that I am bound by that decision  although the formal submission was made that the dissenting judgment of Finkelstein J is to be preferred  Carr J said  at        Accordingly  once the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction in the proceeding and that one or other of the various cases referred to in O   r   apply  then  in my opinion  the party seeking leave or resisting a revocation of such leave  need only show a prima facie case for the relief sought in the proceeding          As the primary judge noted at   of his reasons  the applicant s proceeding is founded on breaches in Australia of s   of the TPA  in summary  giving effect to the Cartel Arrangement by making agreements containing price fixing and market sharing provisions and giving effect to those provisions  and is brought in respect of  and for the recovery of  damage suffered by the group members in the Commonwealth    Senior counsel for the Aventis Foreign Respondents submitted that the causes of action against those respondents were disparate  One set of claims was based on a series of communications between them and the Australian Aventis Respondents  The other was put on the basis that the Aventis Foreign Respondents were at all times active in Australia    But there was no submission that the applicant was seeking to litigate matters which had no real connection with Australia  or that the applicant had joined a trifling claim having merit and falling within r   with other claims without substance which did not fall within r            In my view  the primary judge did not err in holding that it was sufficient  for the purposes of O   r  c  to be satisfied that the applicant had a prima face case for relief on the basis of any of the causes of action relied upon by her against each of the Foreign Respondents      Branson J said  at        It was argued on the appeal that before the court can have the satisfaction required by O   r  c  it is necessary for the court to be satisfied that the party seeking leave has a prima facie case for the relief sought pursuant to each of the causes of action relied upon  The alternative possibility is that it is sufficient that a prima facie case for the relief sought is made out on one of the causes of action relied upon          In my view  at least where the relevant originating process is an application  the inference is strong that the expression  the relief sought by the party in the proceeding  in O   r  c  is intended to carry the same meaning as the expression  the relief claimed by the applicant  in O   r  a   As is mentioned above  that meaning is the remedy sought by the applicant in the proceeding rather than the relief sought pursuant to each cause of action to be relied upon          It is significant  in my view  that O   r   does not give rise to an entitlement to serve originating process outside the Commonwealth  it gives the court a discretion to give leave which may only be exercised if the court is satisfied as to the matters identified in the subrule  The court might be satisfied of those matters but nonetheless decide  in the exercise of its discretion  to refuse leave to serve outside of the Commonwealth  Alternatively  the court could give leave to serve outside the Commonwealth but make such leave subject to terms and conditions which the court considered appropriate  I am not presently able to think of any reason why a condition imposed on the leave to serve could not  in an appropriate case  limit the causes of action which the applicant was entitled to plead in the statement of claim or rely upon in the affidavit should a statement of claim not be appropriate  O   r            I conclude that it is not necessary  before the court can have the satisfaction required by O   r  c  that the court be satisfied that the party seeking leave to serve originating process outside the Commonwealth has a prima facie case for the relief sought pursuant to each of the causes of action relied upon  In my view  O   r  c  requires the court to be satisfied that the party has a prima facie case for the remedy sought by the applicant in the proceeding    The relief sought by the applicant in this proceeding is identified by para   of the second amended application  That relief is declaratory relief pursuant to s  A of the TPA  damages pursuant to s   of the TPA  injunctions under s   and possibly  relief under s   of the TPA  I agree  for the reasons given by Carr J  that it was open to the primary judge to be satisfied that the applicant has a prima facie case for the relief sought by her in the proceeding within the meaning of O   r  c  of the Rules      Finkelstein J  having held that the conditions in r   must be satisfied in respect of each cause of action raised in the proceeding  went on to say  at      A different construction has been placed on O   r  c  by the other judges  In their opinion  if an applicant makes out a prima facie case for the relief  that is  the remedy  he seeks the condition will be satisfied  whether or not that relief is based on more than one cause of action  I accept  of course  that this construction of the rule is open  though it is not the construction which I prefer  Moreover  it is a construction which has the potential to bring about some unusual results  Let it be assumed that three plaintiffs each bring an action for two causes  one in contract and the other in tort  and that each cause of action arises out of the same facts  In one case the plaintiff seeks specific performance of the contract and damages for the tort  This plaintiff will be required to establish a prima facie case in respect of each cause of action because each gives rise to different relief  The second plaintiff claims damages for breach of contract and tort and  let it be assumed  when properly assessed the measure of those damages will be the same for each cause  This plaintiff will only be required to establish a prima facie case for one cause of action  The third plaintiff is in the same situation as the second save that the measure of damages for each cause is different  It is not clear what this plaintiff must prove to satisfy the condition  He may be required to establish a prima facie case for each cause of action because the measure of damages is different  On the other hand  the answer may depend upon the manner in which this plaintiff has formulated his relief  for example  he may only seek  Damages  or he may describe the nature of those damages in a way which indicates they are different  Whatever be the position  I see no reason in principle why any one of these plaintiffs should be treated differently from the others  On the construction of O   r  c  which I prefer each will be treated in the same way   The application of that decision to this proceeding is not crystal clear  That question can be illustrated by considering the position of Ho  The only relief sought against him is in the first paragraph of the Details of Claim  I have held that there is no prima facie case against him in relation to paragraphs     and      I have found that there is a prima facie case against him in relation to part of paragraph      It can be concluded that a case against Ho has been made in relation to the relief identified in paragraph     namely  orders pursuant to s  H of the Act requiring him to compensate the first applicant in respect of damages resulting from such contraventions  When the Statement of Claim is considered  as it should be in view of its incorporation in the Details of Claim  it is clear that those orders relate to the three heads of loss earlier identified  namely  general insolvent trading  the Capetronics transaction and the Silver Phoenix transaction  Indeed  that relief  in substance  is also sought in paragraph       If  in substance  the one form of monetary compensation is sought by way of relief based upon various causes of action  then the case is on all fours with Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  above    If not  then it seems to me that Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  above  should be applied as if the principle related to each separate and independent form of relief  As pointed out by Branson J in Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  above  the same practical result can be achieved by imposing terms   I am satisfied that the relief sought in paragraphs     and     when understood in the light of the Statement of Claim  is  in substance  the same and can be regarded as the same relief for present purposes  Thus  Ho is not entitled to have service upon him set aside in any respect  I am not disposed to impose terms at this stage limiting the effect of service by excluding the shadow director allegations  The underlying facts are likely to be similar in relation to all aspects of paragraph   of the Details of Claim and a decision as to whether that part of the claim should be struck out is best made in the context of the overall management of the case  Consideration will also need to be given to paragraphs     and       I take a different view in relation to paragraphs   and    It is questionable whether the relief sought is the same relief as that involved in paragraphs   and   and  in my opinion  is sufficiently distinct from it to make it unnecessary and undesirable that an overseas party should be put to the trouble and expense of coming to Australia to defend   I have found that there is no prima facie case against Grande Group pursuant to paragraphs   or   of the Details of Claim  Grande Group does not challenge service in relation to paragraphs   and   of the Details of Claim  On one view  the substance of the relief sought in paragraphs       and   of the Details of Claim is the same designed to recoup the identified losses  If that were so  Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  above  would indicate that Grande Group is not entitled to relief on the motion otherwise then pursuant to the general discretion  I am not satisfied that the relief sought in paragraphs   and   of the Details of Claim is identical to that sought in paragraphs   and    I am prepared to set aside service in relation to paragraphs   and    Even if I am wrong in that  I would achieve the same result by imposing terms   Grande Holdings is implicated in relation to more of paragraph   of the Details of Claim than Ho and is in the same position as Grande Group in relation to paragraphs   and     The Application and service of the Application upon each of Grande Group and Grande Holdings will be set aside in so far as paragraphs   and   of the Details of Claim are concerned  Subject to submissions to the contrary  the Application should be amended to delete paragraphs   and   of the Details of Claim and the Statement of Claim should be amended accordingly  As the major relief sought in the motion has not been granted  but there has been a measure of success    per cent of the costs of the respondents to the motion  the applicants in the proceeding  will be the applicants  costs in the cause       I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs

 ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The particular definition of  officer  was introduced to the Act in   by the Corporation Law Economic Reform Program Act    Cth   However  like issues have arisen in relation to similar provisions at various times  A useful summary appears in the judgment of McColl JA in Forge v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALR   at      A very wide application was given to the definition by Santow J in Re HIH Insurance Ltd  in prov liq  and HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd  in prov liq  Australian Securities and Investments Commission  ASIC  v Adler   NSWSC         FLR       ACSR   at      There does not appear to have been any discussion about that aspect of the judgment on the appeal   Adler v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   NSWCA         FLR       ACSR    Austin J also recently discussed some former similar provisions in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vines     ACSR   at             and     although the factual situation in that case differed substantially from the present facts   The facts in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler are somewhat closer  Adler was a director of HIH Insurance Limited  HIH  from   April   to   February    He joined the Investment Committee of HIH on   June   and was a member of that Committee throughout    HIH Casualty and General Insurance Co Limited  HIHC  was a wholly owned subsidiary of HIH  Adler had no office in that company  It was held that Adler was an officer of HIHC by virtue of his participation in decisions by the Board of HIH and the Investment Committee of HIH affecting the affairs of HIHC  It was found that he was one  who makes or participates in making  decisions that affect the whole  or a substantial part  of the business of HIHC  namely investment decisions  and also  as a director of the parent HIH  had at the relevant times  a capacity to affect significantly the corporation s  HIHC s  financial standing    That reasoning is not directly applicable to the present circumstances as it was a case of parent and subsidiary  However  it can be argued that the effect of the Agreement is to substitute the board of Grande Group for the board of Akai Australia for all practical purposes and it can also be argued that the position of Ho viz a viz Grande Group is more significant than was the role of Adler in relation to HIHC  Whilst any such conclusion  and indeed the correctness of the reasoning in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler  may be debateable  the issue is appropriate to be settled at trial rather than at this interlocutory stage  I thus conclude that there is a prima facie case that Ho was a deemed officer of Akai Australia at the relevant time  although not a deemed director  As appears from paragraph   of the Details of Claim  there are relevant differences in the effect of being a deemed officer as compared with a deemed director as some consequences of being a director are not suffered by officers  eg  there is no liability under s  G   All of paragraph   of the Details of Claim is predicated upon the respondents being directors or officers   The next issue is whether there is a prima facie case that either Grande Group or Grande Holdings was a holding company of Akai Australia such as to lead to the potential contravention of s  V as alleged in paragraph   of the Details of Claim  By s    holding company  in relation to a body corporate  means a body corporate of which the first body corporate is a subsidiary  Whether a body corporate is a subsidiary is determined by the application of ss     and   of the Act  It is suggested that here each of Grande Group and Grande Holdings controlled the composition of the Board of Akai Australia and was in a position to cast  or control a casting of  more than one half of a maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general meeting of Akai Australia   In the case of Grande Group  it is alleged that the prima facie case followed from the Agreement and the control it could exercise directly and through Akai Electric  and  in the case of Grande Holdings  by virtue of its shareholding in  and control of  Grande Group referred toStandard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd v Antico     ALR       NSWLR   A shadow director of a company includes a person who is not validly appointed as a director where the directors of a company are accustomed to act in accordance with the person s instructions or wishes   Corporations Act    Cth   the Act  s    There is authority that a corporation can be a shadow director   Standard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd v Antico     ALR       NSWLR   at       A prima facie case has certainly been established that the directors and officers of Akai Australia regarded themselves as bound to follow the instructions of Grande Group during the relevant period  The question is whether there is a prima facie case that they were accustomed to act in accordance with the instructions or wishes of Ho and Grande Holdings  The mere fact that Grande Group was a subsidiary of Grande Holdings and that Grande Holdings was accustomed to act in accordance with the instructions or wishes of Ho would not be sufficient to establish such a case   Standard Chartered Bank  above  at  B and  G   It seems to me  however  that a possible view of the facts at a prima facie level is that the directors and officers of Akai Australia were prepared to  and did  accept instruction from those whom they regarded as speaking for the Grande group of companies as a whole and  in particular  from those speaking with the authority of the ultimate holding company  Grande Holdings  and its effective controller  Ho  Binney does not appear to have been a director or officer of Grande Group and the communications  generally speaking  do not purport to emanate from that particular company  I have already referred to the evidence of involvement of officers acting on behalf of Grande Holdings   In my opinion  there is a prima facie case that Grande Holdings was a shadow director of Akai Australia  I am not persuaded that the same conclusion should be reached in relation to Ho  It needs to be borne in mind that the question is not one of actual or ultimate control by Ho but  rather  concerns the propensity of the local executives to act upon the instructions and wishes of Ho  I cannot see a sufficient basis for raising an arguable case that Ho gave any direct instructions to any such executive  or that there is a proper basis upon which it could be concluded that those who did give instructions gave them in the name of Ho  Even if there were  there is nothing to indicate that Ho was acting as an individual rather than as the chief executive of Grande Holdings   However  paragraph   of the Details of Claim also alleges that Ho and Grande Holdings are deemed officers of Akai Australia  A shadow  officer  of a company includes     b  a person           i  who makes  or participates in making  decisions that affect the whole  or a substantial part  of the business of the
