under which the right or cause of action was created  Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC    In that case  the House of Lords held that an assignment of a right of action  breach of contract  which arose in England  and which was effected in Switzerland by an agreement governed by Swiss law  was void under English law because English law did not permit the assignment of a bare right to litigate   In consequence  although both assignments in the present case included  governing law  clauses  and were purportedly entered into in Canada  those clauses are not relevant in deciding whether the causes of action in question are assignable  That question is to be decided by the law of the place where the causes of action arose  As the causes of action relied on arose in Australia  Australian law is applicable   The principles governing the assignability of causes of action in tort and equity are discussed in Meagher  Gummow and Lehane Equity Doctrines and Remedies     th ed  Butterworths    pp      Of fundamental importance is the principle that  as a right to sue for damages for tort is merely a bare right of action  and not itself property  a purported assignment of a cause of action for damages for tort is not legally effective  Poulton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   per Williams  Webb and Kitto JJ at    Their Honours  observations in Poulton were dicta  and arguably not in conformity with later observations of the House of Lords in Trendtex   In the latter case  some of their Lordships observed  also dicta  that although it remained a fundamental principle of English law that a bare right to litigate is not capable of assignment  an exception exists in the case of an assignee with a genuine commercial interest in taking and enforcing the assignment for his own benefit  That principle was subsequently applied by the House of Lords  in relation to an assignment of a cause of action for damages in tort  in Giles v Thompson     AC     In Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ALR   McDougall J identified a number of first instance judgments  some applying and some declining to apply the Trendtex principle in Australia  In the result  although minded to favour the adoption of the Trendtex principle with respect to the assignability of causes of action in contract  his Honour acknowledged the continuing force and application of the observations in Poulton in relation to the assignability of causes of action in tort   Subsequent to Rickard Constructions   passing reference was made to the issue by Finkelstein J in TS   B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v  Fold Resources Pty Ltd  No        FCR   at      Once again  the brief discussion was dicta and  unsurprisingly  was inconclusive on the subject  His Honour observed that  in Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   the High Court may have recently approved Trendtex   But that observation is of doubtful application to circumstances such as those of the present case  In Fostif   the High Court was not concerned with the validity of a purported assignment of a cause of action but rather whether an action should be stayed as an abuse of process because of the existence of a litigation funding arrangement between the plaintiffs and a firm of consultants  The appeal to the High Court was allowed on a quite separate basis  and the question of the validity of the assignment of a cause of action was nowhere considered   The most recent discussion on the subject is that of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v J P Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd     FCR    In that case the issue  like that in Fostif   was whether a litigation funding agreement constituted an abuse of process  Tamberlin and Jacobson JJ  Rares J dissenting  held that it was not  concluding that the funder  Westpac Banking Corporation  did have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim  citing both Fostif and Trendtex in support  Importantly  the majority at   expressly noted that the agreement in question was  not an assignment of the cause of action  as did Rares J at   who noted further that it was common ground between the parties that the causes of action in question  were not capable of assignment to Westpac    It is apparent  therefore  that the statement of principle by Williams  Webb and Kitto JJ in Poulton retains its authority  As commented by Meagher et al  op cit at p   in respect of those first instance decisions that purport to favour adoption of the principles stated in Trendte x in preference to that in Poulton     The difficulty is that the proposition urged is inconsistent with Poulton v Commonwealth     and it is not easy for courts below the High Court legitimately to depart from the considered dicta of three High Court Justices   Further  even if Trendtex was accepted as good law in Australia in relation to the assignment of tortious and equitable claims  Crocodile had no genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment  It is clear from the cases that a mere personal interest in profiting is not enough  Cohen J in Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     NSWLR   at   said    In my opinion  the interest claimed by the plaintiff  is not a genuine commercial interest in the way that the phrase has been used in the judgments  Examples may be given from the facts in the various cases concerned  For instance it was held that there was such an interest where the assignee was already a substantial creditor of the assignor with a right to enforce the debt  Trendtex  Re Timothy s  or where the assignee was the sole shareholder who was a guarantor of the overdraft of the assignor  Re Daley  or where the assignee was a debenture holder with an interest in protecting the value of its security  First City Corporation  followedPoulton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www

Mutual Property Services  Australia  Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Limited     ALR   To similar effect  in National Mutual Property Services  Australia  Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Limited     ALR   at   Lindgren J said that the interest must exist independently of the assignment          the genuine commercial interest referred to in Trendtex is not a nebulous notion of the general commercial advantage of the assignee but something more specific and limited  In particular  it does not embrace an interest arising from an arrangement voluntarily entered into by the assignee of which the impugned assignment is an essential part  like the arrangement in the present case  Rather  the expression refers to a commercial interest which exists already or by reason of other matters  and which receives ancillary support from the assignment   For the reasons discussed above  there was no loan between Crocodile and Arkaroola and the charge over Arkaroola s assets granted in favour of Crocodile was not created until   February   well after the first assignment was supposedly entered into in  Crocodile  therefore  had no genuine commercial interest prior to the Deed of Assignment   In the result  the first assignment  even if genuine  was not legally effective to assign the relevant causes of action from Arkaroola to Crocodile  It follows that the second assignment from Crocodile to Mr Salinger is of no effect
