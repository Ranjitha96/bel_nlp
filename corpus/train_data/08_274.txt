SZJOH v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedCoulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The written submission on the part of the Appellant that there has been a breach of s  A is also rejected  If the submission is to be construed as an application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to raise an additional ground of appeal  the application for leave is refused  It was not an argument raised before the Federal Magistrate and no explanation has been advanced as to why the argument should now be entertained  Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR     A letter was in fact forwarded to the Appellant pursuant to s  A inviting him to comment on the matters therein set forth  The letter is that dated   April   and provided in relevant part as follows      You are invited to comment  in writing  on the following information    When you applied for the Bridging A visas on   November   your application for substantive visas  ie Protection visas  had been finally determined   This information is relevant because it may indicate that you do not meet the requirements of cl     b      When you applied for judicial review of the decision in relation to your protection visas on   October   you did not hold Bridging A visa or a Bridging B visa   This information is relevant because it may indicate that you do not meet the requirements of cl     c      You applied for Protection visas in Class XA on   January     This information is relevant because it may indicate that you do not meet the requirements of cl    b      You had not made valid applications for a subclass of a visa prescribed by cl    a    This information is relevant because it may indicate that you are unable to meet the requirements of cl     a      You had not made valid applications for a subclass of a visa prescribed by cl    a    This information is relevant because it may indicate that you are unable to meet the requirements of cl     a      At the time of the Tribunal s decision  the judicial review of a decision in relation to your application for Protection visas has been completed and there is no evidence that the decision has been appealed   This information is relevant because it may indicate that you do not meet the requirements of cl     d  and therefore cl        If the intent of the letter was to invite comments from the Appellant in relation to the matters raised  it is  with respect  far from satisfactory  The letter  not surprisingly  has all the hallmarks of being written by a person with experience and detailed and extensive knowledge of the Migration Act and Migration Regulations   But it is a letter written to a non lawyer and a person  at the very least  not fluent or conversant with the English language  Nowhere in the letter is there a reference to the clauses referred to being provisions to be found in the Migration Regulations   The origin or source of the clauses referred to would remain a mystery to the reader  Nowhere in the letter are the provisions of those clauses of the Regulations set forth  and a copy of the Regulations or an extract is not annexed  Those with access to the three volumes of the current Migration Regulations may also experience difficulty in finding the clauses of present relevance  Even an educated person may well have difficulty in making any meaningful comment in such circumstances  A letter inviting a person to comment upon undisclosed provisions is  it is considered  not much of an   invitation to comment  citedRandhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government   Ethnic Affairs     FCR   It is considered that the appeal must be dismissed for the reasons previously given by both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court  The Grounds of Appeal seek to characterise the errors as being errors of law  jurisdictional error and procedural fairness  There is also a ground which asserts that the Federal Magistrate did not apply Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government   Ethnic Affairs     FCR    The grounds are expressed in the most general terms but content may be given to them if reference is made to the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate   The Appellant s written submissions filed in this Court also make a submission as to a breach of s  A of the Migration Act    Cth    It is considered that each of the Grounds of Appeal should be dismissed as should the submission in respect to s  A   The decision of the Full Court in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government   Ethnic Affairs     FCR   is a decision as to the definition of a   refugee    Its relevance to the present proceedings  other than an impermissible attempt to now recanvass the earlier unsuccessful claims for a protection visa  is not apparent followedSJSB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Provision is made in the Migration Act    Cth  for the grant of a visa  s    Section   provides for the grant of a   bridging visa   provided an applicant satisfies criteria which may be prescribed by regulation  s    Failure to satisfy those criteria requires a refusal of the application  SJSB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Ryan  Jacobson and Lander JJ   For present purposes  the regulations of relevance may be found in Schedule   to the Migration Regulations    Cth  being regulations     and      Those regulations relevantly provide as follows        Criteria to be satisfied at the time of application         The applicant meets the requirements of subclause         or        An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if     a  the applicant has made  in Australia  a valid application for a substantive visa of a kind that can be granted if the applicant is in Australia  and    b  that application has not been finally determined                An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if          c  at the time of that application  he or she held a Bridging A  Class WA  or Bridging B  Class WB  visa                An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if           b  he or she has not applied for a Protection  Class AZ  or Protection  Class XA  visa               An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if     a  the applicant has made a valid application for     specified visas               An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if     a  the applicant has made a valid application for        specified visas  and            Criteria to be satisfied at the time of decision       The applicant continues to satisfy the criterion set out in clause       For the reasons given by the Migration Review Tribunal  the Appellant does not satisfy Clauses           or    The now Appellant did not satisfy Clause    b  as his application for a protection visa had been   finally determined   at the time of his application in November    That phrase is further defined by s   of the Migration Act    Cth   In the circumstances of the present case  the application for the protection visa had been   finally determined   as the delegate had refused the application and there had been no review   instituted as prescribed   within the meaning of s  b   The Appellant did not satisfy cl    c  as he was not the holder of a bridging visa A or B  he did not satisfy cl    b  as he had applied for a protection visa  and there was no evidence that he had applied for a class of visa prescribed by cl    a  or  a  followedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA       ALR   Comfort was sought to be drawn by the Respondent Minister in a submission that the matters in respect of which comment was sought was not   information  within the meaning of s  A and that  accordingly  an invitation need not have been sent at all  That submission may well be correct  It may well be that the matters set forth are more in the nature of the thought processes or reasoning of the Tribunal  SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       FCA       ALR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ  But  insofar as the Appellant is concerned  such subtleties do not deny the fact that he would have received the letter and read that it was forwarded to him in an attempt to   ensure both a fair and speedy review process    The letter previously stated    The Migration Act    the Act  contains provisions intended to ensure both a fair and speedy review process  These include opportunities for review applicants to respond to material before the Tribunal  as well as limits on further opportunities if there is a failure to provide comments within a specified period   Section  A of the Act states that the Tribunal must explain  and invite comments on   particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision that is under review    If a letter in the form of that forwarded to the Appellant is to be sent  it is considered at a minimum that the letter should identify the source of the requirements being set forth and either extract the relevant provisions or annex a copy of the relevant Regulations   The bona fides of the author of the letter are not in question  What is in question is whether such matters as were disclosed in the letter put the recipient in a position where he could meaningfully contribute to what was held out as a   fair and speedy review process     Such deficiencies in the letter  however  do not advantage the Appellant  even if a breach of s  A is made out and even if leave to raise the matter had been permitted  The simple fact is that he cannot bring himself within regulation     of Schedule   to the Migration Regulations and leave to amend should thus be refused  Any relief would have been refused as a matter of discretion  cf SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       FCA       ALR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ  In the present case  the refusal of leave to amend and the refusal of relief  even if a breach be established  is an exercise of discretion that   is proper  prudent  economical and just     HCA   at   per Kirby J   None of the Grounds of Appeal is made out   Accordingly  the appeal must be dismissed  An award of costs is always discretionary but there is no reason why the usual approach to the award of costs should not apply
