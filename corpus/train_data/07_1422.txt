www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   April   I delivered judgment in this proceeding   Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCA         FCR    Orders reflecting the result were made on   April     Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCA    On   November   the Full Court allowed an appeal  ordered that the orders made on   April   should be set aside and remitted the matter to me for reconsideration   Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR    That reconsideration has been delayed by reason of an appeal to the High Court in related proceedings   X v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority     CLR    This is that reconsideration  The case concerns a challenge under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the ADJR Act  to a decision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority  APRA  to disqualify the applicant pursuant to s  A of the Insurance Act    Cth   I will assume a familiarity with the history and circumstances of the case  the statutory background and the prior judgments in framing these reasons   The Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the AAT  has now held that it is appropriate to make orders ensuring that an applicant s identity is not disclosed in the course of proceedings before it and that APRA can be restrained from publishing a notice relating to  or in any other way revealing  its decision   Re VBJ and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   AATA         ALD       ATR    That supplements the topic referred to in Kamha   FCA       FCR   at     Whether it is appropriate to now make such orders in this case  with its history  would be a matter for the AAT   The applicant has now been charged with two offences  firstly  that he did not act honestly in exercise of powers and discharge of duties as an officer of FAI General Insurance Co Limited and  secondly  that being an officer was privy to the fraudulent altering of a database of that company  Those charges obviously involve an overlap with the subject matter of the present proceedings  The charges have been preferred in open Court and there has been newspaper publicity about them  This adds to the point discussed in Kamha   FCA       FCR   at      The Full Court appeal in this case was argued in public and the judgment of the Full Court is public  It has been available on the Court s website since shortly after it was delivered  It has been reported  The remitted proceeding has been argued in public  This judgment will be public  The fact that APRA has decided to disqualify the applicant is well and truly in the public domain by reason of his choice in bringing this proceeding relatedKamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCA  http www austlii

Review  Act    Cth   the ADJR Act  to a decision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority  APRA  to disqualify the applicant pursuant to s  A of the Insurance Act    Cth   I will assume a familiarity with the history and circumstances of the case  the statutory background and the prior judgments in framing these reasons   I rejected that submission and indicated that  in my opinion  the remittal includes exercise of the discretion whether or not to grant relief under s   of the ADJR Act  The Full Court dealt with the discretion issue in Kamha   FCAFC       FCR   at      The existence and possible application of the s   discretion was affirmed  The Full Court did not purport to exercise that discretion for itself  The Full Court decision does not preclude the application of the Federal Court Rules   including those relating to summary dismissal  The order of remittal is not limited in any way and cannot be read down  The result of the Full Court appeal is that only ground  b  in respect of the satisfaction decision and ground  b  in respect of the discretionary decision in the further amended application have been disposed of  All of the remaining grounds are open  subject to the limitations arising out of what the Full Court had to say under the heading  Reasons for deciding to disqualify   The reconsideration must be conducted in the light of the circumstances that exist at the present time  I propose to reconsider the issue of discretion before moving to complete the hearing of the remaining issues on the merits  Certain events occurring after the previous decision now need to be taken into account   It is clear enough that  if the inevitable disqualification had taken place  the applicant could have exercised the internal review and made an application to the AAT for an immediate stay and thereafter maintained confidentiality through that process and any consequent appeal to the AAT  Counsel for the applicant naturally sought to rely upon what was said by the Full Court as to  status   see Kamha   FCAFC       FCR   at       Status  is an unusual way of describing an administrative disqualification that is stayed and is subject to full confidential internal and external review on the merits  Even in the case of bankruptcy by court order  a successful appeal means that it is as if sequestration had never occurred   de Robillard v Carver     FCR   per Buchanan J at     agreed with by Moore and Conti JJ at    Reliance is also placed upon the statement  that may be a matter of prejudice       Kamha   FCAFC       FCR   at      No fact or circumstance indicating potential prejudice is identified  I cannot discern any  Nonetheless  I will take into account the possibility of some unidentified prejudice by reason of the statutory process being followed to decision by the AAT   Full internal and external merits review of a disqualification is available pursuant to s   of the Insurance Act   The existence of a
