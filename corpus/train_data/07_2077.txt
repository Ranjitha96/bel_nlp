Winspear v Mackinnon   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toGrant v John Grant   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for Rosalind seek an order under s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  correcting the share register of the relevant companies to reflect her entitlement to shareholdings in them  Rosalind has standing to apply for such an order as  a person aggrieved  given that her interests are not correctly stated in the current share register  It is appropriate and just in this case to order a correction of the register  Rosalind has established an equity to be recorded on the Dalness Pty Ltd share register by virtue of the Deeds of Appointment made by Donald on   December   see  Grant v John Grant   HCA         CLR    In relation to Rocklands Pty Ltd  the Family Rearrangement entered into in   gave Rosalind a right to be registered as the owner of one A class share immediately and the B class share upon payment  Payment was eventually made by July    Under s   the notice of correction must be lodged with ASIC and it is appropriate to so order referred toIn re Sussex Brick Company     Ch   Under s   of the Act  a person can apply for an order under s   if that person is a member of the company  Counsel for the defendants submit that Rosalind lacks such standing but concede that if the Court makes an order nunc pro tunc   finding her to be entitled retrospectively to be a member of the companies at a time prior to   October   when the application was filed  the standing issue disappears  It is appropriate in this case to make an order nunc pro tunc as equity so requires  There has been unnecessary delay in registering Rosalind as a member of the companies and there is no apparent injustice to third parties if such an order were made  see  In re Sussex Brick Company     Ch    Rosalind was entitled to be recognised as a member of Rocklands Pty Ltd from at least   July   on the payment of the price of those B Class shares and of shares in Dalness Pty Ltd from the time of the grant of probate on her father s estate on   June    She was entitled to her A Class share in Rocklands Pty Ltd as from   October     Under s   of the Act  having regard to the facts and circumstances of this matter discussed above  it may be appropriate that the companies are wound up given the unlikelihood that Neil and Rosalind are capable of working together in the best interest of the companies  However  counsel do not oppose the Court deferring the question of winding up until after the parties  primarily Rosalind and Neil  can attempt to resolve outstanding issues concerning the companies between them  before the Court is required to consider the appointment of liquidators  An order under s   will be made  if necessary  because the failure of the other shareholders in the companies to recognise Rosalind s stake in them has denied her the opportunity to play a part in the functioning of those companies and is in that sense  oppressive    Counsel for the defendants submit that the Court should invite counsel to provide  within a relatively short period  minutes of orders which the parties contend should be made to give effect to the Court s reasons  That request is a reasonable one  However  the preparation of those orders should reflect the Court s views on the plaintiff s application that      Dalness Pty Ltd should correct its register of members to record the plaintiff as a member of the company and a beneficial holder of   ordinary shares  and the beneficial owner jointly with Neil of   ordinary share  and requiring Neil and Deidre to lodge a notice of correction with ASIC     Rocklands Pty Ltd should correct its register of members to record the plaintiff as a member and the beneficial owner of   A Class share and the beneficial owner of   B Class shares  and requiring Neil and Deidre to lodge notices of correction with ASIC     Otherwise the application under s   of the Corporations Act seeking winding up of the companies and other orders as set out in paragraph   of the application should be adjourned to a date to be fixed by the Court  in consultation with the parties     The defendants  cross claim should be dismissed as no such agreements as alleged were entered into by Rosalind     As the plaintiff has wholly succeeded on the issues dealt with to date  the defendants should pay her costs of the application referred toMasters v Cameron   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is unnecessary to traverse the details of what occurred thereafter  The defendants contest Rosalind s entitlement to shares in the two companies based on what they contend was her agreement to give them up  According to the cross claim  that agreement was constituted by the   January   and   December   agreements  The   January   agreement was no more than an agreement to negotiate  So much was conceded from the bar table by the defendants  senior counsel in his final submissions  In closing  it was submitted by counsel for the defendants that the outcome of the   December   meeting constituted a binding agreement on the authority of Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR    In that case  the High Court constituted by Dixon CJ  McTiernan and Kitto JJ said at     Where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract  the case may belong to any of three classes  It may be one in which the parties have reached finality in arranging all the terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance of those terms  but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect    In such a case  as described in Masters   there is a binding contract  What is critical  in the current circumstances  is to establish the intentions of the parties viewed objectively to be bound immediately at the   December   meeting  No such evidence of any probative value was advanced in that regard  The evidence of Rosalind and the actions of both Neil and Mr McKenzie demonstrate a contrary intention  There was no agreement on   December   other than to consider the proposals contained in Mr McKenzie s paper  Rosalind did not commit herself to those proposals at that meeting  She had not ever had the opportunity to fully consider them before it occurred  Mr McKenzie s letter to Mr Sproal on   December   was based on a false premise that Rosalind had agreed to the terms of his proposal on the previous Saturday  The better view of the evidence  considered as a whole  is that she had not done so   Having regard to the foregoing there is no reason why Rosalind should not be recognised as the holder of shares in the two companies  In fact  in   the relevant register of shares showed Rosalind registered as the owner of one A Class share in Rocklands Pty Ltd  The evidence offered no explanation for this change or for its subsequent removal  Neil  under cross examination  agreed that in   Rosalind was beneficially entitled to have the A Class share registered in her name  Neil also agreed with the proposition put to him that    As to Rocklands  the correct situation which should be reflected in the share register concerning the A class shares is one share to you and one share to your sister   On   July   Neil wrote to Rosalind saying that he would arrange the  transfer of shares in both companies  to her as soon as she paid certain amounts allegedly owing to her father s estate and to the partnership upon receipt of advice as to when she would pay referred toMorgan v   Flers Avenue Pty Ltd     ACLC   Rosalind s application is also made under s   of the Act  Section   is found in Pt  F   of the Act and entitled  oppressive conduct of affairs   Section   allows the Court to make an order under s   if the conduct of the company s affairs or an omission by the company is  oppressive to  unfairly prejudicial to  or unfairly discriminatory against  a member or members       The failure of the other shareholders in the companies to recognise Rosalind s stake in them has denied her the opportunity to play a part in the functioning of those companies and is in that sense  oppressive  see  Wayde v NSW Rugby League Ltd   HCA         CLR   Morgan v   Flers Avenue Pty Ltd     ACLC    Further  it is evident that the conduct of Neil as a director of both companies has been oppressive where he unfairly used that position to deny Rosalind her right to be registered on account of purported debts owed to his father s estate and the partnership referred
