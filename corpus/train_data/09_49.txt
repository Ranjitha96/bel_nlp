cases cth FCA  htmlThe Authority submits that the power in reg   does not extend to imposing a condition that the persons so hired be  acceptable  to it  It put forward three reasons for this  First  it was said to be inconsistent with reg  C  which explicitly imposes conditions on the holder of a certificate of approval in relation to the persons employed by it  secondly  it was said that the regulation did not set forth any criteria by which the acceptability might be measured  thirdly   it was said that the Tribunal had  in truth  remitted its function to the Authority  a course which was said to be forbidden by this Court s decision in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Allan   FCA         FCR    I do not think these submissions have substance  Reg  C  provides     C  A certificate of approval is subject to   a  a condition that each activity the certificate covers must only be carried out at a place where the facilities and equipment necessary for the proper carrying out of the activity are available to the holder of the certificate   b  a condition that the activities the certificate covers must be carried out in accordance with a system of quality control that satisfies the requirements of subregulation  D  and   c  if the certificate covers some or all of the following activities   i  the design of aircraft   ii  the design of aircraft components   iii  the design of aircraft materials   vii  the maintenance of aircraft   viii  the maintenance of aircraft components   ix  the maintenance of aircraft materials   x  the training of candidates for the examinations referred to in paragraph      e   xi  the conducting of the examinations referred to in paragraph      e   a condition that each of those activities that is covered by the certificate must be carried out under the control of a person appointed by the applicant to control the activities  and   d  a condition that the holder of the certificate of approval must ensure that each person employed by  or working under an arrangement with  the holder receives adequate training in   i  the work performed by the person for the purposes of the activities covered by the certificate  and   ii  the use of any equipment used in connection with that work  As I apprehend it  the argument is that because of the specific provisions of reg  C  it should be concluded that there is excluded from the power in reg   any power to impose conditions regulating the qualities of persons employed by a certificate holder  To accept such an argument it would be necessary to identify some negative implication from reg  C  to the effect that no other power might be used to achieve a similar result  I can discern in it no basis for such an implication discussedComcare v Lees     ALR  The issues which arise from s   are more subtle  There is no doubt it requires the Tribunal to provide reasons which are adequate  There is also little question but that the question of adequacy  in the present circumstances  directs attention at least to the efficacy of the appeal process contemplated by s    The reasons must be at least sufficient in quality to permit that appeal process to be efficacious  However  the appeal process under s   is subject to the constraint that there be present a  question of law   Debate exists as to whether a failure to provide reasons is an error of law  There is an obiter dictum of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at     which suggests that a failure by the Tribunal to provide adequate reasons does not result in the invalidity of its decision and that the proper remedy is a mandatory order that reasons be provided  That view has not prevailed in this Court where it has instead been held that a failure to provide adequate reasons is an error of law  Dornan v Riordan     FCR   at   per Sweeney  Davies and Burchett JJ  The contrary view is set forth in Comcare v Lees     ALR   at     by Finkelstein J  The existence of the debate about the correctness of Dornan has been noted on a number of occasions by Full Courts of this Court  but none have thought it necessary to resolve it  To the extent that Lees assumes that there is no question of law where there is no error of law I respectfully differ  Every error of law corresponds with a question of law but the converse is not true  Questions of law concerning the processes of the Tribunal rather than its actual decision are likely to give rise to questions of law which do not correspond with any error of law in the decision of the Tribunal  The provision of inadequate reasons is one illustration  a departure from a statutorily mandated procedure during the course of a hearing may be another  There is a textual argument available against this view  Section   uses the expression  question of law  when conferring jurisdiction on this Court to hear an appeal  The same expression is used in s   which permits  in certain circumscribed circumstances  the referral by the Tribunal to this Court of a  question of law   It may be that the expressions should bear the same meaning  if so  there may be difficulties in contemplating the Tribunal referring the adequacy of its own reasons to the Court  However  the answer to that is either that  question of law  in s   does not so extend or  alternatively  that it does and that the Tribunal could refer the adequacy of its own reasons to this Court citedCommissioner for Railways for the State of Queensland v Peters     NSWLR  The second matter to which I should refer is the Tribunal s reference at   to having  had

South Australia   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan  Deane  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ  However  it is to be noted that the errors of law there identified as having that effect were said to be

  ALR   at     by Finkelstein J  The existence of the debate about the correctness of Dornan has been noted on a number of occasions by Full Courts of this Court  but none have thought it necessary to resolve it  However  as I have said  the question of whether the Tribunal s reasons are adequate is a  question of law   More formally  the question is whether the Tribunal has complied with its statutory duty under s   of the AAT Act  That is  without any doubt  a question of law even if a failure to provide adequate reasons might not involve an error of law in the decision of the Tribunal  Thus the question of the correctness of Dornan does not arise for consideration in the context of an appeal under s   where what is required is not the identification of an error of law by the Tribunal but rather the existence of a question of law for the consideration of the Court  Of course  any appeal on such a question of law is necessarily delimited by the requirement that there exist a matter in respect of which this Court might exercise its jurisdiction  For those reasons  I would prefer to regard the adequacy of reasons as reviewable under s   of the Act not because Dornan binds me to such a conclusion but rather because the adequacy of reasons is a question of law within the meaning of s    The Authority s challenge to the adequacy of the reasons provided by the Tribunal turns upon the content of paragraph   of the Tribunal s reasons which is set out at   above  In essence the complaint is that there is no explanation by the Tribunal of how it decided that Mr Fawcett and Central were fit and proper persons the paragraph merely states a conclusion  This syllogistic infelicity was supported  so the Authority argued  by noting the gulf between the Tribunal s factual findings unremittingly negative at least where competence was concerned and its conclusions on whether Central and Mr Fawcett were fit and proper persons within the meaning of reg  d   Thus  on the one hand  the Tribunal had concluded that Mr Fawcett had  in his approach to the installation of the engine of the Cirrus plane exhibited  a fundamental failure to understand his role   at   and that his explanation proffered for that failure did not  excuse what I consider to be a fundamental failure as a LAME   at   and that he  seemed to have little understanding of the concept of quality control which is central to holding a Certificate of Approval under CAR    at    The Tribunal described this last matter as being  of concern   at    On the other hand  it found that Mr Fawcett and Central were fit and proper  to have the responsibilities and exercise and perform the functions and duties of a holder of a licence and a certificate of approval respectively   at    Of course  if Dornan is correct then  additionally  the Tribunal made an error of law  However  the significance of that for present purposes hinges upon whether that conclusion would lead to a different result  Clearly  such an approach would require the Tribunal to produce its reasons again  The difference would be that  if the error of law were jurisdictional the orders of the Tribunal might be set aside  it might have to re exercise its powers afresh and it might have to do more than just produce reasons  I think it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be

issue  It may be doubted whether an error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could ever have that effect for reasons explained in Yusuf   However  even if Dornan required the conclusion that the decision of the Tribunal were afflicted by jurisdictional error  in the exercise of my discretion I would not set aside the Tribuna s decision  The existence of that discretion is confirmed by s   which provides that this Court  may  make such order as it thinks appropriate  In the context of a jurisdictional error  it is appropriate that that discretion be exercised in a way which is analogous to the refusal of prerogative relief on discretionary grounds  In that regard  the existence of an adequate alternative remedy is a proper basis for refusing relief  R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  ex parte Ozone Theatres  Aust  Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Latham CJ  Rich  Dixon  McTiernan and Webb JJ  Here adequate alternative relief is available if the decision is left in place because s  AA b  allows the Tribunal to correct its decision to ensure consistency with its reasons  That  of course  will still require an order that the Tribunal produce reasons which are adequate  It is not entirely clear to me how Dornan can explain that necessity but it is not necessary to determine that issue any other result would be surreal citedErgon Energy

suffer financial hardship if Central s certificate of approval were cancelled  One cannot tell from the Tribunal s reasons where  or even if  these findings were taken into account  It is difficult to see that they had anything to do with the Tribunal s conclusions that Mr Fawcett and Central had failed  within the meaning of reg  c  in the duty imposed on them with respect to a matter affecting the safe operation of the Cirrus aircraft  Whatever else might be said about the failure by Mr Fawcett to notice that the steel cap was missing from the engine port  it is difficult to incorporate notions of honesty or financial hardship into that particular field of discourse  On the other hand  it is difficult to see how financial hardship to Mr Fawcett had any relevance to the issue of whether he  or Central  were fit and proper persons  cf  Hughes and Vale Proprietary Limited v State of New South Wales  No     HCA         CLR   at     per Dixon CJ  McTiernan and Webb JJ  It is possible that his honesty could be seen as going to fitness and propriety but it is difficult to understand  without more  how honesty might be an answer to a lack of fitness said to be constituted by incompetence  Of course  it may be that those factors were taken into account in deciding how to exercise the discretionary power to vary  suspend or cancel which arose consequent upon the Tribunal s conclusions about reg  c   There is nothing to indicate  however  that this is what occurred  Indeed  there is no explanation of how the Tribunal came to the conclusion that it was appropriate to vary
