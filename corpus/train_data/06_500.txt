SECOND RESPONDENT   JUDGE  SACKVILLE J DATE    MAY   PLACE  SYDNEY   RULING ON EVIDENCE     THE EXPERT REPORT     Objection has been taken to the tender of a report prepared by Mr Roy A Salter  Mr Salter is a Principal of the Salter Group and is based in the Group s Los Angeles office  where he directs the firm s overall practice and project management efforts  The Salter Group is said to be     an independent financial and strategic advisory firm dedicated to the entertainment and media industry offering economic analysis  investment banking support  corporate development and other advisory services    In HG v The Queen   HCA         CLR   Gleeson CJ pointed out  at   that the provisions of s   of the Evidence Act      will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form  By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training  study or experience  the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question      His Honour also observed  at   that     in trials before judges alone  as well as in trials by jury  it is important that the opinions of expert witnesses be confined  in accordance with s     to opinions which are wholly or substantially based on their specialised knowledge  Experts who venture  opinions   sometimes merely their own inference of fact  outside their field of specified knowledge may invest those opinions with a spurious appearance of authority  and legitimate processes of fact finding may be subverted  citedOcean Marine Mutual Insurance Association  Europe  OV v Jetopay Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlSeven Network Limited v News

SECOND RESPONDENT   JUDGE  SACKVILLE J DATE    MAY   PLACE  SYDNEY   RULING ON EVIDENCE     THE EXPERT REPORT     Objection has been taken to the tender of a report prepared by Mr Roy A Salter  Mr Salter is a Principal of the Salter Group and is based in the Group s Los Angeles office  where he directs the firm s overall practice and project management efforts  The Salter Group is said to be     an independent financial and strategic advisory firm dedicated to the entertainment and media industry offering economic analysis  investment banking support  corporate development and other advisory services    Similarly  in Ocean Marine Mutual Insurance Association  Europe  OV v Jetopay Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   the Full Court observed  at   that the     further requirement  in s   that an opinion be based on specialised knowledge would normally be satisfied by the person who expresses the opinion demonstrating the reasoning process by which the opinion was reached  Thus  a report in which an opinion is recorded should expose the reasoning of its author in a way that would demonstrate that the opinion is based on particular specialised knowledge    Emphasis in original   In my opinion  the report in its present form does not meet the requirements of s   of the Evidence Act   In particular  it is impossible to ascertain whether the opinions expressed by Mr Salter quantifying losses sustained by Seven because of its inability to pursue an IMC strategy reflect his specialised knowledge  based on his training  study or experience  The report must therefore be rejected   Because Mr Sheahan SC foreshadowed the possibility that Seven would seek to adduce further evidence from Mr Salter to cure the evidentiary defects in his report  I think it is appropriate to make some additional comments
