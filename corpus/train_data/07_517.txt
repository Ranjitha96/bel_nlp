Bluescope Steel Limited  ACN       v Kelly   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCorrs Pavey Whiting   Burn v Collector of Customs     FCR   In order to succeed in a claim for a breach of confidence  Bluescope and Castrip must first identify  with some specificity  information that is said to be confidential  Next  they must show that the information has the necessary quality of confidentiality  Finally  they must show that the information was received in such circumstances as to import an obligation of confidence  There may then be an injunction to restrain threatened disclosure and there may be an account of profits in respect of actual disclosure   Corrs Pavey Whiting   Burn v Collector of Customs     FCR   at   followedDart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The claim by Bluescope and Castrip for an account of profits requires a determination of the profit derived by Mr Kelly and K Con from any wrongful use or disclosure of the relevant information  The Court  in calculating the quantum of profit  must make such approximation as will do justice to the parties   Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     K Con received sums totalling     from Danieli  K Con paid   to Messrs Sorensen  Minter  Russell  Zancolich and their respective companies and incurred travelling and other expenses of      Bluescope and Castrip assert that the net amount of     is the profit derived by Mr Kelly and K Con from their wrongful use or disclosure of the relevant information   While that calculation of profit makes an allowance for amounts paid to Messrs Sorensen  Minter  Russell  Zancolich and their companies and travelling and other expenses  it makes no other allowance for the cost of deriving the fees  Nor does it make allowance for information provided to Danieli that did not consist of confidential information relating to Project M  Danieli received information and assistance from K Con  in exchange for the fees of   that was not confidential information belonging to Bluescope and Castrip  It is tolerably clear that Danieli also obtained benefit derived from Mr Kelly s wealth of experience in steel making over some   years  It would not have been possible for Mr Kelly or K Con to disclose the specific information that has been identified except through an individual who has Mr Kelly s wealth of experience in steel making   Bluescope and Castrip contend that  without the confidential information relating to Project M  neither Mr Kelly nor K Con would have been retained by Danieli at all  They say that the whole arrangement involving the Consultancy Agreement between K Con  on the one hand  and Danieli  on the other  came about only by reason of the wrongful use of the confidential information obtained by Mr Kelly from Bluescope  They say that Danieli only paid K Con in exchange for receiving confidential Project M information  Had K Con not been in a position to provide confidential Project M information  Danieli would have paid nothing at all  Accordingly  they say  the net amount represents profit obtained by K Con from unlawful conduct  see Dart Industries at       It may be that an inference can be drawn that Danieli was interested in entering into arrangements with Mr Kelly and K Con because of Mr Kelly s involvement with Project M  However  it by no means follows that Danieli s object was to obtain confidential information relating to Project M  in breach of Mr Kelly s obligations of confidence to his employer  Bluescope and Castrip do not contend  and they have certainly not established  that all of the information imparted by Mr Kelly  either directly or through K Con  to Danieli involved a breach of Mr Kelly s obligations of confidence  On the other hand  it is for Mr Kelly to demonstrate the extent to which any benefit he received in connection with any breach of duty is attributable to his own effort  expertise and know how beyond the mere disclosure of confidential information citedFaccenda Chicken Limited v Fowler   FSR   There is a category of information that an employee must treat as confidential but which  once learned  necessarily remains in the head of the employee and becomes part of his own skill and knowledge  While that information may have been acquired in the course of the employer s business  the employee will be allowed to use his full skill and knowledge for his own benefit  even in competition with his former employer after he leaves that employment  Such information is often referred to as   know how   being the skill and knowledge that an employee gains during the course of his employment  which is not capable of protection in favour of the employer  Even so  however  that type of information may be protected from use or disclosure by express contractual arrangement  see Faccenda Chicken Limited v Fowler   FSR

it is appropriate to make an allowance in respect of Mr Kelly s skill  expertise and other expenses is a matter of judgment  As a general rule  consistently with the principle that a fiduciary must not profit from a breach of fiduciary duty  the Court will make allowance for skill  expertise and other expenses   Warman International Ltd v Dwyer   HCA         CLR   at    The grant of an allowance

the information is jealously guarded by the claimant  that it is not readily made available to employees and that it could not  without considerable effort and risk  be acquired by others  is a
