Jones v Toben  Corrigendum dated   April     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe rationale for the exercise of the contempt power is  to protect the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the Court s orders will be enforced  AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    There is  a public interest in the exercise of the contempt power in cases of disobedience to an order  Mudginberri Station   HCA       CLR   at    The law recognises a distinction between civil and criminal contempts  A civil contempt usually involves disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking  On the other hand  a criminal contempt is committed where there is contempt in the face of the court or an interference with the administration of justice  In Mudginberri Station   HCA       CLR   at   Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson and Deane JJ said    When the defendant s disobedience is casual it may readily appear that the primary purpose of exercising the power is to vindicate the plaintiffs  rights  On the other hand  when the disobedience is accompanied by public defiance it may as readily be seen that the primary purpose of exercising the power is the vindication of the court s authority  But the classification in terms of primary purpose is a more complex and artificial undertaking when the punishment is for wilful disobedience unaccompanied by defiance  There is  accordingly  much to be said for the view that all contempts should be punished as if they are quasi criminal in character  notwithstanding the adoption of the contrary view by some members of this Court in the decisions to which we have already referred  A civil contempt may be classed as a criminal contempt if there has been a contumacious defiance of the Court s order or an undertaking given to the Court  Mudginberri Station   HCA       CLR   at    The applicant contends that the respondent s conduct is contumacious and in deliberate defiance of the September   orders and the November   undertaking  In those circumstances  it was put that the respondent s conduct must be characterised as criminal contempt because  it occurs in circumstances where the conduct amounted to public defiance  involves a public injury and this calls into play a penal disciplinary jurisdiction to deal with criminal contempt  Mudginberri Station   HCA       CLR   at    In discharging the onus of proof  the applicant must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had knowledge of the order or undertaking and voluntarily did an act or omitted to do an act in breach of that order or undertaking  A party must comply strictly with an order that requires the party to do something or to refrain from doing something  The course of the trial Dr Toben was represented by counsel  I adopted the procedure of having the charges read over to Dr Toben  He pleaded not guilty to each of the   charges  I should address the question of contumacy because it is important in classifying the contempt and in considering any penalty to determine whether the disobedience to the order has been wilful or contumacious  Mudginberri Station   HCA       CLR   at     and      I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the separate publications on the Adelaide Institute website of the material which has established each of the charges which I have found proven was wilful and contumacious  The fact that the AI Document has appeared regularly on the Adelaide Institute website on each of the days accessed and can be accessed through a number of the Adelaide Institute newsletters is evidence of a wilful and contumacious disobedience of the September   orders and the November   undertaking  Moreover  the number of statements which have been identified by the applicant in support of the charges giving rise to the imputations  in particular imputations   and   of the September   orders which I have found proven on the various dates upon which the Adelaide Institute website was accessed  shows a wilful and contumacious disregard of the September   orders and the November   undertaking referred toAttorney General v Punch Ltd   UKHL         All ER  In Attorney General v Punch Ltd   UKHL         All ER     Lord Nicholls said at     An interlocutory injunction  like any other injunction  must be expressed in terms which are clear and certain  The injunction must define precisely what acts are prohibited  The Court must ensure that the language of its order makes it plain what is permitted and what is prohibited  This is a well established  soundly based principle  The person should not be put at risk of being in contempt of court by an ambiguous prohibition  or a prohibition the scope of which is obviously open to dispute  It was argued that the September   orders were imprecise and vague in that in paragraph   of the orders reference was made to  substantially similar content to the document  About the Adelaide Institute   It was contended that the form of order required the respondent to make a subjective assessment of what might be substantially similar content to that which was contained in the document  About the Adelaide Institute   It was contended that in those circumstances the order was so vague that it should not be the subject matter of contempt proceedings citedAttorney General v Times Newspapers   AC  In Attorney General v Times Newspapers   AC   at   Lord Diplock said    Contempt of court is punishable because it undermines the confidence not only of the parties to the particular litigation but also of the public as potential suitors  in the due administration of justice by the established courts of law appliedAustralian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn The King v Metal Trades Employers Association  Ex parte Amalgamated Engineering Union  Australian Section   HCA         CLR   at   Latham CJ said   Wilful disobedience to an order of the Court is contempt of a criminal nature   In Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan   HCA         CLR   at   Barwick CJ said    A contempt in procedure by disobedience of an order of the Court or by breach of an undertaking given to it may be accompanied by such contumacy or defiance on the part of the party against whom the contempt proceedings are brought as evidences a criminal as well as a civil contempt citedBakerland Pty Ltd v Coleridge   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlSection   of the Evidence Act applies to both criminal and civil trials  It permits the Court to refuse to admit evidence if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the party against whom the evidence is sought to be tendered  It seems to me the unguarded admissions made by a party which are sought to be used for the purpose of proving the party to be in contempt of Court and therefore liable to be imprisoned could be unfairly prejudicial to that party  They might  if admitted  mean that that party is put at a forensic disadvantage by having to give evidence to explain the admissions where otherwise that party would choose not to give evidence  The Courts have said the inability to cross examine on material sought to be adduced in a civil trial may attract the discretion in s   Bakerland Pty Ltd v Coleridge   NSWCA   at     Longhurst v Hunt   NSWCA   at        citedBiba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd   Ch  Of course  the November   undertaking is in a different class  The respondent gave the undertaking himself  He has always been aware of that undertaking and its effect  So much is clear from his attempting to resile from the undertaking  An undertaking given to the Court is punishable in the same way as if it were an order of the Court  It is a contempt to breach an undertaking the same as it is to disobey an order of the Court  Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd   Ch     Windsurfing International Inc v

proceedings for a breach of that undertaking are commenced  Order   rule   only applies to orders  not undertakings  Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR    Separate charges for breaches of the September   orders and the November   undertakingreferred toCitron v Z ndel  No       CHRR D Relevantly  her Honour found that the respondent controlled the Adelaide Institute and thereby was responsible for its actions  and for the material which was published on the Adelaide Institute s websites  She found that the material contained in the AI Document conveyed the imputations which were the subject matters of the orders mentioned above  She found that publishing material on a website which is not password protected had the effect of communicating that information to the public  Such publication allows persons who access the website with a browser to view the material  Her Honour described how the material moves through the World Wide Web by relying on the description given in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in Citron v Z ndel  No       CHRR D  at     The Internet is a means of global communication that relies on a universal set of protocols or standards for the transmission of information  Two related sets of communication instructions  Transmission Control Protocol   TCP  and Internet Protocol   IP  govern how information will move through the system  defining addresses  routing systems  and all the regulation necessary to permit communication among users  Her Honour also relied on the Tribunal s description of the World Wide Web at     The World Wide Web   the  Web  is a specific application that uses the Internet to send and display data  including text  graphics  audio and video  There are two active components on the Web  a server that stores and transmits information  and a client or browser that requests  receives and displays the information obtained from the server  A  web site  is a collection of computer files that are coded in a specific way     to allow information to be sent on request to a browser  The files are then displayed in a way consistent with the instructions provided by the creator of the web site  Every web site has a unique Uniform Resource Locator  URL  akin to their Internet address  Once connected to the Internet  the URL     is necessary to gain access to a given web site     Her Honour found that publication of the AI Document on the World Wide Web amounted to conduct which was rendered unlawful by the Racial Discrimination Act and made a declaration accordingly  Her Honour found that the AI Document and other material published by the respondent on the World Wide Web conveyed the imputations in paragraph   of the September   orders  Her Honour found that the first and second imputations would engender feelings of hurt and pain within members of the Jewish Community who would  by reason of the publication  consider themselves being treated contemptuously  disrespectfully and offensively  She also found that the third and fourth imputations would offend  insult  hurt and wound members of the Jewish Community and engender the same senses  The judge found that the publication of the AI Document was unlawful under s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act and that it was published because of the ethnic origin of the people in the group identified in the document  namely Jews and it was an act reasonably likely to humiliate and intimidate Jewish people  The judge found that the respondent had not established any exceptions under s  D of the Racial Discrimination Act   Her Honour made a permanent injunction restraining the respondent first  from publishing to the public on the World Wide Web the AI Document or any document with substantially similar content to that document  and secondly  from publishing any material which would convey the imputations which she had previously found to be unlawful  The respondent s reaction The respondent appealed against the September   orders  The respondent deleted all material on the website within the time prescribed by paragraph   of her Honour s orders  That action indicates an awareness of the September   orders  However  some time before   September   the material which was contained in the AI Document was again published on the same website  On   December   the respondent attended the   rd International Historical Revisionism Conference in Italy and published further material on the website  On   February   the respondent entered the September   orders  Initially the respondent argued that the sealed order now on file did not reflect her Honour s reasons but that argument was abandoned  The respondent s appeal On   April   the respondent filed an amended notice of appeal against the September   orders  The notice of appeal did not challenge the finding made by Branson J that publication of the material was conduct which was rendered unlawful by s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act   being conduct which was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend  insult  humiliate and intimidate the groups or persons identified by her Honour  Three matters were argued on the appeal  First  that Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act was unconstitutional  Secondly  the material which had been published on the website did not have a sufficient degree of causal connection with race  colour or national or ethnic origin as required by s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act   Thirdly  the published material fell within the exemption to the provisions of Part IIA in s  D  In May   at or about the time the matter was heard by the Full Court  the respondent published on the website  that the appeal would signal how strong the Jewish Zionist influence is in Australia s judiciary where a battle rages between common law and talmudic law  The Full Court dismissed the respondent s challenge to the validity of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act   Carr and Kiefel JJ found that the provisions of Part IIA were supported by the external affairs power  Allsop J found that Part IIA   ss  C and  C  b   in its statutory context  are reasonably capable of being considered as appropriate and adopted to implement the obligations     assumed by Australia  under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination done at New York on   March    The Full Court found that the AI Document was calculated to offend in itself those who maintain that the holocaust occurred and  in particular  Jewish people  It concluded at least one reason the AI Document was published was because of the race or ethnic origin of Jewish Australians  It found that the AI Document was deliberately provocative and inflammatory  and contrived to smear Jews  It rejected the respondent s contention that he was entitled to an exemption by reason of s  D b  which provides that s  C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any publication made for genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest  I disagree  The intention of the September   orders is to prevent Dr Toben from continuing to engage in conduct that is rendered unlawful by s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act   The September   orders were designed to achieve that result in two ways  First  in paragraph   by requiring Dr Toben to remove from the Adelaide Institute website the AI Document and any other material which conveyed the imputations in paragraph  a iii   Branson J made that clear when she approved at   the approach taken by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal which considered the utility of making any order in a similar case  In the case of Citron v Z ndel   CHRR D  the Tribunal said at     Any remedy awarded by this  or any Tribunal  will inevitably serve a number of purposes  prevention and elimination of discriminatory practises is only one of the outcomes flowing from an Order issued as a consequence of these proceedings  There is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint  Similarly  there is the potential educative and ultimately larger preventative benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any Tribunal decision  Paragraph   of the orders was designed to ensure that once there had been compliance with paragraph   of the orders  conduct of the kind which gave rise to the declaration in paragraph   would not be repeated  To that end  paragraph   restrains Dr Toben from publishing the AI Document anywhere on the World Wide Web and further restrains him from publishing material with substantially similar content to that document  It was necessary to include paragraph  b  because otherwise it might have been said by Dr Toben that he was entitled to publish on the World Wide Web information which was in slightly different form to that which was contained in the AI Document  Paragraph  c  of the orders is designed to reflect  insofar as future conduct is concerned  that which Dr Toben was obliged to remove from the World Wide Web website in accordance with paragraph  a iii   In my opinion  the orders are not imprecise or vague and uncertain  They do not become so because they require the party to whom they are directed to make a subjective assessment of the material which may be published on the World Wide Web distinguishedEvans v New South Wales   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIt was put by way of an alternative argument that the September   orders ought to be construed as not intending to deny Dr Toben his right of free speech which was said to be given him by s  D of the Racial Discrimination Act   Mr Perkins relied upon Evans v New South Wales   FCAFC         FCR    In that case  the Full Court of this Court held regulations made under the World Youth Day Regulation    NSW  which were in turn made under the World Youth Day Act    NSW  are invalid in that they impermissibly infringe freedom of speech  I do not think that directly impacts upon the proposition which was put by the respondent  I think the proposition that must be accepted is that the September   orders were made for the purpose of preventing the respondent from engaging in conduct that is rendered unlawful by the Racial Discrimination Act   They ought to be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act in the sense that Branson J would not have intended to make orders preventing the respondent from doing something which was otherwise lawful  The September   orders ought to be understood as only preventing the respondent from doing something which is unlawful  The purpose of the orders was to require him to desist from further publications in contravention of the Racial Discrimination Act and requiring him to remove publications which had already been held to contravene the Racial Discrimination Act  distinguishedFig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodial Holdings   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlLastly  the respondent argued that Dr Toben was provoked by Mr Jones  publication in the Australian Jewish News to publishing the material which he did and breaching the undertaking  The respondent relied on Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodial Holdings   FCA    I do not  with respect  think that that case stands for the proposition which was put  That case involved an application for discovery and the judge made some observations about a party having the right to apply to be released from an undertaking  But  in any event  there are a number of difficulties with this argument  First  the September   orders and the November   undertaking operated in their terms for all circumstances  Dr Toben was obliged to comply with the terms of paragraphs   and   of the September   orders until such time as those orders were varied or revoked  If he thought that Mr Jones had said something that would have allowed him to respond  but for the orders to which he was subjected  he could have applied to the Court for a variation or revocation of those orders  He was not entitled for himself to ignore those orders  Secondly  there is no evidence that he responded as he did because of the provocation which he said was displayed by Mr Jones  His articles suggest that he thought he had some right to respond because of what was published in the Australian Jewish News but there is no evidence because he gave none that he was provoked into doing what he did  Thirdly  and in any event  intention is not an element that needs to be established by the moving party when that party seeks punishment for contempt by another party disobeying an order of the Court  For all of those reasons  those arguments fail referred toICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR     Lockhart J  with whom Gummow J agreed and French J generally agreed  said at     Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction  Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed     That decision was approved in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd   FCAFC   citedJones v Scully   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlMoreover  the argument put does not assist the respondent in the proceeding because the respondent has not tendered any evidence at all and there is no evidence that would bring the respondent within s  D of the Racial Discrimination Act   The onus was on the respondent to establish an entitlement to an exemption under s  D of the Racial Discrimination Act   Jones v Scully   FCA         FCR   at   and    Next it was put that the Australian Citizenship Act    Cth   the Citizenship Act  has the effect of rendering the September   orders nugatory  It was not explained what was meant by the term  rendering the order nugatory  but unless the Citizenship Act had the effect of discharging or revoking the September   orders then the orders would continue to stand  Mr Perkins relied upon the preamble in the Citizenship Act which provides    The Parliament recognises that Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia  and Australian citizenship is a common bond  involving reciprocal rights and obligations  uniting all Australians  while respecting their diversity      The Parliament recognises that persons conferred Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations       a  by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people  and      b  by sharing their democratic beliefs  and      c  by respecting their rights and liberties  and      d  by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia citedLonghurst v Hunt   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au

Newton Colliery     S J    Roach v Electoral Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlHe relied upon Roach v Electoral Commission   HCA         CLR    That case was concerned with provisions of the Electoral Act    Cth  which disqualified as voters at federal elections persons who were serving sentences of imprisonment regardless of duration for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth  a State or a Territory  In the course of his reasons  Gleeson CJ said at     The preamble to the Australian Citizenship Act    Cth  declares that Parliament recognises that Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia  and the Australian citizenship is a common bond  involving reciprocal rights and obligations  The reference to the reciprocity of rights and obligations is important in the context of membership of the community  Serious offending may warrant temporary suspension of one of the rights of membership  that is  the right to vote  Emphasis upon civic responsibilities a the corollary of political rights and freedoms  and upon society s legitimate interest in promoting recognition of responsibilities as well as acknowledgment of rights  has been influential in contemporary legal explanation of exclusions from the franchise as consistent with the idea of universal adult suffrage  In my opinion  those remarks have no relevance to the issues under consideration  Dr Toben has not been deprived of any rights attaching to citizenship  The declaration in paragraph   of the September   orders is that the respondent in publishing the AI Document engaged in conduct rendered unlawful by Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act   The injunctions in paragraph   require him to remove from the Adelaide Institute website the AI Document and any other material which convey the imputations to which reference is made  That order contemplates that anything published which contains those imputations would contravene s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act   The injunctions in paragraph   make the same assumptions  The injunctions restrain him from engaging in conduct which the Racial Discrimination Act renders unlawful  No citizen is entitled to engage in similar unlawful conduct because of the provisions of s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act   Dr Toben has not lost any of the incidents of citizenship which are given by the Citizenship Act  Of course  the November   undertaking is in a different class  The respondent gave the undertaking himself  He has always been aware of that undertaking and its effect  So much is clear from his attempting to resile from the undertaking  An undertaking given to the Court is punishable in the same way as if it were

 at   Latham CJ said   Wilful disobedience to an order of the Court is contempt of a criminal nature   In Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan   HCA         CLR   at   Barwick CJ said    A contempt in procedure by disobedience of an order of the Court or by breach of an undertaking given to it may be accompanied by such contumacy or defiance on the part of the party against whom the contempt proceedings are brought as evidences a criminal as well as a civil contempt citedThe King v Nicholls   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlDr Toben has published remarks which might be described as insulting of the Court and which tend to scandalise the Court  An act which is calculated to lower the authority of the Court or a judge of the Court or an act which is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice will be a contempt  The King v Nicholls   HCA         CLR    The first class is often referred to as scandalising the Court  Mr Perkins  Dr Toben s counsel  argued that the Court should not have regard to those remarks in considering whether these charges of contempt have been made out  I think that contention is partly right  Clearly enough  whatever remarks Dr Toben has made about the Court would not be relevant in determining whether his other remarks or his other publication was in disobedience of the September   orders or breached the November   undertaking  However  his remarks may be relevant for that aspect of the applicant s case which is directed to establishing contumacy referred toToben v Jones   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn particular  Carr J  with whom Alsop J agreed  said in relation to the last matter   Toben v Jones   FCAFC         FCR   at       In my opinion the contents of the document  taken as a whole  do not establish on the balance of probabilities that publication by the respondent of it was done reasonably and in good faith for any genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest      In the context of knowing that Australian Jewish people would be offended by the challenge which the appellant sought to make  a reasonable person acting in good faith would have made every effort to express the challenge and his views with as much restraint as was consistent with the communication of those views      In my opinion  the Document shows that the appellant made no such effort  On the contrary  the terms of the Document are  in my view  deliberately provocative and inflammatory  The reference to the Lenin and Stalin eras was  in my opinion  contrived to smear those on the receiving end of the appellant s message  The appellant described the Jews as  also murderers   This reference was made almost as an aside  clearly to paint the Jews in a bad light  before the author resumed his flamboyantly worded challenge      I think that the primary judge was correct in finding that there was no proof of good faith  I would go further and hold that there is no proof that the publication was done reasonably or in good faith    The respondent s publications after the Full Court decision and before   November  Between the delivery of judgment by the Full Court and November   the respondent published on the website a plethora of information which is contained in Exhibit  JJ  to the applicant s affidavit sworn on   November   and which had been read by the applicant on   August   and was subsequently re read on   October    I set out a summary of the applicant s claims of breaches of the September   orders occurring after those orders were made and before   November     July   Attributes ulterior motives to what it describes as  Holocaust propaganda   Refers to Diary of Anne Frank as one of  those self

represented in politics  the media and the judiciary  refers to  historical lies such as the drummed up six million lies  and to the  filthy lie  of the  Holohoax         October   It contains repeated denials that the Holocaust ever happened accompanied by viciously racist and antisemitic statements          October   It contains repeated denials that the Holocaust happened and says that the respondent is  pushing the limits of a Federal Court of Australia gag order  and pressuring the upholders of the Holocaust orthodoxy to admit they are living on   a lie         January   Refers to the  holocaust dogma of Judaism  being used to enslave Christian Germany and the rest of the world and as propaganda to achieve the creation of Israel and to get money by blackmail and extortion      February   Refers to Holocaust museums and reparations claims as  just a gimmick to collect money   Case proven that the holocaust was a hoax  There were no gas chambers      March   Refers to the  Hitler gas chamber legend   the non existent  Hitler gas chambers  and Holocaust myths as propagated by Jews  the Soviets and others for ulterior purposes and describes the Jewish author of a book on Holocaust revisionism as a  Holocaust Pimp   States  the holocaust is a lie  that school education teaches  the lies of the holocaust  and refers to  the Auschwitz Lie   The Germans had no gas chambers  no gas vans  and did not commit any inexcusable crimes  Revisionists understand that the holocaust did not happen      November   Refers inter alia to  more Holocaust rubbish   Holocaust  educational fraud program  a  tsunami of lies  preventing discussion of Nazi extermination of Jews in homicidal gas chambers  the  Hoaxoco t Blood Libel   the hoax of the century  etc and contains grossly antisemitic  racist and hate filled material about Jews and the Holocaust      January   A report in The Tehran Times on   December   of an interview with him  which was still there on   April   and   May   containing inter alia the following      Fredrick Toben  the director of the Adelaide Institute in Australia  believes that Israel was created based on the Holocaust myth  On December   the Mehr News Agency conducted an interview with Toben to ask why Western countries were so outraged when Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad called the Holocaust a myth  Following is the text of the interview      Q  The Iranian president said that he thinks that the Holocaust is a myth  However  he also said some European countries insist that millions of innocent Jews were killed during the Second World War by Hitler  and asked why the Europeans don t give part of their land to the Jews if they are correct  What is your view      A  The Holocaust is a lie because none of its three main pillars on which it rests are factually true or proven         Germany Hitler systematically exterminated European Jewry  There is simply no proof of this claim it was a transfer of Jews  and together with Zionist collaboration  German Jews arrived in Palestine with their property  Others were moved out of German territory and Auschwitz was a transit camp         The killing was done in huge chemical slaughterhouses homicidal gas chambers  This is a technical impossibility because you can work out how long it would take  for example  to kill one million people the size of a city like Adelaide without anyone finding out about it  The world soon found out President Bush lied about Iraq s Weapons of Mass Destruction that lie didn t last even one year         Six million Jews were killed this number is mythical religious and although at one time the numbers killed at Auschwitz was claimed to be   million  then reduced to       million  and now to around   the six million

  November   Notice of motion and supporting affidavit JJ  filed commencing proceeding for contempt    The notice of motion of   November  citedUniversal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Network Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe respondent next argued that the September   orders were vague or unclear and therefore cannot be enforced in contempt proceedings  and in that regard relied upon the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Network Ltd   FCAFC    In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR     Lockhart J  with whom Gummow J agreed and French J generally agreed  said at     Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction  Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed     That decision was approved in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd   FCAFC   appliedWimpole v McIlwraith   VLR  The applicant argued  relying upon a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Wimpole v McIlwraith   VLR     that those paragraphs of the respondent s which contained admissions were admissible without the applicant being required to tender the whole of the affidavit  In that case  Mann J said at     I think in trials without juries there has been in our Courts some diversity of practice about this matter  and I think the reason is that there are two courses that may be taken  and which lead now practically to the same result  One course I might take here would be to admit the four paragraphs tendered  subject to and along with any other qualifying paragraphs to which the defendant s counsel would be at liberty to refer without thereby being taken to be tendering evidence  The other alternative is to insist on the whole document going in  but with these reservations  which seem to be just firstly  that the plaintiff putting in the document would only be bound by the admissions to which he calls attention and any qualifications contained in any other part of the document  The defendant would not be treated as calling evidence by calling attention to any such qualifications  As regards statements appearing elsewhere in the affidavit prejudicial to the plaintiff  I should hold that he is not bound by them in the circumstances  and  so far as those statements were in support of facts  the proof of which was on the defendant  I should not accept them as being sufficient proof of those facts by the defendant for the purpose of satisfying that proof  I refused to admit those parts of the respondent s affidavits which contained admissions  If it were a criminal trial  s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   the Evidence Act   would give the Court a discretion to refuse to admit the evidence of an admission if  having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made  it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence  The admissions were contained in affidavits filed prior to the present charges being laid  The respondent was unrepresented at that time  He was apparently not warned that anything contained in an affidavit might be used against him in contempt proceedings  The applicant only seeks to put part of the respondent s affidavit  effectively reserving to himself the editing of the respondent s affidavits  However  this is not a criminal trial  even though the charges must be proved to the level of satisfaction required in a criminal trial  so s   of the Evidence Act does not control the admissibility of the evidence of an admission citedWindsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOf course  the November   undertaking is in a different class  The respondent gave the undertaking himself  He has always been aware of that undertaking and its effect  So much is clear from his attempting to resile from the undertaking  An undertaking given to the Court is punishable in the same way as if it were an order of the Court  It is a contempt to breach an undertaking the same as it is to disobey an order of the Court  Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd   Ch     Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    A breach of an undertaking will involve the same consequences for the party in breach as disobedience of an order of the Court  Milburn v Newton Colliery     S J     Where the undertaking is given to the Court by the person who is to be bound by the undertaking  the undertaking does not need to be served upon that person before contempt proceedings for a breach of that undertaking are commenced  Order   rule   only applies to orders  not undertakings  Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR    Separate charges for breaches of the September   orders and the November   undertakingappliedWitham v Holloway     CLR  In Witham v Holloway     CLR     Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ described the distinction between civil and criminal contempts as illusory  In that case  the majority held that because contempt proceedings are brought to punish the contemnor either for the purpose of vindicating judicial authority or for the purpose of coercing obedience to an order  the proceedings must realistically be seen as criminal in nature  For that reason  whether the contempt is civil or criminal  the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt  The onus of establishing the contempt is  of course  on the party asserting it
