Calderbank v Calderbank     ALL ER     Cutts v Head     C    Mutual Community Limited v Lorden Holding Pty Ltd   Ors  unreported  Supreme Court of Victoria  per Byrne J    April   and M T Associates Pty Ltd v Aquamax Pty Ltd   Anor     VSC       May    We look forward to receiving your reply      The letter was put to the applicant expressly as a Calderbank letter  It would have been plain to the applicant that the respondents were seeking to mitigate the unrecoverable costs to which they would ultimately be exposed in resisting the applicant s claim to relief by attempting to lay the foundation for a more favourable costs order should the applicant be unable to establish a right to that relief   The applicant however elected not to respond to the letter  The controversy proceeded to a hearing   The respondents say that the ultimate orders were more favourable than the terms of the offer  The action was dismissed with an order that the applicant pay the respondents  costs of and incidental to the action  Under the offer  the applicant could have chosen to withdraw and discontinue with no costs order against it  The applicant chose to press for the relief and the price it must pay as a matter of the proper exercise of the discretion as to costs is an order that it pay the respondents  costs of the proceeding  Thus  the ultimate orders were more favourable than the offer   That assessment will take account of the complexity of the issues and the basis upon which the Court resolved the controversy  Although an applicant may have been unsuccessful in obtaining the relief sought  the applicant may have successfully resisted a significant proportion of what was said to be an answer to the relief claimed  An applicant may have established the integers of the cause of action upon which the relief is based yet relief may be refused on discretionary grounds  Although in an absolute sense  a respondent simply seeks to resist the relief sought in the proceeding and any successful ground of doing so is sufficient   the basis upon which the Court resolves the controversy assists in understanding whether an unsuccessful applicant acted reasonably in electing to proceed and thus assume the risk of a less favourable outcome than that available when choosing to go on  The letter of offer need not nor should it  engage in an analysis of the underlying contentions  The focus of the letter is to put the offer in clear and precise terms so that the recipient can understand what is offered and the Court can later see without obfuscation just exactly what was offered and rejected  As to the general principles see  Calderbank v Calderbank     All ER     Cutts v Head     WLR   Aljade and MKIC v OCBC   VSC     SMEC Testing Services Pty Ltd v
