reasoning assumed that Katz J was correct in his construction of s  PO  followedCharles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhen the University sought further and better particulars of Ms Crvenkovic s Statement of Claim she responded by identifying many alleged acts or omissions which occurred after she had made her complaint to the Commission  The University objected and sought a direction that Ms Crvenkovic would not be able to rely  at trial  on events which post dated the lodging of the complaint with the Commission  The University relied on the decision of Katz J in Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   in which his Honour held  at   that s  PO  prevented a complainant from relying  in a proceeding in the Court  on any act of unlawful discrimination which occurred after the relevant complaint had been lodged with the Commission  Despite being referred to this decision  counsel for Ms Crvenkovic maintained that she was entitled to rely on discriminatory acts which had allegedly occurred after   February    Having heard argument on the point I have determined that a direction of the kind sought by the University should be made  This will ensure that time and expense is not wasted by the parties in preparing for trial or at the trial  Counsel for Ms Crvenkovic argued the preliminary point at two levels  He contended  first  that a different construction should be placed upon s  PO  than that which commended itself to Katz J  Alternatively  counsel contended that Charles was distinguishable  Katz J explained his approach to the construction of s  PO  in the following passages at         It appears to me that s  PO  of the  Act  is only incidentally concerned with those allegations of fact which can be made in an application under s  PO  of the  Act  it is primarily concerned  not with such allegations  but rather with the legal character which those allegations of fact can be claimed to bear  In the two situations with which it deals  it permits an applicant in a proceeding before the Court to claim that the facts alleged against the respondent constitute unlawful discrimination of a different legal character than the unlawful discrimination which was claimed in the relevant terminated complaint    Paragraph  a  of s  PO  of the  Act  proceeds on the basis that the allegations of fact being made in the proceeding before the Court are the same as those which were made in the relevant terminated complaint  The provision naturally permits the applicant to claim in the proceeding that those facts bear the same legal character as they were claimed in the complaint to bear  However  it goes further  permitting the applicant to claim in the proceeding as well that those facts bear a different legal character from that they were claimed in the complaint to bear  provided  however  that the legal character now being claimed is not different in substance from the legal character formerly being claimed   Paragraph  b  of s  PO  of the  Act  on the other hand  permits the applicant to allege in the proceeding before the Court different facts from those which were alleged in the relevant terminated complaint  provided  however  that the facts now being alleged are not different in substance from the facts formerly being alleged  It further permits the applicant to claim that the facts which are now being alleged bear a different legal character than the facts which were alleged in the complaint were claimed to bear  even if that legal character is different in substance from the legal character formerly being claimed  provided that that legal character  arise s  out of  the facts which are now being alleged  His Honour found support for his construction of s  PO  in other provisions of the Act which prevented proceedings being commenced in the Court before an attempt had been made to resolve disputes by conciliation under the auspices of the Commission  see s  PF  and in various secondary materials such as Explanatory Memoranda and Parliamentary Debates  Charles has since been applied by other single judges  see Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology   FCA   at    per Weinberg J  Maghiar v State of Western Australia   FCA   at    per French J  and Stanislawa Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology   FCA   at    per Tracey J   More recently a Full Court  in Hurst v State of Queensland   FCAFC         FCR     accepted that s  PO  imposed  temporal limits  on any claim brought under s  PO   The Court was referred to Charles and its reasoning proceeded on the basis that Charles was correctly decided  Ms Crvenkovic contended that s  PO  should be read as if the words  the subject of  in its two paragraphs did not appear and that the reference to  practices  in para  b  comprehended  conduct following the termination of the complaint  which could  be said to arise out  of  identical practices that formed the subject matter of the terminated complaint   It was also contended that the terms in which the Court s powers to grant relief to a complainant under s  PO      and   were not consistent with there being a temporal limit of the kind which Charles had found to be imposed by s  PO   I found these arguments to be unconvincing  Both paragraphs of s  PO  would be rendered meaningless by the notional omission of the words  the subject of   The use of the word  practices  in s  PO b  is apt to refer to practices which occurred prior to the lodging of a complaint  The fact that they continued to be implemented thereafter may support the making of a further complaint but this possibility does not compel the conclusion that s  PO  should be construed in a manner contended for by the applicant  If the Court finds that unlawful discrimination has occurred it may grant one or more of the orders provided for in s  PO   These orders may readily be applied to unlawful discriminatory acts  omissions or practices which have been the subject of complaint to the Commission  Section  PO  provides for the granting of interim injunctions  Whilst the granting of such injunctions might be appropriate where conduct  which has been the subject of complaint to the Commission  has continued or been resumed  it does not necessarily follow that s  PO  does not impose the temporal limit which was recognised in Charles   Section  PO  merely provides the Court with power to discharge or vary earlier remedial orders made under the section  As a single judge of the Court I should follow Katz J unless I thought that he was clearly wrong  see Bank of Western Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at    per Lindgren J  and the authorities there cited  I am not persuaded that his Honour was clearly wrong for the reasons advanced by Ms Crvenkovic or for any other reason  On the contrary  I respectfully agree with His Honour s reasoning  I am fortified in this view by the fact that  although the Full Court in Hurst did not expressly approve Charles   its reasoning assumed that Katz J was correct in his construction of s  PO   Ms Crvenkovic sought to distinguish Charles on three bases  They were that In my view none of these matters has any bearing on the proper application of s  PO  to the proceeding commenced by Ms Crvenkovic  There will  accordingly  be a direction that Ms Crvenkovic not be at liberty to lead any evidence directed to establishing that the University  by act or omission  unlawfully discriminated
