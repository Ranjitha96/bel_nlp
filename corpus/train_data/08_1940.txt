functus officio   Once the statutory function is performed  there is no further function authorised under the Act for the Tribunal to carry out and it has no power to reopen the delegate s decision   Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR   per Goldberg J at   referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Thiyagarajah   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Thiyagarajah   HCA         CLR   Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ noted that the Act contemplates changed circumstances which might found a fresh application to the Tribunal  but imposes the limitations found in ss  A and  B  As their Honours said at   It would be inconsistent with that scheme and contrary to the ordinary reading of Div   of Pt   of the Act to treat the decision of the Tribunal as provisional in nature  In the situation where the Tribunal had  without reviewable error  disposed of an application for review of the decision of the delegate made on   October   the Act did not confer upon the Tribunal any authority subsequently to reconsider the decision of the delegate by reason of later changed circumstances citedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I asked the applicant what he would have said to the third Tribunal had he been given the opportunity to address it on the question of jurisdiction  I also asked the applicant to identify any error in the conclusion by Smith FM that the third Tribunal had not erred in finding that it had no jurisdiction to hear his present application  The applicant was unable to make any relevant submission other than his assertion that the second Tribunal made a mistake and he wished to have the second Tribunal decision reconsidered  Therefore  even if there had been a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness  no practical injustice flows from it   Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR   per Gleeson CJ at    As the Minister submits  an opportunity to address the Tribunal on the question of jurisdiction was   a hollow opportunity     In the applicant s affidavit he alleges a failure on the part of the third Tribunal to comply with s  A of the Act  Such a complaint is misconceived in circumstances where the third Tribunal found that it had no jurisdiction to conduct a second review of the delegate s decision  Section  A is part of those provisions of the Act which govern the procedures to be adopted in the conduct of a review  set out in Part   Div   of the Act   Those provisions were not engaged   The applicant has not established any purpose in remitting the matter to the Tribunal or any practical consequence arising from any denial of procedural fairness or natural justice  The applicant has not shown any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate nor has he shown that he has any prospects of success in an appeal from that decision  No substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal is not granted  The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding forty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In SZBWJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     the applicants sought a further review by the Tribunal of a delegate s decision  Justice Moore said at   In my view  a proper construction of the Act tells against a conclusion that the Tribunal is empowered to again review the delegate s decision in circumstances where the Tribunal s original decision was not attended with jurisdictional error  Treating the Tribunal as authorised to undertake a second review of the delegate s decision would be contrary to the statutory aim of providing a mechanism of review that is  fair  just  economical  informal and quick  see s   of the Act   As Smith FM said in SZEYK v Minister for Immigration   FCA   at         the Tribunal referred to well known authority which establishes that it does not have jurisdiction to review a delegate s decision twice  That line of cases has recently been followed by Cowdroy J in SZCKX v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   and Moore J in SZBWJ v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     For these reasons  Smith FM did not err in his conclusion that the third Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider the application to conduct a second review of the delegate s decision  The third Tribunal correctly found that it lacked jurisdiction   The applicant contends that he was denied procedural fairness by the third Tribunal  He claims that when he filed his application he was issued with a standard letter and then received no further correspondence from the third Tribunal  until the letter notifying him of the decision  and was not asked the reason for his repeat application  He claims that the third Tribunal did not give him an opportunity to reply concerning the validity of his application
