http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I dismissed the appeal in this proceeding on   May   see MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA    Due to illness  the first appellant  who is the mother of the second and third appellants  was unable to appear when judgment was delivered  Since she had not been heard on the question of costs and it appeared that she might wish to be so heard  I directed my associate to send a letter to the appellants informing them that  if they wished to make any submissions on costs  they should file written submissions   On   May   the first appellant filed submissions stating that     I wish to bring the following facts for your kind consideration regarding the costs       I am a single mother with two young daughters and currently depending financially on my sisters and mother       I have no working rights and enclose a copy of my E class bridging visa    Under the circumstances I humbly request you to consider my case and waive the costs   On   May   the first respondent filed brief submissions contending that an inability to meet a costs order is not a reason for a departure from the usual rule that costs follow the event appliedRuddock v Vadarlis  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Court has an unfettered discretion regarding costs orders  although it  must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case  see Ruddock v Vadarlis  No     FCA         FCR     Ruddock v Vadarlis  No     at   per Black CJ and French JJ  Ordinarily  if a successful party is denied an order for costs in whole or part  it is because the party s conduct of the proceeding in some respect or respects makes it just or reasonable to do so  see  e g   Ruddock v Vadarlis  No   at   and Latoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ referred toLatoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

costs  see  e g   Oshlack v Richmond River Council   HCA         CLR   at   per Gaudron and Gummow JJ  at   per McHugh J  dissenting in result  and     per Kirby J  The inability of the unsuccessful party to meet costs is generally not a sufficient reason to deprive the successful party of a costs award  In Selliah v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Nicholson J said       I t is contended for the applicant that as he has been in detention since arriving in Australia he has no assets in this country  an order against him would be futile  No evidentiary foundation exists for a finding of futility  Even if the proper inference to be drawn from the applicant s detention is that such an order would be futile  I do not consider that would amount to special circumstances warranting the making of a different order  Here the applicant chose to comprehensively argue his case and expose himself to the risk of costs  Having failed  any futility of collection is not a reason for an order to the contrary    The same principles apply here  The appellants have not shown a proper basis to justify the Court in making other than the usual
