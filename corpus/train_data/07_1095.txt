and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The fourth ground of appeal contended that the Tribunal breached its obligation to hear and determine the application and had breached s  A of the Act  The appellant relied upon the transcript of the Tribunal hearing  noting in particular that the Tribunal questioned a witness relating to his impartiality  The appellant claimed that the issue of impartiality was not translated by the interpreter  His Honour found that there was no evidence to support such claim  His Honour referred to Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   in finding that the Tribunal s view of the impartiality of a witness is part of the Tribunal s reasoning process and does not constitute information within the meaning of s  A  of the Act  His Honour found that there was no obligation to provide the appellant with particulars of its opinion of the impartiality of a witness and dismissed this ground of appeal   The fifth ground of review arises out of an interview which was held between Australian officials in Beijing and the appellant s wife  The appellant had claimed that he was not married when he obtained his Preferential Relative  Migrant  visa  However  such claim was shown to be false during the subsequent interview with his wife  The Tribunal drew the inference that the details of such interview would have been conveyed to the appellant by the wife  The appellant challenged the drawing of such inference   Lloyd Jones FM accepted that the Tribunal could draw the inference contained in the fifth ground of review  and that such inference was reasonably open to the Tribunal on the material before it  There was no need for direct evidence of specific communication before such an inference could have been drawn   The assessment of the credibility of a witness is a matter entirely for the determination of the Tribunal  see Tin   FCA   and does not form information for the purposes of s  A  of the Act  The provisions of the Act are an exhaustive statement of the principles of natural justice and there is no scope for the application of any residue common law principles  see s  B of the Act   There is no error as claimed  and Lloyd Jones FM was correct in his conclusion that there was no denial of natural justice   The Tribunal accepted that the appellant engaged in some political activities in Australia but found that any such activities were engaged in for the purpose of enhancing his refugee claim  The Tribunal would pay no regard to such activities because they were activities which were excluded pursuant to s  R  of the Act  The appellant submits that s  R  does not exclude the possibility that an applicant may act with more than one purpose  so that if he or she engages in conduct to which s  R  applies  there may be another purpose which has resulted in the conduct  It is alleged that the Tribunal failed to exclude such possibility of more than one purpose in its determination referred toVAAW of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant did not know of the interview on   May   between Australian Embassy officials in Beijing and the appellant s wife  Lloyd Jones FM noted the evidence upon which the Tribunal could reach such conclusion  which included the sponsorship of the wife and child by the appellant  Contrary to the claim of the appellant  there was sufficient factual circumstances to warrant the inference by the Tribunal in making such finding  see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi     ALD   at     Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam   HCA         CLR   at         and   VAAW of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
