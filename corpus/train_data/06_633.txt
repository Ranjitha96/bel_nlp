SZEPU v Refugee Review Tribunal   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAbeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appeal is being heard by me as a single judge pursuant to s    AA a  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   An appeal to this Court from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of re hearing  but the process remains a process for the correction of error  As Kenny J said in Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA        On an appeal by way of re hearing  the powers of an appellate court are exercisable only if the appellant can demonstrate that  having regard to the evidence before the appellate court  the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal  factual or discretionary error    Therefore  the burden rests on the appellant to demonstrate some legal  factual or discretionary error by the Federal Magistrate  In turn  the Federal Magistrate was examining the question whether there was jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal   The Tribunal examined each of the grounds upon which the appellant challenged the decision of the delegate  and rejected all of the grounds raised by the appellant  The Tribunal concluded that there was  an overwhelming lack of credibility  in the appellant s claims regarding his political profile and activities and alleged fear of persecution for political reasons  The Tribunal formed the view that he had  fabricated a colourful set of claims  to support his application for a protection visa citedMashayekhi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii

appeal alleged a number of jurisdictional errors  First  it was contended that the Tribunal erred in adopting an unduly harsh approach to the requirement that there be a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  and more particularly  that the Tribunal did not apply the  real chance  test enunciated in cases such as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo   HCA         CLR   and Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR     Chan     Those cases require both a subjective apprehension of persecution and an apprehension that is grounded in objective reality  This has been described as a  real chance  of persecution  namely  a chance that is not remote or insubstantial or a far fetched possibility  see Chan at       and    Secondly  the notice of appeal contended that the Tribunal made errors in its assessment of  serious harm  as embodied in s  R b  of the Migration Act    Cth   Thirdly  the notice of appeal contended that the Tribunal erred by basing its findings on country information concerning the Naxalite movement  rather than on information provided by the appellant  The fourth ground of appeal was that the Tribunal misdirected itself by failing to correctly identify the appellant s social and political group  which was described as a non violent segment of the Naxalite movement  Finally  the notice of appeal raised a contention that the Tribunal was biased  This contention appears to be largely premised upon the way in which the Tribunal questioned the appellant and then proceeded to reach conclusions as to his credibility citedChan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The notice of appeal alleged a
