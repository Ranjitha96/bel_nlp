 at    appliedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In its recent decision in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA   at     SZBEL   the High Court enunciated the principle that if the Tribunal takes no step to identify and raise an issue other than those which the delegate considered dispositive  and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is  the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered important comprise all the issues in relation to the decision under review  In the present case  the Federal Magistrate accepted that there was an issue which was different which was considered by the Tribunal  However  having regard to the transcript of the proceedings in the Tribunal  the Federal Magistrate formed the view that the issue had been referred to as an important question by the Tribunal  which was sufficient to satisfy the principle set out in SZBEL    In SZBEL   the High Court refers to an obligation on the Tribunal to invite an applicant to amplify any aspect which it believes will be taken into account and of which the applicant may not be aware  It is not necessary  according to the reasoning in SZBEL   to expressly challenge an applicant by directly putting a proposition contradictory to his or her submissions  but it is important that the matter should at least be referred to  In the present case  I am of the view that the transcript indicates that the Tribunal did signal a concern in relation to the question now raised by the appellant on appeal  namely  his reasons for not going back to Karachi  The Tribunal raised these questions and indicated their importance in questions   through to   of the transcript before the Tribunal   In those circumstances  although the principles of SZBEL are indeed called into play  I consider that the task imposed on the Tribunal by those principles has been satisfied  Accordingly  having heard the submissions of the appellant and having considered the reasoning of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate below  I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs as it does not have any substance and in particular because the question of misinterpretation was not raised either before the Federal Magistrate or in the Notice of Appeal before this Court   For the above reasons  the appeal is dismissed  I will fix costs in this matter at                             I certify that the preceding
