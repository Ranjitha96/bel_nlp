Gough   Gilmour Holdings Pty Ltd v Caterpillar of Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAckers v Austcorp International Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlG G has suffered loss and damage by this breach of the Dealership Agreements     Particulars of loss and damage     Loss of profits from the Dealership from around October    Loss of monies invested in the Dealership unable to be recouped from profits of the Dealership after April    Losses incurred in connection with closing down the Dealership    Thereafter  when addressing those allegations relevant to equitable estoppel and unconscionable conduct  the Amended Statement of Claim also states  In giving the Notice of Termination and terminating the Dealership  COA  acting both for itself and on behalf of CAT  COCC and CSARL  departed from the Relevant Understandings and acted contrary to the Relevant Representations   It would thus appear that the claim in contract sought to be advanced on behalf of the Applicant is as follows   i  the parties to the Dealership Agreements are the Applicant and the First Respondent     ii  the   rights  interests and obligations under the Dealership Agreements   are said to have been first assigned   on or around   January     from the First Respondent to the Third Respondent and thereafter  but at the same time  from the Third Respondent to the Fourth Respondent  and   iii  the First Respondent was the entity that is said to have given the notice of termination on   October      With reference to the implied duty of good faith  it is then said that   iv  the giving of the notice of termination   breached this term of the Dealership Agreements       The allegation is that those entities that   failed to act reasonably and in good faith   and without   due regard to the objects of the Dealership Agreements   are   v  the First  Third and Fourth Respondents   Notwithstanding the amendments effected by the Amended Statement of Claim   the following difficulties nevertheless remain  namely   i  how can it be said that the Third and Fourth Respondents acted in breach of a term of agreements  namely the Dealership Agreements   to which they were not a party   Moreover  and assuming that there were at least two   deeds of assignment   and that the parties to those   deeds   were one or other of the First  Third and Fourth Respondents   ii  how can it be said that the Third Respondent remains exposed to liability to the Applicant if the Third Respondent   reassigned   the   rights  interests and obligations   to the Fourth Respondent   No novation agreement of the Dealership Agreements to which the Applicant is a party is apparently relied upon  Reservation may also be expressed as to whether the Applicant is correct in its allegations as to the manner in which the   deeds of assignment   operated  That which may be exposed in due course remains the commercial objective sought to be achieved by the two   deeds   being executed on apparently one and the same day   assigning   and thereafter   reassigning   the same   rights  interests and obligations    But that is not a matter which need be further addressed at this stage  Nor need attention presently be given to whether it is possible to unilaterally assign the   obligations   or burden of an agreement in a manner which binds the other contracting party without its consent  Carter J  Peden E and Tolhurst G  Contract Law in Australia   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworths    at      At least one further difficulty in relation to the contract claim is   iii  a manner of pleading whereby the draftsman seeks to set forth the manner in which the First  Third and Fourth Respondents   failed to act reasonably and in good faith   by way of   Particulars   rather than by way of a statement of   material facts   as required by O   r     Sections  A and     Section  A   it has been recognised    is a qualified and complex deeming provision   Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd   FCA   at   per Rares J  It is  however  properly characterised as an interpretation provision and does not of itself create a cause of action  Ting v Blanche   FCA         ALR   at    Section  A provides as follows      Interpretation           For the purposes of this Division  where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter  including the doing of  or the refusing to do  any act  and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation  the representation shall be taken to be misleading            For the purposes of the application of subsection   in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made by a corporation with respect to any future matter  the corporation shall  unless it adduces evidence to the contrary  be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation            Subsection   shall be deemed not to limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Division to a misleading representation  a representation that is misleading in a material particular or conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead        In Ting   supra  Hill J observed of this provision      The section is but an interpretation section  it does not of itself create a cause of action  nor define a norm of conduct  The relevant cause of action is to be found in s   of the Act by reference to the norm of conduct laid down in s   of the Act  What s  A does  in a practical sense  in cases where it applies  is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing  In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis     ALR     ATPR  Digest      s  A is  designed to facilitate proof   at ALR   ATPR           In the present proceeding  the course pursued by the draftsman has been to expressly plead reliance upon s  A where it has been considered appropriate to do so  Whether it was necessary to pursue such a course may be left to one side  That which may also be presently left to one side is whether each of the representations which the Applicant presently maintains are representations in respect   to any future matter   truly falls within that description  Of present relevance is the importance assumed by s  A in casting the   burden of proof   upon the Respondents  Different views have also been expressed as to the manner of operation of s  A and the nature of the evidence to be adduced by a respondent before the   deeming   effect of s  A ceases to operate  McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR     Skiwing

suffered loss and damage by this breach of the Dealership Agreements     Particulars of loss and damage     Loss of profits from the Dealership from around October    Loss of monies invested in the Dealership unable to be recouped from profits of the Dealership after April    Losses incurred in connection with closing down the Dealership    Thereafter  when addressing those allegations relevant to equitable estoppel and unconscionable conduct  the Amended Statement of Claim also states  In giving the Notice of Termination and terminating the Dealership  COA  acting both for itself and on behalf of CAT  COCC and CSARL  departed from the Relevant Understandings and acted contrary to the Relevant Representations   It would thus appear that the claim in contract sought to be advanced on behalf of the Applicant is as follows   i  the parties to the Dealership Agreements are the Applicant and the First Respondent     ii  the   rights  interests and obligations under the Dealership Agreements   are said to have been first assigned   on or around   January     from the First Respondent to the Third Respondent and thereafter  but at the same time  from the Third Respondent to the Fourth Respondent  and   iii  the First Respondent was the entity that is said to have given the notice of termination on   October      With reference to the implied duty of good faith  it is then said that   iv  the giving of the notice of termination   breached this term of the Dealership Agreements       The allegation is that those entities that   failed to act reasonably and in good faith   and without   due regard to the objects of the Dealership Agreements   are   v  the First  Third and Fourth Respondents   Notwithstanding the amendments effected by the Amended Statement of Claim   the following difficulties nevertheless remain  namely   i  how can it be said that the Third and Fourth Respondents acted in breach of a term of agreements  namely the Dealership Agreements   to which they were not a party   Moreover  and assuming that there were at least two   deeds of assignment   and that the parties to those   deeds   were one or other of the First  Third and Fourth Respondents   ii  how can it be said that the Third Respondent remains exposed to liability to the Applicant if the Third Respondent   reassigned   the   rights  interests and obligations   to the Fourth Respondent   No novation agreement of the Dealership Agreements to which the Applicant is a party is apparently relied upon  Reservation may also be expressed as to whether the Applicant is correct in its allegations as to the manner in which the   deeds of assignment   operated  That which may be exposed in due course remains the commercial objective sought to be achieved by the two   deeds   being executed on apparently one and the same day   assigning   and thereafter   reassigning   the same   rights  interests and obligations    But that is not a matter which need be further addressed at this stage  Nor need attention presently be given to whether it is possible to unilaterally assign the   obligations   or burden of an agreement in a manner which binds the other contracting party without its consent  Carter J  Peden E and Tolhurst G  Contract Law in Australia   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworths    at      At least one further difficulty in relation to the contract claim is   iii  a manner of pleading whereby the draftsman seeks to set forth the manner in which the First  Third and Fourth Respondents   failed to act reasonably and in good faith   by way of   Particulars   rather than by way of a statement of   material facts   as required by O   r     Sections  A and     Section  A   it has been recognised    is a qualified and complex deeming provision   Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd   FCA   at   per Rares J  It is  however  properly characterised as an interpretation provision and does not of itself create a cause of action  Ting v Blanche   FCA         ALR   at    Section  A provides as follows      Interpretation           For the purposes of this Division  where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter  including the doing of  or the refusing to do  any act  and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation  the representation shall be taken to be misleading            For the purposes of the application of subsection   in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made by a corporation with respect to any future matter  the corporation shall  unless it adduces evidence to the contrary  be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation            Subsection   shall be deemed not to limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Division to a misleading representation  a representation that is misleading in a material particular or conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead        In Ting   supra  Hill J observed of this provision      The section is but an interpretation section  it does not of itself create a cause of action  nor define a norm of conduct  The relevant cause of action is to be found in s   of the Act by reference to the norm of conduct laid down in s   of the Act  What s  A does  in a practical sense  in cases where it applies  is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing  In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis     ALR     ATPR  Digest      s  A is  designed to facilitate proof   at ALR   ATPR           In the present proceeding  the course pursued by the draftsman has been to expressly plead reliance upon s  A where it has been considered appropriate to do so  Whether it was necessary to pursue such a course may be left to one side  That which may also be presently left to one side is whether each of the representations which the Applicant presently maintains are representations in respect   to any future matter   truly falls within that description  Of present relevance is the importance assumed by s  A in casting the   burden of proof   upon the Respondents  Different views have also been expressed as to the manner of operation of s  A and the nature of the evidence to be adduced by a respondent before the   deeming   effect of s  A ceases to operate  McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR     Skiwing Pty Ltd t as Caf

the Court retains a discretion as to whether leave should be granted to serve a respondent outside Australia  So much follows from the use of the term   may    It has thus been observed that      the power given by O   r   is clearly a discretionary power   West v TWG Services Ltd   FCA   at     His Honour Justice Gray was there satisfied that the requirements of O   r   had been satisfied but nevertheless concluded as follows        This being the case  my view is that I should refuse the leave sought to serve the amended application and the amended statement of claim on the respondent in England  To serve those documents in their present form would be to visit upon the respondent a proceeding in Australia involving a significant number of claims  with only a small number of those claims justifying the grant of leave for such service  Although technically the proceeding as a whole might fall within O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   because of the presence of the small number of claims  this is not enough to persuade me to exercise the discretion to permit service out of the jurisdiction in respect of the whole proceeding  To do so would be to allow the tail to wag the dog
