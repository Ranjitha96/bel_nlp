Narayan v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBretag v Immigration Review Tribunal  unreported  Federal Court of Australia  O Loughlin J    November   The Federal Magistrate did not accept that the Tribunal failed to make findings in relation to the financial aspects of the relationship and the nature of the household  His Honour accepted that the Tribunal did have regard to those matters as required by Regulation    A a  and  b  and that the Tribunal had considered the major issues raised and evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant  Further  the Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal was not precluded from having regard to events which occurred subsequent to the date of the visa application  He relied on Bretag v Immigration Review Tribunal  unreported  Federal Court of Australia  O Loughlin J    November   as authority for this point  His Honour held that  i t is ultimately a matter for the Tribunal to make an assessment of the facts and it is entitled to express that assessment in what might be otherwise regarded as somewhat pejorative terms  such as there being  little evidence  to support a claim   His Honour found that there was no jurisdictional error arising from the weight that the Tribunal gave the evidence when it considered  the voluminous material relied upon by the Applicant  in relation to the social aspects of the relationship  The Federal Magistrate found  no error in the manner in which the Tribunal approached its task having regard to the obligation set out in  Regulation    A c    The Federal Magistrate noted that the determination of the nature of persons  commitment to each other was  no doubt a very difficult issue for Tribunals to assess   His Honour accepted that the Tribunal was entitled to take into account  the absence of evidence of living arrangements and specifically those arrangements which might reveal whether the parties shared a bedroom or     had lived together  as husband and wife   The Federal Magistrate found that it  was a matter entirely for the Tribunal to make a finding of this manner   His Honour confirmed his earlier view that  in considering circumstances at the time of the application the Tribunal as a matter of law is entitled to consider and as a matter of logic in many cases compelled to consider subsequent events and circumstances when making an assessment of  the nature of the persons  commitment to each other   Emphasis added    The Federal Magistrate noted that  although the findings in relation to this criterion were brief  he accepted that those findings  were made after a fairly detailed assessment of the matters referred to by the Respondent pursuant to the various sub regulations   The Federal Magistrate noted that there appeared to be a lack of corroboration of the assertion by the appellant that the parties did live together as husband and wife and again that it was  a matter entirely for the Tribunal to make an assessment of evidence of this kind which it has done in a manner free of error   The Tribunal found that the nominator did not have a commitment to a shared life with the appellant to the exclusion of all others at the time of the application  This finding was partly based on the nominator s statements to the Department  which were unable to be tested  as the nominator had not deposed to the statements and did not appear as a witness  The Federal Magistrate accepted  as a matter of law  that the evidence before the Tribunal could include material that was not the subject of evidence on oath  His Honour held that there was  no principle of law which requires the Tribunal to prefer evidence on oath over and above other evidence although normally one might expect evidence on oath which may be tested to have a higher value   In the Federal Magistrate s view  the Tribunal was entitled to take into account all the evidence before it and the findings made by the Tribunal were reasonably open to it on the evidence before it   The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal s findings in relation to the failure of the applicant to provide evidence in support  by the nominator s family  of the relationship  were made free of error  His Honour found that this evidence was relevant  and that  in having regard to it  the Tribunal did not make a jurisdictional error   The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had complied with the requirements of s  A of the Act  the Tribunal had explained  in clear terms  the relevance of the information  the information was properly relevant to the obligation under s  A of the Act   the information was a reasonable part of the reason for the Tribunal s decision  and the information did not fall within any of the exceptions under s  A  of the Act   As each of the grounds for judicial review failed  the appellant s application was dismissed   The notice of appeal to this Court was filed on   February    The grounds relied on in the appeal are substantially the same as those relied on before the Federal Magistrate  They are that       The Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal had made findings in relation to  financial aspects of the relationship  and  the nature of the household   see Grounds   and   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court        The Federal Magistrate erred in finding that no jurisdictional error arose from the weight the Tribunal had afforded the evidence in relation to the social aspects of the relationship  Further  the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to consider the appellant s case that there was no evidence to support the Tribunal s finding on this issue and that the finding was based on conjecture  see Ground   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court       The Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal was not in error in having regard to the absence of evidence and subsequent events in relation to the nature of the appellant s and the nominator s commitment to each other  Further  the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to consider the appellant s case that   a  there was sufficient evidence  at the time the appellant s application was made  of the appellant s and the nominator s commitment to each other  for the purposes of regulation    A d  of the Regulation  and    b  the Tribunal s findings in relation to this issue were made in the absence of evidence    see Ground   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court        The Federal Magistrate erred in failing to address the appellant s application ground that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence when it made its finding concerning whether and  if so  the length of time during which the appellant and the nominator lived together  see Ground   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court        The Federal Magistrate erred in failing to address the appellant s application ground that  in relation to its findings concerning the appellant s and the nominator s mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others  the Tribunal failed to consider the appellant s evidence  engaged in speculation and gave significant weight to evidence that post dated the appellant s application  see Ground   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court        The Federal Magistrate erred in failing to respond to the appellant s ground that there was no evidence to support the Tribunal s findings and the Tribunal relied on irrelevant material  see Ground   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court       The findings of the Federal Magistrate in relation to the appellant s ground that the s  A letter did not respond to the appellant s grounds of appeal in relation to that issue  see Grounds   and   of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court        The Federal Magistrate erred in stating that the  great deal  of references to the transcript of Tribunal hearing had been made in an attempt to encourage the Federal Magistrates Court to revisit the merits of the application   Under this ground the appellant complains that the Federal Magistrate had been in error in finding that the Tribunal had  in fact  made findings in relation to the financial aspects of the relationship between the appellant and the nominator and on the nature of their household  In its reasons the Tribunal had dealt with these two issues under discrete headings  In dealing with the financial aspects of the relationship it had referred to evidence about the financial positions of the appellant and the nominator  the existence of a joint account  the way in which household expenses were paid and the receipt  by the nominator  of money from her mother  The Tribunal found that there was little evidence that the parties had combined their financial affairs at the time at which the appellant had applied for the spouse visa  It noted that the nominator had continued to receive financial support from her family for her own use  The evidence relating to the nature of the household was sparse  The Tribunal noted that the flat in which the appellant and the nominator lived after they had left the nominator s parents home had two bedrooms and that the appellant claimed that he had done the housework  No findings in terms were made   The argument advanced by counsel for the appellant at the hearing differed from that suggested in the notice of appeal  As argued  the appellant s complaint was not that no findings were made but rather that  in dealing with these two matters  the Tribunal had directed its attention to financial and domestic arrangements between the appellant and the nominator in the weeks and months after the appellant s application had been made   The Tribunal s reasons clearly state that it was directing its attention to the arrangements between the appellant and the nominator at the time   March   when the visa application was made  At that time the appellant and the nominator were living with the nominator s parents  At that time any joint financial dealings were at an embryonic stage  There was no joint household  The Tribunal looked to subsequent events in an effort to make a judgment about what the relevant arrangements were at the end of March    This it was entitled to do  see Bretag v Immigration Review Tribunal  unreported Federal Court of Australia  O Loughlin J    November    It was a matter for the Tribunal to determine the weight to be accorded to the limited evidence which was presented to it   The Tribunal dealt with the social aspects of the relationship between the appellant and the nominator in another  discrete  part of its reasons  It noted that they had been married in a traditional religious ceremony  It took into account the evidence of friends of the appellant as to their observations about the relationship between the couple and their friends  The Tribunal  however  noted the absence of any evidence from the nominator or her family to support the visa application or the review application  It therefore observed that there was  limited evidence of support for the relationship from family and friends who attended the wedding   There can be no doubt that the Tribunal took into account the social aspects of the relationship between the appellant and the nominator  The weight it gave to the evidence was a matter for it citedVAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii

Tribunal and the thought processes of the Tribunal which were founded on that information  Reference was made to VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR   at   and SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA         ALR   at     Despite this acknowledgment the appellant contended         that inconsistencies cannot remain inconsistencies  It is to be brought within the scope of information and this can only be achieved if the Tribunal gives particulars of these inconsistencies and explains its relevance which may well differ from Tribunal member to Tribunal member   The authorities referred to by the appellant do not support the proposition that the Tribunal is required to particularise any inconsistencies which it discerns when considering the evidence before it and to incorporate such particulars in any notice given under s  A of the Act  In SZBYR the joint judgment  at   said that         However broadly  information  be defined  its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation  not the existence of doubts  inconsistencies or the absence of evidence  The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant  information  was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief  as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself    Emphasis added    The distinction between  information  and inconsistencies emerging from such information was referred to by Siopis J in SZIWL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    His Honour said      I understood the appellant s submission to complain that he had not been given an opportunity to comment in writing upon what he regarded as findings of inconsistencies in his evidence  in the two respects identified  which he said was  information  to which s  A  applied because it was the reason  or part of the reason  for the Tribunal affirming the decision under review        In my view  the appellant s submission is not to be accepted  The reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision was that it disbelieved the appellant s evidence because of the implausibility of that evidence  rather than as the appellant characterised it  the  inconsistencies  in his evidence  But whether the appellant s evidence was disbelieved due to its  implausibility  or  inconsistency  is naught to the point  because it is accepted that a finding that evidence is disbelieved on the grounds of implausibility or inconsistency as part of the subjective appraisal made by the Tribunal which

of the Act citedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The submissions concluded by referring to some words of Allsop J in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   where his Honour  in dealing with s  A of the Act  said  at   that     Also  the fact that appraisal  thought processes and determination are not information does not mean that they are not relevant to the operation of s  A  The thought processes of the Tribunal may reveal the relevance of information for s  A b  and may assist in understanding what the Tribunal must say or do to comply with s  A a   b  or  c     The appellant contended that  i f such a duty is cast on the Tribunal in respect of information  it cannot be said that no similar duty is cast on the Tribunal in respect of inconsistencies  citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA
