Act  It submitted that since Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd     CLR   the courts have approached the Act as an economic statute designed to address economic activity  It was submitted that  critically  the courts have understood that the character of the Act as an economic statute must be taken into account in construing the words of the Act and  in this regard

true   that as the articulation of a statute increases  the room for interpretation must contract  but the meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words  as a melody is more than the notes  and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse to the setting in which all appear  and which all collectively create   And also in Cabell v Markham     F  d    at        of course it is true that the words used  even in their literal sense  are the primary  and ordinarily the most reliable  source of interpreting the meaning of any writing  be it a statute  a contract or

has been comprehensively considered by a single judge of this Court in Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council     ALR     Hamersley     I accept that I should not depart from the ratio

sufficient for a judge to merely reach one view  which he or she may prefer over that of an earlier decision  and upon that basis not follow the strong persuasive authority that has already pronounced on the same legislative provision  Before a judge refuses to follow an earlier decision regarding the construction of the same legislative provision he or she must come to the view the earlier decision is  clearly wrong  or  plainly wrong    BHPBIO contends that the meaning of the expression  use of a production process  was correctly stated in Hamersley   It is contended by the Council that the Hamersley decision is clearly wrong  Fortescue supported the decision of  production process  adopted in Hamersley   but contended that the trial Judge made errors of principle in her reasoning so as to lead her to the wrong conclusion  In addition  Fortescue contended that Hamersley was plainly distinguishable  In view of these submissions the question of the correctness or otherwise of the Hamersley decision falls for my consideration  as does the question of whether the decision can be distinguished   The decision in Hamersley arose after an application was made by one of the respondents in the proceeding  which I will refer to as  Robe  to the Council under s  F  of the Act to recommend to the designated Minister declaration of a service  The service to which Robe sought access was identified in its application as  the bulk iron ore rail track transportation service provided by the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility   Robe specifically distinguished this service from any rail haulage service which may be available in relation to the facility  In essence  Robe sought access to what it termed the rail track service provided by Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd  Hamersley  by means of a facility owned by Hamersley  including associated infrastructure  but not including locomotives  rolling stock  hi rails or operational personnel   One of the main issues in the proceeding was whether the service to which access was sought by Robe was a  service  within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Act  In particular  the issue was whether the rail track service involved the use of a production process   In determining what was meant by the expression  production process  the learned trial Judge used dictionary definitions of the word  production  and the word  process  as the starting point for her analysis  Her Honour concluded  at     that    The expression  production process  in the definition of  service  in s  B of the Act means  in my view  a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured   I will refer to this definition of  production process  as the  Hamersley Construction    After referring to this definition  her Honour continued    Hamersley s production process in the Pilbara extends  on this view  from its commencement of mining operations at the mines to the completion of the product that it sells  namely  export product   In support of her view  the learned trial Judge referred to the judicial analyses of related expressions  including the term  the product  in a series of cases about whether an activity or series of activities was part of a taxpayer s  mining operations  for the purposes of income tax deductions and sales tax exemptions   Having determined the meaning of the term  production process  the learned trial Judge then considered the purpose of the expression as an exclusionary criterion within the definition of  service  in s  B of the Act  In doing so  she noted that Part IIIA was introduced into the Act as a result of the Competition Principles Agreement and the recommendations of the Hilmer Report  Her Honour concluded  at     that    The purpose of the exclusion was  it seems  to permit appropriate utilisation of certain infrastructure by third parties and  at the same time  protect the viability of investments made by those who had invested in  for example  the processes of production   In light of this conclusion  the learned trial Judge dismissed an argument that in order for the proposed service to come within the exemption it had to comprise the entire relevant production process and not just one part of it  such as the railway line  on the ground that such an interpretation of  production process  would defeat the purpose of the exclusion   As to the concept of  use of  her Honour held  at   that   emphasis in original    To use a production process  then  is  in some way to employ  apply or exploit a process directed to production  Most commonly  a user makes use of a production process to create the product or products which the process of production is designed to create  That is not  however  the only sense in which a user can be said to engage in  the use of a production process   Someone may use a production process by incorporating it into another process or operation  To use a production process may not only involve incorporating it into a larger operation  it is also possible to  use a production process  by using  employing  applying  exploiting  part of that process  That is  the use of a production process extends  in my view  not merely to the use of the whole process but also to the use of any operation  or step or procedure  that is integral  and perhaps essential or non subsidiary  to that process as a whole  In this case the use of the railway is integral and essential to the highly integrated series of operations that constitute Hamersley s production process   The learned trial Judge found on the evidence adduced by Hamersley that by virtue of the highly integrated nature of Hamersley s operations in the Pilbara  Hamersley operated its railway line not simply for transporting ore from mine to port but also as a necessary component of an integrated set of operations which constituted a production process  at       In reaching her ultimate conclusion the learned trial Judge made a number of important observations and factual findings  In considering the object of Hamersley s use of the railway line  the learned trial Judge observed  at       What is the relevance  if any  of the operational ends of Hamersley s use of its railway line  The respondents submitted that Hamersley s own use of its railway line is irrelevant  because that use forms no part of the service sought by them  That submission is  it seems to me  accurate to a limited extent only  Thus  I accept that the ultimate issue is the correct characterisation of the service  or use of the railway line  sought by Robe  I do not accept  however  that the operational ends that Hamersley meets by its use of the railway line are immaterial  Those ends  or the uses to which Hamersley puts its use of the line  are relevant  in my view  to the question whether the service Robe seeks is or involves the use of a production process   Her Honour then went on to set out the following central facts about Hamersley s production process  at       I have already set out the facts concerning Hamersley s operations in the Pilbara in some detail because  in my view  the outcome of this case necessarily turns on them  In summary  the central facts are the following        Hamersley s railway line carries locomotives  consists and like vehicles between Hamersley s mines and the port at Dampier      Ore of differing grades  composition and quantities is carried in the consists that run along the line      The grades  composition and quantities of ore carried in the consists  from each mine to the port  are pre determined by the  Batch Planning Team  in accordance with a  recipe  that the  Batch Planning Team  formulates for making a particular batch of export product      The consists carrying the ore are run over the line in a planned sequence as part of making up the recipe for a particular batch and as part of blending and stockpiling operations       Save for Yandicoogina  by virtue of the batch system Hamersley s mines operate as if each were a pit within a larger mine      Although not blended with ore from other mines  ore from Yandicoogina is subject to essentially the same process   The respondents did not submit that ore from Yandicoogina was subject to a relevantly different production process       Each step in the production process  including the use of the railway line for the carriage of ore in accordance with a recipe for a batch of product  is part of a highly integrated operation designed to make the export product  and     The export product is brought into being at the port at Dampier after all blending and stockpiling operations are complete   Her Honour then concluded  at     Hamersley s use of its railway line  and associated infrastructure  is  it seems to me  one in a series of operations that result in the creation of its export product   Nothing turns in this analysis on the fact that Robe seeks access to a part of the length of the railway line and not to the whole of the length of the line   By the use of its railway line  and associated infrastructure  it does not merely convey ore by rail from mine to port  it makes up the recipe that it has formulated for the creation of a particular batch of its product  The making up of a recipe for a batch of product depends on the line being made available  by Hamersley  for Hamersley s use  That is the effect of the undisputed evidence  It follows from this that Hamersley s use of its railway line is an integral  indeed  essential  operation in Hamersley s production process  That is  by virtue of the operations carried on by Hamersley in the Pilbara  Hamersley s use of the railway line is an operation upon which other operations necessarily depend for the creation of its export product   In this connection  I emphasise that I am not concerned with the application of the exemption from the exclusion  rather  I am concerned with the operation of paragraph  f  of the exclusion   I make the following observations on the approach taken in Hamersley   First  the learned trial Judge carefully considered the question before her  and analysed in detail the various terms used in Part IIIA  There was a detailed consideration of the purpose of Part IIIA and of the exclusion in question  The different conclusion I have reached  and where I find Hamersley to be  clearly wrong  or  plainly wrong  is in the approach taken to defining  the use of a production process    Secondly  I can see no objection to interpreting a composite phrase by reference to the dictionary definitions of one or more of the words within that composite phrase  Everything will depend upon the context and subject matter of the composite phrase  Of course  the context is the master not the dictionary definitions of single words  particularly where one has a phrase involving a number of individual elements combining to introduce into legislation a single concept  However  approaching the expression  production process  as merely the combination of the dictionary definitions of the individual words  production  and  process  has its dangers  and in itself may not yield the correct interpretation of the expression in Part IIIA of the Act   I do not disagree with her Honour s use of the definitions of  production  and  process  as a starting point to the sympathetic understanding of the operation of the relevant provisions  However  as a composite phrase  in my view the emphasis is on a process of production  being a production process which in itself makes or creates one thing into another  not being so much a series of operations covering relevantly in Hamersley   mine to port operations  If one focuses  as her Honour does  on the  series of operations  concept  then one readily moves to the conclusion in Hamersley that the  production process  includes the entire operation from mine to port   I do not think this is warranted as a matter of the most ordinary and natural meaning of the term  particularly when dealing with the composite term  production process   By looking at the overall series of operations one diverts attention away from the very thing to which access is sought in the Access Application  the railway line and associated infrastructure  and the function it has to perform  The railway line in itself is not designed to make or create anything  Further  with or without the  batch system  iron ore could be carried over the rail line  and whether or not the  batch system  was employed does not affect the character of the railway line itself  The  batch system  was merely a management tool in the efficient carriage of iron ore over the railway line  albeit from Hamersley s point of view  an important one   Thirdly  the concept of marketable commodity  of which I will discuss later  is not found in the dictionary references made in Hamersley   This concept arises out of the tax cases her Honour refers to such as Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd     ATR   at   per Lush J  with whom Kaye J agreed  at   per Brooking J   In my view  I see no warrant to introduce such a concept into the definition of  service  or the phrase  use of production process  in the context of Part IIIA  Whilst the learned trial Judge in Hamersley was acutely aware of the limited assistance to be afforded by those cases she relied upon  in my view the purposes of the statutory regimes are so dissimilar that there is no warrant to introduce the concept of  marketable commodity  into the meaning to be given to a  production process   In addition  by introducing the concept of  marketable commodity  as these proceedings attest  introduces an even greater uncertainty into the operation of Part IIIA  It also detracts  in my view  from the main enquiry  which is to define what is a production process  In looking at the most natural and ordinary meaning of the words found in the exclusion in para  f  one is not directed to an enquiry as to what is a  marketable commodity  which has taken prominence in these proceedings   Fourthly  her Honour recognised that the concept of  use of  a production process most commonly imparts the notion of a user making use of a production process to create the product or products which the process of production is designed to create  In my view  this is the very concept that ought be incorporated into the phrase  use of a production process   It fits well within the most natural and ordinary meaning to be given to the term  a production process  and by employing that concept one does not necessarily exclude the whole rail line from the possibility of consideration for declaration under Part IIIA  In view of the specific inclusion of a railway line as a service  the interpretation of  use of a product in process  given in Hamersley is not appropriate  It has the potential to exclude infrastructure that would normally be expected to be considered under Part IIIA for access  and does not assist in promoting the purposes of Part IIIA   Fifthly  in my view the learned trial Judge focused not upon the phrase  use of a production process  but the concept of  involving the use of a production process   The critical question was whether the  service  in respect of which Robe sought access was or constituted the use of a production process  The exclusion does not extend to something which merely  involves  the use of a production process  The learned trial Judge s approach in any given circumstance may not lead to any different conclusion  but when considering the  highly integrated operation  from mine to port as in Hamersley   approaching the matter as  involving  the use of a production process  did lead  in my view to an erroneous conclusion  It diverted attention away from the service the subject of the Access Application and from a proper characterisation of the railway line itself   Finally  I agree with the principle in the Hamersley decision that in determining whether the  production process  exclusion is applicable  the court must consider  the actual operation of the activities in question  considered as a whole  The question of characterisation is  in this sense  one of fact and degree   at      As I have indicated  however  the use of the railway line as part of its operations  even if essential to Hamersley s operations  does not mean that the railway line has the character of being  a production process   The use of the railway line itself was to convey iron ore by rail from mine to port by whatever management tool was appropriate to employ  and did not of itself constitute the use of a production process   In light of the above  with respect to the learned trial Judge  I have come to the conclusion that the decision in Hamersley is  clearly wrong  or  plainly wrong  and I should not follow it in these proceedings   Fortescue contended that Hamersley was plainly distinguishable on its facts for three principal reasons  First  it was submitted that the above rail below rail distinction found to be irrelevant in Hamersley was relevant on the facts in these proceedings because the Mt Newman JV and the Goldsworthy JV own the facilities which provide the two below rail services to which Fortescue seeks access  whilst BHPBIO provides to Mt Newman JV  Goldsworthy JV and the Yandi JV above rail services to which Fortescue does not seek access   Secondly  it was submitted that the production process as relied upon by BHPBIO in these proceedings is relevantly different from that found by the learned trial Judge in Hamersley   and was not the  highly integrated operation  therein described   Thirdly  it was submitted that  whilst the learned trial Judge in Hamersley found there was no  marketable commodity  produced by Hamersley before the export product which it produced at Dampier  and concluded for that reason that Hamersley s production process included the railing of the ore between Hamersley s mines and Dampier  in these proceedings there are marketable iron ore products produced at the mines serviced by the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Railway Lines prior to rail transportation to Port Hedland  and so the relevant production process is complete prior to railing the ore   Accepting the approach of the learned trial Judge in Hamersley   I do not consider that a different result would have been reached in Hamersley had the three alleged distinguishing features been present in that case   In relation to the first feature  there is nothing in her Honour s reasoning that would lead to the conclusion that she would have reached a different conclusion if joint venture parties  as providers  owned the facilities which would have provided the below rail services to which Robe sought access  The essential question the learned trial Judge determined was whether access was being sought to the use of a production process  On her Honour s reasoning  as detailed above  the exception in para  f  would apply irrespective of the ownership of the facilities  and irrespective of the distinction sought to be made by Fortescue here of the above rail below rail services   As to the second feature  upon the facts as I have found them in relation to the operations of BHPBIO  I can see no material difference in the operations of Hamersley found by her Honour  In particular  BHPBIO s operations in these proceedings effectively consist of carrying iron ore over the railway line in a planned sequence as part of making up  the recipe  for the iron ore eventually blended and stockpiled  to adapt the words of her Honour  In essence  the findings I have made in relation to BHPBIO operations indicate no material difference to the elements relied upon by her Honour in Hamersley at     I now turn to the question of when the  marketable commodity  is produced  It is necessary for me to consider in some detail the context in which  marketable commodity  was used by her Honour  There is some dispute between the parties as to the meaning of the expression  marketable commodity  used by the learned trial Judge in Hamersley   Expert evidence was led by Fortescue in support of its position  but in light of the following analysis  nothing turns on such evidence   BHPBIO submitted that the marketable commodity to which the learned trial Judge referred was Hamersley s finished product  or  export product   The inquiry  it was submitted  was focused on the products that were produced by Hamersley for sale to end user customers  and the series of operations undertaken by Hamersley to produce those products  BHPBIO submitted that the interpretation did not involve or invite a hypothetical inquiry into whether a commodity capable of being sold was  produced  at an earlier point in time  the case involved an inquiry into the actual operations undertaken  and the actual products created  or manufactured  for sale to end users by Hamersley   Fortescue  on the other hand  contended that the term  marketable commodity  in Hamersley referred to a product that is capable of being sold rather than one which is actually sold  In its submission  whether a product is capable of being sold depends upon whether there are actual or potential transactions for that product  The potential for transactions will exist if the transaction costs associated with the separate provision of goods or services at the two layers cannot be such that vertical integration is inevitable   In my mind  it is difficult to accept Fortescue s submissions on this point  In the learned trial Judge s discussion of the meaning of  process  she referred to the Macquarie Dictionary  which defined  process  as  a systematic series of actions directed to some end   at      Her Honour also referred to the definition of  process  in the Oxford Dictionary  which referred to a series of actions carried on  in a definite manner  and leading to the accomplishment of some result    Having regard to the definitions of the individual terms that make up the composite phrase  production process  it seems to me that the  marketable commodity  to which the learned trial Judge referred was the finished product  or export product  that Hamersley sells  at       Hamersley s production process in the Pilbara extends  on this view  from its commencement of mining operations at the mines to the completion of the product that it sells  namely  export product  There was no evidence to show that Hamersley produces a marketable commodity at an earlier stage   Fortescue argued that the final sentence implies that  had there been evidence to show that Hamersley produced a marketable commodity at an earlier stage  the learned trial Judge may have reached the conclusion that the production process finished once that marketable commodity was produced  such as before the ore is railed to the port  However  this does not detract from the learned trial Judge s focus on the product that Hamersley  sells   Her focus is on the end product that Hamersley s production process is directed to producing  and indeed does produce  Accordingly  the main focus for me in this case must be the commodities that are sought to be produced by BHPBIO   Even if I am wrong on this point  and accept the submission that the term  marketable commodity  refers to no more than a product for which there is a potential or actual market  it is still necessary for me to assess whether the production process used by BHPBIO produces the actual marketable commodities at the port  Whilst it may be  as Fortescue submited  that a marketable commodity is produced by BHPBIO at a stage before railing the ore to the port and therefore before the use of either the Mt Newman or Goldsworthy Railway Lines  BHPBIO also produces marketable commodities  not only capable of being sold but that are in fact sold  at the port  Accordingly  where a marketable commodity is produced by BHPBIO at the port  all of the integrated series of operations by which that marketable commodity is produced will constitute the production process under the Hamersley Construction   It is instructive to analyse the application of the Hamersley Construction to the evidence in this case to determine whether the third distinguishing feature relied upon would have produced a different result in the Hamersley case  The issue requires an analysis of whether the railway facilities to which Fortescue seeks access are an integral part of the series of operations by which any  or all  of BHPBIO s marketable commodities are created or manufactured   The output of BHPBIO s production process is currently six bulk iron ore products that are offered for sale to steel makers  primarily on the export market  The iron ore products are sold as the ore is loaded onto ships at Port Hedland  The iron ore products have consistent and specific chemical and physical properties  Those properties are determined by BHPBIO  having regard to BHPBIO s perception of what is acceptable to its customers  and having regard to BHPBIO s perception of the optimal manner of using its available mineral resources  The process by which BHPBIO produces the six finished iron ore products for export at Port Hedland involves an integrated series of operations as has been described above   However  the process by which BHPBIO produces each of its six bulk iron ore products differ to some extent  Despite this  BHPBIO submitted that it has only one overall production process for the purposes of producing all of its iron ore products  In the alternative  BHPBIO submitted that it conducts more than one production process to the extent that the operations by which the different products are produced differ  For the purposes of applying Hamersley   I do not accept BHPBIO s first submission that it has only one overall production process for all its products  However  I do accept its alternative submission  Hamersley requires an analysis of the process by which a marketable commodity is produced and each of BHPBIO s exported iron ore products clearly constitutes a marketable commodity whether on the definition contended by Fortescue or BHPBIO  To the extent that the process by which each marketable commodity is produced differs  the use of the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Services in that process will also differ  Therefore  applying Hamersley   there would be more than one production process  but still from mine to port and involving the use of the railway line   Fortescue further submitted that BHPBIO produces iron ore which is a marketable commodity prior to its transportation on either the Mt Newman or the Goldsworthy Railway Lines by reason of a number of joint venture transactions  The facts establish that iron ore is sold between different joint ventures at the various mine sites  In particular  the evidence shows the transfer of ownership of ores mined from Jimblebar  W  and Mining Area C  These joint venture transactions at the mine sites are legitimate commercial transactions and evidence a market for ROM ore at the Newman mining area  Therefore the ROM ore is a marketable commodity  applying the definition contended for by Fortescue  produced without the use of the rail lines  Fortescue submitted that  therefore  the use of the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Rail Lines are used after the end of a production process   Whilst I accept that a marketable commodity  within the meaning contended for by Fortescue  is produced in these instances at the mines  the evidence establishes that after ownership of these ores is transferred at the mine  the relevant ores continue to undergo further processing  The further processing is directed to the production of finished bulk iron ore products by BHPBIO to be loaded onto ships at Port Hedland for export  Fortescue did not dispute that through its operations at the port BHPBIO seeks to make  in relation to some ore  a more refined and valuable product  However  Fortescue submitted that these port operations  under which ore from some of the mines is further crushed  screened and blended and ore from other mines is blended and screened are separate production processes to those undertaken at each of the mines   Applying Hamersley   I do not accept this submission  The extent to which the ROM ore undergoes further development in order to produce some other marketable commodity of different physical or chemical constitution  in this case NHGL and NHGF  necessarily means that the production process for NHGL and NHGF  which commences at the mine  does not finish until the finished product is produced at the port   Fortescue also submitted that  in respect of at least two of the iron ore products produced by BHPBIO  Yandi Fines and MAC Fines  finished products are produced at the mine without the use of the rail line as a proportion of these products are loaded as DSO without undergoing further processing at the port after railing  I do not accept the contention that a particular service must solely be used as part of a production process according to the principles adopted in Hamersley   Accordingly  accepting that a proportion of Yandi Fines and MAC Fines products are finished at the mines  and accepting Fortescue s submission that the production process in relation to that proportion of Yandi Fines and MAC Fines ends at the mine  it does not necessarily follow that the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Railway Lines are not a part of BHPBIO s production process used to create BHPBIO s other finished products   The evidence clearly shows that all six of BHPBIO s final export products  apart from the small proportion of Yandi Fines and MAC Fines loaded as DSO  are produced at the port  after transportation on the relevant rail facilities  Accordingly  in relation to all of BHPBIO s products  or  marketable commodities  on the Hamersley Construction the production process extends from the commencement of mining operations at the mines and ends at the port  when that final product is created   Therefore  in light of the above  there is no basis to distinguish the ratio decidendi in Hamersley to the facts pertaining to these proceedings   Putting aside the Hamersley decision  in my view the question before the Court can be resolved by the following analysis   BHPBIO uses the rail line in its operations  and schedules trains which run on the track as part of BHPBIO s overall production of iron ore  One can conclude that  by virtue of the operations carried on by BHPBIO  its use of the railway line is an activity upon which other operations necessarily depend for the creation of its export product  Fortescue  by gaining access  may well interfere with BHPBIO s operations and scheduling of trains  but this will be a matter to be assessed at a later part of the statutory investigation under Part IIIA  The fact that access to the relevant service sought by Fortescue may impact upon  or be a part of  BHPBIO s operations does not mean that access to the rail lines and associated infrastructure and systems is access to the  use of a production process    A production process is the creation or making of a product or the transforming of one thing into another  To use a production process is to employ  apply or exploit a process for this purpose  This most natural and ordinary meaning can be seen from the use of the definitions of  production   process  and  use  in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary  which may be used as a first point of reference  However  as I have discussed previously  the relevant expression is a composite term and must be read in the context of the definition  Part IIIA and the Act as a whole   Apart from the decision in Hamersley   BHPBIO relied upon the case of Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd v Victoria   HCA         CLR     Pipeline Tax Case  in the consideration of the question of what is encompassed by the concept of production process  The question in that case was whether the Pipelines  Fees  Act    Vic  purported to impose a duty of excise  contrary to s   of the Constitution   and accordingly was invalid  By majority  Mason  Murphy  Brennan and Deane JJ  Gibbs CJ and Wilson dissenting  the High Court so held   The evidence of Mr Ergas and Professor Rey was primarily concerned with the meaning  from an economic perspective  to be given to the term  production process  as used in s  B of the Act  Having formulated a proposed economic test  they both provided an opinion of the facts and matters that would be relevant in determining whether the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Services constitute a  production process  within the meaning of those words as favoured by them  The evidence of Mr Houston was primarily directed to the meaning  from an economic perspective  of the words  marketable commodity  as used by the learned trial Judge in Hamersley and he similarly arrived at a proposed test  He then provided his opinion of the facts and matters that would be relevant in determining whether the various stages of BHPBIO s iron ore operations are economically separable in accordance with his test   BHPBIO submitted that as the words used in s  B of the TPA  in particular the term  production process  are words of ordinary meaning  expert evidence was not required for their understanding  Therefore  BHPBIO submitted  the economic evidence cannot affect the construction of ordinary words in a statute   It was further submitted that the economic evidence had to be relevant to some issue in the proceeding  It was stressed that whilst there may be some debate in relation to how the definition of  service  applies to the facts in the case  it was certainly not a matter for the economists  It was merely a matter of argument  one in which it is clearly inappropriate for the economists to engage   Fortescue relied upon evidence to support the distinction between an  above rail service  and a  below rail service  and sought to attack the reliability of the evidence led by BHPBIO as to the integrated nature of the production process and upon the issue of marketable commodity  I have not found it necessary to rehearse in these reasons this evidence or attack because of the approach I have taken to the construction of the phrase  use of a production process   To the extent I have found as a fact and detailed within these reasons the operations of BHPBIO  such have been determined objectively by reference to the operations actually employed by BHPBIO and not by reference to BHPBIO s own subjective views or characterisations  nor by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of any witness called on behalf of BHPBIO  None of the matters raised by Fortescue would otherwise detract from the essential elements of the production process as relied upon by BHPBIO nor would lead to distinguishing the ratio decidendi in Hamersley  It may well be that the submissions made and evidence relied upon by Fortescue will be relevant at a later stage in the processes to be undertaken under Part IIIA  but these considerations do not impact upon the Court s function in these proceedings   In the Victorian Proceeding  I will order that the application of BHPBIO dated   December   be dismissed  In the Western Australian Proceeding  I will declare that the bulk iron ore rail track transportation services provided by the Goldsworthy rail facility  as defined in Part     of the Fortescue s Access Application filed under s  F  of the Act and dated   June   is a service within the meaning of s  B of the Act  The matter of the question of costs will

well by Learned Hand J  first in Helvering v Gregory     F  d    at       It is quite true   that as the articulation of a statute increases  the room for interpretation must contract  but the meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words  as a melody is more than the notes  and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse to the setting in which all appear  and which all collectively create   And also in Cabell v Markham     F  d    at        of course it is true that the words used  even in their literal sense  are the primary  and ordinarily the most reliable  source of interpreting the meaning of any writing  be it a statute  a contract or anything else  But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary  but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish  whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning

High Court restated a number of the key principles of statutory interpretation  In doing so  the Court cited with approval  at     the following extract from the judgment of the High Court in CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    footnotes omitted    Moreover  the modern approach to statutory interpretation  a  insists that the context be considered in the first instance  not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise  and  b  uses  context  in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief which  by legitimate means such as those just mentioned  one may discern the statute was intended to remedy  Instances of general words in a statute being so constrained by their context are numerous  In particular  as McHugh JA pointed out in Isherwood v Butler Pollnow Pty Ltd   if the apparently plain words of a provision are read in the light of the mischief which the statute was designed to overcome and of the objects of the legislation they may wear a very different appearance  Further  inconvenience or improbability of result may assist the court in preferring to the literal meaning an alternative construction which  by the steps identified above  is reasonable open and more closely conforms to the legislative intent   Furthermore  s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  requires that a construction which promotes the purpose or object underlying the Act is to be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object  This is so even if the meaning of the words  interpreted in the context of the rest of the Act  is clear  When the purpose or object is brought into account  an alternative interpretation of the words may become apparent  However  I accept that if the words of a legislative provision are capable of only one construction  taking into account the purpose and context of the provision  then a court cannot ignore them and substitute a different construction because the court considers it somehow furthers the object of the legislation consideredNewcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Justice McHugh made the same observation in Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd   HCA         CLR   at        in applying a purposive construction   the function of the court remains one of construction and not legislation   When the express words of a legislative provision are reasonably capable of only one construction and neither the purpose of the provision nor any other provision in the legislation throws doubt on that construction  a court cannot ignore it and substitute a different construction because it furthers the objects of the legislation consideredNezovic v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I accept that I should not

significance in the area of statutory construction  His Honour said  at         The judgment of Hely J in Tuncok is a carefully considered and recent judgment on the same issue as is before me in the present proceedings  Unless I was satisfied that his Honour was plainly wrong  I would not be justified in departing from the ratio of his decision on that point  In that respect I refer to what I said in Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA    Judicial comity does not merely advance mutual politeness between judges of the same or co ordinate jurisdictions  It supports the authority of the courts and confidence in the law by the value it places upon consistency in judicial decision making and mutual respect between judges  Where questions of law and in particular statutory construction are concerned  the view that a judge who has taken one view of the law or a statute is  clearly wrong  is not lightly to be adopted having regard to the choices that so often confront the courts particularly in the area of statutory construction citedPepsi Seven Up Bottlers Perth Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   The general rule of

Bradbourn   Crim LR   It is tempting to say that in any particular case a court may well be able to recognise a  service  just as it can recognise an elephant when it sees one  but may not find it necessary to define it  see  e g  R v Bradbourn   Crim LR    The difficulty with this approach is that it provides little  if any  guidance on the considerations that need to be considered in arriving at a reasoned decision consideredRail Access Corporation v New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd     FCR   The Full Court confirmed the distinction between  above rail   transportation  and  below rail   infrastructure  services in its decision in Rail Access Corporation v New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd     FCR     Rail Access Case    The Rail Access Case concerned the question of whether the NSW Rail Access Corporation provided a  government coal carrying service  within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Competition Policy Reform Act    Cth  which could therefore not be a  service  within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Act  Rail Access Corporation did not carry coal itself or offer the service of carrying coal  but it owned the railway line which Freight Rail Corporation used to carry coal and provided a below rail service to third parties seeking to run trains to transport coal on its tracks and related infrastructure   In considering the definition of  service  in s  B  the Full Court held  at     The definition of  service  in s  B of the Act makes clear that a service is something separate and distinct from a facility  It may  however  consist merely of the use of a facility  The definition of  service  distinguishes between the use of an infrastructure facility  such as a road or railway line  and the handling or transporting of things  such as goods or people  by the use of a road or railway line  The fact that one service provider  such as Freight Rail Corporation  is using the railway line infrastructure facility made available to it by Rail Access Corporation for the purposes of carrying coal by rail does not mean Rail Access Corporation is carrying on  or is the provider of  a service of carrying coal by rail  There is a clear distinction  enshrined in the Transport Administration Act and confirmed by the NSW Rail Access Regime  between the service provided by Rail Access Corporation and the service provided by Freight Rail Corporation  Freight Rail Corporation provides the service of transporting coal  Rail Access Corporation provides to Freight Rail Corporation the different service of making available the infrastructure facility which is necessary to enable Freight Rail Corporation to provide the transportation service  The respondent is seeking access to the service provided by Rail Access Corporation  not the service provided by Freight Rail Corporation   The Full Court concluded that the provider of a rail network or permanent way provides a different service to an entity that provides the service of carrying or transporting the coal using the rail network consideredRe Australian Union of Students     ALR   Part IIIA of the Act is to be interpreted as part of an economic statute designed to address economic activity  This does not mean that each and every word or expression found in Part IIIA of the Act is to be interpreted as an economic word or expression  just that the economic context of Part IIIA of the Act provides the setting within which to interpret words and expressions  The importance of the economic context was recognised by the Australian Competition Tribunal  the Tribunal  in Re Australian Union of Students     ALR   at     Part IIIA is based on the notion that competition  efficiency and public interest are increased by overriding the exclusive rights of the owners of

context to the task of interpreting Part IIIA of the Act  It submitted that since Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd     CLR   the courts have approached the Act as an economic statute designed to address economic activity  It was submitted that  critically  the courts have understood that the character of the Act as an economic statute must be taken into account in

require expert explanation appliedSydney Airport Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In order to understand the economic theory underpinning Part IIIA of the Act  it is useful to consider its origins and purpose  The Full Court recently set out the background and context to Part IIIA in its decision in Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal   FCAFC     Sydney Airport    to which I will briefly return   Part IIIA of the Act was introduced by the Competition Policy Reform Act    Cth  and had its genesis in the recommendations of the report entitled  National Competition Policy Report by the Independent Committee of Inquiry  August   by F Hilmer  M Rayner   G Taperell  The report is more commonly known as the  Hilmer Report   Of course  one must recall that not all the recommendations of the Hilmer Report were adopted by Parliament  Nevertheless  it provides an insight into the purpose of the access regime in Part IIIA of the Act   The Hilmer Report made a number of recommendations as to how concerns over access to  essential facilities  could be dealt with under a national competition policy  The Hilmer Report recognised that in some markets the introduction of effective competition requires competitors to have access to facilities which exhibit natural monopoly characteristics and therefore cannot be duplicated economically   The concept is not complex  as the Full Court in Sydney Airport said  at        the background material does not reveal any complexity in the concepts behind what the access regime is directed to  essential facilities that cannot be duplicated economically  to use the words of the Hilmer Report  and services being provided by means of significant infrastructure facilities in circumstances set out in cl  a   d  of the Competition Principles Agreement of   April       Further  as the Full Court went on to say  at        in none of the various materials was there any discussion of any complexity of notion or anticipated complexity of assessment involved in respect of the consideration contained in cl  b  of the Competition Principles Agreement  that access to the service is necessary in order to permit effective competition in a downstream or upstream market  Rather  the essential notion to be derived from the Hilmer Report  the outline of legislation issued by COAG  the Explanatory Memorandum and the Competition Principles Agreement is that it is necessary for the fact of access  in its ordinary meaning  to be relevant to effective competition in another market  upstream or downstream    The Hilmer Report itself makes it clear that notions of access and the circumstances in which access rights should arise are separate from whether in any given situation vertical integration exists  Vertical integration in itself cannot be a basis to exclude the operation of Part IIIA  The notion of shared access within the context of a vertically integrated operation is part of the scenario the Hilmer Report was seeking to address  That is  it is the very prevention of a vertically integrated organisation using its control over access to an essential facility to limit effective competition in dependent markets that is a key activity that the access regime seeks to deal  Hence  it was envisaged certainly by the Hilmer Report that the access regime would be applied to require vertically integrated organisations to provide access to services provided over some of their infrastructure   This is not to say  however  that the Hilmer Report envisaged the automatic and indifferent application of the access regime to vertically integrated operations  In this regard  the Hilmer Report cautioned that a legislative right of access to private property and facilities may have undesirable economic consequences  and that competition policy needed to strike a balance between protecting private property and freedom of contract on the one hand  and requiring access to essential facilities on the other  at p     As a general rule  the law imposes no duty on one firm to do business with another  The efficient operation of a market economy relies on the general freedom of an owner of property and or supplier of services to choose when and with whom to conduct business dealings and on what terms and conditions  This is an important and fundamental principle based on notions of private property and freedom to contract  and one not to be disturbed lightly   And at p     The Committee is conscious of the need to carefully limit the circumstances in which one business is required by law to make its facilities available to another  Failure to provide appropriate protection to the owners of such facilities has the potential to undermine incentives for investment   However  it is to be recalled that even if there be an opportunity for access to a particular service should the exclusion in para  f  not apply  Part IIIA provides for a two stage process as described by the Full Court in Sydney Airport  see      Even a declaration of the service under the first part of the process does not necessarily ensure access to the service  but rather confers a right on the access seeker to negotiate with the provider  Whether access occurs and on what terms will involve questions of  an economic  commercial and social character   see Sydney Airport at    It seems to me this is an important consideration in determining the interpretation to be given to the exclusion in para  f   Protection of the viability of certain investments is not just found in the interpretation to be given to the exclusion in para  f  but is also found in the two stage process that is to be undertaken even if the exclusion is inapplicable   BHPBIO s business in the Pilbara consists of three main operations     a  A mining operation which extracts the iron ore from the various mines   b  A rail operation that transports ores from the different mines to port facilities at Port Hedland  using either  or a combination of  the Mt Newman Railway Line and Goldsworthy Railway Line and associated facilities  and   c  A port operation at Port Hedland  with infrastructure located at both Nelson Point and Finucane Island  at which ore is crushed and screened  in some instances  blended in stockpiles  in most instances  reclaimed and loaded onto ships  where in some instances further blending occurs  for transportation to customers   BHPBIO uses a Continuous Stockpile Management System  CSMS  as a production and grade control system that involves its mining  rail and port operations  The CSMS is part of the production and grade control system that is involved in BHPBIO s operations from mine to ship loading at the port  It assists in the development of the daily blend for each mining area  and determines the required sequence of trains necessary for BHPBIO s operation and requirements for finished iron ore products  Essentially the CSMS was intended to be a more efficient and effective form of the  batch system  which was employed prior to the introduction of the CSMS   The Hilmer Report itself does not set the specific boundaries in which the access regime would apply  Other than giving guidance as to the aims and potential parameters of the access regime  the Hilmer Report  and for that matter other extrinsic material referred to in the Sydney Airport case  provides little guidance as to the ambit of the exclusion found in para  f  of the definition of  service   In view of the general application of the access regime this is not surprising  Part IIIA is not referable to any particular industry  This is to be contrasted with similar regimes in other jurisdictions  such as New Zealand  where access regimes are introduced in the context of a particular industry  such as the telecommunications  gas or electricity industries  Similarly  Part XIC of the Act specifically deals with a telecommunications access regime  However  Part IIIA applies generally to a wide range of potential industries and circumstances  Therefore  the court must apply Part IIIA to a range of services and this will be done on a case by case basis   It can be accepted that the use of rail infrastructure generally is the type of essential facility infrastructure which was intended to be included within the scope of Part IIIA  The services provided by a railway line would be obvious candidates for declaration given that they would often be prohibitively expensive to duplicate  The width of exception in para  f  must balance the desire to preserve the viability of investment in production facilities whilst at the same time preserving the aims of the access regime  Whether or not access to a particular railway line should be declared would need to be determined following the two stage process set out in Part IIIA and referred to in the Sydney Airport case  So
