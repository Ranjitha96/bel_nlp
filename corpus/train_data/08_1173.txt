Watson v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBHP Petroleum  Timor Sea  Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources     FCR   The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum  Timor Sea  Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources     FCR     BHP Petroleum   and Watson v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA         FCR     Watson   on the one hand  and cases such as Murry   Hope v Bathurst City Council   HCA         CLR     Hope   and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR     Ferguson   on the other   The decisions of BHP Petroleum and Watson also  in my view  do not support the contrast between the two expressions in s     BHP Petroleum concerned the eligibility of certain taxpayers under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act    Cth  to have their projects combined so that expenditure on one of the combined projects could be set off against revenue from another  Section   empowered the Minister to      issue a combination certificate  if satisfied  having regard to specified factors  that the projects  are sufficiently related to be treated for the purposes of this Act as a single petroleum project   The application for the  combination certificate  had to be made  from  a person or persons who were together entitled to at least half of the receipts from the sale of marketable petroleum commodities produced in relation to each of the projects  The formal application  by oversight  omitted the name of one intended applicant whose entitlement was necessary to meet the one half eligibility criterion  In the circumstances  the Court  Beaumont  Jenkinson and Heerey JJ  found that the application had in fact been made by all the intended applicants  so that criterion was satisfied  Beaumont J at     explained that the word  from  had its ordinary meaning as indicating  the starting point  source or origin  of the application  That source had been clearly exposed by other communications  I do not  however  see any observations in the reasons which support the claimed contrast between  business activity  and  business   However  I think the meaning of the word  from  as discussed is equally applicable to that word in the phrase  from the business activity    The relevant distinction which is drawn by s   is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year  Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it  Beaumont J  with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed  in BHP Petroleum at     applied the normal sense of a starting point  source or origin  Finn J in Watson at   contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received  As noted above  such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not  or not likely to be  recurrent  eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus  as in Kidston   or the proceeds of a life insurance policy  as in Carapark   or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease  as in Lees and Leech   In certain circumstances  and in relation to a particular period  the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy  I do not need to decide that question followedWatson v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum  Timor Sea

  Hope v Bathurst City Council   HCA         CLR     Hope   and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR     Ferguson   on the other   The decisions of BHP Petroleum and Watson also  in my view  do not support the contrast between the two expressions in s     Watson concerned the claim of Mr Watson and his wife for benefits under the Social Security Act    Cth   Section   provided that  if a person carries on a business  the person s ordinary income from the business is to be reduced by     losses and outcomings that relate to the business       Mr Watson was refused benefits because the payments under the PIP policy were not part of his ordinary income from his financial planning business  so as to allow the reduction for the losses and outgoings of the business  Consequently  the statutory threshold for eligibility for benefits was exceeded  Mr Watson argued  in that case  that the benefits under the PIP policy had the same character as the income they replaced  particularly as  he claimed  he had to continue to work in the business or in some other remunerative employment as a prerequisite to being paid partial disability payments  Finn J at   upheld the conclusion that the payments under the PIP policy were not  ordinary income from the business   The contractual income was a surrogate for  and was payable because of  the reduced ordinary income from the business  The distinction drawn by Finn J is helpful in addressing the present appeal  In that regard  Finn J did not appear to place especial weight on the word  ordinary  in his reasoning  However  I do not think his Honour s views support the contrast between  business  and  business activity  which was contended for   The relevant distinction which is drawn by s   is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year  Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it  Beaumont J  with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed  in BHP Petroleum at     applied the normal sense of a starting point  source or origin  Finn J in Watson at   contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received  As noted above  such income may include income from

 or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease  as in Lees and Leech   In certain circumstances  and in relation to a particular period  the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy  I do not need to decide that question citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry     CLR   The PIP partial disability payments received by Mr Watson for the year ended   June   are clearly part of his assessable income  see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith   HCA         CLR    That is common ground  So too is the nature of Mr Watson s business activity during that year  It was that of a financial planner  although  as he says  that required administration and regulation compliance activities  each of which did not directly result in the earning of income  That was the activity he engaged in during the financial year ended   June   and in earlier years  for the purpose of profit  cf Commissioner of Taxation v Murry   HCA         CLR   at     Murry     The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum  Timor Sea  Pty Ltd v Minister

about the nature of a business also do not support the contrast sought to be drawn  Murry at   Hope at     and Ferguson at   all describe in generally consistent terms what is involved in carrying on a business  They do not suggest that the activities undertaken in doing so  so that they may be called  business activities  are somehow outside or distinct from the business itself   Whether particular payments in a particular year of income under an income protection policy are income from the business activity will depend upon the particular facts  In Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR     Carapark   the benefits received by a holding company of an employer taken out on the life of an employee of a subsidiary company were part of its assessable income  The Court  Kitto  Taylor and Owen JJ  said at         in general  insurance moneys are to be considered as received on revenue account where the purpose of the insurance was to fill the place of a revenue receipt which the event insured against has prevented from arising  or of any outgoing which has been incurred on revenue account in consequence of the event insured against  whether as a legal liability or as a gratuitous payment actuated only by considerations of morality or expediency    The fact that it was the holding company which took out the policy and received the benefits  rather than the subsidiary employing company  did not alter that position  As that passage indicates  the purpose of the taxpayer entering into the contract of insurance which produced the payment is relevant to identifying the relationship of the payment with the business  See e g  Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Myer Emporium Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   cf Murry at

not indicate an intention to distinguish between those two expressions  They are discussed by Stone J in Commissioner of Taxation v Eskandari   FCA         FCR     Eskandari   at      I respectfully adopt her Honour s observations  I shall not repeat them in these reasons  The relevant legislative intention which appears to have underpinned Div   was to distinguish between  activities which are essentially private or lifestyle choices  and those which involve  genuine business activities   see para   of  Review of Business Taxation a Tax System Redesigned     I also note  by way of illustration  that para     of the Explanatory Memorandum to the New Business Tax System  Integrity Measures  Bill    Cth  by which Div   came to be in the ITAA   says    Division   does not change the existing income tax concept of what constitutes the carrying on of a business  The Division will apply within that environment to those individuals able to claim business deductions under the existing law on the grounds that they are carrying on a business and meet all existing tests of deductibility   Paragraph     when comparing the key features of the proposed law and the current law  says that the change is to provide that the excess of deductions over assessable income from a business may be claimed against other income only if one of the tests is satisfied or the Commissioner exercises a discretion to permit it   Eskandari is the only decision concerning Div   of Pt       of Ch   of the ITAA   to which my attention was drawn  The taxpayer sought to set off against his normal salary the losses incurred in his unrelated business activity as a registered migration agent  It was common ground that  unless he could bring himself within the exception to the application of s       provided by s        b i  s       would prevent him from setting off those losses  Section        b i  permitted the Commissioner to decide that the rule in s       does not apply to a business activity for a year or years of income if satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply it because the business activity  in respect of the relevant income years   because of its nature  would not satisfy one of the other tests imposed  Hence  the relevant issue was a narrow one  could s        b i  apply because of the nature of the business  namely that it was in its start up phase and the anticipated revenue stream would not come about for some two years or more  The taxpayer claimed that his new business had that nature because he charged only a modest initial fee  and then incurred significant expense  and would only receive the substantial part of his fee when the visa application was granted  possibly some years later  Stone J decided that the term  because of its nature  referred to an inherent feature of the taxpayer s business activity in common with business activities of that type  Unless the  lead time  before a substantial success fee became payable was a common or inherent feature of migration agent businesses  rather than a consequence of how the taxpayer chose to charge  the exception in s        b i  could not apply and the Commissioner would not have a discretion to exercise   Counsel for Mr Watson  at the other end of the spectrum of submissions  contended that there should be symmetry between the concepts of  taxable income  and  allowable deductions  in particular those deductions falling within the second limb of the income nexus test specified in s        b  of the ITAA    If the premiums paid on the PIP policy were accepted as deductions by the Commissioner  as they apparently were  on the basis that they were necessarily incurred in carrying on the financial planning business  then payments made under the PIP policy should also be regarded as income received in carrying on the business citedHope v The Council of The City of Bathurst   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The contrast between

 The PIP partial disability payments received by Mr Watson for the year ended   June   are clearly part of his assessable income  see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith   HCA         CLR    That is common ground  So too is the nature of Mr Watson s business activity during that year  It was that of a financial planner  although  as he says  that required administration and regulation compliance activities  each of which did not directly result in the earning of income  That was the activity he engaged in during the financial year ended   June   and in earlier years  for the purpose of profit  cf Commissioner of Taxation v Murry   HCA         CLR   at     Murry     Whilst that contention has a superficial attraction  I think it over simplifies the position  The PIP policy was clearly to diminish the adverse consequences of illness or accident  The benefits under the PIP policy provided protection against income loss from the inability to fully conduct the business  and so to earn income from it  So the benefits under the PIP policy are a partial indemnity for  and as a substitute for  the reduced commission and fee income which Mr Watson suffered by reason of his illness  There is no need for a direct monetary correlation between the amount of the benefits and the foregone or lost commission and fee income  Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith   HCA         CLR   at    That does not  however  mean that the benefits under the PIP policy are part of assessable income from the business activity for the year in issue   One submission of Mr Watson acknowledged that  He accepted it was necessary to take the extra step of regarding the business activity as encompassing the  related or incidental activities  which  in turn  include his  insurance activities    Counsel for Mr Watson then submitted that the business activity of Mr Watson included his  insurance activities  as well as the range of other incidental administrative and professional matters referred to in   above  Counsel further submitted that the  insurance activities  by which he relevantly meant Mr Watson taking out the PIP policy and regularly paying the premiums on it and in the event of an insured risk occurring receiving the benefit of it  had the  significant commercial purpose  of securing a stream of income as a substitute for the business income that could be at risk if Mr Watson were injured or became ill  He also said there was a purpose of profit or the prospect of profit  because the potential benefits if an insured event occurred could be up to   of Mr Watson s earnings from the business and were much greater than the premiums payable from time to time  Counsel also relied upon the fact that  as the material showed  the PIP policy was taken out by many authorised representatives of National Mutual AXA and by many other self employed persons followedCarapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

Watson of a discussion with an officer of the insurer    Therefore  there is a requirement to work if capable  If the insured person returns to work at a reduced capacity  the income protection is replacement income  business related income   If expenses exceed other business income  ie ignoring the Income Protection benefit itself  then to sell off the business is against the intent of the insurance act and the insurance company would cease benefit until other work was obtained    In a practical sense  Mr Watson should take reasonable steps to  mitigate his loss   That obligation is one applicable to the measure of damages in all contracts  It does not apply as a term of the policy  Section   of the Insurance Contracts Act    Cth  implies a term that each party to an insurance
