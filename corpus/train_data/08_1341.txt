Logic Group Tyres Pty Limited v Tokio Marine   Nichido Fire Insurance Co Limited   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedLogic Group Tyres Pty Limited v Tokio Marine   Nichido Fire Insurance Co Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  This is an application for costs in relation to a proceeding in which I have already given a judgment on   August   Logic Group Tyres Pty Limited v Tokio Marine   Nichido Fire Insurance Co Limited   FCA    In that judgment  I dismissed the application by the applicant  Pursuant to the Court s broad discretion as to costs  and following the general principle that costs follow the event  I ordered that the applicant pay the costs of the respondents   Subsequent to delivery of that judgment  the first respondent made an application seeking costs from the applicant on an indemnity basis  The second respondent did not seek such an order  I granted the applicant and first respondent some time to file and serve submissions as to whether the applicant should pay indemnity costs to the first respondent   The applicant submits that it should not have to pay the costs of the first respondent on an indemnity basis  The applicant goes further and  without leave to file submissions on this point and despite the Court s order on   August   argues that it should not have to pay any costs   To support its position  the applicant makes several arguments  Most of these arguments relate to the conduct of the case and  in my view  to a large extent simply seek to canvass for a second time the merits of the dispute  By way of example  the applicant submits  that the respondents did not  come to the Court with clean hands  that there was inadequate disclosure of certain information  and in particular information relating to Australian Business Numbers  that it has suffered and will continue to suffer considerable loss  that the second respondent has breached s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  that the respondents  pleadings were inadequate  and that there was late filing of relevant documents and or non compliance with orders of the Court   I have considered the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant  They are not sufficient to warrant variation of the order made on   August    It is also my view that the applicant s arguments do not have sufficient force to displace the general principle which led me to the conclusion on the last occasion that discretion should be exercised to require the applicant to pay the costs of the respondents citedBrother Industries  Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In relation to the first respondent s application for indemnity costs  I note that the first respondent made an offer of compromise  which it filed and served on   April    The content of that offer was that judgment would be entered for the first respondent and the first respondent would not seek its costs in the proceeding  In the present case  I am satisfied that such an offer was reasonable  As is evident from my earlier judgment  the case advanced by the applicant was ultimately unsuccessful  the arguments which they advanced as to agency and liability were clearly untenable  and the order of the Court was less favourable to the applicant than those offered to it by the first respondent on   April    In
