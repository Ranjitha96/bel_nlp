au cases cth HCA  htmlI think it is quite clear that the bankrupt s possession of the property beyond completion of the contract was as a licensee of  and not as a tenant from  the applicants and that that situation did not change at any time before the date of bankruptcy  My reasons for being of this view are as follows        The circumstances in which the right of possession was granted as a vendor  from the purchaser  of the property where the common intention of the parties  so far as it can be discerned from the relevant terms of the contract  was to allow the vendor time  six months  to remove his chattels from the property  hence the nominal  rent  of   per week  True  there was no evidence as to what a market rent would be  but having regard to the purchase price of the property   the improvements and the business being carried on from the property   rent  of   per week could not be characterised as anything but  nominal      The terms of Special Condition    see   above  in
