Ltd   FCA   at     In Alphapharm   Lindgren J at   said that it was not adequate that a party  hopes to be comforted in taking the decision which it already has sufficient information to enable it to take    If an exclusivity agreement in writing between Keycorp and Gemalto exists  it may contain details concerning the date or events causing its expiry  Accordingly  the existence of any such agreement would be a significant matter to HID in its determination of whether it should commence the foreshadowed litigation  Further  any correspondence between Keycorp and Gemalto which might indicate that Keycorp treats the exclusivity agreement to be at an end could also be of significance for such purpose  Any written memorandum or record  for example of a telephone conversation  between Keycorp and Gemalto relating to the termination of such exclusivity agreement in the relevant period  namely between   August   and   August   would serve the same purpose  The Court does not regard the claim for preliminary discovery as being one designed to strengthen or enhance the decision to commence proceedings  No such decision has yet been made  although HID has grounds for believing that it may be entitled to make a claim under the Trade Practices Act and possibly under promissory estoppel  The documents are sought for the purpose of providing sufficient information to enable a decision whether to make a claim  In this respect  any documents of the kind referred to in subparagraph  d  of the Application could be relevant  The Court is satisfied that HID does not have sufficient information to institute proceedings  The present circumstances are accordingly different to those considered by Lindgren J in Alphafarm   For the above reasons  the Court grants the application for preliminary discovery  in respect of the documents referred to in paragraphs  a   b   c  and  d  of the application   I certify that the preceding forty seven   numbered paragraphs are

Corporation Berhad   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe necessity to make enquiries from other sources was considered by Tamberlin J in CGU Insurance Ltd and Others v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad   FCA         ALR   at         At   his Honour said    The provision does not contemplate an order where some reasonable inquiries have been made but rather where all reasonable inquiries have been made  It appears to contemplate a reasonable exhaustion of alternative sources of information and  in any particular case  involves a pragmatic balancing of considerations  The power of the Court arises after the applicant has made all reasonable inquiries and finds that there is insufficient information to enable a decision to be made  There is no evidence of any attempts made by HID to ascertain from Gemalto whether the exclusivity arrangement existed  However  the question is whether it is reasonable to expect that HID would  prior to commencing litigation  inquire of Gemalto whether it held an exclusivity arrangement  That is  whether it was reasonable to expect that it would ask its competitor to provide information which relates solely to a commercial transaction made between Gemalto and Keycorp  in respect of which HID was an unsuccessful bidder  The Court is not persuaded that it was reasonable for HID  a commercial competitor of Gemalto  to have made such inquiries of Gemalto concerning the existence of any exclusivity arrangement between Gemalto and Keycorp  Therefore  such an inquiry was not necessary to satisfy the first requirement of O  A r  b  namely that HID make  all reasonable inquiries    referred toDartberg Pty Limited v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd and Another   FCA         FCR
