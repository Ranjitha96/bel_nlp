amount agreed between the parties   In consequence of discussions that took place at the hearing  all parties agreed to amend para   of these orders  by deleting the subpara designated as  a  altogether  and also by deleting the words  or indirectly  the comma after  in  and the words  or party to   The effect of this would be to make the opening words of the second declaration sought read    The Second Respondent was directly knowingly concerned in the First Respondent s contraventions of sections        a     c  and   of the TPA by  as the manager of the First Respondent     These amendments are appropriate  to provide certainty to any declaration that the Court might make  It is undesirable that the Court make a declaration containing alternatives  at least where the true position is known  because it makes it appear that the Court does not know what it is declaring   The practice of granting declarations  which are not true declarations of right pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act   appears to have become entrenched in proceedings of this kind  See BMW Australia Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC       ALR   at     With the amendments made to them at the hearing  the proposed declarations satisfy the need to be precise  and to inform as to the basis on which the Court has found that the relevant contraventions have occurred  Subject to proper reference to the Trade Practices Act   it is appropriate to grant those declarations   In the circumstances of this case  it is also appropriate to grant injunctions  Notwithstanding the remedial actions taken  the seriousness of the conduct  and particularly the circumstance that it was committed in part while the previous undertaking  involving a trade practices compliance program  was in existence  requires that the Court ensure that any repetition of the conduct can be visited with the more serious consequences attaching to punishment for contempt of court  Of course  there is no threatened or intended future conduct in contravention of any of the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act   but an injunction can be granted in the absence of threatened or intended conduct  in consequence of s  a  of the Trade Practices Act   Although neither respondent is currently in a position to repeat the contravening conduct  it cannot be guaranteed that that situation will remain  Given their experience in the egg industry  the respondents might well decide to resume activity in it in the future  when any contractual restraint on them has expired  The second respondent may not be responsible for any decision Farm Pride might make to resume involvement in the organic egg business  and might thereby be exposed to temptation of the kind that he could not resist previously  Subject to satisfaction that the terms of the injunctions sought are appropriate  injunctions should be granted   In one respect I have a serious concern about the form of each injunction to which consent has been given   As a matter of principle  if an injunction is to be granted when there is no threatened or intended contravening conduct  such an injunction ought to be limited precisely to preventing a repetition of contravening conduct that has occurred  In the absence of threatened or intended conduct  there can be no justification for an injunction with broader scope  covering possible contraventions that the person subject to the injunction has neither committed before nor threatened or intended to commit in the future  The practical difficulty of limiting an injunction to avoiding a repetition of the contravening conduct in one respect in the present case arises from the absence of any commonly accepted  or recognised standard for determining what is an organic egg  The Macquarie Dictionary gives a number of alternative meanings for the word  organic   One of them is  characteristic of  pertaining to  or derived from living organisms   In that sense  every egg is organic  There can be little doubt that the word  organic  has acquired a colloquial meaning  used to distinguish foods produced without inputs that are regarded as artificial  particularly chemicals  The acquisition of this meaning is reflected in an additional definition  now appearing in the fourth edition of the Macquarie Dictionary    of or relating to farming and the produce of such farming which does not use chemical fertilisers or pesticides   The colloquial meaning  and even the new definition  are imprecise  however  in that there is no general agreement on precisely what inputs are to be regarded as artificial  or as chemical  and to be avoided in the production of organic foods  This is certainly the case for eggs   The absence of any recognised norm by which to judge whether eggs are  or are not  organic has created difficulty for the ACCC from the outset of this case  in its attempts to frame orders that would express with sufficient precision what the respondents are to be enjoined from doing by way of repetition of their contravening conduct  Initially  the ACCC proposed injunctions prohibiting the respondents from representing falsely by the packaging of non organic eggs that they were organic eggs  Plainly  such an injunction would be almost impossible to enforce  because of its vagueness  A similar criticism could be levelled at the ACCC s second attempt  which was to enjoin false representations on packaging that eggs were organically produced and consequently were  at a minimum  produced without the use of artificial or synthetic fertilisers  herbicides or pesticides  In addition  this version may not have covered all the possible inputs that some might think should be considered in determining whether eggs are organic  Any reference to a supposed minimum standard was removed in the ACCC s third attempt at amendment  The fourth attempt at amendment would restrain the respondents from    supplying eggs in packaging to retailers and other participants in the food industry which represents by the packaging of the eggs that       a  all eggs labelled as  organic  are different to eggs not labelled as    organic  having regard to the chemicals  feed and other substances   used in the production of the eggs  when at the time of making the   representation  the First Respondent does not have an honestly held   belief that the representation is true     This is the form of order to which the respondents now consent  It introduces an element that has no basis in any of the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act   That is the element of honestly held belief in the truth of the representation  Each of the relevant provisions focuses on the misleading or deceptive nature of conduct  It is no defence to an allegation of misleading or deceptive conduct in making a representation that the maker of the representation believed honestly in its truth  Conversely  in proving such an allegation  it is unnecessary to prove the absence of an honest belief  Enforcement of an injunction in the form proposed would require the enforcer to prove the absence of an honest belief  thereby making the issues different in substance from those presented by the provisions of the Trade Practices Act   Counsel for the ACCC attempted to argue that the proposed element of honest belief in the truth of the representation was simply narrowing the ambit of the contravening conduct  repetition of which the ACCC seeks to prevent  In a sense  this is true  Rather than misleading or deceptive representations  the enforcer of the injunction would be required only to prove misleading or deceptive representations within a certain class  namely those as to the truth of which the maker of the representations did not have an honest belief  I do not regard this factor as saving the form of injunction chosen  In my view  the departure from the legislative underpinning of the injunction  by the addition of the requirement of dishonest falsity  rather than simply falsity  is impermissible   I am therefore of the view that the attempts to overcome the lack of a clear criterion by which it can be said that eggs are  or are not  organic have been unsuccessful  In this respect  I would not grant an injunction in any of the forms proposed  In reality  the absence of such an injunction does not amount to a serious omission in the circumstances of this case  The other paragraphs of the injunctions proposed will effectively prevent packaging and supplying eggs as organic if they were not NASAA certified or produced by a NASAA certified organic producer  It is true that the packaging might not make these representations  but might still describe the eggs as organic  If that were to occur  it would simply be an example of the problem that there is no certainty about the meaning of the term  organic  in relation to eggs  and no means whereby it can be determined with any certainty whether eggs are  or are not  organic   For these reasons  I would make orders in the terms sought by consent  subject to the following  a correct description of the name of the Trade Practices Act wherever appearing in the declarations  the amendments to the second declaration to which the parties agreed at the hearing  the omission of para  a  in each of the injunctions  and the consequent redesignation of paras  b  and  c  as paras  a  and  b  the replacement of the  and or  combination with the conjunction  or  in each of the injunctions  and the amendment of para   of the orders  so
