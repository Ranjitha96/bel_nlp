cases cth federal ct  html  In C  Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd   FCA   at     C  Pty Ltd   Gyles J considered an application under O  A r   and observed         I have not limited myself to considering evidence which is in a form which would be strictly admissible at a final trial  During the hearing I ruled that press reports and other hearsay material were not necessarily excluded on that account  The issue against which the admissibility of evidence is to be tested is whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant may have the right to obtain relief  This does not tender an issue of fact in the usual way   I agree with this statement as to the issue and its character  His Honour s observation that the task of the Court on an application for preliminary discovery   does not tender an issue of fact in the usual way   assists in the characterisation of the application  Because it is directed to the grounds of the applicant s belief   the application does not call for and is not directed to making a determination of fact or entitlement on a final basis  It is therefore not appropriate to strictly apply the laws of evidence as if the application for preliminary discovery involved a final hearing of the issues in the prospective substantive application   In C  Pty Ltd   Gyles J had to consider whether  on an application under O  A r   evidence was required to be in a form admissible at a final trial  His Honour rejected that approach and said that in order to satisfy the requirements of O  A r   evidence could be lead in the form of press reports and other hearsay material  His Honour said at   that   the proceeding is  in essence  interlocutory   citedDaniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In a later decision in Kennedy v Wallace   ALR   Gyles J decided that a determination of a claim for legal professional privilege was a final resolution of a dispute or controversy between the parties  and was therefore final in nature  This is perhaps not surprising because there is authority that legal professional privilege is in the nature of a substantive right  see Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         ALR   at      At   his Honour referred

Federal Court in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   in which the constitutional validity of O  A was challenged on the ground that it did not give rise to a federal  matter   The argument raised on the challenge was that there is no federal  matter  decided on an O  A application because it does not finally determine a dispute  On this question  the Full Court decided that there was a  matter  which established the jurisdiction of the Court to apply O  A  Their Honours that the proceeding which would determine the rights of the parties was the substantive action in respect of which the preliminary discovery application was brought  The  matter  was the underlying substantive claim  and not the ancillary application for preliminary discovery  Being ancillary  the preliminary discovery decision was deemed to be within the scope of the substantive  matter   This treatment of the preliminary discovery application provides support for the conclusion that  when determining whether a preliminary discovery application is interlocutory or final  it is the substantive rights of the parties in the prospective action to which attention must be directed when considering whether the determination finally resolves those rights  This is consistent with the view in the present case that  since preliminary discovery is ancillary in nature and part of the larger dispute  no substantive rights are finally determined until a decision is made in the contemplated substantive application  This conclusion is consistent with that of Graham J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v

was John Fairfax   Sons Ltd v Cojuangco   HCA         CLR     John Fairfax    In that case  the High Court considered the same Supreme Court rule as that considered in Stewart in the context of a proposed defamation action in relation to what was known as the  newspaper rule  that is  the common law practice that courts would normally refuse to make an order which would compel a newspaper company to disclose its sources prior to commencement of an action  The Court said at      The newspaper rule is not capable of applying directly to proceedings under Pt     r     The respondent to an application     is not  as such  a defendant in a defamation action  Such an application is not an interlocutory proceeding in such an action     Emphasis added   The reasoning in John Fairfax related to a rule different to O  A r    The reasoning does not assist in the present case because the Court limited its statement to an observation that an application for preliminary discovery is not an interlocutory proceeding in a defamation action   which it plainly is not and could not be  This observation does not mean that the determination must be treated as a binding determination of an application for preliminary discovery which finally settles the rights of the parties citedJohn Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases

Kendell v Moraitis  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Hunt CJ    December   in which Hunt CJ found that the circumstances in that case did not invite undue hardship or delay warranting the exercise of the discretion to admit hearsay evidence  In this case  the delay and expense involved in adducing evidence admissible on a final hearing basis at this stage is clearly significant  Quite apart from the relatively simple task of providing the original source code  expense and delay would accrue while confidentiality orders are drafted and executed to take account of the special sensitivity which production of the source code would entail  The increase in costs and time are unnecessary at this early stage of the proceedings  An application for preliminary discovery is a procedure intended to facilitate the administration of justice by allowing an applicant to decide whether to commence the proceedings  It is not appropriate at this early stage for evidence to be exhaustively adduced and tested so that findings of facts can be made on a final basis   Accordingly  even if  contrary to my finding  an application for preliminary discovery is a final hearing  I consider that as a proper exercise of the Court s discretion the strict rules of evidence should be waived in relation to this application under s  b  of the Act    For these reasons  I rule that Tibra s objections to the evidence filed for Optiver are not sustained on the above grounds  I order that the matter be stood over until Optiver s application for preliminary discovery is to be heard

application under O  A r   for discovery to identify a respondent was final in character because  in his Honour s view  a determination whether documents should be produced had the consequence of finally determining the rights of the parties in relation to the particular issue tendered for decision  namely whether the person concerned should be ordered to provide the information  His Honour believed that  without reference to authorities  such an application would not be interlocutory  On this basis  his Honour held that the evidence must be in a form admissible on a final hearing  In my view  with respect to his Honour  this analysis is too narrow   There are a number of other more recent decisions directly in point to the effect that applications for pre action discovery under O  A r   and O  A r   are interlocutory and not final  In London Economics  Aust  Pty Ltd v Frontier Economics Pty Ltd   FCA   at     London Economics   Finkelstein J expressly disagreed with the reasoning

federal ct  html  In Malouf v Malouf   FCA         FCR     Malouf   the Full Federal Court held that an order on an application for pre trial discovery under O  A r   is interlocutory in nature  and that leave to appeal is required  The Full Court proceeded to observe at      It is not difficult to find good reason for allowing relaxation of the hearsay rule in a narrower category of cases that that in which the right of appeal is truncated by a requirement for leave  The latter requirement merely places the parties in the hands of the Court  Relaxation of the hearsay rule may substantially affect the outcome of the proceedings or the way in which they are conducted   The respondents suggest that this remark indicates that the Court considered that  for example  in relation to a preliminary discovery application  a more rigid approach should be taken to the relaxation of the strict rules of evidence  The above observation by their Honours was unnecessary to the decision  It is tentative and speculative in nature  and in my view does not assist in the determination of the present question as to whether the application is interlocutory or final in nature citedMakita  Australia  Pty Ltd v Sprowles   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  Tibra advances three broad objections to Optiver s evidence  each of which arises out of the proposition that the evidence must be in a form which is admissible on a final hearing because an application under O  A r   finally determines the rights of the parties in so far as it resolves the discovery issue  and therefore is not interlocutory but final  The objections are     i  all references to the source code of Optiver s automated securities trading software are inadmissible because they are not substantiated by evidence proving Optiver s copyright in the source code  which can only be done by tendering the source code itself   ii  all references to actions undertaken or comments made by other people are inadmissible hearsay evidence  and   iii  all references to the beliefs of the deponents of the affidavits are inadmissible opinion evidence in the sense discussed by Makita  Australia  Pty Ltd v Sprowles   NSWCA         NSWLR     Makita     In my view  Tibra s objections should be rejected for three reasons  The first is because the task for the Court on an application under O  A r   is not to determine questions of fact on a final binding basis  but rather to determine whether the applicant has reasonable cause to believe that it has or may have a cause of action against the respondent  and if so to decide whether it will commence proceedings   It is not to decide whether a reasonable cause of action actually exists or whether the claim will ultimately succeed  The second reason is that such an application is interlocutory in nature  and therefore the rules of evidence do not apply in with the same rigidity as they would apply on a final hearing  Thirdly  this is an appropriate case for the application of s  b  of the Evidence Act    Cth   the Act   which allows the Court to dispense with the rules of evidence where they might otherwise cause undue expense or delay   An applicant may base a  reasonable cause to believe  on a range of considerations  evidence of which may not be admissible on a final hearing but which may be sufficient to ground his or her belief for the purposes of O  A r    For example  if a solicitor reviews the material surrounding a case and advises his or her client that a reasonable cause of action exists  this examination together with other evidence of a hearsay nature may be sufficient to ground the requisite belief  If a computer scientist expresses an opinion that a prospective respondent could only have achieved certain operational standards by copying or appropriating software from an applicant  this may also suffice as a ground for a belief sufficient to satisfy O  A r   in the absence of strict compliance with all the principles canvassed in Makita  referred toOptiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The background
