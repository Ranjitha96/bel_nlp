Piotto v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toPiotto v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA  The proceeding was heard concurrently with another proceeding  VID   of   which also concerned an appeal by Mr Piotto from a decision of the Tribunal to affirm a participation failure imposed by Centrelink in   see Piotto v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA    These reasons should be read in conjunction with the reasons for judgment in that proceeding  particularly in respect of the relevant legislative background  The respondent initially applied to the Court for summary judgment in its contentions of fact and law filed on   March    For reasons which were unexplained  counsel for the respondent did not press the application at the trial of the proceedings and the proceedings were heard on a final basis on   September    This proceeding concerns an appeal by Mr Piotto from a decision of Senior Member Friedman of the Tribunal delivered on   May    Senior Member Friedman affirmed the decision of the SSAT to uphold Centrelink s decisions to impose Newstart participation failures on Mr Piotto in respect of Mr Piotto s conduct on   August     September   and   October    the   Participation Failures   The Tribunal in considering the delegation issue stated  It is claims  sic  that there was not an instrument of authority or something that gave them  MatchWorks  the legal authority to act for Centrelink  I am not persuaded that this is the case at all   However  there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support this finding  In contrast to the circumstances considered by Bennett J in Lim v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations  No     FCA   at     the respondent did not adduce any evidence before the Tribunal to demonstrate which of the arrangements referred to in cl   applies to MatchWorks s activities on behalf of the respondent  see also Piotto at      Also the respondent has not adduced evidence to demonstrate that the relevant employees of MatchWorks were officers of an Employment Services Provider for the purposes of s   of the Act  see Lim at   and Piotto at      Mr Piotto also placed considerable emphasis on what he considered as the inability of the respondent to require him to sign a Newstart Activity Agreement  Mr Piotto s understanding of the Act in this respect is mistaken for the reasons discussed in Piotto at      The relevant question is whether Mr Piotto was prepared to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement  see s  c  of the Act  As indicated by s   of the Act  a Newstart Activity Agreement must be in writing between the Newstart recipient and the respondent  The respondent was entitled to ask Mr Piotto to indicate his acceptance of the written agreement through his signature  Mr Piotto has not shown that he was prepared to enter in to the Newstart Activity Agreements and to conclude that agreement in writing  Mr Piotto has not shown that he has a reasonable excuse for so refusing  Mr Piotto has not shown that the Tribunal s decision on this point was effected by any error of law  This ground of appeal also fails  The matter must be remitted back to the Tribunal for reconsideration  In the circumstances it is appropriate to make no order as to costs  I certify that the preceding forty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable

and Workplace Relations   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  htmlCounsel for the respondent submitted that the Act empowers the respondent to impose the terms of a Newstart Activity Agreement rather than requiring a true process of negotiation  In doing so  counsel for the respondent relied on the Tribunal s decision in Dunn v Secretary  Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   AATA    Similarly  counsel for the respondent contended that as the respondent is empowered to require attendance at interviews or other appointments  this permits the respondent to alter the dates in a Newstart Activity Agreement  Counsel for the respondent also submitted that the matters identified by Mr Piotto did not constitute a reasonable excuse for the purposes of s   of the Act  The decision in Dunn considered the refusal by Mr Dunn to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement  including whether Centrelink was permitted to present the terms of an agreement as a fait accompli   In doing so  the Tribunal examined what was then known as s   of the Act  The Tribunal at   concluded that      Section   of the Act clearly has the effect of empowering the Secretary to impose terms  It is something of a misnomer to suggest that the agreed plan is the product of negotiations     The provisions of s   considered by the Tribunal in Dunn were contained in s   of the Act as it was at the time of the   Participation Failures  Although this Court is not bound by the Tribunal s decision in Dunn   I see no reason in the present circumstances to depart from the Tribunal s observations regarding the extent of  negotiation  required by Act  The language of s   of the Act  in place at the time of the   Participation Failures  did not require the parties to a Newstart Activity Agreement to engage in the same process of negotiation that may be expected of parties to other types of contracts  The respondent is placed in the stronger negotiation position by the Act and is able  to a very real extent to dictate the terms of a Newstart Activity Agreement  Accordingly  the Newstart Activity Agreements proposed at the time of the   Participation Failures are not unconscionable or unreasonable as a result of the failure of Mr Piotto and MatchWorks to engage in a negotiation process  The Tribunal s findings in this respect were correct
