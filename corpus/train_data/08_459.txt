Nathan v Capital Finance Australia   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlaffirmedNathan v Capital Finance Australian Ltd   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe appellant  Mr Kailai Nathan  appeals from a judgment of Burchardt FM  in which his Honour dismissed Mr Nathan s claims concerning alleged contraventions of ss   and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Act   see Nathan v Capital Finance Australia Ltd   FMCA    Mr Nathan s amended statement of claim in the proceeding below traversed many issues  however his Honour struck out all aspects of it other than those concerning ss   and   of the Act   In his reasons for judgment  Burchardt FM said at    I did     make it clear that the trial would be restricted to the issues involving alleged contraventions of s   and s   of the Act    The aspects of the amended statement of claim dealing with other issues were the subject of interlocutory decisions of the primary judge in respect of which Mr Nathan did not seek leave to appeal  The events the subject of the claim under s   of the Act occurred in May    Mr Nathan s case was essentially as follows    on   May   he visited the premises of James Lane Motors in Coburg    at that time he was employed as a casual psychiatric nurse by a nursing agency    he spoke to a Mr Gavin Fernandez at James Lane Motors about purchasing a motor vehicle    on   May   he returned to James Lane Motors and spoke to a Mr Cameron McCredie  and   Mr McCredie told him that the loan arrangement for the purchase of the vehicle included  loan protection cover  for the monthly payments  The respondent s case on the s   issue was essentially as follows    Mr Nathan might be confused about loan protection insurance on the car because he had taken out a personal loan with the respondent in September   which included a sickness  accidental injury or involuntary unemployment insurance policy  as part of that personal loan    no such loan protection cover was included in the car loan or any representation made to that effect    it is not possible to obtain such insurance cover in favour of a debtor  and   if such a representation was made by Mr McCredie  he was not authorised to do so by the respondent explainedCampomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe extraordinary nature of the alleged representation creates further difficulty for Mr Nathan  It is well understood that in cases where a class of person is claimed to have been misled or deceived that an assessment of the reactions of the  ordinary  or  reasonable  members of a class is required and that  the court may well decline to regard as controlling the application of s   those assumptions by persons whose reactions are extreme or fanciful  see Campomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Callinan JJ  Where a particular individual  rather than a class of persons  is said to have been misled or deceived it is also appropriate to consider the assumptions of that individual as to the meaning of a representation and whether that meaning or interpretation can be said to be reasonable in the circumstances  It is fanciful for Mr Nathan to believe that the alleged statement by Mr McCredie regarding loan protection would absolve him from liability for payment of the loan in default  Even if a representation had been made to Mr Nathan  which is not borne out by the evidence  there is doubt in my mind whether Mr Nathan s assumptions about its meaning fall within the protection of s    In considering whether any such representation had been made  his Honour also took into account that he accepted Mr McCredie as a witness of the truth but considered Mr Nathan  a very unimpressive witness  who told lies to the respondent about being in the movie business in order to secure the loan that enabled him to purchase the vehicle  His Honour said at          I am comfortably satisfied that Mr Nathan has not discharged the burden of proof upon him to establish that the representation for which he contends was made  Indeed I am positively certain that no such representation was made  The primary judge said at       It therefore follows that the s   claim must fail  Mr Nathan was not induced to take out the loan with the Respondent that he took out on the basis of a representation made by Mr McCredie because no such representation was ever made  by him or by anyone else  for or on behalf of the Respondent  His Honour did not find it necessary to deal with the issue whether Mr McCredie was authorised  in any event  to make such a representation on behalf of the respondent appliedFox v Percy   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThose findings of fact  referred to above  on the s   issue were strong and decisive ones  aided by the primary judge s observations of the evidence given by Mr Nathan and by Mr McCredie  Grounds one  three and seven of the notice of appeal dealing with the s   issue challenge certain findings of fact made by the primary judge  Those findings include his Honour s categorisation of Mr Nathan as an unimpressive witness with a propensity not to tell the truth  Those are not matters on which this Court is any better placed than the court below to assess  nor is a review of the factual findings the Federal Magistrate made a proper exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court  see Fox v Percy   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Kirby JJ  The only substantive legal challenge to the s   aspect of the case as dealt with below is the allegation in ground two of the notice of appeal that Mr Nathan was denied natural justice by his Honour s alleged failure to give proper effect to s    That ground is related to ground eight which alleges that the primary judge failed to consider whether the alleged representation induced Mr Nathan into error  Those grounds are untenable  Section   precludes a corporation  in trade or commerce  from engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive  His Honour found that no such conduct occurred  That finding was open to him on the evidence before him  No appealable error has been identified on this aspect of the appeal  Ground five of the notice of appeal contains the allegation that the primary judge erred in his approach to the allegations of harassment and coercion made under s   of the Act   Section   of the Act provides      A corporation shall not use physical force or undue harassment or coercion in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer   On the topic of the alleged breach of s   by the respondent  the primary judge said at       It only remains now to deal with the issue of harassment asserted by Mr Nathan  The endeavours made by the Respondent to repossess the car and to otherwise pursue legal avenues against Mr Nathan were all  in my view  entirely reasonable and do not begin to approach what might be said to be harassment within the meaning of s   of the Act  consideredO Sullivan v Parkin   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlWhen the primary judge published his reasons for judgment on   September   he did not make any orders  The current appeal was  to that extent  premature  see O Sullivan v Parkin   FCAFC    No orders were made until   September   when his Honour dismissed the application and ordered costs against Mr Nathan on an indemnity basis  Mr Nathan has not sought to appeal from the judgment which contained the operative orders in respect of which he seeks relief  However  despite this  I have dealt with his appeal as if the judgment of   September   contained an order dismissing his application  This is the most practical commonsense way of dealing with the controversy between the parties  especially as Mr Nathan does not have the benefit of legal representation  It is also necessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal enumerated in Mr Nathan s notice of appeal  Ground four contains a new allegation of bias against the primary judge and has not been substantiated by Mr Nathan  The allegation concerned a disclosure made by his Honour of a shareholding in the parent company of the respondent  Mr Nathan conceded that he did not raise any issue of bias at the time his Honour made the disclosure and therefore acquiesced in his Honour hearing the application  However  Mr Nathan referred in his oral submissions today to comments made in transcript by the Federal Magistrate at an interlocutory hearing  Those comments showed that the Federal Magistrate was keen to bring the proceeding to finality  That does not mean that he was biased in any way against Mr Nathan or that there exists any basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias against his Honour  Ground six is   Did the learned Federal Magistrate err in law in assuming the terms of the Loan Protection insurance in the absence of the policy itself      This ground is based on an incorrect premise that the primary judge assumed the terms of an agreement when it was proved that no such agreement existed  That ground also fails  The Court will order as follows     The appeal is dismissed     The appellant pay the respondent s costs of the appeal    I certify that the preceding twenty
