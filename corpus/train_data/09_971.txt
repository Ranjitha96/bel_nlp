SZMZL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRe RUDDOCK  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte APPLICANT S    HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe purpose of a provision such as s   was explained by Gummow and Heydon JJ  with whose reasons Gleeson CJ agreed  in Re RUDDOCK  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte APPLICANT S    HCA         ALR   at    Applicant S    as follows          The purpose of a provision such as s   is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate  Further      administrative decision making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures  There  the court has to decide where  on the balance of probabilities  the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial  The relevant criterion for the grant of a protection visa to which s  a ii  refers is to be found in s   of the Act  which  relevantly  for present purposes  provides as follows      A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is       a  a non citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  or      b  a non citizen in Australia who is the spouse     of a non citizen who       i  is mentioned in paragraph  a  and      ii  holds a protection visa      The Refugees Convention means the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees  done at Geneva on   July   and the Refugees Protocol means the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees  done at New York on   January    Hereafter I will refer to the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol as  the Convention  referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam     FCR  Plainly  satisfaction under s   is not to be addressed by deciding where the truth lies on the balance of probabilities  Whilst cases such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR    Rajalingam  refer to the  civil standard of proof  being not irrelevant to the process of fact finding by the Tribunal and cases such as Kalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR    Kalala  refer to the Tribunal being obliged to consider matters on  a standard less than the balance of probabilities   see at    I doubt the utility of addressing matters on which the Tribunal has to be  satisfied  by a standard which is related to the standard of proof required in adversarial civil litigation referred toKalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR  Plainly  satisfaction under s   is not to be addressed by deciding where the truth lies on the balance of probabilities  Whilst cases such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR    Rajalingam  refer to the  civil standard of proof  being not irrelevant to the process of fact finding by the Tribunal and cases such as Kalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR    Kalala  refer to the Tribunal being obliged to consider matters on  a standard less than the balance of probabilities   see at    I doubt the utility of addressing matters on which the Tribunal has to be  satisfied  by a standard which is related to the standard of proof required in adversarial civil litigation referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of       CLR  As has been said many times  proceedings in the Tribunal are not adversarial  but  rather  inquisitorial  The Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of the case being advanced by an applicant  The Tribunal member conducting the relevant inquiry is not an adversarial cross examiner  but an inquisitor obliged to be fair  see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Applicant S  at   see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of     HCA         CLR   at      The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which an applicant chooses not to embark on  It is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she may wish to advance before the Tribunal  and for the Tribunal to decide whether the relevant claim has been made out  see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Applicant S  at     citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     CLR  Procedural fairness does not require the Tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given  On the contrary  to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of pre judgment  per Gleeson CJ  Kirby  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     referred toNAGV and NAGW of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another     CLR  In NAGV and NAGW of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another   HCA         CLR    NAGV  the High Court considered s   of the Act in the form in which it existed prior to the passage of the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act    Cth   Relevantly  for present purposes  Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ said at             a perusal of the Convention shows that  Art   apart  there is a range of requirements imposed upon Contracting States with respect to refugees some of which can fairly be characterised as  protection obligations   Free access to courts of law  Art   temporary admission to refugee seamen  Art   and the measure of religious freedom provided by Art   are examples            Section   does not use the term  refugee   But the  protection obligations under  the Convention  of which it does speak are best understood as a general expression of the precept to which the Convention gives effect  The Convention provides for Contracting States to offer  surrogate protection  in the place of that of the country of nationality of which  in terms of Art  A  the applicant is unwilling to avail himself  That directs attention to Art   and to the definition of the term  refugee         Such a construction of s   is consistent with the legislative history of the Act  This indicates that the terms in which s   is expressed were adopted to do no more than present a criterion that the applicant for the protection visa had the status of a refugee because that person answered the definition of  refugee  spelled out in Art   of the Convention        Footnotes omitted Article   of the Convention  to which reference was made in NAGV   provides       No Contracting State shall expel or return  refouler  a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  The question of who answers the description of a  refugee  is relevantly determined by Art   of the Convention  which relevantly provides     A  For the purposes of the present Convention  the term  refugee  shall apply to any person who                  owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country  or who  not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence     is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to return to it  The Convention does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned unless  by virtue of s  R of the Act     a  that reason is the essential and significant reason  or those reasons are the essential and significant reasons  for the persecution  and      b  the persecution involves serious harm to the person  and      c  the persecution involves systematic and discriminatory conduct  citedVBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     CLR  The requirements of s  R  of the Act provide a manifestation of a statutory intent to define persecution  and therefore serious harm  in strict and perhaps narrower terms than an unqualified reading of any unadapted Art  A  of the Convention might otherwise require   The section is not concerned exclusively with or applicable to events in the past  rather than current or future circumstances  The Convention is framed to ensure that persons will not be exposed to persecution  as defined by Australian law  if they were to return to the country which they have left  If any threat or relevant risk is not current or prospective  then there can be no well founded fear of persecution  per Callinan and Heydon JJ in VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR    VBAO  at      The word  threat  as used in s  R a  of the Act connotes  risk  in the sense of danger or hazard  per Gummow J in VBAO at    It is indicative of a likelihood of harm  per Gleeson CJ and Kirby J in VBAO at   and   citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar     CLR  The definition of  refugee  in the Convention is couched in the present tense  and the text indicates that the position of the putative refugee is to be considered on the footing that that person is outside the country of nationality  The reference then made in the text to  protection  is to  external protection  by the country of nationality  for example  by the provision of diplomatic or consular protection  and not to the provision of  internal protection  provided inside the country of nationality from which the refugee has departed  per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar   HCA         CLR    Khawar  at   cited with approval by Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR    SZATV  at    The definition of  refugee  presents two cumulative conditions  the satisfaction of both of which is necessary for classification as a refugee  The first condition is that a person be outside the country of nationality  owing to  fear of persecution for a relevant Convention reason  which is well founded both in an objective and a subjective sense  The second condition is met if the person who satisfies the first condition is unable to avail himself or herself  of the protection of  the country of nationality  This includes persons who find themselves outside the country of their nationality and in a country where the country of nationality has no representation to which the refugee may have recourse to obtain protection  The second condition also is satisfied by a person who meets the requirements of the first condition and who  for a particular reason  is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality  that particular reason is that well founded fear of persecution in the country of nationality which is identified in the first condition  per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Khawar at   cited with approval by Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ

 and   that the requirement that the  fear  be  well founded  adds an objective requirement to the examination of the facts and that this examination is not confined to those facts which form the basis of the fear experienced by the particular applicant  per Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at    A fear is  well founded  where there is a real substantial basis for it  see Guo at    The so called  relocation principle  was considered by Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at        At   their Honours observed that any notion of  relocation  and of the  reasonableness  thereof is to be derived  if at all  as a matter of inference from the more generally stated provisions of the definition of  refugee  contained in the Convention  At   their Honours said          What is  reasonable  in the sense of  practicable  must depend upon the particular circumstances of the applicant for refugee status and the impact upon that person of relocation of the place of residence within the country of nationality  In SZATV the Tribunal had considered that the appellant could reasonably have relocated within Ukraine  The effect of the Tribunal s stance was that the appellant in that case was expected to move elsewhere in Ukraine and live  discreetly  so as not to attract the adverse interest of the authorities in his new location lest he be further persecuted by reason of his political opinion  The High Court ordered that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed and that the appeal from the decision of the Federal Court on an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia be allowed  Application of relevant principles to the present case The first applicant is a non citizen in Australia who is a citizen of India  The second appellant is a non citizen in Australia who is the spouse of the first appellant  She does not contend that she is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention  The appellants arrived in Australia on   March   having left India on the previous day  They each travelled on passports issued by the Indian government and entered Australia relying upon three month visitor visas  On   April   the appellants applied for Protection  Class XA  visas  On   July   a delegate of the Minister decided that the application of the appellants for protection visas should be refused as their claims did not meet the requisite criterion for a protection visa set out in s   of the Act referred toChan v The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     CLR  The definition of  refugee  presents two
