Esco Corporation v PAC Mining Pty Ltd   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedEsco Corporation v PAC Mining Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  When I delivered my reasons for judgment in this matter on   May   I directed that the parties consult with a view to agreeing upon Short Minutes of Order giving effect to my reasons  and that  if the parties could not agree  then competing Short Minutes of Order should be sent to my chambers with brief reasons  see Esco Corporation v PAC Mining Pty Ltd   FCA     I have had the benefit of both written and oral submissions by the parties in relation to the appropriate form of orders  From these submissions  several matters have arisen which require determination   The first point of dispute between the parties concerns the definition of the term  Infringing Articles  which is used in both competing Short Minutes of Order  The definition proposed by the applicants was that  Infringing Articles  means the Hensley System  the PAC Mining System  the CQMS System and the CQMS Lower Wing System  and any other wear assembly that contains the essential integers of claim   of Jones III    The definition proposed by the respondents was that  Infringing Articles  means the Hensley System  the PAC Mining System  the CQMS System and the CQMS Lower Wing System   My reasons for judgment of   May   refer to and explain the meaning of most of these  systems  citedBowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd  No     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There is also a dispute in relation to costs  The respondents concede that they are bound to pay the costs of the applicants in relation to the cross claim  on which the applicants were successful  In relation to the applicants  claim of infringement  the Court found there was infringement  but in so doing only accepted one of the applicants  three arguments on construction  The general rule is that costs should follow the event  although the Court has a discretion to award costs on an issue by issue basis where a litigant has succeeded only in a portion of its claim  Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc   ATPR       Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd  No     FCAFC    I think this principle should be applied in the present case  so that the applicants receive their costs with some allowance made for the fact that they succeeded only in respect of one of the three claims in dispute  Accordingly  I consider that the respondents should pay   of the applicants  costs

Accordingly  I consider that the respondents should pay   of the applicants  costs citedPowerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation     FCR   Finally  the respondents seek a stay of certain orders pending determination of an appeal from my judgment of   May    As a condition of this stay  the respondents are willing to give undertakings that they shall keep accurate records of sales  shall not destroy any records in relation to their business  shall not dispose of or encumber any assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business  and shall execute any application for leave to appeal and appeal with due expedition  cf Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation     FCR   at    In addition  the respondents undertake to pay to the applicants such amount as the Court thinks fit as compensation for any damage that the applicants may suffer as a consequence of a stay being granted  and to provide  if required by the Court  a bank guarantee in the sum of   as security for this undertaking as to compensation   Relevant to the application for a stay  the respondents adduced evidence from Mr Meyers to the effect that the respondents employ about   people in Australia  He says that the manufacture and supply of wear assemblies is an important part of the respondents  business and a significant revenue contributor  Some of the relevant assemblies  he notes  have been supplied by the respondents for more than ten years  and that supply currently goes to every major coal producer in Australia  Mr Meyers says that if a stay is not granted  customers using the respondents  dragline and excavator lips will not be able to source alternative wear assemblies to fit their existing buckets and lips  the delay in supply of wear assemblies will have consequences for the respondents  customers  capacity to meet their contractual obligations  the employment of the   of the respondents  employees who are involved in the manufacture and sale of the respondents  wear assemblies may be jeopardised  and the respondents  relationship with customers will be damaged  There was some cross examination of Mr Meyers  but it did not materially diminish the content or effect of his evidence   Under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   the Court has the power to stay the execution of a judgment pending an appeal from that judgment  There is a prima facie assumption that the judgment the subject of the appeal is correct and that the Court should not deprive a person of the fruits of victory by granting a stay  It is not necessary for the party seeking the stay to show that special or exceptional circumstances exist  but the Court must be satisfied that a sound reason has been presented to warrant exercise of the discretion  see Powerflex   FCR at
