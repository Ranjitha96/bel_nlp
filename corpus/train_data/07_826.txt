 ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A failure to comply with s  A amounts to jurisdictional error  see SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at   per McHugh J  at   per Kirby J and at   per Hayne J   As set out in the amended notice of appeal  the appellant relied on two grounds  The first ground arose under s  A and had two limbs   Ms Meehan s letter  and   the appellant s initial statement regarding his office in the YWA  The second ground related to the Tribunal s failure to make inquiries about Ms Meehan s qualifications   The appellant submitted that the fact that Ms Meehan failed to specify her qualifications constituted a part of the reason for the Tribunal s decision for affirming the delegate s decision and  thus  s  A  of the Act applied  This submission gives rise to the question  first  whether the Tribunal s knowledge of the fact that Ms Meehan s letter did not contain a statement of her qualifications amounted to  information  for the purposes of s  A   If it did  there is a further question as to whether this was information that the Tribunal considered  would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review referred toVAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   This Court has discussed what is intended by the term  information  in s  A on a number of occasions  As Finn and Stone JJ said in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at        T  here is now a considerable body of case law concerned with the compass of the term  information  in its s  A  setting  The following propositions emerge from it         i   the purpose of s  A is to provide in part a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness  Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at           FCA       ALD   at    However the

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR     SZEEU   compare SZEEU at     per Moore J  at   and   per Weinberg J and at     per Allsop J   Accordingly  I accept that  for present purposes   information  does not encompass the Tribunal s appraisals or thought processes  although the Tribunal s appraisals and thought processes may show the relevance of the information in question and indicate what is required for compliance with s  A   It follows that information is not constituted by what the Tribunal considers to be defects in evidence or a lack of evidentiary specificity  Secondly  information may have relevance for any number of reasons  compare SZEEU at   per Allsop J   I accept that the Tribunal s knowledge of the letter was  information  for the purposes of s  A   The contents of the letter included statements about the appellant and about the letter writer  The information was  relevantly  the knowledge that the letter communicated to the Tribunal   The Tribunal gave no weight to the statements in the letter about the appellant s psychological condition because the letter did not communicate enough about the letter writer s qualifications  According to its reasons  the Tribunal s determination about the importance of the letter to its review was the product of its evaluation of the significance of this deficiency  As already noted  whilst the Tribunal s thought processes  including appraisals and evaluations  are not  information  they show why the information that they concern  here  the letter  was relevant for s  A  purposes   Obligations arise under s  A  in respect of information that the Tribunal considers would be a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review  In the present case  for the reasons already noted  the letter played a part in the Tribunal s reasons for its decision  even if only a subsidiary part  Notwithstanding that a piece of information constitutes only a minor or subsidiary part of the Tribunal s reasons  s  A is attracted  see SZEEU at   per Weinberg J and at   per Allsop J  and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC     NBKT   at   per Young J  with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed  The Tribunal considered the letter in the form it took  and put the statements about the appellant s psychological condition  which it contained  out of reckoning because the letter did not state the letter writer s clinical qualifications  The adverse credibility finding  made after the Tribunal had put this letter out of account  was central to the Tribunal s decision  The fact that the Tribunal s reasoning did not proceed in a straight line way is immaterial  Weinberg J explained in SZEEU at   that    The actual process by which a decision is reached is  of course  a complex matter  It is not always as neat as the reasons themselves may suggest  The reasoning may not proceed in a linear fashion  and the Tribunal s reasons must  of course  be read as a whole   In other cases  the Tribunal has asked the applicant about such information  which it has generally found in the Department s file in the Tribunal s possession  In cases of this kind  the Court has adopted no fixed view about the application of the exception  On some occasions  it has found that s  A b  does not apply  because the applicant was not to be taken as having given the information to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review application  see  for example  NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at       per Jacobson J  In SZBMI   which appeal is reported with SZEEU   the applicant confirmed with the Tribunal that an earlier statement as to flight information was true and correct  This led the respondent to argue that the appellant in that case had adopted the flight information and given it to the Tribunal for the purposes of its review  Moore J  at   specifically rejected this submission  commenting    I do not accept that  by adopting the statement at the hearing before the Tribunal  that information was transformed into information provided by the appellant in his application for review  In my opinion  the approach of Jacobson J in NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs was correct  If the Tribunal comes to know of what was said by an applicant at a point before any application for review was made  and views what was said at that time as material to its assessment of what was later said by an applicant  then the mere adoption of the earlier statement during the review process would not result in the knowledge  and relevantly information in the present appeal  being comprehended by s  A b   Different considerations could arise if it was clear the Tribunal treated only the adoption of the earlier statement as the fact relevant to its consideration of the application in the review  In those circumstances the fact of adoption would almost certainly constitute information provided by the applicant in the application on which the exclusion would operate   Weinberg J agreed with Moore J that the adoption of the earlier statement by the appellant during the hearing before the Tribunal did not render it information provided by him in his application for review  see SZEEU at    Allsop J did not consider the operation of the exception in s  A b  in this context   As Young J noted in NBKT at   the Full Court s approach in SZEEU to issues of this kind must also take into account its treatment of a similar question in the appeal in SZDXA   also reported with SZEEU   The relevant information in SZDXA was the fact that the appellant had a temporary business visa to Australia  Moore J concluded that  although the Tribunal had acquired this information from sources other than the appellant  the Tribunal had discussed the fact with the appellant at the hearing and the appellant had affirmed that he had entered Australia on a business visa  In this circumstance  Moore J concluded  at   that the information fell within  A b  and Weinberg J agreed  at   observing  at   that the adoption of an earlier statement at the hearing can bring that statement within the exception  Allsop J agreed  at   with Moore J in relation to SZDXA   The Full Court in NBKT reached a similar conclusion in relation to the information in question in that case  see NBKT at     per Young J  See also SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per Heerey J  and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   per Kenny J citedNBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Obligations arise under s  A  in respect of information that the Tribunal considers would be a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review  In the present case  for the reasons already noted  the letter played a

Young J  See also SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per Heerey J  and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   per Kenny J   The question whether an applicant gave an item of information for the purposes of his or her review application must be answered by reference to the particular facts of the case  As Rares J said in SZGGT at   and   these facts must be considered objectively  The nature of the information is also relevant to this inquiry  see NBKT at   per Young J  For example  if the Tribunal puts a specific piece of factual information to the applicant in the course of the hearing and the applicant affirms that it is true  then the conclusion may readily be reached that the applicant has given this information to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review referred toM  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct
