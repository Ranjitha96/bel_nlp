Conservation  NSW      ALR   Branson J ordered the joinder of Mr Kemp  who did not wish himself to advance a claim for native title  to a proceeding for a determination of native title  Mr Kemp s interest as a descendant of the Pirripaayi people  was to avoid the making of a determination by the Court that discounted the traditional connection which he believed to exist between the Pirripaayi people and the land  Her Honour  at   was of the view that this was an interest that satisfied the Byron test and was relevantly affected by the determination  at    Justice Branson contrasted that interest with Mr Kemp s interest in establishing and maintaining the integrity of his own research and dissemination of his knowledge of Pirripaayi language and culture  The latter interests were characterised as  indirect  interests which fell outside the Byron test  at     Accepting that an interest that is not indirect  remote or lacking in substance is a sufficient interest for the purposes of s       What is the nature of the interest asserted by Worimi    Does a person seeking to establish native title as a respondent have an  interest  within the meaning of the Byron test if they are incapable of meeting the requirements of the Act for a claimant application  Worimi submits that he has  in his affidavit  demonstrated an arguable case that he and others in his family may possess native title rights and interests in the Land  The Land Council submits that the substance of the application for joinder is Worimi s belief that he and the female members of his immediate family hold such rights and interests  That belief is not  the Land Council submits  an interest that may be affected by a determination in these proceedings within the meaning of the Byron test  The Land Council submits that Worimi s personal belief is no more than an interest of an emotional kind   The Land Council submits that joinder should not be permitted where the person seeking to be joined cannot establish anything more than a personal belief that he and his family hold native title   It is not in dispute that Worimi s claimed native title rights and interests must satisfy the Byron test  The Land Council submits that standing as a party is limited to persons whose interests      may be genuinely  demonstrably and not indirectly affected by a determination of native title    are not remote or so insubstantial that it will be mere speculation as to whether and  if so  how they may be actually affected by the determination    can be defined with reasonable certainty and is in each case readily ascertainable as a matter of fact and law   Worimi satisfies that test  As in Davis Hurst at   Worimi is seeking to avoid the making of a determination by the Court that discounts the traditional connection which he believes to exist between the Worimi people and the Land  Worimi s interest is that of a person who claims that native title exists over the Land  That interest is not indirect  remote or lacking in substance  It is not advanced as an interest of an emotional kind  It is clearly directly affected by a declaration that there is no native title  It is not remote or insubstantial  The Land Council submits that it can be no more than a belief  However  Worimi asserts that native title exists  founded on evidence that was not tested  There was no evidence on this application for joinder to contradict Worimi s evidence or to demonstrate that it fails to satisfy the Byron test  The findings in Hillig  No   and Worimi do not extend to a determination that native title does not exist or to a rejection of Worimi s factual assertions  Those decisions covered the failure of Worimi to comply with the requirements of the Act in relation to claimant

and the person or group of persons has a s   application on foot in the proceedings   Kokatha at   Kokatha People at     There is no evidence of prejudice to the Land Council if Worimi be joined  other than that occasioned by delay  As discussed in Gamogab at   delay is unlikely of itself to constitute a basis to refuse joinder  Justice Gyles  with whom Sunderg J agreed  discussed the nature of the discretion to be exercised for joinder of a party who has reached the threshold as to affectation of interests  In Gamogab   as here  the Court was considering the application of s   prior to amendment  that being the section under which the primary judge had considered joinder  At   Gyles J said that  if the threshold is reached  the Court   is to assess the prejudice occasioned to the other parties and the Court by the delay in applying to be joined    Justice Gyles then observed  consistently with the   in rem   nature of the proceedings  that  i  t would be odd in this day and age if delay in applying  in itself  were to radically prejudice  sic  a potential party    His Honour emphasised at   that it is fundamental that an order which directly affects a third person s rights or liabilities should not be made unless the person is joined as a party   However  the history of the proceedings is relevant  The Court has granted numerous adjournments over the objection of the Land Council  then in administration and represented by an administrator  Mr Hillig  to enable Worimi to prepare his case  Worimi initially declined legal representation which he later accepted and filed two successive claimant applications  As recently as   February   he indicated  through his then counsel  that he intended to file another claimant application  This has not occurred  Despite the fact that the original application for joinder was filed on   August   it has been stood over repeatedly to allow the claimant applications to be dealt with   This non claimant application  brought then by the Administrator of the Land Council  was filed on   December    The delay attributable to Worimi s various applications based on his assertion of native title is of the order of   months  Worimi says that  if he is joined  he would make every effort to file any further evidence within   weeks  He later accepted the imposition of such a time limit for the filing of any further evidence on which he relies in the non claimant application as a condition of joinder  Joinder may be permitted  subject to conditions   Gamogab at   and  in the circumstances  it would be reasonable to impose such a condition  Bearing in mind the time that has already elapsed and the end of the Court term  it is appropriate to direct that the further evidence be filed and served by   December   a period of   weeks   I am satisfied that the Court should exercise its discretion to join Worimi to the non claimant application  subject to the condition limiting the time for filing of further

Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales  No     FCA     Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales   FCA    Worimi had previously indicated that he intended to file a further claimant application  That has not occurred and there is no present suggestion of any intention on Worimi s part to do so  By an amended notice of motion filed on   March   Worimi seeks to be joined as a respondent to this non claimant application under s   of the Act  The application for joinder is opposed by the Land Council   Worimi satisfies that test  As in Davis Hurst at   Worimi is seeking to avoid the making of a determination by the Court that discounts the traditional connection which he believes to exist between the Worimi people and the Land  Worimi s interest is that of a person who claims that native title exists over the Land  That interest is not indirect  remote or lacking in substance  It is not advanced

 FCA         FCR   a non claimant sought  by a non claimant application  positively to assert the existence of native title  Justice Madgwick observed at   that the Act is structured so that any positive assertion that native title exists needs to comply with the requirements of ss    A and   and that the drafters of the Act evidently assumed that only claimant groups would assert native title  His Honour observed that there is no apparent policy reason why the information required of a claimant group should not also be required of a non claimant application   if such a vehicle might be used to seek to establish the existence of native title    at    To allow otherwise would  in his Honour s view    tend to compromise the claimant application process envisaged by the Act   and   leave other potential parties and the Court with little of the information necessary to consider the justification for making any positive determination that some group or person holds native title   citedKokatha Native Title Claim v South Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is not a matter of mere speculation as to how Worimi s claim will be affected  it will be extinguished  Regardless  Worimi relies on his claimed native title right to oppose or qualify the Land Council s claim of no native title   Kokatha Native Title Claim v South Australia   FCA         FCR     Kokatha   at    He has defined his claim and whether or not it is sufficient to answer the claim of the Land Council will be able to be determined   The Land Council submits that the scheme of the Act makes it clear that a person who asserts native title must comply with the requirements of ss    A and   of the Act  whether native title is asserted as a claimant in proceedings for a determination of native title or as a respondent in proceedings seeking a declaration that no native title exists in the Land  The Land Council points to the scheme of Pt   of the Act which it says requires that  when a non claimant application is made  a putative native title holder should make a claimant application within the notification period  ss       and  a   It submits that any person or group wishing to assert native title must do so as a claimant and meet the tests imposed by the Act  Accordingly  although Worimi did not make an application within the notification period  it submits the appropriate course is not to be joined to the non claimant application but to file a claimant application  Of course  Worimi did this on two previous occasions and those applications were summarily dismissed   The Land Council relies on the consideration of the potential claim group identified by Worimi in his second claimant application  which it says substantively mirrors the claim group described in his affidavit in support of joinder  It submits that the only available conclusion is that Worimi cannot identify a claim group capable of meeting the requirements of s   of the Act citedKokatha People v State of South Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As Finn J noted in Kokatha People v State of South Australia   FCA     Kokatha People   at   it is well settled that a native title interest is a sufficient interest for the purposes of becoming a party to proceedings under ss  a iii  and   of the Act  As persons with competing claims to native title for an area are entitled to be respondents to the competing claims for the same or overlapping area   Kokatha at   per Mansfield J  so is a person who has a claim that competes with a claim that there is no native title   In Kokatha   Mansfield J observed that all persons who claim to be entitled to native title rights should be able to become a party to the claim or claims in which those rights may be determined  at    In that case  a number of parties claimed a native title interest in the land which was inconsistent with the native title rights and interests claimed by the claimants  His Honour rejected a contention that s   does not permit the joining of parties because they assert native title rights and interests  His Honour s view  at   was that the Court has a discretion to join persons notwithstanding that the interests upon which they rely in seeking to be joined are native title rights and interests which cannot themselves be determined in the proceedings  His Honour gave an example of a competing native title group who claim communal rights and interests which may be affected by the determination of native title over the claim area  If there were a potential dilution of the competing interests or a possibility of limitation or qualification of the native title being claimed  the holder of the competing interest was eligible for joinder  The fact that native title rights are communally held does not disentitle an individual from being joined as a party whose rights may  individually  be affected  at    His Honour recognised that an assertion of the rights enjoyed by individual members of a competing native title claim group may   lead to a more informed decision   as to whether a determination of native title rights and interests should be made as expressed in the application before the Court  at     Justice Finn recognised in Kokatha People at   that  i  t is difficult to overstate the centrality of the requirement

non compliance with the authorisation requirement of s   is fatal to the success of an application and that authorisation must be by all the persons who constitute the native title claim group in respect of the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed   I agree with Finn J in Kokatha People at   that the legislative intent to require applicants to comply with the requirements of ss     and  B applies to any person or persons advancing a claim for a determination of native title  A person or group that seeks a positive determination of native title is required to make a s   determination application under the Act   However  that does not mean that a person is unable to use claimed native title rights and interests defensively to combat a non claimant application for a declaration that no native title exists  The assertion of such rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non claimant application   The Court has a discretion under s   whether or not to join a person whose interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings  That discretion is not  however   at large    Gamogab at    Where the

considered directly whether the Court has jurisdiction under the Act to make a determination of native title in favour of a person  or group of persons  that has not made a native title determination application under s   of the Act and is a respondent to the proceedings  As in Kokatha   the context was a claim to native title by the Kokatha people  the Kokatha native title claim   Mr McKenzie initially became a respondent to the Kokatha native title claim pursuant to s   of the Act  He was also the named applicant in separate proceedings  the first Kuyani native title claim  that overlapped the Kokatha native title claim  The first Kuyani native title claim was struck out after six amendments which altered substantially the composition of the claim group and lands the subject of the claim  The claim was struck out as Finn J found that there was no arguable basis on which the requirements of ss    iv  and  v  relating to Mr McKenzie s authorisation to bring the claim  could be satisfied   McKenzie v South Australia     ALR    A second Kuyani native title claim was then brought by Mr McKenzie  Orders were made in the Kokatha native title claim for it to be dealt with in that proceeding to the extent that there was overlap  The second Kuyani native title claim was discontinued but Mr McKenzie remained as a respondent to the Kokatha native title claim   apparently on the basis that  notwithstanding the discontinuance  he claimed to hold native title in relation to land in the area covered by the proceedings   or else his interests might be affected by a determination in it    at    In addition to opposing a determination that the Kokatha people held exclusive native title rights and interests in the claim area  Mr McKenzie sought a determination that
