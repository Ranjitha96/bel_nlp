Traljesic v Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toApplicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I agree with his Honour  Experience in forensic contests in which it is sought to reveal  even under conditions of strict confidentiality  limited material to one or more legal advisers or representatives of a party  while excluding those persons from communicating with others in the same interest  can create great difficulties for the adviser  It is even harder where that information is communicated to a person such as Mr Hopper who  accepting the highest ideals of the legal profession to act for those who need assistance  act for other persons who are in a similar situation of potential  perceived  or real  risk to security or in litigation involving the question of whether or not their security classifications or other civil rights have been affected by decisions taken in the interests of national security  cp  Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at pp        and     referred toAssociated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   Counsel for the applicant faintly put an argument based on Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   namely that the decision was one which was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at it  The submission was introduced with the words that counsel had difficulty in making it  I have difficulty in accepting it   In my opinion  the material reveals a perfectly rational basis on which the issue of the certificate was approached  Other minds may have approached it differently and rationally  but it is not the function of the court to interfere unless it can be seen that there is some reason to say that the decision maker in effect behaved in an irrational way or in a way that was not authorised by law  In my opinion there is no substance in this ground and I reject it   For those reasons I am of opinion the application should be dismissed    Counsel addressed on costs consideredAttorney General v Leveller Magazine Limited   AC   The problem with secrets is that the revelation of the secret to one person can have the unintended consequence that a cat gets out of the bag  There are cases in the books in which this has happened  One very well known example is Attorney General v Leveller Magazine Limited   AC   in which a Colonel in the MI  gave evidence under a pseudonym and in circumstances where it was intended that his identity not be revealed  But  by setting out his own circumstances and qualifications in giving his evidence in open court other persons were able  outside the court  to put two and two together and  as Lord Russell of Killowen colourfully said     t he gaff was already blown by the deposition     AC   at p    F G   In effect  the cat was out of the bag citedEsso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The courts have a duty to view governmental secrets through different spectacles to those with which they would view private information  Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman   HCA         CLR   at p    per Mason CJ  There his Honour said     This involves a reversal of the onus of proof  the government must prove that the public interest demands non disclosure  appliedJackson v Wells     FCR   In a letter dated   December   the Australian Government Solicitor invited Mr Hopper to comment on the following matters           In order to assist the Attorney General to reconsider his previous decision not to consent to a representative of the applicant being present during the closed hearing we therefore invite you to address the following matters               The fact that  whatever the safeguards  your access to the certificated material is an encroachment upon its confidentiality   Commonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA           CLR   at                 The risk of you disclosing  inadvertently or otherwise  sensitive ASIO information to your client  one of your other clients  or another person            a  You have represented  or currently represent  a number of members of the Islamic community in Sydney who have been the subject of investigation by ASIO  In the present case  some of the documents refer to other individuals who are also current or former clients of yours  The risk of inadvertent disclosure is increased because it may not be self evident to you that asking a particular  apparently benign  question of your client or other persons  could reveal to your client or the other person s  some aspect of the certificated material              b  The risk of inadvertent disclosure of national security information has been recognised by Courts without reflecting in any way upon the integrity of the particular legal representative  The risk may increase with the volume of material  the complexity and protractedness of the legal proceedings and the passage of time  Once the certificated material became part of your general knowledge it may be difficult for you to recall its source and ensure non disclosure              c  As noted by Justice Wilcox in Jackson v Wells   FCR    It seems     merely commonsense to conclude that the fewer people who have access to confidential information the less is the risk of unauthorised disclosure                The potentially serious consequences if such disclosure occurred            a  Disclosure of the certificated information  and related submissions  would also result in the disclosure to others of ASIO s modus operandi and ongoing investigations  The ongoing maintenance of confidentiality of ASIO sources of information and modus operandi is essential for ASIO to carry out its functions  including ASIO s ability to provide advice to the Australian government on matters relating to security      b  Disclosure of modus operandi and details of ongoing investigations could alert targets and thereby enable them to take counter intelligence steps which could adversely affect ASIO s ability to gather useful and important intelligence      c  Disclosure of the certificated material could reveal to Mr Traljesic and other current or prospective targets of ASIO s areas of interest and the extent of its ability or effectiveness in obtaining intelligence                 The extent to which your being present  when the certificated evidence is given or submissions are made  is likely to assist your client  You may be able to make submissions about such things as the likely reliability  plausibility or relevance of evidence given or submissions made that could affect the weight the Tribunal would attach to such evidence or submissions  You would not  however  be able to tell your client anything which would disclose certificated evidence or related submissions  This prohibition may well mean that your client will not be able to adduce any responsive evidence   On   December   Mr Hopper responded to the Attorney s invitation in the following terms     We refer to the above and your correspondence of   December    We are obliged for the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the Attorney General in relation to certificated material      We make the following submissions in reply to your correspondence and adopt your paragraph numbering for clarity            It is quite clear to the writer that certified materials are highly sensitive to the interests of national security and access to such materials by the writer is acknowledged as an encroachment upon their confidentiality          As such the writer recognises the special responsibility placed on him if access is permitted  Nonetheless  the immunity sought by the Attorney General is subject to a competing interest being the proper administration of justice          In the particular case the interest of the proper administration of justice is superior as our client has had the right of international travel denied based on serious allegations contained in the ASIO security assessment  This administrative decision has been made on the basis of this adverse security assessment          A significant portion of the evidence in support of the security assessment is subject to a certificate restricting access to it  For our client to obtain even the basic level of procedural fairness and natural justice it is imperative that the writer  who holds the appropriate security clearance  be permitted access to certified material and be permitted to make submissions to the Tribunal at in camera hearings              The writer submits that the risk of a willful or inadvertent disclosure is non existent        a  The writer acknowledges that he has represented a number of clients subject to ASIO investigations in the past and currently  The writer represents   clients in  passport cases  and one in a civil litigation  The writer further represents another client held in Guantanamo Bay but has not communicated with this client      The writer has also represented and provided legal advise  sic  to a number of other people who have been  sic  subject of ASIO investigations but for various reasons does not represent such people anymore and is unlikely to have any further contact with all but a few of these former client  sic        From representing such clients the writer has a significant understanding of various methods employed by ASIO during investigations      As a consequence the writer is acutely aware of sensitivities related to such knowledge obtained and to providing appropriate lawful advice to clients subject to ASIO scrutiny without compromising the interests of national security      In the present case the writer s experience in dealing with matters of national security would assist him in ensuring no deliberate or inadvertent disclosure of certified material would occur      The writer has discussed the matter of accessing certified material with Mr Traljesic and other relevant active clients of this practice in Australia and advised them that he would not be able to disclose any certified material to them        Further  the writer has advised these clients that when he is attending to one client s matter he may obtain information from certified material attending relating to another client and would not be able to disclose the information to either client  These clients instructed the writer that they understood this and had no objections if such were the case      Accordingly  there would be no expectation by the clients for the writer to disclose any certified material to them      The clients are also aware that if any information exposes a conflict of interest then the writer will have to cease to act for those whom the conflict applies      b  The writer understands the importance of retaining a clear knowledge of the source of information related to national security as a strategy to prevent inadvertent disclosure        The writer will always  and has always  checked the source of information prior to disclosure if there is any uncertainty as to the information s source      c  The writer acknowledges the obita dicta in Jackson v Wells and submits that the writer being permitted access to certified material and in camera hearings is entirely consistent with the principle      The writer has the appropriate security clearance and as he represents a number of clients with such matters any information would be restricted to the one person  This has to be advantageous to a situation where numerous persons had separate representatives      It should be further noted that disclosure of any certified information to any source would be a serious ethical breach of the solicitor s practice rules and would be reportable to the Law Society  A significant possibility would exist that the writer would be struck off the role of solicitors if a deliberate or negligent disclosure of certified information was made        The writer takes very seriously his role as an officer of the court and is aware that his duty to the court outweighs that to his clients              The writer is well aware of the serious consequences of a deliberate or inadvertent disclosure of certified information      a  The writer acknowledges that disclosure of sources of information  being persons  documents or devices  would seriously prejudice the operations of ASIO and the interests of national security      The writer is aware that the disclosure of the name of a person who is a source of information to ASIO would place that person at significant risk of harm      Given these sensitivities the writer understands that he would have a special responsibility not to disclose sources of information  The writer undertakes not to disclose sources of information of ASIO and to employ the highest degree of prudence to ensure that no inadvertent disclosure occurs      b  The writer undertakes not to disclose any information obtained from certified information regarding the modus operandi of ASIO and details about ongoing operations to any person or client      The writer is aware of the nature of counter intelligence and would be extremely prudent with any certified information obtained to prevent it being disclosed and used to undermine the efforts of ASIO and other relevant authorities      c  The writer acknowledges the Government s concerns in this paragraph  It is the writer s role to represent clients legally and not assist them in activities that may be detrimental to the national security or to otherwise offend the laws of Australia      Accordingly  the writer is aware that disclosure of certified material could be of great prejudice to ASIO and the national interest  As such the writer undertakes not to deliberately disclose certified information and employ the highest degree of prudence to avoid inadvertent disclosure of such information            The writer acknowledges that we would not be able to disclose any certified information obtained from documents or in camera proceedings to any client  counsel or other person          Without prior knowledge of the material we cannot submit specifically to what extent the writer can assist our client          Notwithstanding that  the writer agrees that he can assist as you have outlined in paragraph      Furthermore  the writer has a significant understanding of the client s mindset  social background  culture and his philosophy toward Islam  This information may well assist our client in relation to any analysis of his comments by ASIO or others          The writer s presence would also ensure that our client was treated fairly in relation to the admission of evidence and submissions by the Government  This is significant in the circumstances as the client cannot be present and is up against a well resourced Government that has taken action to restrict his right to international travel based on serious allegations that have criminal undertones        Summary     The writer has been involved in matters involving ASIO and national security since October    This has involved providing advice to numerous clients  instigating court and tribunal proceedings and public comment  The writer is one of the few non government lawyers who has obtained a security clearance that is at the appropriate level to have access to certified material      There are competing interests at stake in this matter  That of the public interest to maintain national security  over that of the proper administration of justice  Given the resources of the Government and the fact that our client is not permitted access to certified information or in camera proceedings the interest of the proper administration of justice is superior  This is buttressed by the writers exposure to national security matters and the acute awareness of the sensitivities of restricted information and the consequences that would flow from its disclosure      The writer undertakes that any certified information will not be disclosed to the client  the client s counsel or any other person other than strictly authorised by the Government  The writer further undertakes to employ the highest degree of prudence to prevent inadvertent disclosure of certified information      The writer is aware that disclosure of certified information would constituted a serious ethical breach of the solicitors practice rules and such breach would likely involve disciplinary action that may well see the offending practitioner struck off from the role of solicitors   On   March   the Australian Government Solicitor responded to the letter of   December   stating that they were advised that the Attorney General       a  has now reconsidered all relevant matters in relation to his decision under section  A   including but not limited to the submissions made in your letter of   December        b  does not consent to your   that is  Mr Hopper    being present when evidence is adduced or submissions made which are the subject of the certificates issued pursuant to section  A  of the AAT Act in the proceedings   A certificate signed by the Attorney General subsequently issued dated   April   in the following terms    ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL ACT     ABDULLAH TRALJESIC   CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL   UNDER SECTIONS    A AND  B     I  Philip Ruddock  the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Australia and the Minister administering the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act     hereby certify pursuant to paragraph  B a  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    the Act  that disclosure of the contents of the documents described in the supplementary schedules hereto  and the schedules  would be contrary to the public interest because the disclosure would prejudice security      I further certify  pursuant to subsection  A  of the Act  that evidence proposed to be adduced and submissions proposed to be made by or on behalf of the Director General of Security concerning the documents set out in the Supplementary Schedules hereto are of such a nature that the disclosure of the evidence or submissions would be contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice security      As the responsible Minister for the purposes of subsections  A  and   of the Act I do not consent to a person representing the Applicant being present when evidence described in paragraph   is adduced and such submissions are made      I further certify  pursuant to subsection   of the Act  that disclosure of the contents of the public interest by reason that it would prejudice the security of Australia   Once that occurs by  in effect  persons putting two and two together the damage is done and cannot be undone  In circumstances where the security of the nation has been confided by statute to a Minister of the Crown who forms a view that there is a risk to security by a revelation of information  I do not consider that it is an irrelevant consideration for the Minister to have regard to an assessment of risk  even of remote risk  in circumstances where the person who is applying  as in this case  to have information revealed to him or her could be put into the position where  inadvertently and through no design of his or her own  he or she will unconsciously reveal something of importance which may be of no meaning to him or her  In Jackson v Wells     FCR   at pp      Wilcox J said this      Thirdly  Mr Roberts suggested that  if I were not disposed to grant access to the subject material to the parties  I should at least grant access to the legal representatives of the parties  I gave this submission anxious consideration  It was a course apparently considered by the High Court in Alister  v The Queen   HCA         CLR     although ultimately not adopted  As I have indicated  I would have welcomed the assistance of counsel upon the content of the documents  The applicants would  no doubt  have felt more satisfied that the documents were rigorously examined by the court if their counsel had been given the opportunity to take the court through the documents  But  in the end  I rejected the proposal  It involves a number of problems  Without reflecting in any way upon the integrity of any counsel or solicitor  difficulties are likely to arise where counsel appearing in  and advising their clients in respect of  protracted and complex proceedings acquire information which they are not free to use or to pass on to their clients  During the heat of battle an unwitting disclosure may occur  Frank and full advice becomes impossible  I am aware of cases in which  for reasons such as these  experienced counsel have declined to receive information which they are not free to share with their clients  It seems to me merely commonsense to conclude that the fewer people who have access to confidential information the less is the risk of unauthorised disclosure  Weighing the assistance likely to be obtained from counsels submissions against the sensitivity of the material  it seemed better not to accede to Mr Roberts  suggestion  appliedMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my opinion  the considerations that the submissions made to the Attorney General reveal about the potential but unsubstantiated risk that Mr Hopper might inadvertently disclose information were not an irrelevant consideration  The subject matter  scope and purpose of each of sections    A and  B indicate that the Minister has an unconfined discretion to have regard to what he  as a high officer of the Executive  considers is in the public interest and may prejudice the security of Australia  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at p    per Mason J  Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex

me has tended to centre on the provisions of section  A subsections   and   particularly because it is in those provisions that some exception to the blanket effect of a certificate can be made if the Attorney General is prepared to consent to a person representing an applicant before the Tribunal being present when evidence is adduced or submissions made that are the subject of the certificate  However  each part of the statute must be construed separately  although the court will try to give an harmonious meaning to it as a whole  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at pp          and       Critically  each of the three empowering provisions authorises the Attorney General to certify in writing that the disclosure of information concerning a specified matter or the disclosure of any matter contained in a document will be contrary to the public interest by reason that it would prejudice the security of Australia  Each provision then provides consequences as to the effect of the certificate when so given appliedReg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA

Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at pp      consideredTelstra Corporation Limited v Australis Media Holdings Limited  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales    December   Some of the obvious difficulties which can be created for legal advisers or others in such situations were adverted to in an interlocutory judgment given by McLelland CJ in Eq  in Telstra Corporation Limited v Australis Media Holdings Limited  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales    December    There his Honour said     So far as concerns disclosure to individuals who may in the future participate in decisions on the part of either of the plaintiffs or other commercial associates  to which confidential and commercially sensitive information in the satellite joint venture agreement may be relevant  any requirement imposed by way of condition or undertaking to refrain from using that information in making any such decisions may  in a practical sense  be impossible to fulfil  and any breach impossible to detect or prove  This was a point forcefully made by Hayne JA in the Mobile Oil Australia case where  at p   his Honour said   Once the documents are inspected by the principals of the trade rival the information which is revealed is known to the trade rival and cannot be forgotten  Confidentiality is destroyed once and for all  at least so far as the particular trade rival is concerned   To say that the trade rival is bound not to use the documents except for the purposes of the action concerned is  in a case such as this  to impose upon that trade rival an obligation that is impossible of performance by him and impossible of enforcement by the party whose secrets have been revealed  How is the trade rival to forget what internal rate of return the competitor seeks to achieve on a new investment of the kind in question  How is the party whose hurdle rate has been revealed to know whether the rival has used the information in framing a tender  Thus  if the trade rival may inspect the documents concerned  the confidentiality of the information in them is at once destroyed  Is that necessary for the attainment of justice in the particular case      This applies not only to any officers or employees of the respective plaintiffs but also to any solicitor or counsel who may have ongoing responsibilities in advising the plaintiffs or their commercial associates on matters other than the prosecution of the proceedings for which the confidential information in question may have relevance  For reasons of this kind in some classes of cases it may sometimes be appropriate to confine disclosure of particular documents to nominated individuals associated with the parties to which disclosure is to be made who have given undertakings to the Court and to the disclosing party  not only restricting the use to which information in the documents may be put  but restricting the future activities of those individuals in representing or advising  or in participating in decision making for  those parties  at least for some specified period of time  Such a procedure  however  has its own disadvantages discussed in the cases including the quarantining of the individual to whom the poisoned chalice passes  from providing their services in particular areas and depriving the parties of the benefit of those services  and also creating a situation where agents of a principal are in that capacity put in possession of information  from access to which the principal is excluded  appliedWentworth v New South Wales Bar Association   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  That  of course  does not deal with the statutory formulation in each of sections    A and  B of the Act  However  courts are naturally cautious in construing legislation which has the effect of interfering with what might be regarded as ordinary civil rights of citizens or dealing with other fundamental common law concepts  Thus  provisions will be construed so as to preserve those rights unless such interference is shown to be strictly required by clear words or as a matter of necessary implication  Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association   HCA         CLR   at p    per Deane  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ   I am mindful that the context in which the certificate is authorised to be issued in the form it was under the Act occurs in circumstances where  first  a person s civil liberties and other civil rights may be substantially impacted upon and  secondly  those liberties and rights are the subject of the proceedings before the Tribunal   The question  however  that Parliament has confided to the Attorney General under each of sections    A and  B is the formation of a judgment of a Minister of the Crown that disclosure of particular information would prejudice the security of Australia  Necessarily  considerations which are present to the mind of the member of the Executive of the Commonwealth at ministerial level to whom that responsibility is confided are difficult to judge of in a forensic contest  particularly where an issue of public interest immunity or matter of state immunity arises
