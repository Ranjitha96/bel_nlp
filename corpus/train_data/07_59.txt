Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission in the matter of Allstate Explorations NL  Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement    FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA

    It can now be taken as settled that  when a statute confers power upon a public official to destroy  defeat or prejudice a person s rights  interests or legitimate expectations  the rules of natural justice regulate the exercise of that power unless they are excluded by plain words of necessary intendment         In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   it was held that reputation  including business or commercial reputation  is an interest that may attract the protection of the rules of procedural fairness  In the present case it may be accepted that  at the time the decision was made  the Administrators had been identified as both targets and examinees  Thus  in a practical sense  a grant of the status of eligible applicant was a step towards an examination which was either inevitable or highly likely  In my opinion  that practical consequence does not mean that the difference between the stages explained in Re Excel   FCR   can be elided  In Ainsworth Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ said   CLR at            what is decisive is the nature of the power  not the character of the proceeding which attends its exercise      Either the statutory power is subject to the obligation to afford prior notice or it is not  The circumstances of the particular application for exercise of the power do not affect the question as to whether the implied obligation has any operation in relation to the power in question  The decision to authorise the Evans did not itself directly adversely affect the interests of others in the manner required to bring the statutory presumption into play  Ainsworth   HCA       CLR   concerned publication of a damning report  The same can be said of Testro Bros Pty Ltd v Tait   HCA         CLR   that was

deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC  each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice  The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process  the end result of which would entail procedural fairness   Ainsworth per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ   CLR at   South Australia v O Shea   HCA         CLR

examination of the balance of convenience on an application for a contested adjournment and did not involve the present issue  There is merit in the submission by counsel for ASIC that it is hardly correct to say that an officer of a company that is in external administration has any right to silence concerning the affairs of the company  On the contrary  the officer is bound by statute  when

to suppose that would have produced a different outcome   Stead v State Government Insurance Commission   HCA         CLR    It was submitted that ASIC had received significant submissions from or on behalf of the Administrators in relation to the original investigation and in relation to the release of transcripts which said all that could be said  as was revealed by the nature of the response made when the authorisation was known  Counsel for ASIC submitted that the evidence suggested that ASIC took those considerations into account  Some of the difficulties of applying the Stead principle were discussed by McHugh  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ in Applicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     In the present case  the

that it was a special case  depending upon the form of particulars given by the Commissioner  In my opinion  an argumentative submission that is responsive to an integer of the applicant s case and

consideredCommissioner of Police v Reid     NSWLR  The decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Police v Reid     NSWLR   cited by counsel for ASIC  is  at least  consistent with his submission and  on one view  directly supports it  Meagher JA  with whom Clarke JA agreed  held  at  FG  that the ministerial step of obtaining leave from a judge to prosecute for perjury before any decision to prosecute is taken           of itself does nothing  and certainly does not imperil any relevant right or interest      I do not read the circumstance that the decision to prosecute does not require natural justice to be afforded as detracting from the more general proposition  For the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC  each

htmlDuring the hearing an issue arose as to whether the nature of certain submissions made by counsel for ASIC waived legal professional privilege in certain parts of the Spear Report and the incorporated report based upon the reasoning of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto   FCAFC         FCR    After hearing argument on behalf of the Administrators I said       I am not persuaded that a defensive argument or submission deploys the substance of legal advice in the way the authorities require         Further argument was then presented by counsel and  after further reflection  I adhered to my opinion and rejected the application for access to the whole of the documents in question  Attention was particularly drawn to pars     of ASIC s written submissions  The submissions in question were an answer to the argument that par   of the Gray Memorandum was irrational  It is sufficient to set out par   and par   to understand the argument           In such a complex case  Mr Gray  in his memorandum to Mr Taylor  was entirely reasonably adverting to the possibility that ASIC s own conclusion as to prospects was not infallible or the only view which could be said to be reasonably or even possibly open  especially in circumstances where ASIC had only examined four persons and the applicants had signalled an intention to examine additional persons                     The most that can be said of the material is that it indicated that there was insufficient evidence for ASIC to take action  ASIC is a public body with has limited resources to take legal action  As a public prosecutor  ASIC needs to exercise caution before taking steps against private persons  It does not follow from there being insufficient prospects of success for ASIC to take action that there are insufficient prospects of success for a private person to take action  For the same reason  it did not follow from this result of the investigation that the examinations would be futile  It was submitted that ASIC s reference to  complex  connoted some form of assessment of the merits which could not be tested without having access to all of the underlying material  It followed that it would be unfair not to have such access to counter that which was put forward on behalf of ASIC  Rio Tinto   FCAFC       FCR   concerned an interlocutory discovery issue  The common law was applied and the test was expressed as follows   FCR at        Both before and after Mann   the governing principle required a fact based inquiry as to whether  in effect  the privilege holder had directly or indirectly put the contents of an otherwise privileged communication in issue in litigation  either in making a claim or by way of defence  In DSE  at   Allsop J put the matter somewhat more descriptively  saying waiver arises when   the party entitled to the privilege makes an assertion  express or implied  or brings a case  which is either about the contents of the confidential communication or which necessarily lays open the confidential communication to scrutiny and  by such conduct  an inconsistency arises between the act and the maintenance of the confidence  informed partly by the forensic unfairness of allowing the claim to proceed without disclosure of the communication       emphasis in original Counsel for ASIC submitted that as the point here arose at the hearing  it was governed by s   of the Evidence Act rather than the common law  It was not necessary to decide that question as I was not persuaded that the application should succeed on the basis put forward  The reasons in Rio Tinto   FCR from     make clear that it was a special case  depending upon the form of particulars given by the Commissioner  In my opinion  an argumentative submission that is responsive to an integer of the applicant s case and defensive of the respondent s position would not normally give rise to the type of inconsistency referred to by the High Court

private examination of persons pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the ASIC Act in aid of an investigation by ASIC pursuant to Div   of Pt   has a different history  role and purpose from examinations pursuant to Div   of Pt     of the Corporations Act   The latter are a long standing feature of insolvency administration  the history  nature and purpose of which have been analysed in many cases most recently by Lander J in Evans v Wainter Pty Limited   FCAFC         FCR   and French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd   FCA   and need not be repeated  Counsel for Macquarie also put a variation upon those themes  Reliance was placed upon some statements made by Lander J in Evans   FCR at     to erect a mandatory consideration  namely  that ASIC identify what was described as the  net  benefit to a corporation of the proposed examinations  thus involving a calculus of benefits and detriments leading to a net benefit  The analysis by Lander J in the passage referred to above is  no doubt  valuable  It is not  however  a statute  It does not set out to lay down mandatory considerations for ASIC to consider before granting authorisation  It provides guidance as to what would be an abuse of process or an improper purpose  The statement that ASIC was only entitled to authorise a person who was an eligible applicant if that person s purpose in seeking an examination summons is for the benefit of the corporation  its contributories or its creditors must be understood in that context  ie  the purpose should not be a collateral purpose  There is no suggestion of any collateral purpose in the present case  Furthermore  Lander J does not hold that it is mandatory for ASIC to expressly weigh up all potential benefits and detriments to find a  net  benefit before granting authorisation  The argument is an attempt to incorporate mandatory provisions into an unconstrained statutory discretion  The Administrators did not receive prior notice of the intention to make the decision in question and  if they were entitled to natural justice or procedural fairness  it would follow that the decision was invalid by reason of that failure  It is convenient to deal with the argument that the statute impliedly required natural justice be accorded to the Administrators prior to considering the argument that the dealings between ASIC and the Administrators led to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Administrators that natural justice would be accorded to them  Counsel for the Administrators was unable to refer to any like case in which the point has been taken  Even more striking is that the point does not appear to have been taken in relation to the issue of a summons for examination  a decision with direct and immediate impact upon the examinee which has often been challenged  In my opinion  the argument does not withstand analysis  although it has some initial attraction  It is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon  It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann   HCA       CLR     The only authority that was cited to support that proposition  apart from the reference in the passage from the reasons of Dawson J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission   CLR at   was that

Electoral Act    Cth  provided  inter alia  that an authorised officer of the Electoral Commission could issue a notice requiring the production of documents where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is capable of providing documents relating to a possible contravention of certain parts of the Act  Sheppard J held that the officer was not obliged to give a recipient an opportunity of making submissions as to why the notice should not be served or why it should be limited in a particular respect  nor to foreshadow to the recipient the nature of her belief in relation to a possible contravention of the Act  His Honour said   ALR at        She was acting in an investigatory capacity only  Nothing that she could do could affect any right or interest which he has or expose him  except by the operation of the Act itself  to conviction for any offence or the risk of such a conviction  In the light of the decision in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR     ALR   it is probably true to say that few statutes will be construed in such a manner as to deny to persons affected by action taken under them procedural fairness  The question in each case is what does procedural fairness require  In my opinion  it did not require Mrs Gladwin to give Mr Hare any opportunity of making any submissions to her at all about whether the notice should be issued or what the form of it ought to be      That case is not on all fours with this case  On the one hand  it is a stronger case  The effect upon the recipient of the notice was direct and immediate rather than indirect  The right to maintain the privacy of documents was directly affected  On the other hand  there was no reference to damage to reputation  as public disclosure was apparently not involved

Administrators that the conduct of the examinations that are proposed is likely to prejudice their private and commercial and business reputation  It is a reasonable assumption that the examinations will be held in public and that the topics to be explored will involve airing allegations which would be detrimental to the reputation of the Administrators  It is also likely that there will be some media publicity as to those allegations  It is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon  It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to

Ltd   FCA   at      Johns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA       CLR   deals with a different statutory setting  The issue of substance before the High Court concerned the validity of decisions on the part of the Australian Securities Commission  ASC  to release transcripts of private examinations of Johns by the ASC to a Royal Commission in circumstances which allowed the information released to be published generally  see   CLR at    The Australian Securities Commission Act    Cth  provided for the examination of persons on oath as ancillary to an investigation by the ASC  Such an examination was to take place in private  s    As Brennan J said  in delivering the principal judgment    CLR at        The Act thus maintains the traditional privacy of examinations into the affairs of a company  Privacy has been observed in conducting such examinations out of consideration for the commercial reputation of the company and the protection of witnesses      Of course his Honour was not speaking of examinations pursuant to Pt   of the Corporations Act in relation to which public examination is now the norm  His Honour was of the view that confidentiality of the information contained in the transcripts of examination was amenable to protection by Johns by injunction where its use or disclosure was not authorised by statute   CLR at    That being the case  it was not a long step to hold that the statute implicitly provided that Johns was entitled to prior notice of any decision to affect his statutory right to confidentiality in the information in particular existing transcripts by authorising the release of those transcripts on a basis that would destroy that confidentiality  For the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC  each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice  The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process  the end result of which would entail procedural fairness   Ainsworth per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ   CLR at   South Australia v O Shea   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ at    It was

place  it is doubtful whether there is a single decision making process of the kind referred to in the present circumstances  The decision by ASIC in relation to authorisation involves different questions and different issues than would a decision to issue a summons by the Court or the conduct of the proceeding itself  cf McHugh J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission   CLR at     and see Re Excel   FCR at     and    It is difficult to see how failure to accord natural justice in relation to the decision in question could be cured by later events  In the second place  the

adversarial  There is no case put against the examinee or any case in reply  As Windeyer J said in Rees v Kratzmann   CLR at        The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to day  If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law s traditional consideration for the individual  then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy      See also Hamilton v Oades   HCA         CLR     The fact that the Court maintains considerable control over the examination does not change the information

htmlCounsel for ASIC submitted that the decision of Sheppard J in Hare v Gladwin     ALR   is in point and should be followed  Section   of the Commonwealth Electoral Act    Cth  provided  inter alia  that an authorised officer of the Electoral Commission could issue a notice requiring the production of documents where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is capable of providing documents relating to a possible contravention of certain parts of the Act  Sheppard J held that the officer was not obliged to give a recipient an opportunity of making submissions as to why the notice should not be served or why it should be limited in a particular respect  nor to foreshadow to the recipient the nature of her belief in relation to a possible contravention of the Act  His Honour said   ALR at        She was acting in an investigatory capacity only  Nothing that she could do could affect any right or interest which he has or expose him  except by the operation of the Act itself  to conviction for any offence or the risk of such a conviction  In the light of the decision in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR     ALR   it is probably true to say that few statutes will be construed in such a manner as to deny to persons affected by action taken under them procedural fairness  The question in each case is what does procedural fairness require  In my opinion  it did not require Mrs Gladwin to give Mr Hare any opportunity of making any submissions to her at all about whether the notice should be issued or what the form of it ought to be      That case is not on all fours with this case  On the one hand  it is a stronger case  The effect upon the recipient of the notice was direct and immediate rather than indirect  The right to maintain the privacy of documents was directly affected  On the other hand  there was no reference to damage to reputation  as public disclosure was apparently not involved  However  on the whole  it tends to support ASIC s position  Counsel for ASIC pointed out that a similar question would arise in relation to the issue of a subpoena to produce documents or give evidence in a court established by statute  The same question would apply to the issue of a summons to give evidence or produce documents to a Royal Commission or other administrative body with compulsory powers  eg  the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  There is a plethora of provisions that do not involve a hearing  but result in the compulsory acquisition of information and documents that can be used publicly later by the regulatory authority concerned  eg  notices pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and s   and s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  search warrants pursuant to Pt  AA Div   of the Crimes Act    Cth  and telephone interception warrants pursuant to the Telecommunications  Interception  and Listening Device Amendment Act    Cth   Counsel for the Administrators was not able to cite any authority that has imposed a duty to hear any person before exercising any such powers  notwithstanding the expansion of the application of natural justice since Kioa v West   HCA         CLR    I have already noted that no authority was cited to suggest that either the authorisation of an eligible applicant or the issue of a summons for examination has previously been challenged on this basis citedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe reasons in Rio Tinto   FCR from     make clear that it was a special case  depending upon the form of particulars given by the Commissioner  In my opinion  an argumentative submission that is responsive to an integer of the applicant s case and defensive of the respondent s position would not normally give rise to the type of inconsistency referred to by the High Court in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   and applied on the facts of Rio Tinto   FCAFC       FCR    cf Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt seems to me that par   and par   state the outcome with sufficient clarity  The use which is sought to be made of par   is a good example of the tendency to parse and analyse administrative reports with a fine toothcomb contrary to Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR    A fair reading of the three paragraphs in question is that the complexity of the matter was such that the fact that ASIC had come to a particular conclusion did not preclude a different conclusion being arrived at by others  particularly with the benefit of the further examinations sought  In my opinion  the decision maker was not obliged to seek any further information  It needs to be borne steadily in mind that an unconstrained discretion was being exercised  There is a further difficulty with this argument  If the decision maker had drilled down to the Spear Report and the incorporated report it would have been apparent that the decision made by ASIC was based upon a number of debateable matters requiring judgment and that  indeed  the possibility of various forms of civil action were flagged but not precluded  The second way in which par   was attacked was that the reasoning was perverse and therefore unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense  It was said that complexity of itself provides no sensible basis for departing from the prior conclusion by ASIC itself  A matter could be complex but the outcome clear  The way in which I have held that par   should be understood was not unreasonable in any sense  There is  therefore  no need to explore the application of the Wednesbury principle in this context distinguishedPrasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR  The attack was twofold  In the first place  it was said that the decision maker was obliged to seek more information to clarify par     Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at   and other authorities which have applied Prasad    It was suggested that the decision maker would need to drill down to ascertain upon what basis the decisions had been made and ascertain how clearly or strongly the conclusion had been reached and so on citedRees v Kratzmann   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThis argument ignores the difference between the two stages of the process and assumes that it was mandatory for ASIC to form a view that successful litigation on behalf of Allstate would ensue  In the first place  there is no mandatory consideration of that kind in the statute  Secondly  it mistakes the nature of examinations  They are for the purpose of information gathering  The potential result would only be known at the conclusion of that exercise rather than at the beginning  Thirdly  it assumes that the only potential causes of action were those expressly dealt with by ASIC and that the only examinations proposed were those of the listed persons  That was not the basis of the application and was not the basis of the approval  Fourthly  it ignores the more general purposes of public examination of those connected with insolvent companies   Rees

Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd   FCA   at     citedRe Excel Finance Corporation Ltd  Receiver and Manager Appointed  Worthley v England     FCR  It is then submitted that Gray s reasoning was based upon the analysis in Re Excel Finance Corporation Ltd  Receiver and Manager Appointed  Worthley v England     FCR   of the statutory provisions as they stood prior to the amendments which were in force at the time relevant to this case in particular by reference to the former s   rather than by reference to the present s  A and s  B  A particular complaint is that this caused no attention to be paid to the mandatory nature of s  A  It will be recalled that par  b  and par  c  of the Gray memorandum were in the following terms         b  Different matters arise for consideration at each stage of the two stage process  The first stage requires ASIC to consider the relationship which the applicant has to the corporation  and may also include matters personal to the applicant  such as the applicant s relationship to the person to be examined  The second stage requires the Court  in deciding whether to grant the examination order  to take into account different matters including the relationship between the examinee and the corporation as well as relationship between the applicant and the examinee               c  Contributories  including members  are a class of persons that would normally have the appropriate connection to the company to be an appropriate person to be authorised by ASIC  It is argued that  as a result  ASIC did not take into account a relevant consideration namely the current form of the statute  did take into account an irrelevant consideration  namely the former provision  and made an error of law  In my opinion  the point which is made  whilst correct insofar as it goes  does not affect the validity of the reasoning adopted  The discussion by Gummow  Hill and Cooper JJ in Re Excel   FCR between   and   explains the difference between the authorisation decision  on the one hand  and the issue of the summons on the other and puts the issue in its historical context  Their Honours said   FCR at          What subs   does  in its reference to authorisation  is permit the Commission to extend the class of persons who may  in a particular case  have standing through the grant by the Commission of authorisation  The Commission  in determining whether to grant authorisation  will consider the relationship which the person seeking authorisation has to the relevant corporation and the external management of that corporation which is in progress  Contributories and creditors would normally have the appropriate connection with the corporation  as the history of examination orders  already set out  demonstrates  although other factors relevant to a particular case may make the authorisation of such persons inappropriate      And their Honours said   FCR at      But while the purpose of examinations ordered to take place under s   may be so stated  the role to be played by the procedure of authorisation contained in subs   is much narrower  It is to the subject matter  scope and purpose of subs   to which attention must be given to resolve the present question  not the subject matter  scope and purpose of subs        As we have already noted  the grant of authorisation under subs   does no more than confer standing upon the person authorised to make an application  That being the case  reference to the subject matter  scope and purpose of subs   leads to the conclusion that the decision maker  in determining whether to authorise a particular person to make applications in relation to a particular corporation  will be required only to consider the relationship which that person has to the external administration and in a particular case the appropriateness of that person being given standing to apply to the Court under subs    In my respectful opinion  those statements remain apposite notwithstanding the amendments to the provisions  The two stage process remains and there is nothing about the amendments which renders inappropriate the explanation of the proper approach to the first stage  It should be noted that historically any contributory could apply for an examination order  Furthermore  the relevant parts of the Gray memorandum refer to the authorities relevant to the new provisions and expressly refer to the new provisions themselves  It can be assumed that the decision maker  Taylor  was familiar with the statutory provisions  He was  after all  the delegate of ASIC  The question is whether the decision in question prejudiced the rights of the Administrators  There is some debate as to whether the relevant power being exercised is that conferred by s   of the ASIC Act or the substantive provisions of the Corporations Act   The better view in this Court is the former   Re Excel   FCR at    Whether the correct answer is either or both is of little significance for the resolution of the present issue  The power is unconstrained by any express provision and the only effect of the impugned decision is to put the appointee in a position to apply for a summons pursuant to s  A and s  B of the Corporations Act as an eligible applicant  That appointment has no effect upon any other person  The interests of other persons are not affected unless and until a summons is issued  The focus upon the Administrators in this case tends to distort perspective  It does not even follow that the issue of a summons for examination and the conduct of the examination will have an adverse impact upon all potential examinees  An examinee may be asked to give an account of what occurred in the affairs of the company without any reflection upon the examinee or the disclosure of any information personal to the examinee  Examinations may be conducted in order to obtain information without any defined target and  even if there is a defined target  many examinees will not be that target  Given the width of s  A and s  B   it is apparent that it would be quite impractical to give notice to all persons who might be conceivably affected by the appointment of a person as an eligible applicant in relation to the affairs of a particular corporation either as a potential examinee or a person potentially affected by evidence to be given by an examinee  In the present case it may be accepted that  at the time the decision was made  the Administrators had been identified as both targets and examinees  Thus  in a practical sense  a grant of the status of eligible applicant was a step towards an examination which was either inevitable or highly likely  In my opinion  that practical consequence does not mean that the difference between the stages explained in Re Excel   FCR   can be elided  In Ainsworth Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ said   CLR at            what is decisive is the nature of the power  not the character of the proceeding which attends its exercise      Either the statutory power is subject to the obligation to afford prior notice or it is not  The circumstances of the particular application for exercise of the power do not affect the question as to whether the implied obligation has any operation in relation to the power in question  The decision to authorise the Evans did not itself directly adversely affect the interests of others in the manner required to bring the statutory presumption into play  For the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC  each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice  The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process  the end result of which would entail procedural fairness   Ainsworth per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ   CLR at   South Australia v O Shea   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ at    It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the
