The University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedThe University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The decision refusing the University s application was given on   December   The University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA    I noted in the reasons that Dr Gray did not contend that the material sought was irrelevant  He argued rather that it was of  tangential  relevance  It was not in issue that he treated patients during the relevant period but no issue about that treatment was raised on the pleadings  He maintained through his solicitors that it would be oppressive to require that he sort out and produce from the large number of documents in existence those which fell within the class the subject of the proposed order  I found the case advanced by the University for access to those records to be less than convincing  The class sought by its minute overreached in seeking a range of clinical data relevant to patients treated with an invention the subject of the proceedings  It was not limited to data flowing from such treatment  The description of records by reference to records of treatment with an  invention  would require judgments about what was meant by  invention   I also expressed reluctance about having the clinical data of individuals put in play in the proceedings without good reason   The University has now adverted to discovery item   which it had not previously raised in Court and seeks inspection of those documents  They may fall within  although they are not necessarily congruent with  the class of documents for which the University in effect sought additional discovery in October    The question therefore is whether  clinical records having been discovered  the University is entitled to inspect them   Order   relevantly provides        After a directions hearing under Order   any party may  with the leave of the Court and within any period fixed by the Court for this purpose  by notice for discovery  in accordance with Form   filed and served on any other party  require any other party to give discovery of documents        A party required to give discovery must do so within the time specified in the notice of discovery  not being less than   days after service of the notice of discovery on the party  or within such time as the Court or a Judge directs        Unless the Court or a Judge orders otherwise  a party must give discovery by serving       a  a list of documents required to be disclosed  and    b  an affidavit verifying the list        Without limiting rule   or   the documents required to be disclosed are any of the following documents of which the party giving discovery is  after a reasonable search  aware at the time discovery is given       a  documents on which the party relies  and    b  documents that adversely affect the party s own case  and    c  documents that adversely affect another party s case  and    d  documents that support another party s case                A list of documents required by or under this Order shall  unless the Court otherwise orders  be in accordance with Form   and conform to the requirements of this rule                A list of documents shall appoint a time within   days after service of the list when  and a place where  the documents in the list may be inspected                Where a pleading or affidavit filed by a party refers to a document  any other party may  by notice to produce served on him require him to produce the document for inspection                Where a notice to produce a document is served on a party under subrule   he shall  within   days after that service  serve on the party requiring production a notice           a  appointing a time within   days after service of the notice under this subrule when  and a place where  the document may be inspected     b  claiming that the document is privileged from production and sufficiently stating the grounds of the privilege  or    c  stating that the document is not in his possession  custody or power and stating to the best of his knowledge information and belief where the document is and in whose possession  custody or power it is                      Where           a  it appears from a list of documents filed by a party under this Order that any document is in his possession  custody or power                  the Court may  subject to any question of privilege which may arise  order the party           d  to produce the document for inspection by any other party at a time and place specified in the order  or      e  to file and serve on any other party a copy of the whole or any part of the document  with or without an affidavit verifying the copy made by a person who has examined the document and the copy            An affidavit made pursuant to an order under paragraph  e  shall  unless the Court otherwise orders  state whether there are in the document copied any and  if so  what erasures  interlineations or alterations                        The Court shall not make an order under this Order for the filing or service of any list of documents or affidavit or other document or for the production of any document unless satisfied that the order is necessary at the time when the order is made  citedKimberley Mineral Holdings Pty Ltd  In Liq  v McEwan     NSWLR   The requirement of necessity in O   r   may well find its place in the understanding of what is  disproportionate  for the purposes of the Civil Procedure Rules  In Kimberley Mineral Holdings Pty Ltd  In Liq  v McEwan     NSWLR   the Court of Appeal of New South Wales considered the operation of Pt   r   of the Supreme Court Rules  NSW   That conferred upon the Supreme Court a discretion to order the production of documents set out in the list of documents filed by a party save for those privileged from production  In the joint judgment of Hope and Glass JJA their Honours said that  at            there are grounds of objection in relation to the production of documents for inspection which may properly be taken other than grounds based on privilege  Without suggesting that that is the only purpose for the use of the word  may  in r   it would  nonetheless seem to provide one basis for that use      Moffitt P agreed with the joint judgment and emphasised the court s discretion to adapt its orders to the exigencies of the case particularly where large quantities of documents are concerned     Davies J in Holmes v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   referred to O   r   as a rule which  at            emphasises the principle which was clearly stated in Kimberley Mineral Holdings Ltd  In Liq  v McEwan     NSWLR   that a court s powers with respect to discovery and inspection are discretionary and ought to be exercised to prevent abuse of its process  citedHolmes v Deputy Federal Commission of Taxation     ATC   Davies J in Holmes v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   referred to O   r   as a rule which  at            emphasises the principle which was clearly

the Court to be satisfied that an order of the kind referred to in that rule is  at the time when the order is made  necessary  in the interests of a fair trial   He cited Percy v General Motors Holden s Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at    He also referred to Boyle v Downes     NSWLR   dealing with a similarly expressed constraint in the Supreme Court Rules    NSW  relating to interrogatories  The criterion adopted in the latter case was whether the order sought was  reasonably necessary for the disposing fairly of the cause or matter   Lindgren J said  at        The notion of the  interests of a fair trial  and of the  fair disposition of a case  encompasses  in my view  the opening up of a train of inquiry of the kind referred to above which is part of the proper function of discovery       His Honour was referring to discovery rather than the production of discovered documents  Nevertheless  O   r   applies the same criterion to orders for production of documents  It was so applied by Branson J in Gray v Associated Book Publishers  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA   in which her Honour said  at              it is clear that the power of the Court to order that a discovered document be produced for inspection by another party is a discretionary power  see O   r        And added  at        What is  necessary  within the meaning of O   r   is that which is reasonably necessary in the interests
