Mujedinovski v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedGodley v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD  The next ground is that the fifth sentence of the passage quoted at   disregards the precept that  continuing conduct must be demonstrated that shows a lack of enduring moral quality   That is a quotation from the reasons of Lee J in Godley v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD     Godley   at   approved on appeal in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Godley   FCAFC         FCR   at     The whole passage is as follows    Before past and present general conduct may be taken to reveal indicia that a visa applicant is not of good character continuing conduct must be demonstrated that shows a lack of enduring moral quality  Although in some circumstances isolated elements of conduct may be significant and display lack of moral worth they will be rare  and as with consideration of criminal conduct there must be due regard given to recent good conduct     The applicant contends that there is no continuing conduct of the kind of which Mr Selimi was guilty previously  The third ground attacks the passage in the Tribunal s reasons set out at   above   of the Tribunal s reasons   Reliance is placed on another passage from Lee J s judgment in Godley     ALD     also approved by the Full Court  His Honour said at     A provision such as that contained in s  c  is not concerned with weaknesses or blemishes in character but with ensuring that the power to refuse a visa by reference to quality of character of a visa applicant is only provided to the minister when it is demonstrable that the visa applicant is not of good character thereby giving sufficient cause for the minister to determine whether the degree of absence of good character is such that it would be clearly in the interests of the Australian community to refuse entry to that person        This passage is preceded by an elaborate examination of matters relied upon by the Minister  which Lee J generally characterised at   as weaknesses or blemishes in character which in his view did not justify a conclusion that Mr Godley was a person not of good character  The matters included insignificant traffic offences  offences that were  non informative  as to whether he was a person not of good character  a failure to disclose something influenced by his need to obtain earnings as a husband as much as by any innate defect in character  a matter of which his Honour said it was difficult to see how it could have been used by the Minister to determine bad character  and a matter that in terms of assessing a person s enduring moral quality was described as trivial  It was this catalogue of incidents that Lee J characterised as mere weaknesses or blemishes in character falling short of demonstrating that Mr Godley was not of good character  His Honour went on to hold that the Minister s reasons  which relied on the catalogue of incidents  showed that he did not apply his mind to the threshold question required to be determined under s  c    namely whether he could find as a fact that Mr Godley was a person not of good character  The present case is quite different from Godley     ALD    What Lee J there described as  weaknesses or blemishes in character  were trivial matters and matters uninformative as to whether Mr Godley was not of good character  The matters the Tribunal in the present case so described were not of that nature  Paragraph   of the Tribunal s reasons begins   If not already apparent  I cannot find Mr Selimi has enduring moral qualities    This refers to the incidents recorded elsewhere in the reasons  especially in    The offences of which he was convicted  his conduct in relation to the claim for a protection visa  making or allowing to be made false statements for many years intended to conceal that his marriage was a sham  and his recent false evidence at the Tribunal hearing  were not trivial or uninformative matters that Lee J described in globo as  weaknesses or blemishes in character   They were serious matters that went to the core of whether Mr Selimi was a person not of good character  The Tribunal twice referred to the offences as  serious   It also stressed  the gravity and extent  of the past criminal and general conduct  It noted that in the Direction the Minister regarded serious crimes against the Act as being  very serious   In those circumstances the Tribunal s conclusion that it could not find that Mr Selimi had enduring moral qualities would  but for the balance of the sentence at   be unassailable  The  enduring moral qualities  test applied by the Tribunal is endorsed by Full Courts in Irving v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at   and Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     to which the Tribunal referred  and by Full Courts in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Baker     FCR   and Godley   FCAFC         FCR   at     to which it did not refer  What seems to have happened at   is that the Tribunal has taken  enduring moral qualities  from Irving and Goldie and has assimilated those qualities with  weaknesses or blemishes in character   Irving and Goldie were of course contrasting those characteristics  However  despite this slip  it is clear from a reading of the Tribunal s reasons as a whole that it regarded Mr Selimi s conduct as serious  grave and extended  and concluded that he did not have enduring moral qualities  That the Tribunal used  weaknesses or blemishes in character  as a general description of that conduct does not mean that it regarded it as trivial or uninformative of true character  The expression  infractions     that show weaknesses or blemishes  should  in the context of the whole of the Tribunal s reasons  be understood as  weaknesses or blemishes in character of a serious nature  which  taken together with the fact that Mr Selimi lied to Departmental officers and gave false evidence to the Tribunal  demonstrated an absence of enduring moral qualities and thus an absence of good character  It is important to understand that the Tribunal was not strictly wrong in calling Mr Selimi s infractions  weaknesses or blemishes in character   They did have that quality  The description only seems to understate the seriousness of the infractions because it was used in Godley     ALD   to describe trivial matters and matters uninformative as to whether Mr Godley was not of good character  When the passage from Godley     ALD   set out at   above is read in the context of the facts of that case  it is seen that it provides no assistance to the applicant s third ground  For the avoidance of doubt I should record that the document described as  Application for an order to show cause  has a fourth ground  However  it appears to be an amalgam of the first and second grounds  and is disposed of by what I have said about them  None of the grounds having been made out  the application must be dismissed   I certify that the preceding thirty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

previous temporally extended criminal and generally dishonest behaviour  I do not accept the applicant s submission that reliance cannot be placed on these observations because they were made in the

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAt   the Tribunal said    If not already apparent  I cannot find Mr Selimi has enduring moral qualities   he has committed infractions       that show weaknesses or blemishes in character and he is a person who lied to officers of the respondent thereby demonstrating an absence of good character  refer Irving v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Re Lachmaiya and Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   AATA         AAR    The Tribunal then turned to the discretionary considerations in Part   of the Direction  After considering the three primary considerations and the  other  considerations  it concluded that the discretion should be exercised in favour of a refusal of the visa  I do not need to record the Tribunal s reasoning process in this connection  because its treatment of the discretionary matters was not attacked  It is however necessary to note some findings of fact made in the course of this part of the Tribunal s reasons  At   of its reasons the Tribunal recorded Mr Selimi s oral evidence about the Court proceedings referred to at     above  He told the Tribunal he did not know the purpose for his appearance there  but understood that it had something to do with the issue to him of a visa  He could not remember whether he had an interpreter assisting him  He did not understand the proceedings  He could not remember whether he gave evidence or whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty  He said that at the conclusion of the proceedings his solicitor told him that  everything was alright   He did not discover that he had been convicted until the present application was made  At   of its reasons  in the course of dealing with discretionary considerations  the Tribunal said    I am satisfied and find as a fact that Mr Selimi did understand the nature of the proceedings  that he did plead not guilty  that he did give evidence and that the allegations against him were properly interpreted  His denial throughout the hearing of this application of his understanding of the proceedings at Dandenong Magistrates  Court and his memory of it does him no credit  The present case is quite different from Godley     ALD    What Lee J there described as  weaknesses or blemishes in character  were trivial matters and matters uninformative as to whether Mr Godley was not of good character  The matters the Tribunal in the present
