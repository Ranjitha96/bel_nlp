context of an appeal  In Humber   Co v John Griffiths Cycle Company     LT   Lord Davey  the only member of the House of Lords to address the point  held that where a company was being wound up under the direction of the court  an appeal in which the company was a respondent  brought in an action in which the company was originally the plaintiff  was not a  proceeding against the company  within s   of the Companies Act    UK   Accordingly  leave to proceed was not required  However  in Skinner v Jeogla Pty Ltd     ACSR   which arose out of an application to the court for leave to proceed against a company in liquidation brought under s  B of the Corporations Law   the New South Wales Court of Appeal doubted the correctness of Humber   It noted that the language of s  B differed significantly from that of the provision under consideration in Humber   Spigelman CJ observed  at   that Lord Davey s reasoning was  redolent of the language of waiver   He concluded that there were two points of distinction between Humber and the case before the Court of Appeal  The more important of these was that in   when Humber was decided  the position was that leave to proceed against a company in liquidation had to be obtained from the court that had made the winding up order  and not the appellate court  The practice under the   Act was said to have been set out by Jessell MR in Re

should be granted are the amount and seriousness of the claim  the degree of complexity of the legal and factual issues involved  and the stage to which the proceedings  if already commenced  may have progressed  Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at    per McPherson J  with whom WB Campbell CJ and Sheahan J agreed   Plainly  this proceeding has now progressed to a very advanced stage  It is all but complete  I accept Mr Cawthorn s submission that it would now be inappropriate to require the proceeding to be the subject of a proof of debt in the winding up  Although there is a judgment debt in favour of the appellants  there remains outstanding an issue as to costs which the liquidators cannot resolve  In addition  it is unlikely that the liquidators will be distracted or diverted from their task by allowing this matter to proceed to finality before the Full Court  rather than having it stayed because the company is now in liquidation  It follows that  if leave to proceed against Lane Moller Partners is in fact required  a matter upon which I express no concluded view  such leave is granted        I certify that the preceding sixteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of
