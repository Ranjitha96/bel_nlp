expressed a narrower view than Mason and Wilson JJ on the question of when legal professional privilege attaches to confidential professional communications between government agencies and salaried legal officers  their Honours were in agreement as to the need in every case for the legal adviser to be  independent   see also Deane J at p    See also Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd v

cases cth FCAFC  html  The parties were in agreement that the appropriate test to be applied in determining whether or not the respondents have waived privilege in the external legal advice referred to in the letter of   April   is whether they have in effect disclosed the substance or conclusion of that advice  The test was expressed this way by Gyles J  with whom Tamberlin J agreed  in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR   at   where his Honour said        The voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion   In his additional observations in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service   Tamberlin J at   said    Various expressions are used in the formulation of principles relating to waiver of legal professional privilege  such as references to  the substance   effect  or  content  of the advice  The weight of the authorities  in my view  supports the conclusion that the disclosure of the conclusion reached in or course of action recommended by  an advice can amount to waiver of privilege in respect of the premises relating to the opinion which has been disclosed  notwithstanding that this reasoning is not disclosed  By way of illustration  if there is a disclosure that a client has been advised that interpretation  A  is preferable to interpretation  B  of a legislative provision  then even if there is no disclosure of the reasoning leading to that conclusion  the reasoning and content of the advice may be waived  including the factual premises and circumstances leading to that conclusion    His Honour had earlier observed that it  may perhaps have been different  if it had simply been asserted that  in effect  the client had taken legal advice and thereafter adopted a particular position   The critical question concerning the letter dated   April   is thus its proper construction  For this reason only limited assistance is provided by consideration of the facts of other cases  It is necessary for me to form a view  after consideration of the whole of the letter of   April   as to whether the respondents by that letter deployed the substance or effect of their external legal advice for forensic purposes  Assuming for present purposes the correctness of the proposition tentatively advanced by Tamberlin J  see   above  there would have been no waiver if the letter simply asserted  in effect  that PwC had taken legal advice and thereafter acted from   July   in the way complained of by Ms Rich   In my view  a fair reading of the letter of   April   leads to the conclusion that it was calculated to convey the message that the conduct of PwC from   July   was undertaken on external advice and in accordance with that advice  and  for that reason  PwC did not believe that there had been any victimisation or other conduct for which compensation could properly be sought  This conclusion can  it seems to me  be tested by asking whether  were it the case that PwC had acted in disregard of its external advice  or were it the case that its belief that there had not been any victimisation or other conduct for which compensation could properly be sought was inconsistent with its external advice  would the letter have been misleading  In my view  it is plain that it would have been  The statement that PwC had  acted at all times with the benefit of external advice  was apparently made for the purpose of fortifying the claim that it had not engaged in victimisation  or in other conduct for which compensation could properly be sought  Implicit in the calling in aid of the external legal advice for this purpose was the claim that the external legal advice supported the conduct of PwC   I therefore reject the submission of the respondents that the letter does not disclose the substance or conclusion of the external advice received by the respondents and that the statement in the letter reproduced in   above amounts to a simple assertion that the client has taken legal advice and has acted with the benefit of it citedCommissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   the

In Goldberg v Ng this Court considered a case in which there was disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party  for a limited and specific purpose  and upon terms that the third party would treat the information disclosed as confidential  The Court was divided upon whether  in the circumstances of the case  privilege was waived  However  the reasoning of all members of the Court

Mann v Carnell at   the majority of the High Court stated the governing principle concerning waiver of privilege as follows    Waiver may be express or implied  Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect  When an affirmative answer is given to such a question  it is sometimes said that waiver is  imputed by operation of law   This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences  even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege      What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of

necessarily lacks the independence necessary for client legal privilege to attach to his or her advice  Rather she placed reliance on the approach adopted by Graham J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd     ALR   at   where his Honour said    In my opinion  an in house lawyer will lack the requisite measure of independence if his advice is at risk of being compromised by virtue of the nature of his employment relationship with his employer  On the other hand  if the personal loyalties  duties and interests of the in house lawyer do not influence the professional legal advice which he gives  the requirement for independence will be satisfied   In arguing that OGC was in a position to provide independent advice to them  the respondents placed weight on the following passages from the reasons for judgment of Tamberlin J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd   FCA   concerning documents generated by an in house counsel         The dominant purpose test has particular importance in relation to the position of in house counsel because they may be in a closer relationship to the management than outside counsel and therefore more exposed to participation in commercial aspects of an enterprise  The courts recognise that being a lawyer employed by an enterprise does not of itself entail a level of independence  Each employment will depend on the way in which the position is structured and executed  For example  some enterprises may treat the in house adviser as concerned solely in advising and dealing with legal problems  As a matter of commercial reality  however  both internal and external legal advisers will often be involved in expressing views and acting on commercial issues                 The authorities recognise that in order to attract privilege the legal adviser should have an appropriate degree of independence so as to ensure that the protection of legal professional privilege is not conferred too widely  Commercial reality requires recognition by the courts of the fact that employed legal advisers not practising on their own account may often be involved to some extent in giving advice of a commercial nature related to the giving of legal advice  Such involvement does not necessarily disqualify the documents relating to that role from privilege  The matter is necessarily one of fact and degree and involves a weighing of the relative importance of the identified purposes                                 I am cognisant of the fact that there is no bright line separating the role of an employed legal counsel as a lawyer advising in house and his participation in commercial decisions  In other words  it is often practically impossible to segregate commercial activities from purely  legal  functions  The two will often be intertwined and privilege should not be denied simply on the basis of some commercial involvement  In the present case  however  I am persuaded that Mr Philip was actively engaged in the commercial decisions to such an extent that significant weight must be given to this participation  In many circumstances where in house counsel are employed there will be considerable overlap between commercial participation and legal functions and opinions  As can be seen from the specific rulings below  I am not persuaded that in this proceeding Mr Philip was acting in a legal context or role in relation to a number of the documents in respect of which privilege was claimed  Nor am I persuaded that the privilege claims were based on an independent and impartial legal appraisal   In reliance on the above passages the respondents submitted as follows    A reading of these passages     shows that when Tamberlin J was referring to  independence  his Honour was focussing specifically on the issue of whether the in house lawyer is  in generating the particular communication or document  performing a legal function distinct from  that is  independent of  the commercial activities or management of the client  That is   independence  has to be determined having regard to whether or not the person in question was performing a legal function  rather than a commercial or management function  in making a communication or preparing a document     The decision is not authority for the proposition that an in house lawyer is  prima facie  someone who is not independent of the client  Nor is it authority for the proposition that  where there is some issue about independence in the sense outlined above  none of the documents generated by the in house counsel can attract privilege  Instead  as the analysis of the documents generated by Mr Phillip shows  privilege can still be maintained in all documents generated in a legal context  or which embody or refer or relate to legal advice   I am not persuaded that Tamberlin J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd intended to conflate the criteria for a claim of client legal privilege in the way suggested by the above submissions  The requirement that the legal adviser be independent is principally concerned with the nature of the relationship between the client who claims client legal privilege and the legal adviser  The requirement that the communication be made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation in reasonable prospect is concerned with the object and subject matter of the communication  Each criterion must be satisfied before a claim for client legal privilege will succeed   I therefore turn to consider the evidence concerning the nature of the relationship between OGC  Ms Rich and the respondents  The person directly responsible for the legal advice and other legal services provided by OGC is the holder of the position of General Counsel  At all relevant times the holder of the position of General Counsel has been a partner in PwC  Elizabeth Jane Dibbs  solicitor  was General Counsel for the period from   July   until her retirement in December    At all times while she was General Counsel she held a current practicing certificate and each of the solicitors in OGC also held a current practicing certificate  Ms Dibbs  successor as General Counsel was Meredith Kim Beattie  solicitor  Prior to joining PwC on   February   Ms Beattie had been a partner in the legal firm Blake Dawson Waldron for almost   years  She has maintained her practicing certificate as General Counsel and each of the solicitors in OGC continues to hold a practicing certificate   I accept the evidence of Ms Dibbs and Ms Beattie concerning the general functioning of OGC  Their evidence demonstrated that OGC operates as a separate functional unit with PwC  Both Ms Dibbs and Ms Beattie have regarded it as essential that OGC operate on a professional basis  providing professional legal advice and services to PwC with the same level of objectivity as would external lawyers  Separate files are opened within OGC and marked accordingly  Working documents and current files are either kept in a separate and secure OGC area or in lawyers  offices capable of being locked  OGC is separately located on an administrative floor away from the business units of PwC  Neither Ms Dibbs nor Ms Beattie has held any management or executive positions at PwC  nor have any of the other solicitors in OGC  Nonetheless  Ms Howard  the Deputy General Counsel  has fulfilled the role of secretary to the Board of partners and was  perhaps is  a member of the Partnership Amendment Review Committee  In both capacities Ms Howard s role has been to provide professional legal advice and legal services and incidental administrative services such as preparing agendas and collating papers citedTelstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications  Information Technology and

Technology and the Arts  No     FCA      Telstra    at     Graham J has more recently adopted the same approach in Telstra at    In Telstra his Honour concluded at     that as no evidence had been adduced going to the independence of the relevant internal legal advisers no sufficient claim for legal professional privilege had been made  I reject the submission of Ms Rich that the respondents in this case have similarly adduced no real evidence going to the independence of OGC  I refer below to the evidence touching on the independence of OGC citedThe Queen  Brooke and Another  v Parole Board and Others   EWHC    Admin  The content of the requirement that a legal adviser be independent is understandably less stringent than the requirement that  for example  a judge be independent  However  it is informed by the same notions of absence of fear or favour  The concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked   The Queen  Brooke and Another  v Parole Board and Others   EWHC    Admin  at    An independent legal adviser is one who can bring a disinterested mind to bear on the subject matter of the legal advice  In the words of Brennan J in Waterhouse   what is required is a legal adviser who is able to be  professionally detached  in giving the advice   Ms Rich submitted  in effect  that  a  the independence of legal advice provided by OGC could not rise above the independence of the person who holds the position of General Counsel because that person supervises  and carries responsibility for  the work of OGC  and  b  since at all relevant times General Counsel has been a partner in PwC  OGC s legal advice has not been independent because General Counsel has been both legal adviser and client  I have not found it necessary to form a concluded view as to the validity of the second part of this broad submission although the first part seems to me to be correct  For present purposes it is sufficient for me to reach a view on whether  having regard to the nature of the dispute between Ms Rich and PwC that forms the subject matter of this proceeding  the relationship between OGC and PwC was a professional relationship which secured OGC s advice an independent character notwithstanding that General Counsel  and one other senior solicitor in OGC  were partners in PwC citedWaterford v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii

access to their legal advisers  Whether in any particular case the relationship is such as to give rise to the privilege will be a question of fact  It must be a professional relationship which secures to the advice an independent character notwithstanding the employment   Brennan J in Waterford similarly stressed the need for the legal adviser to be independent at p   where his Honour said    The purpose of legal professional privilege is to facilitate the seeking and giving of legal advice and thereby to ensure that the law be applied and litigation be properly conducted     If the purpose of the privilege is to be fulfilled  the legal adviser must be competent and independent  Competent  in order that the legal advice be sound and the conduct of litigation be efficient  independent  in order that the personal loyalties  duties or interests of the adviser should not influence the legal advice which he gives or the fairness of his conduct of litigation on behalf of his client  If a legal adviser is incompetent to advise or to conduct litigation or if he is unable to be professionally detached in giving advice or in conducting litigation  there is an unacceptable risk that the purpose for which privilege is granted will be subverted   Citations omitted     I interpolate that no issue of incompetence arises in this case   Although Brennan J expressed a narrower view than Mason and Wilson JJ on the question of when legal professional privilege attaches to confidential professional communications between government agencies and salaried legal officers  their Honours were in agreement as to the need in every case for the legal adviser to be  independent   see also Deane J at p    See also Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd v Customs and Excise Commissioners  No       QB   per Lord Denning MR at     I do not understand the other members of the High Court in Waterford to have suggested a different rationale for the requirement of independence from that identified by Brennan J in the above passage  His Honour s reference to professional detachment is consistent with the ordinary meaning of  independent   The Macquarie Dictionary  online version  relevantly defines  independent  in the following ways         not influenced by others in matters of opinion  conduct  etc  thinking or acting for oneself  an independent person      not subject to another s authority or jurisdiction  autonomous  free      not influenced by the thought or action of others  independent research           The Oxford English Dictionary defines  independent  in a comparable way
