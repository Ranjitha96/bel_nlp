G S Technology Pty Ltd v Brisbane City Council   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredStack v Brisbane City Council   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As far as I can see  the Council defended the proceedings upon the basis of its further amended defence and cross claim filed on   August    ex JFW   to Ms Whiting s affidavit  notwithstanding the fact that such pleading was delivered prior to the further amended and consolidated statement of claim filed on   October    Although  in that document  the applicants relied upon two patents  the Council s defence related only to patent    the  previous patent   It seems that the previous proceedings originally concerned the previous patent  whilst action No QG   of   involved a similar claim based on petty patent    See Stack v Brisbane City Council   FCA   at         Both petty patents were based upon patent application   which  in turn  was based upon two provisional applications  PK   and PK    The temporal history of these documents was as follows      August     provisional application PK   filed     March     provisional application PK   filed     August     patent application   filed     August     petty patent application   filed     January     petty patent   issued     February     petty patent application   filed     August     petty patent   issued   Shortly before the trial of the previous proceedings  the applicants sought to consolidate them with action No QG   of    Consolidation was granted  However the trial which followed was  as Cooper J held  only concerned with the previous patent  It seems that for present purposes only the previous patent and application   are relevant consideredStack v Brisbane City Council   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Council denied the validity of the previous patent and denied that it had exploited  or would exploit the alleged invention  This latter allegation appears to have involved a denial that the relevant water meter assemblies were within any claim in the previous patent  By its cross claim the Council sought revocation of the previous patent  Its grounds were said to appear in particulars of objection which do not appear in Ms Whiting s affidavit  However the grounds ventilated at the trial appear from the reasons for judgment   Stack v Brisbane City Council   FCA   and from the reasons of the Full Court   Stack v Davies Shephard Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA    One ground of invalidity was that neither Stack nor GST was entitled to the patent because Stack was not the sole inventor consideredStack v Davies Shephard Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Council denied the validity of the previous

HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The present motion depends solely upon a plea of res judicata  Issue estoppel is not raised  The difference between the two defences was addressed in the reasons of the majority of the High Court  Gibbs CJ  Mason and Aickin JJ  in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   as follows     The distinction between res judicata  in England called  cause of action estoppel  and issue estoppel was expressed by Dixon J  in Blair v  Curran     in these terms   In the first the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has in the former proceedings passed into judgment  so that it is merged and has no longer an independent existence  while in the second  for the purpose of some other claim or cause of action  a state of fact or law is alleged or denied the existence of which is a matter necessarily decided by the prior judgment  decree or order       The distinction was restated by Fullagar J  in his dissenting judgment in Jackson v  Goldsmith       His Honour expressed the rule as to res judicata by saying   where an action has been brought and judgment has been entered in that action  no other proceedings can thereafter be maintained on the same cause of action  This rule is not  to my mind  correctly classified under the heading of estoppel at all  It is a broad rule of public policy based on the principles expressed in the maxims  interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium  and  nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa     His Honour went on to discuss issue estoppel  citing the comment of Dixon J  in Blair v  Curran       A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue  so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or other privies     The Council does not presently rely on the extended notion of estoppel for which the decision in Anshun is authority   At par   of its written submissions  the Council identifies the various elements necessary to establish its plea of res judicata       a  the judgment was a final judgment on the causes of action it addressed  The fact that there are some other causes of action yet to be litigated in that action does not change the status of the judgment  a fortiori given the Court s separation of issues  by order  in the earlier proceedings           b  it was a judgment on the merits  following a trial           c  there was relevantly an identity of parties the present Applicant was an applicant in the previous proceedings and the present Respondent was one of the respondents  The relevant cause of action was pursued against the present Respondent  Other causes of action were pursued against other respondents       d  The causes of action were the same in each proceeding        For present purposes  elements  c  and  d  are of primary relevance   For present purposes it may be accepted that the Council is an authority of the kind contemplated in s   and that it has engaged in  or authorized conduct which amounts to exploitation of the invention as disclosed in the current patents  The Council s submission is that the question of GST s entitlement to remuneration for such exploitation was determined against it in the previous proceedings  This submission seems to depend upon the proposition that a patentee s rights pursuant to Ch   are derived from the  invention  rather than from the relevant patent  The chapter certainly contemplates exploitation of an invention prior to grant of a patent and the fixing of the terms for such exploitation  including remuneration  In the course of argument the parties identified numerous difficulties in understanding the operation of the chapter  In the end  they may not matter for present purposes  but I will set out my understanding of the chapter and say a little about comparable legislation in the United Kingdom citedN V Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken   Anor v Mirabella International Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Such a manner of new manufacture may not necessarily be a patentable invention under the Act  See the decision of the High Court in N V Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken   Anor v Mirabella International Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Other requirements of the Act must also be satisfied  The inclusion in the definition of an  alleged  invention is also relevant  It is arguable that s   contemplates remuneration for exploitation of an invention which is not patentable  However such an interpretation seems unlikely  The notion of remuneration for exploitation implies some recognizable  right  in the invention which is protected or recognized by the Act  An applicant may  prior to grant  have a right to such grant and a right to assign  but it is difficult to see how Crown use could  absent s    infringe  such rights  The primary rights conferred by the Act are those conferred by s   and supporting sections such as those contained in Ch    Those rights are conferred upon patentees  If an applicant has  prior to grant  any rights in connection with exploitation of the invention  they are inchoate  Infringement before grant may be actionable after grant because the patent will probably have retrospective effect pursuant to ss   and    As the Act confers no rights in connection with the exploitation of a non patentable invention  it seems unlikely that s   does so  Of course the parties may agree terms of exploitation upon a mistaken belief as to the patentability of an invention  but this case concerns legal rights and obligations  not freedom of contract   As I have pointed out  the section does not expressly confer power to determine whether a patent is valid or whether an application is likely to result in a valid grant  Nor does it expressly authorize an enquiry as to whether there has been exploitation of an invention  This suggests that it assumes acceptance by the parties of the validity of any patent or anticipated patent and that the relevant authority s conduct or proposed conduct amounts  or will amount to exploitation  On the other hand s   empowers a patentee  but not an applicant  to apply for a declaration as to exploitation and an exploiting authority to counter claim for revocation   Whilst it would be impossible for anybody to commence proceedings concerning the validity of a patent in advance of grant  it would be possible to seek to determine entitlement to a grant  However proceedings of that kind would compromise the Commissioner s power and duty to grant patents and might lead to embarrassing results  Proceedings as to infringement in advance of grant might also pose problems  It is presumably for this reason that in a slightly different context  a declaration under Part   of Ch   may not be made prior to grant  s   consideredSingh v Singh   LR   Ind App   To put the matter in a slightly different way  it might be said that in the previous proceedings it was determined that Stack was not individually entitled to a grant pursuant to application   and that GST had not derived a valid patent from him  That says nothing concerning the entitlement of Stack and Grieves jointly  or GST claiming through them  Some support for this proposition is to be found in the decision of the Privy Council in Singh v Singh   LR   Ind App    In that case  it was held that dismissal of a claim for want of a necessary plaintiff  a joint claimant  did not justify a plea of res judicata in subsequent proceedings by all necessary plaintiffs  That decision concerned procedural matters  namely the joinder of necessary parties  The decision in the previous proceedings was not based on procedural considerations but on the absence of substantive rights  Nonetheless any different result in the present case would mean that if Grieves were to claim  he could not join Stack as an applicant  Presumably  he might join him as a respondent and  in any event  would presumably hold the benefit of any judgment on trust for the two of them  Such an unlikely result suggests that the better view is that Stack would not be prevented from claiming with Grieves as joint applicants  and that GST may claim through them jointly   There is another approach to the question which leads to the same result  At par   in Spencer Bower  Turner   Handley  The Doctrine of Res Judicata  rd edition  the learned author observes     There is substantial authority that there can be no res judicata in a changing situation  consideredMills v Cooper     QB   Various authorities are cited in support of the proposition  It is necessary to refer to only three of them  In Mills v Cooper     QB   at   a divisional court considered a prosecution in which it was alleged that a particular person was a gypsy  that term being taken to mean  not a person of the Romany race  but a person leading a nomadic life with no fixed employment and with no fixed abode  At   Diplock LJ said     Once it is recognized that being a gipsy  sic  is not an unalterable status but depends upon the way of life which a person is leading at any particular time  it is plain that the incorrectness of the assertion made in the previous proceedings is not inconsistent with the correctness of the assertion made in the proceedings now under appeal  The justices accordingly would not have been right in holding that the prosecution were not entitled to  or were estopped from asserting that the defendant was a gipsy  sic  on March     and from proving it if they can  consideredCarl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner   Keeler Ltd  No     AC   Similarly  in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner   Keeler Ltd  No     AC   the House of Lords was concerned with the question of whether a local authority  the council of Gera  was the legal representative of a German corporation at a particular date  In earlier proceedings in West Germany it had been held that the council was not authorized to represent the corporation  At   Lord Reid observed     The second requirement for res judicata is identity of subject matter  As to this  it has become common to distinguish between cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel  There is certainly no cause of action estoppel here  The question before the German court was whether the Council of Gera were the legal representatives of the Stiftung at one date  The question here is whether at a different date the solicitors had the authority of the Stiftung to raise this action  An answer  yes or no  to the first question does not necessarily imply a similar answer to the second  consideredO Donel v Commissioner for Road Transport and Tramways   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The present motion depends solely upon a plea of res judicata  Issue estoppel is not raised  The difference between the two defences was addressed in the reasons of the majority of the High Court  Gibbs CJ  Mason and Aickin JJ  in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   as follows     The distinction between res judicata  in England called  cause of action estoppel  and issue estoppel was expressed by Dixon J  in Blair v  Curran     in these terms   In the first the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has in the former proceedings

     A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue  so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or other privies     Finally  the learned author refers to the decision of the High Court in O Donel v Commissioner for Road Transport and Tramways   HCA         CLR   at   where Evatt J said     The argument involves and is based upon the fallacy that  where an issue between A and B relates to a state of things which is capable of subsequent alteration  the conclusive determination in A s favour of that state of things as at one day plus conclusive proof that up to a later day there has been no alteration of such state of things establishes in A s favour as against B and estoppel as to the state of things existing at the later day       At     Latham CJ said     Now it cannot possibly be said that the Supreme Court  by a judgment relating only to a period which ended on  th February  thereby made any direct or actual decision or determination as to any matter or state of affairs whatever which existed at a later date  That judgment did create an estoppel as to one proposition but that estoppel cannot operate to establish by estoppel another proposition which follows from the former proposition only when that proposition is combined with others the establishment of which depends upon evidence or assumption   Whilst the language of estoppel is used  those considerations should lead to a similar conclusion in the case of res judicata  In the present case the finding that GST was not entitled to remuneration for exploitation at the time of the previous proceedings did not preclude the possibility that it might  at some later stage  derive such a right  This it did by obtaining the current patents   In the circumstances the motion must be dismissed with costs       I certify that the preceding forty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein
