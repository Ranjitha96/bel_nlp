SZMXS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedCabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFirst  the Tribunal is under no unqualified duty to obtain a translation of all material that a claimant may seek to rely upon  Thus  in Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Wilcox  Whitlam and Marshall JJ thus observed        There may be occasions in which the RRT is under an obligation to obtain a translation of a particular document which is in a foreign language and whose relevance has been explained to the RRT  However  the primary judge was correct when he said  as a general proposition  at   that the RRT  is not required to translate material in a foreign language  or  consider large volumes of material whose relevance is not explained   Its failure to do so will not mean that it failed to consider or review an application in accordance with s  of the Act or s  of the Act  if applicable  when it has otherwise dealt with all material considered by it to be germane to its task of reviewing the decision of the delegate  In the present case the additional material was voluminous  including   textbooks in Spanish  and its relevance unexplained       To the extent that an occasion may arise as to whether a translation of materials should be obtained  such occasions may be confined to securing the translation of   a particular document    There is no general requirement to secure the translation of   voluminous   material  Indeed  there may be no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to secure the translation of even a particular document  But  if a document that has not been translated is to be relied upon  there may be a necessity to inform a claimant that the Tribunal will not take that document into account because a translation has not been furnished  X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA       FCR    There in issue was a diary obtained from Burma  The Tribunal affirmed the decision under review and concluded that it could not take the diary into account as it had not been translated  Moore J there observed        The point addressed by the Full Court in Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   was whether the Tribunal was under a general obligation to obtain for itself a translation of documents furnished by an applicant  The issue in this appeal is slightly different  I do not suggest that the Tribunal was obliged to obtain a translation of the diary itself nor that it was obliged to defer deciding the appellant s application until the appellant had provided a translation  What it did not do was inform the appellant that it would not take into account the contents of the diary because a translation had not been furnished  Generally  an applicant would be likely to know what a document relied on said and its significance  Both matters could be explained by the applicant if comment was invited before the document was effectively rejected  The Tribunal is not bound by any  best evidence  rule and can rely on secondary evidence  as it is described in curial proceedings  of the contents of documents  see s    Moreover  it is open to the Tribunal to request  as it routinely does  that an applicant provide translations of documents on which he or she relies particularly if the applicant says the document is significant or the Tribunal believes it may be  If a translated document provided by an applicant bears upon the claim of the applicant and the Tribunal is to have regard to it  the Tribunal can either accept the translation or independently seek to verify its accuracy  It is improbable that the statutory scheme would require the Tribunal ordinarily to obtain a translation if none was provided  after invitation  by the applicant  see Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   However  equally  it is unlikely that the statutory scheme authorised the Tribunal to disregard the contents of a document relied on by an applicant simply because it was not in English  when the applicant was not put on notice that the contents would be disregarded without a translation being provided  before the decision was made to reject the application for a protection visa       Both Gray and Moore JJ concluded that the Tribunal could not decline to consider the document simply because it was not in English  Gray J further found that the present case was one where a translation should have been obtained  His Honour relevantly concluded            The appellant s diary was the only document tendered  It related only to    Its relevance to the issue of the appellant s involvement in political activities in   was explained  in the sense that the appellant had submitted  and the Tribunal understood  that this was what the diary was relevant to   This was an occasion on which the Tribunal was  under an obligation to obtain a translation of a particular document which is in a foreign language and whose relevance has been explained  to it  To fail to do so was to act without power  because the Migration Act should be construed as not permitting the Tribunal to distinguish against the appellant on the ground of his race  language  or national or social origin  by refusing to take into account a document of his making because it is not in the English language  It is one thing for the Tribunal to request that documents be translated into English  It is quite another to refuse to take into account a document that is asserted to be relevant to a specific issue on the ground that it has not been so translated       O Loughlin J dissented  In doing so  however  His Honour observed that    t here is room for a variety of views   so much so that I do not think it appropriate for this Court to lay down inflexible guidelines     FCA   at       FCR at   referred toCabal v United Mexican States  No     FCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe present appeal is thus not the occasion to give any detailed consideration to those circumstances in which an opportunity to be heard or the requirement to take into account a consideration relevant to a decision to be made may embrace a requirement to have documents relevant to a claimant s case translated from a foreign language into English  Not unexpectedly  there has been no examination in the present proceeding of any more generally expressed requirement for evidence in civil or administrative proceedings to be in English  Nor has there been any real examination of such guidance as may be gleaned from those cases   such as extradition cases   where documents supplied in support of an extradition request may need to be translated  e g  Cabal v United Mexican States  No     FCA   at   to     FCA         ALR   at   to   per French J  But considerations which may readily be identified as relevant to any such requirement extend to such matters as  the number of documents in issue  the relevance of those documents to the claims being advanced  the ability of a claimant to otherwise advance his case and any prejudice that may be suffered if documents are not translated  the availability and ability of an interpreter present during the course of a hearing before the Tribunal to translate particular documents or particular parts of documents identified by a claimant as relevant to his claims  and the financial ability of a claimant to himself pay for the translation of documents and the ability of the documents to be translated by any community funded agency   No jurisdictional error  it is considered  is exposed simply by reason of the fact that a claimant seeks to rely upon documents written in a foreign language but not translated  More needs to be established  In the present appeal  no jurisdictional error is disclosed by the fact that numerous newspaper articles were not translated and were returned to the now Appellant at the conclusion of the hearing  The fundamental difficulty confronting the Appellant before the Federal Magistrates Court   and this Court on Appeal   is the adverse findings as to credit made by the Tribunal  Those were findings of fact  however  entrusted by the legislature to the Tribunal  No jurisdictional error is disclosed in the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded or in its reasons for decision citedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI   HCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn some circumstances it may be accepted that a Tribunal should make inquiries into aspects of a claimant s case  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI   HCA   at       HCA       ALR   at    Whatever may be the extent of that duty and the circumstances in which it arises  in the present proceeding it may be accepted that inquiries were in fact made  The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus record in relevant part the following      DFAT inquiries made at  Gujarat Today            The Tribunal requested DFAT on   August   to make inquiries in regard to the newspaper which the applicant claimed to write for  DFAT responded as follows          Gujarat Today is a non partisan newspaper covering political and social issues  It is run by reputed NGO  Lok Hit Sarvajanik Trust which was established in   to bridge the  communal divide  caused by widespread religious unrest in that year  The Trust is managed by the Muslim community  and in addition to the newspaper is also involved  sic  charitable work such as free medical treatment camps in slum areas  educational  sic  for the poor  rehabilitation services to those affected

this final Ground of Appeal should be rejected is that  in the present proceeding  the now Appellant had been expressly invited by the Tribunal to draw its attention to any particular document that he specifically sought to rely upon  He apparently declined that invitation  The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus record that it asked the Appellant   whether there was anything he particularly wanted to refer it to within the large amount of material submitted       And that arose  it is to be recalled  in a context where the now Appellant had been requested to provide documents to the Tribunal in advance of the hearing and yet only produced many of the documents on the day of the hearing itself  A claimant cannot complain of any inadequacy of an opportunity to be heard  or of any failure to take into account a particular matter  in circumstances where he produces a vast number of documents at a hearing before the Tribunal and fails to avail himself of an opportunity to draw the Tribunal s attention to a particular matter or matters contained within those documents  Even where a document is not translated  there may be no error where the Tribunal in fact takes into account a point sought to be made by a claimant in reliance upon untranslated documents  SZLSW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at       ALD   at    Where the   gist   of a document

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per Moore J affirmedSZMXS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe Application was subsequently amended on   January    The Amended Application set forth the Grounds upon which it was advanced as follows  without alteration      Ground one          The Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration  and failed to give genuine  realistic  and proper consideration  to a central aspect of the Applicant s claim  which was that the Applicant worked as a journalist for the Gujarat daily  and published numerous articles with his byline attached  which supported his claims to be a Muslim activist  targeted by the authorities in India   Tickner v Bropho   FCA         FCR     at              Particulars              A simple inquiry of the editor of the Gujarat Daily  as requested by the Applicant  would have revealed that the Applicant had worked for the Gujarat Daily as claimed              The Tribunal s own request that DFAT in India verify that the form of the press card held by the Applicant was consistent with the press cards issued by the Gujarat Daily newspaper had not been complied with  and could simply have been followed up              The form of DFAT s response to the Tribunal request that it attempt to verify these claims central to the Applicant s case was sufficient to alert the Tribunal to an obvious obscurity or problem with the inquiries made by DFAT  the source was clearly either unco operative or not sufficiently informed          Ground two          The Tribunal failed to comply with section   of the Migration Act     and failed to give the applicant a proper opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and present evidence and argument in relation to the issues upon which the case turned in refusing to accept the tender of articles written by the Applicant in the Gujarat Daily newspaper  which were relevant because they could easily have been authenticated through DFAT in India       The Minister was called upon to show cause why relief should not be granted on these Grounds   The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the Application before it on   June   SZMXS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    Before the Federal Magistrates Court the now Appellant was represented by Counsel  A Notice of Appeal was thereafter filed in this Court on   July    The Grounds of Appeal provide as follows  without alteration  In term of false case the Respondent said that there is no charges against appellant  There is no basis of this as such the Respondent made an error in making this decision The Respondent committed jurisdictional error of LAW by failing to consider an integer of Appellant s claim   a  that Appellant no provide documents which was relied in making the decision  b  about enquiries to the GUJRAT DAILY employment  The Respondent made irrelevant consideration in deciding the case and Respondent founding was based on wrong footing and no basis in making this decision The Tribunal thus made some inquiries  No jurisdictional error is exposed by the Tribunal not making further inquiries or not causing further inquiries to be made  Nor is an error exposed in the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate in rejecting arguments founded upon any alleged failure to make inquiries    FMCA   at   to    As with the previous Ground of Appeal   this Ground too suffers from the defect that it does not identify any appellable error said to have been committed by the Federal Magistrate  But it  too  can be construed as a contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in rejecting a comparable argument with respect to the Tribunal s decision  So construed  the Ground was understood to relate to the myriad newspaper articles sought to be relied upon by the now Appellant when appearing before the Tribunal  Although the Ground refers to the Tribunal   refusing to accept the tender of articles   that may not be an accurate manner in which to describe what happened citedSZNSC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAlthough leave may be granted to rely upon an argument raised for the first time on appeal  leave should not too readily be granted   especially where it is not evident that the grant of leave is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice  SZNSC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    In refusing leave in the present proceeding to depart from the manner in which the case was advanced before the Federal Magistrate  particular reliance has been placed upon the fact that the now Appellant was previously represented by Counsel and the apparent lack of merit in the argument now sought to be advanced  Although the second Ground of Appeal suffers from the defect that it alleges no error said to have been committed by the Federal Magistrate  it has been construed as an argument that the Federal Magistrate erred in rejecting a comparable argument  So construed  it is a Ground without merit consideredX v Minister
