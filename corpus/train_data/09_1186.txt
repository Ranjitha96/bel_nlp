MZXTA v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB     ALR  The Federal Magistrate was also of the view that the finding that the appellant had engaged in delaying tactics did not constitute   Wednesbury     Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation     KB   unreasonableness in the sense that the Tribunal had acted unreasonably in not making enquiries of Dr Crimmins  The Federal Magistrate said there was no obligation on the Tribunal to embark on an open ended enquiry as to the fitness of an applicant to appear applying Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB     ALR   at par    The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal s invitation in accordance with s   had been meaningful  At   of the judgment  the Federal Magistrate concluded       The primary reason for rejecting the applicant s claims was their inconsistency with the evidence  The issue of whether the applicant was medically unfit to attend a hearing or provide responses to s  A letters was a matter of subsidiary importance  and the Tribunal dealt with the matter in a reasonable manner  By a notice of appeal filed on   October   the appellant appealed from the decision of the Federal Magistrate on the grounds that the Federal Magistrate erred in       a  Improperly construing or misdirecting itself as to the appellant s first ground of review as seeking to challenge a finding of fact by the Tribunal that  the applications for extensions of time and rescheduling of hearings were delaying tactics           b  Failing to properly apply sections   and  A of the Migration Act in determining whether the Tribunal failed to properly exercise its discretion to reschedule the applicant s appearance before it  or from delaying its discretion on the review to enable the applicant s appearance before it to be rescheduled          c  Failing to properly apply the   Wednesbury   principle to the Tribunal s decision in that the Tribunal in arriving at the Tribunal s decision acted so unreasonably in failing to make limited inquiries with Dr Bernard Crimmins on a critical issue which the Tribunal knew or ought to reasonably know was readily available that no reasonable decision maker would have proceeded to make a decision without such information           d  Failing to properly apply sections   and  A of the Migration Act in that the Tribunal failed to take such steps so as to provide a real or meaningful opportunity to the appellant to respond to the s  A letters or to attend a hearing to give evidence and present arguments pursuant to s   of the Migration Act   citedPrasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe appellant submitted that ground  c  of his Notice of Appeal was made out as the Tribunal failed to make enquiries of Dr Crimmins  The appellant submitted that the present circumstances were  exceptional  so as to render such a failure a ground of jurisdictional error because the ensuing decision was  unreasonable  in the Wednesbury sense  The appellant relied on the decision of Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   for the proposition that a decision maker s failure to obtain important information on a critical issue which the decision maker knows or ought to reasonably know is readily available  can be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would proceed to decision without making such inquiry  However  it must be remembered that in that case Wilcox J said at          The circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to inquire are  I think  strictly limited  It is no part of the duty of the decision maker to make the applicant s case for him  It is not enough that the court find that the sounder course would have been to make inquiries  citedAzzi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI do not consider that the present circumstances fall into the category of a rare and exceptional circumstance which is an exception to the well accepted proposition that the Tribunal is not bound to initiate or make its own enquiries  Azzi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le    supra  at      The Tribunal was under no obligation to call Dr Crimmins and clarify the appellant s capacity to attend the hearing or respond to questions having regard to the content of his letter and the previous communications to the appellant and his solicitor  This was not a matter which constituted  some obvious omission or obscurity that needs to be resolved before a decision is made  Videto v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   per Toohey J citedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe appellant accepted that there is no general obligation on the Tribunal to initiate enquiries or to make out an appellant s case but submitted that there was authority for the limited proposition that  in certain rare or exceptional circumstances  the Tribunal s failure to enquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure may render the ensuing decision unreasonable in the sense used in Wednesbury  supra   The appellant relied on Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le   FCA         FCR    In Le   the primary decision maker relied on a mistranslated version of the applicant s statement  The Tribunal s failure to allude to this and failure to make enquiries of the relevant department gave rise to a jurisdictional error  The circumstances in the present case are quite different  Given the background of the communications between the Tribunal and the appellant s representative prior to Dr Crimmins  letter and its contents  it was not unreasonable for the Tribunal to assume that Dr Crimmins had said all that he could relevantly say and that there was no point in making any enquiry of Dr Crimmins  I do not consider that the present circumstances fall into the category of a rare and exceptional circumstance which is an exception to the well accepted proposition that the Tribunal is not bound to initiate or make its own enquiries  Azzi v Minister for
