Turnbull was the subject of  or was contributed to by  legal advice from Williams   Hughes let alone did it  put in issue     advice received  Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins     FCR   at    However  it does indicate that instructions were given to join Mr Turnbull  And as the joinder motion filed on   August   by Williams   Hughes illustrates  those instructions were acted on   The challenge to the privilege claim is put on four discrete bases  They are that     i  by putting in issue his state of mind in applying to join Mr Turnbull  Mr Gurtler has waived privilege in respect of that matter  issue waiver     ii  by disclosing he instructed his solicitors  Williams   Hughes  to apply to join Mr Turnbull  he has waived privilege in those instructions  disclosure waiver   iii  there is a prima facie case that the substantial purposes of the legal advice was for Hillcrest s own purposes  and hence was not subject to any privilege claimed by Mr Gurtler  Hillcrest pursuing its own purposes  and   iv  there is a prima facie case that the communications with Williams   Hughes concerning the joinder were in pursuance of a deliberately improper purpose and as such were not protected by legal professional privilege  the fraud improper purpose exception    What is notable of issue waiver cases  as the Full Court indicated in Rio Tinto  at   is their fact specific character  Nonetheless  observations in that case on the joint judgment of Kiefel and Finn JJ in Spalvins are appropriate to the present matter  In Spalvins Kiefel J and I said  at        The usual type of case said to illustrate issue waiver at common law is one in which  in order to establish a particular right  claim  or defence a party who previously has been legally advised  or has provided advice  needs to show that the advice so given did  or did not  have a particular character  for example that it was or was not negligent where the claim is for professional negligence against the adviser  see Kershaw v Whelan     WLR   that it was not based on full information or was not meaningful  in an undue influence claim  see Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar   AC   at     see also Bester v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd     NSWR   and Brusewitz v Brown   NZLR   or that it did not address or properly address a matter which  if addressed or properly addressed  would defeat or call into

  SR  NSW    Hongkong Bank of Australia Ltd v Murphy     VR   Pickering v Edmunds     SASR    In other words the cases are ones in which  in the substantive proceeding brought  the privilege holder has put in issue the very advice received  We observe in passing that it is questionable whether advice can properly be said to be in issue in a proceeding merely because it may be relevant to an issue in it  see Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc v The Home Indemnity Company   rd Cir     F  d    at   save  perhaps  where the proceeding is between client and legal adviser and the advice is relevant to the adviser s defence of that proceeding  see Lillicrap v Nalder   Son     WLR     All ER     The Full Court in Rio Tinto said of this  at            this correctly summarises the effect of previous authorities  such as Thomason  United States Surgical and Benecke   Referring to the observation of Kirby J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd   HCA         ALR   at     HCA

waived privilege      Although the Full Court was necessarily guided by the authorities prior to Mann   there is little  if anything  in the passage quoted above that would require modification to take account of Mann   It is plain enough that the majority in Mann also saw the  issue waiver  cases as a species of waiver  to which the same basic principle applied  Their Honours  analysis in Spalvins emphasises  as does the majority in Mann   that waiver comes about because the privilege holder s conduct is inconsistent with the continued confidentiality of the communication because he or

of the High Court in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   require some qualification   Given that the privilege issue arises here on a pre trial motion it is governed by the common law of legal professional privilege  not by the provisions of the Evidence Act    Cth   Issue waiver  a form of implied waiver of privilege  is governed by the principle of  inconsistency  stated in the majority judgment of the High Court in Mann v Carnell at      Waiver may be express or implied  Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect  When an affirmative answer is given to such a question  it is sometimes said that waiver is  imputed by operation of law   This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences  even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege     What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of fairness  perceive  between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large   The Full Court in Rio Tinto said of this  at            this correctly summarises the effect of previous authorities  such as Thomason  United States Surgical and Benecke   Referring to the observation of Kirby J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd   HCA         ALR   at     HCA       ALJR   at     HCA   that a mere reference to legal advice will not amount to disclosure  the Spalvins court found that  for the most part  the ASC had done no more than this and had not

analysis in Spalvins emphasises  as does the majority in Mann   that waiver comes about because the privilege holder s conduct is inconsistent with the continued confidentiality of the communication because he or she has put in issue the character or contents of the communication in pursuing a right or claim   or has created a situation where another party must reasonably do so by way of a defence    Emphasis added  I would add the following which is of some present importance given the first respondent s oral submissions  As the High Court emphasised in Mann v Carnell   it is inconsistency  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large that governs implied waiver   I reject the first respondent s contention   This contention can be disposed of shortly  Mr Gurtler has disclosed the fact of a particular instruction having been given   a fact  moreover  which would reasonably be inferred if no such disclosure had been made from the later filing of a motion to join Mr Turnbull  No disclosure was made of the actual content of the communication made or of any advice given in consequence of it  If a disclosure of this variety could result in the loss of privilege by the calling into question of why the particular procedural step it involved had been taken  the basis of the privilege itself would in my view be seriously weakened   All that the affidavit did is to indicate the nature of the instruction given  It did not reveal the basis of  the terms of  or a  version of  cf Mann v Carnell at   the communication  Mr Gurtler has not acted in a way which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege protects   Finance Now s contention is that there is a prima facie basis for alleging that the substantial purpose of advice provided by Williams   Hughes in respect of which privilege is claimed  was advice to Hillcrest for the purpose of Hillcrest conducting the litigation for its own benefit   The prima facie basis relied upon to demonstrate that the advice was to Hillcrest are     a  the litigation funding agreement and  in particular  the two retainers both of which showed Hillcrest as a client and able to give instructions  and    b  the list of privileged documents shows that  subject to limited exception  Williams   Hughes received correspondence regarding the   July   email and the proposed joinder of Mr Turnbull  from Hillcrest rather than Mr Gurtler himself citedSouthern Equities Corporation Ltd  in liq  v Arthur Anderson   Co     SASR   I set out earlier Mr Gurtler s affidavit evidence concerning his proposed joinder of Mr Turnbull  While his evidence related to the fact that he gave instructions to Williams   Hughes to apply to have Mr Turnbull joined and that instruction was acted upon he did not either expressly or impliedly refer to  let alone put in issue  the character or contents of any communications made to  or by  Williams and Hughes  While Finance Now has put in issue the reasons why Mr Gurtler proposed to join Mr Turnbull and Mr Gurtler has sought to answer that  he has not done so in a fashion which could reasonably relate his reasons for the decision  explicitly or implicitly  to communications made in the lawyer client relationship  Thus he has not engaged in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of lawyer client communications  Whatever was the substance of the communications made by Williams   Hughes to Mr Gurtler and Mr Van Noort which related to the decision to join Mr Turnbull and which are listed in Mr Gurtler s affidavit  there is on the material before me no reasonable grounds for believing that legal advice contributed to that decision  cf Southern Equities Corporation Ltd  in liq  v Arthur Anderson   Co     SASR   at       It has been put on behalf of Mr Gurtler that while the email should neither have been couched in the terms it was nor have been sent at all  all it involved was a sharp practice and demonstrated a lack of commercial probity  cf Southern Equities Corporation at    The email itself indicated that the accounts had been analysed and the conclusion arrived at from that analysis  i e  the accounts were  cracked   It also indicated that the stated conclusion were  in Mr Van Noort s view  supported by the bank statements  This  it is said  is not an allegation of fraud knowingly raised without any basis  A sufficient basis had been given at that stage the matter was not as yet the subject of a pleading and that was enough to dispel the allegation of deliberately improper purpose   My own view is that the email was a disreputable and inflammatory vehicle through which to make imputations against Mr Hambrett and  by implication  Mr Turnbull  This said  the email does not have the particular character ascribed to it by Finance Now  It cannot be said that it lacks any disclosed and proper basis for its core allegation  the accounts are a complete and total fabrication   On this I agree with the submissions made by Mr Gurtler  Yet it is upon the supposed lack of such a basis that the challenge to the claim of legal professional privilege has been made  Reliance  as Finance Now places  on the apparent regularity of the accounts on their face as a foundation for asserting there were prima facie grounds for saying there was no proper basis for the allegations of fraud  simply ignores the basis of the allegation being made  I equally agree that  at the time the allegation was made  i e  prior to the pleading of the alleged fraud  the basis given for the allegation was sufficient to dispel the assertion that it lacked foundation  Whether it proves to be correct or not is not of present concern   I cannot in the circumstances see why Mr Gurtler s alleged failure to withdraw the allegation is in any way of assistance to Finance Now  Nor do I consider he can relevantly be faulted for present purposes for not disavowing the sharp and unauthorised practice of his agent  There is no material before me suggesting Mr Gurtler knew of  and condoned that practice  While  as a matter of reasonable commercial standards  one may have expected some reassurance from Mr Gurtler of appropriate behaviour in  the Federal court action  an action in any event subject to judicial management and scrutiny the lack of this is not  in the circumstances  suggestive of the improper purpose alleged citedFarrow Mortgage Services Pty Ltd  in liq  v Webb     NSWLR   Before dealing directly with the first respondent s contention there is one matter to which I need refer concerning the characterisation of Gurtler Hillcrest relationship for the purposes of legal professional privilege  It relates to common interest privilege  Having regard to their relationship inter se in light of the funding agreement and the common retainer  and of their common interest in the successful prosecution of the litigation and in advice given in relation thereto  I am satisfied that a possibly distinctive form of common interest privilege exists between them in relation to lawyer client communications in the Gurtler

au au cases cth federal ct  html  As to the instruction of lawyers  the funding agreement provided that instructions in the proceedings were to be given by Mr Gurtler  not by Hillcrest  see cl    However and despite the  no oral modification  clause in the agreement  it was open to Mr Gurtler and Hillcrest to vary this if they so wished  see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at         I would note  though  that the funding agreement probably did not preclude Mr Gurtler s use of the agency of Hillcrest in giving instructions in any event   What is clear on the material before me is that  whether or not Hillcrest has acted in strict accordance with the written terms of the funding agreement  the manner of his communication with Williams   Hughes was acquiesced in by Mr Gurtler  This is made clear in his affidavit verifying the list of documents produced  He designedly  as a matter of convenience  had Mr Van Noort deal directly with the lawyers to confirm his instructions or to comment upon their advice in order to enable the lawyers to further advance his case  It is unsurprising that he adopted this course given that as between them Mr Van Noort  as a lawyer  was likely to be more able to make forensic choices than Mr Gurtler  cf Fostif NSWCA at     The   July email was one Mr Van Noort should never have sent  Nonetheless  on its face  and for the purposes of the Finance Now s present contention  it purports to have been in furtherance of the common interests of Mr Gurtler and Hillcrest  Mr Gurtler may have been unaware of its contents  Still he authorised Mr Van Noort s contact with Mr Hambrett  Whatever complaint Mr Gurtler may have had of his agent s conduct a matter between himself and his agent
