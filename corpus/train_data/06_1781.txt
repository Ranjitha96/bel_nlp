Sheikholeslami v Brungs   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedSheikholeslami v Brungs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe applicant  Roya Sheikholeslami  commenced employment with the second respondent  the University of New South Wales  on   June    On   October   whilst still employed  she made a complaint of discrimination occurring over a period of some four years to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  The discrimination was alleged to have been carried out by the first respondent  Michael Brungs  an employee of the second respondent  On   April   the complaint was terminated  On   May   the applicant filed an application  Form   and claim  Form   under s  PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act    Cth  in the Court  On   July   Tamberlin J dismissed the applicant s claim pursuant to both O  A r   and O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   Sheikholeslami v Brungs   FCA    The applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the respondents on a solicitor client basis  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the dismissal of the proceeding and the order for costs  Tamberlin J was the docket judge and had management of the proceeding from its inception  Tamberlin J reserved his decision  having had the benefit of argument from counsel for the respondents and counsel for the applicant  although the applicant had represented herself up to that time  His Honour referred to authority and recognised that dismissal of proceedings on either basis required considerable restraint and would be ordered sparingly  As to O  A r   his Honour applied the principles outlined by the Full Court in Lenijamar Pty Ltd and Others v AGC  Advances  Limited     FCR    His Honour concluded that the history of non compliance by the applicant was such as to indicate an inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the Court and the other party in having the matter ready for trial within an acceptable period  His Honour took the view that the way in which the litigation had been conducted by the applicant rendered it impossible for the respondents to meaningfully address any case against them  There had been a persistent failure to identify any specific incident which had any connection to discrimination  His Honour was also satisfied that the way in which the proceeding had been conducted amounted to an abuse of process under O   r   such that the process was an instrument of injustice or unfairness to the respondents  An order for costs on a solicitor client basis was founded upon the same findings  Counsel for the applicant presented a well constructed argument  It commenced with a detailed examination of the procedural defaults found by Tamberlin J and a submission that there was no proper basis for a number of those findings  Suffice to say that  for the purposes of this application  there is an arguable case that a number of the defaults either did not occur or are explicable  Investigation of those issues by a Full Court would involve considerable time and effort and would involve no issue of principle  Even if established  the result is unlikely to be different  One question of potential importance is whether or not it is arguable that the finding that there had been a persistent failure by the applicant to identify any specific incident which had any connection with discrimination was wrong as that was the most significant basis upon which the decision was made  It is submitted that the material filed by the applicant with her original application to the Court did specify particular instances of discrimination  Upon examination  that material does not specify particular instances of discrimination in the sense used by Tamberlin J  It was submitted that Tamberlin J did not take into account the fact that the Court in these matters is not bound by technicalities or legal form  s  PR of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act      I do not regard the judge as having been concerned with technicalities or legal form but rather with the failure of the applicant to state her case in a manner which could be grappled with by the respondents and dealt with by the Court  It was also submitted that the Court had not taken into account the fact that the applicant had been unrepresented until the notice of motion in question  It was submitted that coping with issues such as particulars  discovery  framing a case and responding to a subpoena place an unrepresented litigant at a significant disadvantage  The difficulties faced by an unrepresented litigant are well understood  but so are the difficulties of a respondent to a claim brought by an unrepresented party who cannot or will not comply with the ordinary rules  The application was hardly precipitate  The proceeding had been on foot for more than   months citedColgate Palmolive Company and Anor v Cussons Pty Limited     FCR  It

Wilcox  Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd and Others  No       FCR    I can see no arguable error of principle in the award of costs on a solicitor client basis  bearing in mind the basis of the order of dismissal  the effect of which was that the proceeding had never been in appropriate form appliedDecor Corporation Pty Ltd and Anor v Dart Industries Inc     FCR  Counsel for the applicant recognised the difficulty of upsetting an interlocutory judgment of this kind concerning matters of practice and procedure by the docket judge having an intimate knowledge of the progress of the case  The normal considerations to be taken into account are       a  whether the judgment is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by a Full Court  and   b  whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong   Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Anor v Dart Industries Inc     FCR     However  the exercise of discretion should not be

citedThe State of Queensland and Anor v JL Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt was submitted that Tamberlin J failed to take into account the fundamental objective of Court process  being to decide cases brought to the Court   The State of Queensland and Anor v JL Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at    The judge was conscious of the need to sparingly exercise the powers that he did and had given the applicant every opportunity of outlining her case  over many months  It is also put that the judge erred in failing to consider the other powers of the Court to sanction non compliance such as the use of costs orders  That argument does not meet the fundamental nature of the problem found by Tamberlin J
