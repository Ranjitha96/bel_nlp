Huang v University of New South Wales   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAB v Adult Multicultural Education Services   VCAT  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VCAT  html  In order to determine whether the contact was sexual harassment within s  A   regard must be had to all the circumstances  The test is an objective one that does not take into account the motivation of the perpetrator or the individual   AB v Adult Multicultural Education Services   VCAT   at       It is relevant that    This was an isolated incident     It took place in a corridor and was a movement in passing     Relations between Mr Huang and Professor Winder both before and after the alleged incident were confined to educational matters     No discomfort was apparent on Ms Huang s part in her dealings with Professor Winder after the alleged incident referred toGauci v Kennedy   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Federal Magistrate Driver considered the evidence in relation to this allegation and rejected it  His Honour gave reasons for that finding  I see no error in his Honour s conclusion  A claim under s  A must be analysed on the basis of the nature or quality of the act  see  for example  Gauci v Kennedy   FCA   at     Irrespective of Ms Huang s present belief that the contact between Professor Winder s hand and her hip constituted sexual harassment  she has not shown that his Honour was in error in concluding  at   that   the contact that occurred between Professor Winder and Ms Huang was accidental and non sexual as they passed in the corridor     Federal Magistrate Driver accepted the respondents  submission that there were two allegations of sexual harassment against Dr Markovic   The first allegation  described by His Honour at   is that in   when he was training a group of students he raised both his hands   with lustfully laughing and moved towards Ms Huang with his arms outstretched    Dr Markovic denied laughing lustfully and denied that he sexually harassed Ms Huang  None of the other students present gave evidence  Federal Magistrate Driver found that Ms Huang embellished this alleged incident over time  During cross examination she added as part of the description that Dr Markovic said as he raised his hands   I ll kill you   or   I would kill you    Ms Huang conceded that Dr Markovic did not engage in any conduct that indicated a sexual interest in her   His Honour concluded that whatever was said was intended as a joke and was not sexual in nature and was not conduct within s  A a  or  b  of the Sex Discrimination Act    The second allegation was that  at some time in late August or September   Dr Markovic made a remark about Ms Huang s marital status  Dr Markovic denied making that remark  Another student present gave evidence and failed to corroborate the allegation  The Federal Magistrate accepted Dr Markovic s denial that he said anything about a need for sex on Ms Huang s part  On that aspect  Driver FM preferred Dr Markovic s evidence and the documentary evidence to Ms Huang s evidence  His Honour noted that one of the other students present at the time but who was not able to be available for cross examination as he was overseas provided some support for Ms Huang s allegation that Dr Markovic made a comment about her marital status  His Honour found that  on the balance of probabilities  that Dr Markovic did make a comment about Ms Huang s age and marital status  An internal University investigation supported the allegation and Dr Markovic had been required to undergo counselling  Federal Magistrate Driver concluded that the remark was   offensive and the remedy appropriate    at     However  his Honour accepted that the comment did not constitute sexual harassment within the meaning of s  A of the Sex Discrimination Act   not being conduct of a sexual nature or pertaining to sexual activity or attraction or relationships  Accordingly  his Honour rejected the allegations of sexual harassment against Dr Markovic  Having rejected the allegations of sexual harassment against Dr Markovic and Professor Winder  Driver FM found at   that there was nothing to support any other alleged act of sex discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act    In her complaint to HREOC Ms Huang said that when Dr Markovic was talking about broken glass   he raised his both hands and came to me like to catch me  but I stepped back and avoided the contact    She also said that Dr Markovic sometimes talked about sex in front of male students and that he said on one occasion that she had not been married but needed sex and that she was over   near   but still had pimples on her face   Ms Huang characterises the second incident as being a   sexual comment about my marital status  my age and my sexual life that I was not married that I needed sex and I was over   but I still had pimples on my face  in which he suggested and induced the male students made sex relationship with me    This  she submits  constitutes sexual harassment   Ms Huang raises a number of matters concerning her PhD in her amended notice of appeal under the heading of  sexual harassment   These were not the subject of complaint to HREOC under this heading and it is not clear how they constitute sexual harassment within the meaning of the Sex Discrimination Act   They relate to matters such as the provision of assistance and training  her research and the provision of computers   Ms Huang also says in her amended notice of appeal that Dr Markovic indicated   that  Dr Markovic  would compel obedience from me or conquer me for his sexual favours to me  his support of my PhD would be conditional upon my provision of sexual favours  he made sexual comments and induced his male students sexually harassed me    She explains that when he said   I ll kill you   it meant that   he would compel obedience from me or conquer me for his sexual favours to me     Ms Huang is adamant that Dr Markovic said   I ll kill you    Federal Magistrate Driver implicitly accepted at   that such a comment may have been made  His Honour noted  and Ms Huang repeats  that Dr Markovic did not engage in sexual harassment but indicated a sexual interest in her  She says in her amended notice of appeal that Dr Markovic   did not touch me and did not  directly through his mouth  invite me for a social occasion     His Honour concluded that  in the circumstances  the conduct complained of was more likely to have been intended as a joke rather than being sexual in nature  While his Honour accepted that Dr Markovic laughed  and Ms Huang repeats that it was a   lustful   laugh  his Honour did not accept what was clearly a subjective interpretation of the laugh   It is difficult to see how one can accurately describe a laugh as   lustful   or how that description by Ms Huang is sufficient to establish sexual harassment within the meaning of the Sex Discrimination Act    Much of the detail raised by Ms Huang in support of her claim of sexual harassment by Dr Markovic involves her reading a sexual connotation into things that he said or wrote  For example  she says that his saying   I ll kill you   was a result of   his playing sexual game with me   and that   Dr Markovic was so drunk of his sexual favours to me that he really wanted to  kill  me  but he could not  kill  me in front of people  and he would  kill  me in some time after the talking  He would  kill  me meant he would compel obedience from me or conquer me for his sexual favours to me  as he had known I was afraid and ran away from his sexual favours to me    She also characterises any assistance given to her by Dr Markovic in her PhD programme as part of his   sexual advance for sexual favours to me     Ms Huang says that any failure on Dr Markovic s part to support her  or any criticism of her work  was due to his sexual interest in her  As part of her case that Dr Markovic had made sexual advances to her  Ms Huang describes a series of reasons why he must have done so  She cites examples when he said to her things such as   you are too hard on yourself   and when he provided assistance to her  Suggestions by Dr Markovic that she should   take it easy   in her PhD  that she should learn from her mistakes  that she was expected to work under her own guidance and that it was up to her to determine and manage her time were all linked by Ms Huang to the question of provision by her of sexual favours to Dr Markovic followedHall v A   A Sheiban Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Ms Huang does not contend that the Federal Magistrate was in error in his summary of the principles applicable to conduct in breach of s  A b   His Honour recognised the breadth of actions that can constitute conduct of a sexual nature and that single incident could constitute a contravention of s  A  He also considered the distinction  pointed out by Wilcox J in Hall v A   A Sheiban Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   that  u  nwelcome sexual conduct may be insensitive  even offensive  but it does not necessarily constitute sexual harassment   the latter suggesting repetition   The allegation of sexual harassment made to HREOC against Professor Winder is that he touched Ms Huang s hip while passing her in a corridor in the second semester of    The allegation against Professor Winder is described by Ms Huang in her documentation in the appeal as   an upward affectionate stroking motion on hip   constituting  she says  a sexual advance for sexual favours which in turn constitutes sexual harassment  Ms Huang confirms that the allegation of sexual harassment against Professor Winder consisted of a single incident late in    In her Notice of Appeal  Ms Huang repeatedly describes the incident with Professor Winder and she also demonstrated his alleged action a number of times during her submissions  The description was in terms of touching of the hip with   an upwards affectionate stroking motion on my hip  for his sexual advance for his sexual favours to me     Noting  at   that Professor Winder had no recollection of the incident  Driver FM expressed concern about Ms Huang s evidence  Ms Huang waited more than two years before mentioning the incident and his Honour did not accept her explanation for the delay  His Honour also commented that Ms Huang had changed her account of the incident over time  As his Honour recorded at         Ms Huang has changed and embellished her account of the incident over time  Her initial allegation in   was that  one day when I passed the passage from the printing room of the school he touched my hip   In her   October   affidavit she deposed that  he stretched out his right arm towards me and touched me on the hip   In her oral evidence Ms Huang said that Professor Winder had caressed her  Her submissions allege  affectionate stroking  and give further details but such detailed recollection is inconsistent with Ms Huang s oral evidence that she did not see Professor s Winder s hand    Federal Magistrate Driver accepted at   that an incident occurred and that there was some physical contact between Professor Winder and Ms Huang as they passed each other in the corridor but found nothing to establish that the incident complained of constituted sexual harassment within the meaning of s  A of the Sex Discrimination Act   His Honour concluded that   in all probability  the contact that occurred between Professor Winder and Ms Huang was accidental and non sexual as they passed in the corridor   at    His Honour noted that the alleged incident did not apparently affect Ms Huang s dealings with Professor Winder after that time  equally significantly  Ms Huang did not allege that there was ever any other physical contact between her and Professor Winder   Ms Huang alleges a number of consequences arising from the alleged sexual harassment by Professor Winder  Those consequences and the existence of them are dependent upon a finding that the single incident alleged against Professor Winder took place and constituted a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act    Ms Huang alleges that Professor Winder   made unwelcome sexual advance for sexual favours to me  engaged in unwelcome conduct of sexual nature in relation to me  and discriminated against me of a sexual nature in relation to my sex  his sexual favours to me  and his sexual harassment  that he treated me less favourably than other girls and the male students and that his support of my PhD  my progress of my PhD and the continuance of my PhD re enrolment were conditional upon my provision of sexual favours     In the Notice of Appeal Ms Huang asserts that  had it not been for the sexual harassment she would have done certain things  such as change her supervisor from Dr Markovic to Professor Winder or not done certain things  such as sent him emails or given him a bottle of wine  She says that if she had intended to invent Professor Winder s actions  she would have suggested other contact  Ms Huang does not suggest that Professor Winder touched her at any other time  She says that she told Ms Frank that the touching of her hip was sexual harassment because   he showed his sexual intention in me   referred toHuang v University of New South Wales   Ors   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The appellant  Ms Huang  appeals from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing her application against the first  second and third respondents  Huang v University of New South Wales   Ors   FMCA    The amended notice of appeal raises   grounds of appeal and extends to some hundreds of pages  Ms Huang has also filed submissions and an  Issues Paper   This is in addition to affidavit material filed in the appeal together with the extensive factual material that was before Driver FM  Despite my urging  Ms Huang seemed unable to reduce or simplify her contentions in any meaningful way  There was a lack of focus and much in the way of irrelevant and repetitive material that made it difficult to ascertain matters relevant to this appeal   Federal Magistrate Driver expressed the difficulties he had in identifying the real issues in the mass of material filed and presented by Ms Huang  It is apparent that the case proceeded in the Federal Magistrates Court  as in this Court  in a way which was  as his Honour noted    exceptionally protracted  with far more material filed than was necessary or useful    at     I referred the matter to a Registrar of the Court for a case management conference in an attempt to isolate the issues in the appeal  By consent the following issues were elucidated    Issue   Whether His Honour erred in not giving appropriate weight to the evidence submitted in the proceedings  Issue   Whether His Honour erred in not taking into account crucial evidence and took into account submissions that misinterpreted the evidence or were contrary to the relevant facts  Issue   Whether His Honour did not give sufficient time for the appellant to complete her cross examination of the respondents  witnesses   At the hearing of the appeal Ms Huang seemed to have great difficulty in confining herself to or directing her submissions to the issues that had been identified  She appeared in person and made her submissions in English  A Cantonese interpreter was present at all times to assist Ms Huang and to ensure that she understood everything that was being said and that she was able to present her submissions without the difficulty of not being able to think of a word or an expression   Like Driver FM  I have addressed the issues that I have discerned from the material and submissions advanced by Ms Huang  I have also had the advantage of the Federal Magistrate s reasons and summary of the evidence before him   The nature of Ms Huang s complaints and the factual background are well set out in the Federal Magistrate s reasons for judgment  As an introduction and background  His Honour explained         Hong Cui Huang is a former PhD student at the University of New South Wales  the University   She did not obtain her degree and holds the University and Dr Boban Markovic  her supervisor  and Professor Chris Winder  her co supervisor  responsible  Ms Huang has applied to the Court under s  PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act    Cth   the HREOC Act   seeking compensation in relation to asserted sex  racial and disability discrimination which she believes frustrated her studies  The documentation filed by Ms Huang in support of the application is voluminous  Essentially  however  Ms Huang complains of sexual harassment in   by Professor Winder and by Dr Markovic and alleges inappropriate comments by Dr Markovic in    Ms Huang also makes sexual harassment allegations against two other persons who are not the subject of this present proceeding             The application was amended in   in order to add allegations of racial discrimination and disability discrimination in relation to the cancellation of Ms Huang s PhD enrolment  The racial discrimination is said to stem from Ms Huang s limited command of the English language  The disability discrimination is said to be based upon Ms Huang s asserted anxiety and depression             Ms Huang made two relevant complaints to HREOC  The first complaint  of sexual harassment  was terminated by a delegate of the President of HREOC on   July   pursuant to s  PH of the HREOC Act   The complaint of sexual harassment against Dr Markovic was terminated on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect of a successful conciliation in relation to the alleged events in   and in relation to the balance  the complaint was made more than   months after the alleged events took place  The complaint of sexual harassment by Professor Winder was terminated on the basis that the events took place more than   months before the complaint was made             The second termination was made by a delegate of the President on   May    This related to the complaints of racial discrimination and disability discrimination  The notice was issued pursuant to s  PH of the HREOC Act on the basis that the complaints related to alleged events occurring more than   months before the complaints were made             Ms Huang also alleged victimisation as a result of complaining of sexual harassment and also because of her complaints of racial and disability discrimination   Federal Magistrate Driver  ruled that  he  had no jurisdiction to entertain the application insofar as it was based on the victimisation allegations  Huang v University of New South Wales   Ors  No     FMCA       However   Federal Magistrate Driver  modified that ruling on   June   upon the basis that Ms Huang had referred to alleged victimisation in her first complaint to HREOC  and  although HREOC had declined to accept a complaint of victimisation in later correspondence  Ms Huang was free to put a different legal characterisation on her complaint  which was terminated  than had been put on it by HREOC   Federal Magistrate Driver  confirmed that  he  could not consider allegations of victimisation which post date the termination of the complaint             The respondents deny any sexual harassment and deny any unlawful discrimination or victimisation    Ms Huang gives extremely detailed particulars of her claims in a statement of particulars filed on   October    She amended this statement by a statement of amended particulars filed in court by leave on   February    Ms Huang relies upon ss  A    F     and     of the Sex Discrimination Act    Cth   the SDA  in relation to the sexual harassment allegations    Ms Huang asserts direct sex discrimination contrary to ss        a c  and   of the SDA by the University and Dr Markovic followedObieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Federal Magistrate Driver pointed out that victimisation is dealt with in s   of the Sex Discrimination Act   By s   victimisation for the purposes of the section concerns a person being subjected or threatened with detriment on the ground that they made or proposed to make a complaint under that Act or the HREOC Act or took steps in relation to HREOC  One or more of those matters must be a   substantial and operative   factor in the detriment to which Ms Huang was subjected or threatened with  see Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training   FCA   at      Ms Huang did not identify to Driver FM the detriment to which she alleged she was subjected or the acts referred to in s  a   g  of the Sex Discrimination Act   or the course that she took or proposed taking  or the knowledge that the first  second or third respondents had concerning those acts  or the connection between any of those acts and the detriment alleged  The Federal Magistrate pointed out at   that Ms Huang had not identified evidence of those matters  His Honour found  from the evidence  that Ms Huang first raised her allegations of sexual harassment at her meeting with Miss Nabke Hatton on   March   and that the respondents did not know of her allegations of unlawful discrimination before that date  His Honour found that there was no evidence that Ms Huang ever raised any assertion of unlawful discrimination before that time  By then her supervisors had already told her that they would not be supporting her re enrolment   Accordingly His Honour found that there was no unlawful victimisation under the Act   Ms Huang s allegations of discrimination and harassment were considered as part of the decision making process on her appeal against the cancellation of her enrolment  Federal Magistrate Driver found that these allegations did not appear to have been factors bearing on the decisions that were taken  In any event  the appeal resulted in Ms Huang being offered the opportunity to re enrol   While there were numerous communications between Ms Huang and the respondents prior to her complaint in March   none could reasonably be interpreted as suggesting an intention to make a complaint within the meaning of s   of the Sex Discrimination Act  or  for that matter  s   of the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth  or s   of the Disability Discrimination Act    Cth   Ms Huang raised the issue of sexual discrimination or disability discrimination after the rejection of the second submission of her literature review on   November    The comments predicating the decision that Ms Huang not be permitted to remain as a PhD student were made by Dr Markovic on   December   and by Professor Winder on   January    That is  all relevant actions taken by Dr Markovic and Professor Winder  and through them the University  of which Ms Huang complains were taken prior to any suggestion of a complaint being made to HREOC or otherwise   In her submissions Ms Huang describes as  victimisation  the attitude towards her during the course of her studies and prior to the decision made by the University that she not be permitted to re enrol  It is clear from her written submissions that her description of  victimisation  relates to the time before she first made an allegation to Miss Nabke Hatton or to the University of sexual harassment  sexual discrimination or disability discrimination  She states in her written submissions that she asserted her complaint about the sexual harassment discrimination prior to the termination of her PhD but there is no evidence supporting that assertion  The fact remains that  on the evidence  Ms Huang has not shown his Honour to have been in error in concluding that the decision to terminate her PhD preceded any allegation in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act   the Racial Discrimination Act or the Disability Discrimination Act   To the extent that Ms Huang refers to events that occurred after she gave notice of her complaints  it is difficult to identify the victimisation to which she says she was subjected  She has some complaint about the University s process in dealing with her PhD position but it is apparent that the University s decision making process and consideration of her status as a PhD student were affected by the consideration of her capacity as a PhD student  They were not based on or relate to Ms Huang s complaints of sexual discrimination or harassment against Dr Markovic or Professor Winder   Ms Huang has not established any error in Driver FM s conclusion that there was no unlawful victimisation  I reject  as his Honour did  the contention that there was   Ms Huang has not shown that the Federal Magistrate was in error in dismissing her application or that his Honour erred in any legal  factual or procedural respect  She has not established any of her grounds of appeal  The appeal should be dismissed   I certify that the preceding one hundred and sixteen   numbered paragraphs are a
