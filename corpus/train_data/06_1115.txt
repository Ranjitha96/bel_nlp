basis of their ownership of land adjoining the Port Stephens land   Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales   FCA    Worimi did not seek to be joined to the Hillig proceedings within the relevant period of notification of the non claimant proceedings  see   below   The original basis for joinder was as the applicant authorised by the women who assert a native title interest  Worimi contends  and the original Form   claimant application  the original application  states  that the Port Stephens land is a sacred site for women  in the context of childbirth  If Worimi has a claim to native title over the Port Stephens land on behalf of a native title claim group  subject to compliance with the Act he would have sufficient interest to be joined to the Hillig proceedings  Mr Hillig contends  however  that if no valid assertion of native title can be made  there can be no reason to join him to those proceedings  It is insufficient for joinder to the non claimant proceedings that Worimi seeks to prevent the sale of the land   Hillig at    The original application  filed on   February   was prepared before Worimi had legal advice  In the original application the native title claim group is said to be   the female members of the Garuahgal people who are descended from Mary Mahr born in

with the Act and can not be cured by amendment or further evidence  there is no good reason to grant the adjournment and the application for summary dismissal should succeed  It is necessary to consider the original application as filed  the proposed application and the evidence already filed by Worimi  It is also relevant to consider whether the original application can be amended to substitute the proposed claim group for the original claim group  The determination is to be made on the most favourable view of the evidence adduced by Worimi   Landers v State of South Australia   FCA         FCR   at   per Mansfield J   The proposition advanced by Mr Wright  counsel for Mr Hillig  is that  on Worimi s own case  the claim group is incapable of meeting the requirements of the Act  either as described in the original application or as described in the proposed application  Ms Jowett put a number of possibilities to the Court in support of the proposed claim group and referred to the nature of evidence that could be adduced in support of those possibilities  I have taken those into account  even though they were only raised as possibilities or possible scenarios  Mr Wright s proposition is that  as a matter of construction  the proposed claim group can not be one that can make the claim  even if  as a sub group of the original claim group  the members were to authorise Worimi to bring the proposed application  Further  Worimi now makes a claim on his own behalf  a claim that he has expressly negated on previous occasions  Perry M and Lloyd S  Australian

that a larger group may also have the rights and interests  In Mabo v the State of Queensland  No     HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J acknowledged   individual  non proprietary rights that are derived from the community s laws and customs and are dependent on the community title  A fortiori  there can be no impediment to the recognition of individual proprietary rights    His Honour added at   that there can be protection of interests      members of an indigenous clan or group  whether communally or individually  only in conformity with the traditional laws and customs of the people to whom the clan or group belongs and only where members of the clan or group acknowledge those laws and observe those customs  so far as it is practicable to do so   In Bodney   Mr Bodney s position at the appeal was that the group that he represented and on whose behalf he had been authorised to bring applications was composed of the only living descendants of the traditional owners  Accordingly  his position was that they were not a sub group but the whole of the group described in the application as the Ballaruk and Didjarruk people  at    There was contrary evidence from relatives outside the family that constituted the sub group but Mr Bodney did not have the opportunity to cross examine them as they were not present in Court  As Branson J said at   it was possible that the small group on whose behalf Mr Bodney made his claims was also the whole of the group alleged by him to hold the claimed native title rights and interests  Her Honour declined to form a concluded view as to whether a sub group of those who are alleged to hold the relevant native title rights and interests are permitted to make a native title application but the claim must  in any event  be authorised by the small group  at    As Brennan J said in Mabo  No   at   the interests of members of an indigenous clan or group can be protected  communally or individually  only in conformity with the

in part  in response to the evidence of other persons within the claimed biological descent from Mary Mahr and members of the Worimi and Maaiangal clans including Mr Dates  brother  to the effect that no native title existed over the Port Stephens land and that it was not a women s site  Ms Jowett raises the possibility that it was only to Worimi that the relevant interest passed according to
