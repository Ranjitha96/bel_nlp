of Infrastructure  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   May   I dismissed a notice of motion dated   May   by which the respondents sought orders discharging or staying an interlocutory injunction which I granted in these proceedings on   May   Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure  No     FCA    I reserved the costs of the motion pending receipt of written submissions as to whether costs can or should be ordered in favour of the applicant  having regard to the provisions of s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   WRA    On   May   the applicant and the respondents filed written submissions as to costs  Both parties have consented to me disposing of the question of costs without hearing further oral argument citedBostik  Australia  Pty Ltd v Gorgevski  No       FCR   It is common ground that the Court s jurisdiction in this proceeding arises because there are claims for final relief under the WRA  It follows that all of the claims in the proceeding are matters of federal jurisdiction  It also follows that the matter of costs is governed by s   of the WRA  both as to the statutory claim under the WRA and as to all claims in the Court s associated jurisdiction  Bostik  Australia  Pty Ltd v Gorgevski  No       FCR     Section   provides      A party to a proceeding  including an appeal  in a matter arising under this Act  other than an application under section   must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause        Despite subsection   if a court hearing a proceeding  including an appeal  in a matter arising under this Act  other than an application under section   is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has  by an unreasonable act or omission  caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding  the court may order the first mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs   Subsection   of s   was based upon an earlier provision in s   of the WRA  see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment  Work Choices  Bill    Cth   It appears that subs   of s   was based upon the provision now found in s   of the WRA followedShackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd     ALR   In Shackley v

judgment in Konrad v Victoria Police     IR   at      Both decisions by Marshall J predate the Full Court s decision in CFMEU  In my opinion  even if the views expressed by Marshall J were capable of

In Commonwealth v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCAFC         FCR     CFMEU   the Full Court  Black CJ  Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ  followed Shackley   The case concerned an

Employees Union  WA  v Woolworths Ltd     IR   The respondents  construction of s   was founded upon Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union  WA  v Woolworths Ltd     IR     Woolworths     The case concerned the costs of a directions hearing at which the applicant advised the Court that it no longer wished to pursue its claim for interim relief to restrain the certification of an agreement under the WRA  The claim was not pursued because the agreement had in fact been certified after the institution of the proceedings but prior to the directions date  without the knowledge of the applicant  The respondent sought costs on the basis that the applicant had not mounted its interim application urgently and in accordance with the rules concerning the filing of affidavit evidence   In the present case  the respondents relied on Nicholson J s statement at       that the proviso to s   afforded no ground for making a costs order in respect of a step in the proceeding  as distinguished from the institution of the proceeding  However  it is not clear that the reference by Nicholson J to a  step in the proceeding  was directed to the application for interim relief  rather than to particular procedural  steps  in relation to that application  On my reading  Nicholson J was treating the application for interim relief as a step in the proceeding  as he went on to say at       that     the proceeding was instituted with reasonable cause and  was  one which remained  in the applicant s mind  reasonable throughout  until it learnt eventually of the certification of the agreement      This simply amounts to a finding that  on the facts  costs should not be ordered under the proviso to s   because the interlocutory application was not instituted  vexatiously or without reasonable cause   In my opinion  Woolworths does not support the respondents  contention that costs cannot be awarded under   in respect of an interlocutory notice of motion questionedGray v
