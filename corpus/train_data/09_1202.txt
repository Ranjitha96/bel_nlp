case      as a reference to  a fair chance of success           Plainly  in order to  satisfy  the court for the purposes of s  g    the debtor is not required to prove  as on a final hearing  the asserted entitlement to recover from the creditor  Accordingly  evidence tendered on an application to set aside is to be tested for admissibility  not as if the proceeding were one in which the

Goldberg v Morrow   FCA   at   per Crennan J  The order upon which the bankruptcy notice was here issued is considered to be a   final order    A submission that the certificate of taxation had been fraudulently or improperly obtained is without substance  The factual foundation for the attack upon the certificate focussed upon the date of judgment  No date of judgment is set forth in the certificate itself  An order subsequently made on   November   by the Family Court  however  corrected under the   slip rule   the date of judgment from   October   to   November    But that

notice that the judgment debtor be in no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the judgment creditor  In the present case  the judgment creditor was identified by a name which it had abandoned some considerable time previously  That name was quite different from the name of the judgment creditor at the time of issue of the bankruptcy notice and the judgment debtor could hardly be expected to

FMCA  htmlIn proceeding NSD   the Appellant  Ms Yang  appeals against a decision of a Federal Magistrate delivered on   July   Yang v Mead   FMCA    In proceeding NSD   the Appellant  Ms Mead  appeals against a decision of the same Magistrate delivered on the same date  Mead v Mead   FMCA    Finally  the fact that Ms Mead was in custody when the bankruptcy notice was served does not relieve her of the obligation to comply with the terms of the notice   within   days    And  in any event  she in fact commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court within that period    FMCA   at     The challenge to the validity of the bankruptcy notice served upon Ms Mead is thus rejected  Before the Federal Magistrate Ms Mead claimed that she had a   counter claim  set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt   within the meaning of and for the purposes of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act   The application to set aside the bankruptcy notice as filed in the Federal Magistrates Court claimed this   counter claim  set off or cross demand   in the following terms                                       Cross claim husband breached marriage contract  I singly looked after children   years             Set aside   cross claim husband money I put in   Annexure D prior to marriage to purchase Ermington home             Set aside   cross claim husband money I put in   Annexure D by selling Ryde unit at   Hatton Street Ryde   and others       The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate address both    two   claims   referred to in the application   namely  one for   and the other for    and   an application that an order be made that  as the Federal Magistrate described it    Mr Mead and his solicitors pay her   and be reported  to the law society and bar association to refrain their wrongful and unethical actions    The sum of   was said to be the total of   and    The total does not correspond   The sum of   was said to consist of an amount of   allegedly owed to Ms Mead since   September   and interest  The   was said to be the contribution she had made in   in connection with the purchase of a former matrimonial home  The sum of   was comprised of a sum of      claimed to have been contributed to the marriage on   April   through a company called Hypec Electronics Pty Ltd  together with interest referred toCAM v LGM   FamCA  It should be noted that any entitlement to monies said to be owed to Ms Mead from her former husband has been the subject of detailed consideration by the Family Court  CAM v LGM   FamCA    Indeed  O Ryan J there concluded in part as follows         Both the Husband and the Wife worked very hard to establish and maintain what became a very successful business  This effort enabled significant and valuable assets to be accumulated  However subsequent to the separation of the Husband and the Wife there ensued a bitter and protracted matrimonial conflict  The conflict has been played out in numerous courts  There has now been an extraordinary dissipation of ascertained assets that the Husband and the Wife accumulated with the result that the majority of the identified wealth has gone  As well  as I have said before  the public cost is incalculable  Further  the Wife has been imprisoned and that experience is but one of the destructive outcomes  There are two children who were hardly mentioned but who must be aware of and affected by the enormity of the conflict between their parents  I cannot adequately explain it  However it may be that the explanation is simply that it is a case about money and thus perhaps the conflict has no boundaries             Therefore coming back to what this case is about  I have no doubt that the Wife has undisclosed assets and they are probably located overseas and will never be ascertained  The assets are probably located in Taiwan and the ability of the Wife to control and deal with such assets is assisted by the efforts of various people some of whom are within the jurisdiction and some of whom are not  I am also of the opinion that the actions of the Wife  aided by Grace Yang  the late Mr Yang  Mrs Yang and others to undermine any possible interests and claims of the Husband have resulted in an extraordinary waste of ascertained assets that were accumulated by the efforts of the Husband and the Wife       That was the conclusion of an experienced Judge of the Family Court who had heard the evidence relevant to the proceedings for a period of over   days  The reference in Ms Mead s application to the   Ermington home   and the   Ryde unit   were references to property the subject of consideration by the Family Court  as were the entitlements said to arise in respect to Hypec Electronics Pty Ltd  Due to her being in custody  Ms Mead contends that she was not able to attend the greater proportion of that hearing  But she did attend in person or by videolink from her place of custody to the Family Court on each day of the hearing  The learned Federal Magistrate whose decision is now under appeal had also considered the submissions sought to be advanced by Ms Mead and Ms Yang when challenging the bankruptcy notices now in issue  There is also a protracted history of litigation between the parties to the present proceedings  and related entities  in the Supreme Court of New South Wales
