SZNKU v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI   HCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs to ground   in the court below  the federal magistrate was correct to say that there is no general obligation on the Tribunal  to conduct its own independent investigation of the appellant s claims  That proposition is now the subject of further authority by the High Court  in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI   HCA       ALR    That authority confirms the proposition that the Tribunal did not have a general obligation to make its own independent inquiries  To the extent to which the appellant placed material before the Tribunal  the Tribunal did conduct a thorough investigation of that material  The Tribunal s reasons for decision run to   pages  They are detailed  The Tribunal spent a good deal of time listening to the appellant s case on the two days on which it conducted parts of its hearing  It reasoned in great detail about the difficulties it had in accepting the appellant s account of events that had occurred in relation to him in Bangladesh  Unfortunately  for the appellant  the Tribunal found that it could not accept the truth of most of that account  As to ground   in the court below  the appellant has not attempted to suggest in this Court that the federal magistrate was in error in relation to the Tribunal s reliance on independent information  It would have been necessary for the appellant to isolate exactly what items of information the Tribunal regarded as a reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision of the Minister s delegate  which it had failed to give particulars of  to the appellant  in accordance with s  A  Only information that did not fall within one of the exceptions in subs   of that section could have been relied on  As to ground   in the court below  the three reasons given by the federal magistrate for rejecting that ground were all correct referred toMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNAV   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe preference that the federal magistrate expressed for not following the judgment of another federal magistrate in SZNAV   has now been confirmed as correct by the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNAV   FCAFC    In that case  the Full Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the federal magistrate who had decided SZNAV   To the extent to which the grounds of appeal to this Court seek to raise different issues from those raised in the Federal Magistrates Court  the appellant cannot succeed on those issues  Manifestly  all of his grounds and his written submissions are seeking to agitate again  matters of fact  determined by the Tribunal  I repeat that this Court does not have the power to deal with those matters of fact  The Tribunal made its findings about the fabrication of police records in Bangladesh  and the unreliability of the documents tendered by the appellant  It is not for this Court to overturn those findings  They were matters of fact for the Tribunal only  The findings certainly do not support the conclusion that the Tribunal made its decision in bad faith  or came to the case with a preset mind  The Tribunal was doing its job of evaluating the evidence relating to the appellant s claim  The fact that the Tribunal did not find in the appellant s favour about his fear of persecution because of his political affiliations or his religion is not a ground for overturning the Tribunal s decision  Again  the Tribunal s function was to evaluate whether the appellant s expressed fear of persecution for those two reasons was a well founded fear  In each instance  the Tribunal held that the fear was not well founded  This Court cannot overturn that conclusion on a matter of fact  There is no suggestion that the Tribunal failed to understand the nature of persecution  or the test that it was to apply in reaching that conclusion  Nor is there any evidence of denial of procedural fairness  One ground again raised the issue of the reliability of the documents from Bangladesh  The appellant claimed in his written submission that the Tribunal did not comply with s  A of the Migration Act   by inviting him to make a written comment before it made those findings  The Tribunal was not obliged to comply with s  A of the Migration Act in respect of any information in relation to the findings about the documents  There was no information on which the Tribunal relied  as the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate of the Minister in that respect  There was no information  therefore  of which the Tribunal could give the appellant particulars  and seek his comment about the effect of the information  For all of these reasons  the appeal must be dismissed citedSZNAV v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe federal magistrate then went on to consider the various provisions of the Migration Act imposing procedural requirements on the Tribunal  to determine whether there had been any failure to comply with the requirements of those provisions  In doing so  his Honour declined at     to follow the judgment of another federal magistrate in SZNAV v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA    His Honour concluded that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error by means of any failure to comply with any requirement of the provisions of the Migration Act   Both in his notice of appeal to this Court and in his outline of submissions  the appellant has raised three grounds  They do not address the grounds of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court specifically  Nor do they address themselves to the reasons for judgment of the federal magistrate  The first ground is that the Tribunal made its decision in bad faith  That is justified by reference to the Tribunal s findings that the appellant fabricated the documents concerning police records in Bangladesh and that the Tribunal did not believe that the documents from Bangladesh were reliable  The second ground is that the Tribunal failed to consider persecution on the basis of the appellant s Christian religion  The third ground is that the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act and the Federal Magistrates Court failed to identify that issue  This ground is particularised as involving a lack of procedural fairness  The denial of procedural fairness is exemplified by reference to the Tribunal s findings in relation to the documents from Bangladesh  In his oral submissions  the appellant has been keen to persuade me that the documents he tendered to the Tribunal were all genuine  He pointed to the relative ease of investigating the genuineness of those documents  particularly to the presence of telephone numbers in some of them  and to the failure of the Tribunal to conduct any such investigation  He submitted that the Tribunal came to the case with a preset mind citedSZNKU v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThis appeal is from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in SZNKU v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA    That judgment was delivered on   August    The learned federal magistrate dismissed with costs an application by the appellant  seeking to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  the second respondent to this appeal  signed on   March   and delivered on   March    The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  the Minister  the first respondent in this appeal  not to grant the appellant a protection visa  The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who arrived in Australia on   July    On   August   he applied for a protection visa  The decision of the Minister s delegate refusing to grant him that visa was made on   November    The Tribunal conducted a hearing on two days    February and   March    By s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas  A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa be a non citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention  as amended by the Refugees Protocol  The terms  Refugees Convention  and  Refugees Protocol  are defined respectively in s   of the Migration Act to mean the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on   July   and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on   January    It is convenient to call those two documents  taken together  the  Convention   For present purposes  it is sufficient to say that  pursuant to the Convention  Australia has protection obligations to a person who      owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable  or owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country
