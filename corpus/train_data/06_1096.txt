create a valid assessment where none has been made at all  A taxpayer dissatisfied with an assessment may object against it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the TAA  Section   in turn provides              The production of a notice of assessment  or of a document under the hand of the Commissioner  a Second Commissioner  or a Deputy Commissioner  purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment  shall be conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and  except in proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act   on a review or appeal relating to the assessment  that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct  At  ff Kenny J rejected the submission that the assessment was provisional or tentative  In so doing she reviewed the decisions of the High Court in Hoffnung  Bloemen and Richard Walter   Her Honour noted  at   that in Bloemen        Mason and Wilson JJ  with whom Stephen J agreed  said  at       The Bloemen notice of assessment is in form an assessment  It sets out the ascertainment of the taxpayer s taxable income and the tax payable thereon  It is therefore appropriate to bring s   into operation  Its production will put beyond contention the due making of the assessment so that the Court cannot find that no assessment was made or that  if made  it was made for an inadmissible purpose      The Simons notice  if read with the adjustment sheet  is more debatable  However  we read it as a definitive assessment by the Commissioner intended to create a legal liability to pay the tax specified  coupled with an intimation that the Commissioner will review the taxpayer s liability in a certain event  If it be assumed that the Commissioner lacks power to amend the assessment in the circumstances contemplated this does not affect our conclusion  It merely means that the Commissioner is mistaken in supposing that he has power to review  Accordingly  the notice of assessment will  on production  bring s   into play  I equally am satisfied that the assessment was intended to  and did  create a definitive liability notwithstanding that the Commissioner has acknowledged that Futuris  liability could be reviewed at a future date after the Division  A Part IVC proceedings were complete  cf Bloemen   above at     ANZ Banking Group   at    As I earlier indicated  notwithstanding the different factual settings of this matter and ANZ Banking Group   I consider there is no operative distinction in principle between the two cases  For this reason I have not analysed the relevant case law in a way that I would otherwise have done  I respectfully agree with Kenny J s analysis  Its application to the facts of this case leads necessarily to the conclusion that the Second Amended Assessment attracts the protection of s   and s   of the ITAA  Accordingly  such relief as Futuris is entitled to in respect of that assessment is in Part IVC proceedings and not by way of judicial review under s  B of the Judiciary Act   Having dealt with the application on its merits  I will make no order on the Commissioner s notice of motion but will order that the application be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding sixty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn    Associate

html iii  An internal ATO email of   May   responding to a Part IVA paper relating to Futuris commented of a paragraph in the position paper         PARAGRAPH             In my opinion  this is one of the two matters covered in the response which is truly relevant to the argument of whether   should be included  under Part IVA   in Futuris  assessable income for the   year of income in respect of the scheme defined in the Position Paper      At the Part IVA Panel meeting of   December   the matter covered by this paragraph was raised with the Panel  The Panel advised the assessment should be made on the full amount of   and  depending on the outcome of the Division  A issue  a compensating adjustment can be made at a later stage if necessary  No doubt the Panel came to this view in order to  protect the Revenue       In my opinion  a recent Federal Court case  Australian   New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     is relevant here  In that case  pursuant to section  B of the Judiciary Act     the taxpayer contended that amended assessments that issued as a result of the application of Part IVA were invalid assessments because each of the amended assessments included an amount that had already been returned by the taxpayer as assessable income  The Court found against the taxpayer  I must point out that this decision is subject to appeal  iv  A document entitled  Reasons for Decision  of   August   noted           Thus  in the absence of the First Scheme  immediately after the Bristile shares were transferred from Vockbay to Walshville  the indexed cost base of the Walshville shares to Futuris would probably have been    Consequently  I consider that as a result of the First Scheme being carried out  the indexed cost base of the Walshville shares to Futuris was increased by    following the Division  A adjustment  from   to    for the purpose of this and the following paragraph  I am ignoring the   possible error in regard to the capital gain returned by Futuris on the float of Walshville that is now subject to appeal  This is in line with the recommendation made by the Part IVA Panel at its meeting of   December   refer to para    below           The par   referred to reflects the email comment in  iii  above though with the additional observation     Obviously  we will not pursue recovery for both amounts of tax  penalty and  AA interest general interest charge involved with the two   adjustments      The  Reasons  went on to consider the making of a compensating adjustment under s  F  if a Part IVA assessment was issued for the full amount of   even though the First Amended Assessment included the    It noted       The Panel recommended that the Part IVA assessment should be made on the full amount of   and  depending on the ultimate outcome of the Division  A issue  a compensating adjustment can be made if necessary  No doubt  the Panel came to this decision to protect the Revenue      If  as I recommend  an amended assessment issues including an amount under Part IVA of   then obviously we would only pursue payment of the tax  penalty and  AA interest general interest charge involved with one of the two   adjustments  Futuris has already paid half of the tax  penalty and  AA interest general interest charge involved with the   Division  A adjustment  The Division  A amended assessment is currently subject to appeal    v  Comments reflecting those in the above  Reasons  were repeated in a document entitled  ATO Final Audit Report  with the following recommendations being made that the Commissioner         a  determine under subsection  F  that   be included in the assessable income of Futuris for the   year of income       b  determine under subsection  F  that   be deemed to be included in the assessable income of Futuris for the   year of income under subsection  ZO  and      c  at this stage does not determine under subsection  F  that any compensating adjustments be made to the assessable income of Futuris for the   year of income any such determination s should be made when the Part IVA and Division  A matters have been finalised  I would note in passing that the making of a s  F  determination forms part of the  making of an assessment  for the purposes of s   of the Act  see Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at     ANZ Banking Group    I would also note that the Notices of the First Amended Assessment and of the Second Amended Assessment have been produced in this proceeding referred toBriglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   ACT  There is a voluminous body of case law on the interpretation and effect of s   and s    For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the protection of s   and s   will be lost  a  if the Commissioner has not made a bona fide attempt to exercise the power of assessment  or  ii  if the alleged  assessment  is tentative or provisional in that it does not create a definitive liability  see e g  Briglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   ACT   at   where many of the cases relied upon in the present proceeding are referred to  see also ANZ Banking Group   at      It is unnecessary here to repeat what has earlier been said about Div  A of Pt IIIA of the ITAA other than to reiterate that it provides for the working out of capital gains and losses where assets have been transferred between companies under common ownership  Part IVA of the ITAA is an anti avoidance regime introduced into the Act in    It is brought into operation upon the making of a determination by the Commissioner pursuant to s  F of the Act  That section provides the Commissioner with a discretion to cancel a tax benefit where such a benefit has been  or would but for the section be  obtained in connection with a scheme to which the Part applies  It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the scheme that the Commissioner was satisfied existed relating to the Walshville float  although I would note that  in the Commissioner s view  it involved both declarations of dividends by Bristile and Vockbay and the capitalisation of debts owed to Vockbay and Futuris respectively following those declarations of dividend citedPlaintiff S  v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFuturis  contentions are premised on the uncontroversial proposition in Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   that           a privative clause cannot protect against a failure to make a decision required by the legislation in which that clause is found or against a decision which  on its face  exceeds jurisdiction  From the Commissioner s discovered documents set out in part earlier it is contended that it is clear that the Commissioner incorrectly formed the view       a  that he was entitled to calculate the taxable income by aggregating the amounts of   and   and thus by purporting in effect to reduce the cost base by the aggregate amount of   whereas Futuris had only ever treated the provisions of Division  A as increasing cost base by the amount of      b  that he was entitled to calculate the taxable income of Futuris in an amount which was   greater than the taxable income as calculated under the Original Assessment notwithstanding that such taxable income was   greater than the highest amount of the taxable income which the Commissioner contended to be the taxable income on which tax should be paid for the   year     c  that he would  if his views in relation to the operation of Division  A proved to be correct  at some future time make a compensating adjustment pursuant to s  F  presumably for the purpose of reducing the taxable income by an amount of    although the amount of any future contemplated compensating adjustment was not identified   The Commissioner therefore took the view that he was entitled to overstate the taxable income in making the Second Amended Assessment because it could subsequently be reduced pursuant to a compensating adjustment under s  F  when such was not the case  In this  it is said  the ANZ Banking Group case  outlined below  was distinguishable citedDarrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR  The consequence of the Commissioner s purporting to issue an

the view of Emmett J in Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      ATR   at   and in Asiamet  No   Resources  above  that the Commissioner may defer exercising his discretion until the outcome of a Part IVC decision is known  Kenny J concluded on this issue at          In this case  the Commissioner apparently considers that  depending upon the outcome of the Pt IVC proceeding and the objection process  it may well be appropriate for him to issue a further amended assessment  in consequence of the need to make a compensatory adjustment or otherwise to give effect to the decision of the Court  It does not follow from this  however  that the amended assessment is tentative or provisional in the Hoffnung sense  To adopt what Hill J said in McCleary at           In summary  it can be said that the conclusion that an assessment is tentative will ordinarily emerge from an examination of the assessment itself  as in Hoffnung   The mere indication that an assessment will be reviewed later does not require the conclusion that the assessment is tentative     Nor will an assessment be regarded as tentative in the relevant sense  even if two assessments have been issued to different taxpayers concerning the same income with the consequence that one of them must necessarily be reduced to nil  Richard Walter   Provided the notice of assessment purports to create a definitive liability and at least there is no evidence to the contrary  the assessment will not be tentative      Emphasis in original          In the present case  the evidence falls short of demonstrating that the amended assessment in question was tentative or provisional  It is not to be treated as tentative  simply because officers of the Commissioner contemplated that it might be the subject of a compensatory adjustment in the future  or may not entirely survive a proceeding under Pt IVC  Finally  her Honour acquitted the Commissioner of bad faith  no concession having been made that he assessed the Bank on facts known to be wrong  She went on to observe  at        But even on the assumption that the Commissioner knew that he might have proceeded in error and that ANZ might succeed in the Pt IVC proceeding in showing the amended assessment is excessive  I would not infer bad faith on the Commissioner s part  Even if the Commissioner s approach is erroneous  I accept that  for the reasons given by his counsel  it would be open to the Commissioner to take the view that his approach is necessary to protect the revenue and that any unfairness to ANZ can be remedied at the end of the objection  review and appeal processes    Emphasis in original As I earlier indicated  Futuris has submitted that ANZ Banking Group is distinguishable  s  F  cannot be relied upon by the Commissioner in the present matter to correct the figures stated in the Second Amended Assessment  and that the Commissioner deliberately stated amounts in that assessment which he knew to be incorrect  Futuris accepts that in ANZ Banking Group   s  F a  clearly authorised the making of a compensation adjustment for the reason that it was the implementation of the scheme in that case which led to the inclusion in the Bank s assessable income of the amount of   million pursuant to s    The Commissioner s contention  it is said  is that for s  F  purposes the amount of   which was included in the First Amended Assessment would not have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the Part IVA scheme had not been carried out  Of this  Futuris submits that           The difficulty which the Commissioner s view encounters is that he contends that the Pt IVA  scheme  comprised those events which increased the cost base of the Walshville shares by the amount of   by a transaction which attracted the operation of the anti avoidance provisions of Division  A  In essence  the Commissioner characterises the Pt IVA scheme as a scheme to obtain a cost base transfer in the amount of   thus increasing the cost base of the Walshville shares by that amount  and reducing the net capital gain by the same amount         Consequently the effect of the two amended assessments may be summarised as follows               a  by the First Amended Assessment the Commissioner contends that the  scheme  had the consequence that Division  A operated to increase the cost base of the Bristile shares by an amount of only  M that is    less than Futuris contends  and      b  by the Second Amended Assessment the Commissioner contends  in the alternative  that Pt IVA operated effectively to eliminate the entire cost base transfer of   contended for by Futuris                 Thus it can be seen that the Commissioner s contentions are truly alternative in respect of the amount of    With respect to that amount  the Commissioner relies on one or other of Division  A or Pt IVA but not both         Returning to address the potential application of s  F a  the Commissioner was incorrect on the view that it would supply a basis for making a   compensating adjustment    Paragraph  F a  could only apply if              a  the First Amended Assessment reflects the inclusion of a net capital gain in the assessable income of Futuris  and      b  that net capital gain would not have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the Pt IVA scheme had not been carried out                 However  the Commissioner s contention is in fact to the opposite effect  The Commissioner contends that the amount of   would have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the scheme had not been carried out  He has assessed under Pt IVA on the contention that  but for the scheme  the amount of   would have been included in the assessable income of Futuris  The Commissioner s response to this is that the present matter is relevantly indistinguishable from ANZ Banking Group   In that case  by virtue of the scheme    million was included in the taxpayers  assessable income irrespective of Part IVA   in consequence of s   of the ITAA  Here  by virtue of the scheme  approximately   million was included in Futuris  assessable income  irrespective of Part IVA   in consequence of Division  A  In ANZ Banking Group the tax benefit for s  F  and s  C a  purposes was the   million  here  it was   million  If the scheme in ANZ Banking Group had not been carried out  the   million would not have been included in the Bank s assessable income  here if the Walshville float scheme had not been carried out    million as assessed would not have been included in Futuris  assessable income  There is simply no reason  it is said  to give s  F  the construction contended for by Futuris  In the Commissioner s view  both ANZ Banking Group and the present matter have alternative bases for including the erroneously described double sums in the respective taxpayer s assessable income  However  the Commissioner goes on to say that  given the present uncertainty as to how the   million was calculated  it may be that the two bases may in fact be found in this case to be cumulative  The Part IVC proceedings in relation to the First Amended Assessment will clarify that situation  For my own part  I agree with the Commissioner s submission  The present matter is one which falls naturally within both the language and the evident purpose of s  F   But even if I am wrong in this  I equally am satisfied that at best all that Futuris has shown is that in making a definitive assessment  i e  the Second Amended Assessment  see below the Commissioner proceeded upon a mistaken view of the applicability of s  F   That mistake did not invalidate the assessment or evidence bad faith on the Commissioner s part in the exercise of the power to assess  The effect of the mistake could  and should properly  be addressed in Part IVC proceedings  On the material before the Court I am not satisfied that the Commissioner deliberately engaged in what the applicant calls double counting  When the Part IVA determinations were made the Commissioner could then have made a s  F  determination to include only part of the tax benefit in Futuris  assessable income  i e    million     million   Rather  in view of the facts as he then understood them to be  he chose to include the totality of the benefit in the knowledge that there was some likelihood of the need later to make a compensating adjustment  This was a course he was entitled to take in the circumstances given that  a  the Division  A proceedings in respect of the First Amended Assessment had not been determined   b  there was uncertainty about how the   million was calculated in any event  and  c  his view that there was a need to protect the revenue by making the Second Amended Assessment as he did  The Commissioner was  in the circumstances  entitled to defer making a compensation adjustment  see ANZ Banking Group  citedFletcher v Commissioner of Taxation
