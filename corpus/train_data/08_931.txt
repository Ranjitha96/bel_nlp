the profit for which a trade mark infringer is accountable is not the profit from selling the article itself but the profit from selling it under the trade mark   Dart itself was a case of patent infringement  the patent being for press button seals used to seal plastic kitchen canisters  The trial judge had allowed for the whole profit on the basis that sales of the canisters were attributable to the invention  The Full Court of the Federal Court reached the same result  reasoning that  what characterised the infringing product was the press button lid  without which this particular canister would neve have been produced at all   The High Court majority  at   noted that there was  some divergence  between the trial judge and the Full Court but considered nevertheless the  overall approach  of both was correct   While doubtless Mr Wallz made use of his own knowledge and experience in relation to tender responses when he conducted the Reed workshop  he would not have been able to take up the opportunity to do so had it not been for his use of the Original Manual  That use was fundamental to the presentation of the workshop  The case is similar in that regard to Dart and Peter Pan   The gross revenue received by him should be the starting point for the calculation of profit   In Dart at   the majority cited a lengthy passage from the judgment of Harvey CJ in Eq in Leplastrier   Co Ltd v Armstrong Holland Ltd     SR  NSW    at   which commences  Under no circumstances can  the patent infringer  in my opinion  deduct interest on his capital employed in the business  Under no circumstances can he claim any remuneration to himself  nor under any circumstances can he claim in my opinion any director s fees for carrying on the business   His Honour goes on to say that the only expenses to be deducted are those  solely referrable to the manufacture of the  infringing  machines   The majority in Dart at   et seq discuss this latter part of the statement by Harvey CJ in Eq and point out  referring to a number of United States authorities  that the statement does not take account of opportunity cost suffered by an infringer in certain circumstances  as for example  where there is no excess capacity and the infringer would have been able to manufacture alternative products  In the circumstances which arose in Dart the majority at     held that some proportion of overheads attributable to the manufacture of the infringing products should be taken into account   However  nothing that the majority said in Dart casts doubt on the opening part of Harvey CJ in Eq s statement quoted above  It would be wrong in principle to allow Mr Wallz a deduction for the time he had spent working up his presentation with the aid of Tenderwatch s Original Manual  This would be tantamount to making a copyright owner pay an infringer for the time and effort spent in infringement  As was said in Sheldon v Metro Goldwyn Pictures Corp   F  d     at    a plagiarist may not charge for his labour in exploiting what he has taken    For the purpose of an account of profits an infringer can only claim costs in fact incurred  including costs attributable to the infringing work  Dart    The infringer cannot claim costs not actually incurred  even though they might reasonably have been incurred  Thus in LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd     IPR   the infringer company had paid salaries to its directors but submitted a report of a consultant purporting to set out a  fair remuneration  which was in the order of three times that actually paid  Lindgren J at   rejected this claim  pointing out that the plaintiff must take the business of the infringer as it is citedPeter Pan Manufacturing Corporation v Corsets Silhouette Ltd     WLR   Peter Pan Manufacturing Corporation v Corsets Silhouette Ltd     WLR   concerned confidential information as to a particular style of brassiere  Pennycuick J at     rejected an argument that profits should be limited to the amount by which the profit exceeded the profit the defendant would have made if it had manufactured the article without the use of that information  In his Lordship s view  the manufacture of the article in question of itself involved the use of the confidential information and the defendants could not have manufactured that article at all without the use of the confidential information   That case seems closely analogous to the present one   In the present case the presentation of Mr Wallz at the Reed workshop involved blatant and wholesale copying of the Original Manual  particularly of its structure and layout  As already mentioned  participants were each given a copy of the Reed Manual which was substantially the same as the Original Manual  Mr Wallz used slides which contained headings and information the same as that contained in the Original Manual and substantially the same as slides produced and used by Tendersearch  Mr Wallz frequently referred to the content of the Reed Manual as a supplement to the projected slides  Twice during the course of the day Mr Wallz handed out documents containing exercises  Attendees broke into groups and worked on these exercises  These had similarities in content and layout to like documents created and used by Tendersearch although the similarities are not as striking as those between the Reed Manual and the Original Manual   While doubtless Mr Wallz made use of his own knowledge and experience in relation to tender responses when he conducted the Reed workshop  he would not have been able to take up the opportunity to do so had it not been for his use of the Original Manual  That use was fundamental to the presentation of the workshop  The case is similar in that regard to Dart and

purporting to set out a  fair remuneration  which was in the order of three times that actually paid  Lindgren J at   rejected this claim  pointing out that the plaintiff must take the business of the infringer as it is   The present case is not precisely on all fours with LED Builders because the infringer Mr Wallz was a sole trader and did not employ anybody  However  as a matter of ordinary business practice the  profit  he made for conducting the Reed workshop was the amount he received from Reed less his actual outlays  If his time spent was truly worth what he says  presumably he would have charged Reed    By way of example  if a barrister charged   for an opinion  he or she would not calculate the number of hours spent and determine that there was a  profit  of  say      The cost of printing and GST are properly allowable because they have reduced the actual profit or benefit derived by Mr Wallz from the infringement   Accordingly the profit for which Mr Wallz must account is     being his gross receipt from Reed of     less printing costs of     and GST of
