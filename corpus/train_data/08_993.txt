order to see where the balance of convenience lies  Australian Broadcasting Commission v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at       and Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   at     citedBeecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The requisite strength of the likelihood or probability which will be sufficient depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the orders sought  Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Gummow and Hayne JJ   Here the grant of the interlocutory injunctions sought would amount  in practical effect  to final relief in respect to the s   case at least so far as the Perth Test is concerned  In my opinion  there are serious issues to be tried in relation to the various elements which arise on CSA s s   case  Accordingly the balance of convenience now requires to be considered citedCarlton   United Breweries  NSW  Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing New South Wales Ltd     ALR   Despite this  CSA  no doubt advisedly  decided to challenge what counsel for CSA described as the ARU business model  The challenge  as I have indicated  goes well beyond the immediate s   case in respect of the Perth Test  These proceedings are the manifestation of that decision  It was unnecessary in my opinion  in order to pursue such challenge  for CSA to enter into contracts with its corporate clients for the supply of hospitality packages  including tickets  for the Perth Test  The proceedings might simply have sought declarations without deliberately involving third parties  The proceedings could also have been instituted as early as November last year when CSA and the ARU terminated their contractual relationship  if it had wanted to obtain relevant discretionary relief in time for the Perth Test  There has been an unreasonable delay on the part of CSA in bringing this application  I would  for that reason alone  have refused to grant the relief sought  Carlton   United Breweries  NSW  Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing New South Wales Ltd     ALR   at       Further it is clear that when CSA entered into its contract with SFC for the acquisition of packages in order to access tickets  at a significant premium  for its own packages  it was aware that this was a contravention of the Ticket Condition   The position of the purchasers of corporate hospitality packages from CSA is of course regrettable  However  there is a consideration which outweighs their personal position  In my opinion  a Court should be alert not to give weight to circumstances  deliberately and unnecessarily created by the moving party  which were then sought to be relied upon as a relevant ingredient in the consideration of the balance of convenience  I consider this to be so  even where it involves third parties  There may be occasions when  despite the wilful nature of the moving party s conduct that the position of third parties will nonetheless be a determining factor  This is not such a case citedKolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   It is appropriate  in a case such as this  for the Court to evaluate the strength of CSA s case for final relief in relation to this aspect of its claim in order to see where the balance of convenience lies  Australian Broadcasting Commission v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at       and Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   at     referred toHospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Tickets issued by the ARU which are in substance the same as the tickets for the Perth Test  have already been the subject of consideration by this Court  Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR    This decision  in its application to this case  is to the effect that each ticket comprises a licence from the ARU to the bearer for admission to Subiaco Oval for the purpose of watching the match  in consideration of payment of the ticket price  The case did not concern s   of the Act    The following condition is printed on each ticket for the Perth Test  the Ticket Condition    Sale of this ticket creates a contract between the ARU and the purchaser which gives the purchaser a transferable but conditional licence for admission to the specified match  The licence will automatically terminate if the purchaser or any subsequent transferee       a  resells this ticket at a premium     b  resells the is ticket through a broker or agent     c  advertises or offers this ticket for resale on the internet or in any other medium  or    d  uses this ticket for advertising  promotion or other commercial purpose  including competitions or trade promotions  or to enhance the demand for other goods or services     without the prior  written permission of the ARU  The ARU has the right to deny admission if the licence has terminated   The Ticket Condition prohibits the resale of the ticket at a premium  that is  at a price higher than the amount for which it was sold by the ARU  as well as use of the ticket for commercial purposes  without the prior written permission of the ARU  If the condition is breached  the ARU is entitled to deny admission to any bearer  Hospitality Group at     and     There is an immediate and direct relationship between the Ticket Condition and the SFC Contract Condition  The SFC Contract Condition amounts to a pre emptive refusal on the part of the ARU to give permission to the SFC to use the tickets to be provided under the SFC Contract for commercial purposes by way of supplying them to CSA  Such permission under the Ticket Condition is necessary before tickets can be used for commercial purposes  The use of tickets for commercial purposes without such permission constitutes a breach of the Ticket Condition   The written evidence of Mr Eddie Moore  Head of ARU s Operations  as to the justification for the Ticket Condition and its enforcement by the ARU  is to the following effect  It is to ensure that the purchaser of a ticket to the Perth Test or any Rugby Union test match does not pay more than the face value price appearing on the ticket  This objective is consistent with the ARU s responsibility to promote and advance the sport of Rugby Union because it maximises public access to Rugby Union tests through the various channels available to a wide cross section of the public  In addition  the Ticket Condition assists the ARU in protecting an important revenue stream from the sale of hospitality packages which is in turn invested into the Rugby Union game  In particular  by imposing the Ticket Condition  the purpose of the ARU is to       a  prevent scalping and a black market in tickets at inflated prices   b  ensure that all members of the public within the various groups that attend Rugby Union tests  including those who wish to use corporate hospitality packages  have purchased the same product at the same price   c  prevent confusion amongst the public as to which agents are official and authorised to sell tickets on behalf of the ARU and those who are not   d  prevent persons such as CSA from increasing the cost of corporate hospitality associated with Rugby Union tests in an era when re building is the focus of the ARU citedNews Ltd v South Sydney Football Club   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Furthermore  s  a ii  and  b ii  require a consideration of  purpose   It is the subjective purpose of the ARU in seeking to enforce both the Condition in the SFC Contract as well as the Ticket Condition  which is relevant  News Ltd v South Sydney Football Club   HCA         CLR   at      I think it more likely than not that the ARU s subjective purposes are as deposed to by Mr Moore  which broadly  is to promote Rugby Union in Australia and to ensure that all members of the public are given equal access to rugby tickets so far as possible  I do not think it likely that the purpose was  as CSA contends  to  lock out  CSA from supplying corporate hospitality at the Perth Test match   CSA submits that it cannot be adequately compensated by an award of damages because it has entered into contracts to supply the tickets to third parties and without the aid of the Court it will be unable to supply these tickets  It says this will cause damage to its reputation which is incapable of accurate assessment and will also cause a windfall to the ARU by securing to itself  the SFC or to Matchpoint a transfer of the customers who would otherwise seek corporate hospitality packages from it  It also submits that there is no evidence that these third parties will be adequately accommodated or dealt with in a manner suitable to them citedVisy Paper Pty Limited v ACCC   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Second  the ARU submits that even if the ARU does supply SFC with tickets in SFC s capacity as principal  the ARU does so on condition that SFC will not re supply those tickets except to a limited extent  being to members and specified clients  s  f  of the Act   However  by operation of s   the prohibition on exclusive dealing will not apply to such an arrangement  It submits that by operation of s     the prohibition against exclusionary provisions in s  a i  does not apply to the alleged provision in ARU s arrangement with SFC  Visy Paper Pty Limited v ACCC   HCA         CLR   at          There was less than full argument on this submission  It is arguably correct  CSA did not persuade me that it was wrong or likely to be wrong  This is principally because it again would involve my being satisfied  to the necessary degree  that there was a substantial lessening of competition  For the following reasons I cannot be satisfied as to that   Third  I have not been persuaded to the necessary degree of the likelihood that there has been the substantial lessening of competition in an identified market arising out of the arrangements between the ARU and the SFC or through the enforcement by the ARU of the Ticket Condition in contravention of s  a ii  or  b ii  of the Act
