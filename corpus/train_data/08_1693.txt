SZLOJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Observations concerning the meaning of effect of s  A were made by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR     at          In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ  one there finds the following in para     Section  A does not require notice to be given of every matter the Tribunal might think relevant to the decision under review  Rather the Tribunal s obligation is limited to the written provision of  particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review    And then in para   The  reason  or a part of the reason for affirming the decision that is under review  was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention  When viewed in that light it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellant s statutory declaration would itself be  information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or part of the reason for  affirming the decision that is under review   Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection  denial or undermining of the appellant s claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations   Appended to the protection visa application was a statement of the male Appellant  That statement provided the basis upon which a claim for a protection visa was made  It also provided  for the reason which I have already given  the basis upon which the Appellant s wife advanced her claim  The basis of the claim for a protection visa  as there made  was not enlarged upon in the proceedings of the Tribunal  That is because  though invited to attend at a hearing and present evidence  the Appellant and his wife did not take advantage of that opportunity  The Tribunal  then  as it was entitled to do under the Migration Act     decided the case on the basis of the material which it did have  and that material  in essence  was the statement to which I have referred
