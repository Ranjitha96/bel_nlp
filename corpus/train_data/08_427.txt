citedGriffiths v Boral Resources  Qld  Pty Limited   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  His Honour proceeded to deal with the question of the lapsing of the petition and referred to Ms Menassa s affidavit evidence as to her oversight  He accepted her evidence  The learned Federal Magistrate referred to Griffiths v Boral Resources  Qld  Pty Limited   FCAFC         FCR   in which a Full Court of this Court  while expressing some concern over the course of decision in this Court allowing the invocation of the slip rule retrospectively to extend the life of a bankruptcy petition  was unwilling to disturb that course of decision   Driver FM considered that if the power to extend the life of the petition was available to him  it should be exercised  He referred to his orders of   April   that Mr Snelgrove was to file and serve updated affidavits of search and debt no later than   April   and that both parties were to file and serve further submissions no later than   April    His Honour said  at     The steps required of the parties were to be taken up to a date after the   month period elapsed  It would have made no sense at all to make the orders in those terms if the creditor s petition was not to be extended   Prima facie  the petitioning creditor has a good case for applying the slip rule on the basis that if the issue had been adverted to at the time either the petition would have been extended or different procedural orders would have been made   my emphasis   The passage emphasised by me shows that Driver FM s understanding was that the date   April   was a date after the petition had lapsed  Since the only other date in contention was   April   his Honour s understanding must have been that the petition lapsed on that date and his Honour s reference to   April in the passage at   of his reasons set out at   below makes it clear that this was so  see the discussion of the present question at   below    In relation to the question whether the Federal Magistrates Court had had the requisite power to apply the slip rule  Driver FM considered that O   r   of the FC Rules applied in the Federal Magistrates Court as if it were a rule of that Court pursuant to Schedule   to the Federal Magistrates Court Rules    Cth   FMC Rules   Driver FM gave as a  second reason  why the Federal Magistrates Court had the requisite power  the fact that that Court shared coextensive jurisdiction with this Court in bankruptcy  His Honour also referred to s   of the Federal Magistrates Act    Cth    Having concluded that O   r   of the FC Rules was available to him  Driver FM noted that Mr Roskell submitted that he would have resisted an extension of the life of the petition if application for it had been made before the expiration of the   month period  His Honour had no doubt that Mr Roskell would have done so  but said that the petition would nonetheless have been extended and that the matter would have proceeded in accordance with his other orders or that different procedural orders would have been made  His Honour said  at                Having decided that I should await the decision of the High Court and then having decided that I should receive written submissions on the significance of the High Court s judgment within the period specified in the order  I am certain that if I had adverted to the issue at the time I would have extended the life of the petition on   April    The issue did not occur to me at the time  Although the then solicitor for the petitioning creditor had been instructed to raise it  she neglected to do so  The issue can and now should be dealt with prior to the final expiry of the creditor s petition on   April this year                 I therefore order pursuant to order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules and s   of the Bankruptcy Act that the petition filed on   April   be extended until   April     my emphasis  Driver FM then said that on the basis that the petition was revived  there was no remaining impediment to the making of a sequestration order because he had dealt with the issue of the existence of the debt in his first judgment and had now dealt with the remaining issues   Mr Roskell s amended notice of appeal set out eight grounds  of which only three related to the lapsing of the petition and the invocation of the slip rule to extend its life retrospectively  On the hearing of the appeal  Mr Roskell did not address those grounds  Rather  he addressed the underlying merits  although not by reference specifically to his grounds of appeal   As noted earlier  Mr Roskell did not appeal against the judgment of Jacobson J  It is not open to me to revisit matters which  on a fair reading of their Honours  reasons  were decided against him in the earlier judgment of Driver FM and of Jacobson J   Pursuant to a reference made under O   of the FC Rules  Mr David Ash of counsel has assisted by making written submissions on behalf of Mr Roskell  I gratefully acknowledge the considerable assistance Mr Ash has given to the Court   The lapsing of the petition and Driver FM s reliance on the slip rule in O   r   of the FC Rules raised the following questions  by reference to which Mr Ash s submissions were structured     Was O   r   of the Rules available to Driver FM         If   yes  to   was there an accidental slip or omission for the purposes of O   r      If  yes  to   and   did O   r   enable Driver FM to extend the life of the creditor s petition by an order made on   April   with retrospective effect     If  yes  to     and   was it open to Driver FM to make the particular order that he made extending the life of the petition to   April  citedRe Howell  Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   The
