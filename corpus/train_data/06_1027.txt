Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cambur  with Corrigendum dated   August     FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd  ACN         ATPR     The Commission asked me to incorporate in the orders the findings of fact made for the purpose of determining the appropriate penalties and other remedies  I do not think that it is appropriate to do that for a number of reasons  First  it would make the orders of the court unnecessarily lengthy and it would raise the question of what findings should or should not be included  Secondly  such a course would create a risk of inconsistency between the findings in the orders and the findings in the reasons for judgment  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd  ACN         ATPR      Reference was made by the Commission to s   of the Act  but that section does not suggest that such a course is necessary or appropriate  The findings of fact in the reasons for judgment can be proved in the manner contemplated by the section   Cambur Industries was incorporated in   and it carries on business as an importer and wholesale supplier of electrical goods  homeware products and tableware products  The company s business is divided into three divisions  which correspond to those different types of goods  The evidence is that for the most part the divisions operate separately   The electrical goods supplied by Cambur Industries include kitchen products manufactured under two well known brand names  Bamix and Magimix  such as stick mixers  juicers  food processors and coffee machines  The coffee machines are referred to as  dual branded  Nespresso Magimix  The contraventions in this case relate to the supply of the Bamix and Magimix products and the Nespresso Magimix coffee machines  I will refer to these products as  the Cambur products  except where it is necessary to distinguish between them   The head office of Cambur Industries is in Victoria and the company has a regional office in New South Wales  The company has salespeople in Victoria  New South Wales and Adelaide  In the other States and Territories it operates through commission agents  Cambur Industries has about   employees  of whom approximately   per cent are full time employees and   per cent are part time employees   The electrical goods division of Cambur Industries has four employees  one of whom is Mr Caulfield  who is the sales and marketing manager  The other three staff members report to him and he in turn reports to the managing director  Mr Caulfield is   years old and has worked as a salesperson for a number of years  Mr Caulfield and his wife have a small shareholding in Cambur Industries  Mr Caulfield is effectively the product manager for the Bamix and Magimix products  including the Nespresso Magimix coffee machines  At the time of the conduct that contravened the Act  he was the one who made the decisions on behalf of Cambur Industries about the marketing and distribution of the Cambur products  At the time of the contravening conduct  Mr Caulfield was working in South Australia referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd     ALR   In fixing the pecuniary penalties  I have had regard to the cases to which I was referred  It is important to bear in mind that other cases are no more than a guide and there is an obvious danger in attempting too close a comparison for the purposes of fixing a penalty  In particular  there is a danger in taking a broadly analogous case and the penalty imposed in that case and then adding for circumstances considered more serious  and subtracting for circumstances considered less serious  Bearing those observations in mind  two cases which I have found quite helpful are Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd     ALR   and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Westminster Retail Pty Ltd   ATPR       Injunctions might still be appropriate even if the likelihood of future contraventions is slight  if future contraventions are likely to cause significant damage to other persons  cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd  supra  at   per Goldberg J  Without wishing to minimise the seriousness of the contravening conduct here  I do not think this case falls into that category   For these reasons  I decline to grant the injunctions sought by the Commission   The Commission seeks an order that the respondents pay its costs of an incidental to the proceeding to be agreed or taxed  The respondents do not dispute the fact that they must pay the applicant s costs  The parties have attempted to agree an amount for costs  but have been unable to do so  In the circumstances  it is appropriate to make the order sought by the Commission referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc     ALR   Cambur Industries proffers an undertaking that it will maintain the compliance programme formulated by Mr Dee in January   for a period of three years  The Court s power to accept an undertaking is constrained by the limits of its power to make an order to similar effect as the undertaking  The Court s power to make an order that a contravener comply with a compliance programme is contained in s   or s  C of the Act  As far as s   is concerned  a training programme may go no further than the contravening conduct  or  it seems  that Part of the Act in which the section contravened appears  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z Tek Computer Pty Ltd     FCR   Australian Competition and

Ltd     FCR   Cambur Industries proffers an undertaking that it will maintain the compliance programme formulated by Mr Dee in January   for a period of three years  The Court s power to accept an undertaking is constrained by the limits of its power to make an order to similar effect as the undertaking  The Court s power to make an order that a contravener comply with a compliance programme is

  ALR   at         and   per French J  The programme which may be the subject of an order under s  C is a programme relating to  the contravening conduct  similar conduct or related conduct  referred toFoster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  ABN           FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Commission in this case only seeks injunctions to restrain conduct which would constitute a contravention of the Act and does not seek to restrain conduct which would not or may not constitute a contravention of the Act  In an appropriate case it seems the court has the power to make such orders  Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR    In this case  the granting of injunctions would add only one remedy  ie  a remedy for contempt of court  to those provided by the Act   Generally speaking  injunctions which do no more than restrain contraventions of the Act will have little impact in terms of general deterrence  The pecuniary penalties are likely to have the greatest impact in that respect  Injunctions restraining no more than contraventions of the Act may have an effect in terms of personal deterrence and may be granted because of that consideration  They may also be granted because  in a particular case  they will reduce the likelihood of further contraventions  In this case  I am satisfied that the possibility of further contraventions is slight  Although Cambur Industries should have exercised greater control over Mr Caulfield  it was Mr Caulfield who was responsible for the contraventions  I am satisfied that the investigation  court proceedings  and pecuniary penalty I propose to impose has had and will have a very significant impact on him in terms of deterrence and  coupled with the compliance programme put in place by Cambur Industries  means it is very unlikely that he will engage in contravening conduct in the future   As far as Cambur Industries and Mr Jeffs are concerned  I am satisfied that Mr Jeffs  lack of knowledge of the provisions of the Act  his lack of control and supervision of Mr Caulfield  and the lack of education programmes and checks and balances to ensure compliance with the Act have now been addressed and  coupled with the pecuniary penalty I propose to impose on Cambur Industries  means it is very unlikely that the company will engage in contravening conduct in the future referred toICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   Under s   of the Act  the court may grant an injunction in such terms as the court determines to be appropriate  The section provides that the court may grant an injunction whether or not the person intends to engage in the relevant conduct again  whether or not the person has previously engaged in the relevant conduct and whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first mentioned person engages in the relevant conduct  s   of the Act  These matters  which are often highly relevant to whether a court exercising equitable jurisdiction grants an injunction in an action between private parties  are of much less relevance when a court is considering the power to grant an injunction under s    However  they are not irrelevant to the exercise of that power  ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   at     per Lockhart J referred toNW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     FCR   I start by reminding myself of some well known general principles relevant to the fixing of pecuniary penalties  What follows is taken from the reasons for judgment of Burchett and Keifel JJ in NW Frozen Foods v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     FCR     First  the effect of the respondent s conduct on the function of markets and other economic effects of the conduct will generally be regarded as a significant matter  and the court is likely to be assisted by views put forward by the Commission  or by experts called on behalf of the parties  at    In this case  the Commission put forward no direct evidence as to the effects of the respondents  conduct on the function of the relevant market   Secondly  deterrence  both general and personal  is important in assessing the appropriate penalty  It has been described as a  principal purpose  of s   and a factor of  particular significance   see the cases referred to at    However  at the same time  it is important that the penalty imposed is not oppressive   Thirdly  cooperation and the implementation of a compliance programme by the contravener is also an important matter in fixing the appropriate penalty  Burchett and Keifel JJ said  at      Where the Commission established to administer the Act is satisfied that an appropriate programme has been undertaken  or the undertaking of it is proved to the Court  this is the most important matter to take into account on penalty   Fourthly  the penalties imposed in one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in another case  That follows from the fact that the circumstances in two cases are rarely the same or equal   The fifth point is perhaps an observation more than anything else  Burchett and Keifel JJ expressed the view that the penalties imposed by s   are not criminal sanctions and their purpose  established now by a long line of cases  is not punishment  at      Carr J  on the other hand  considered that the question was an open one  at     Section   identifies four matters which are relevant to the determination of the appropriate pecuniary penalty  They are       the nature and extent of the act or omission     the loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission     the circumstances in which the act or omission took place  and          whether the contravening company and accessory have been found guilty of previous relevant contraventions   The above matters are not exhaustive of all the relevant circumstances  NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  supra  per Burchett and Keifel JJ  at    Other factors have also been identified  such as the respondents  financial position and any profit made by the contravening company  A number of the matters overlap and  clearly  the significance or weight to be accorded to any particular matter will depend on the circumstances of the particular case   As to the nature and extent of the acts constituting the contravening conduct  in the case of Pete N Peppa I have found that there were eight acts which contravened s   of the Act  Those acts occurred over a period of about   months and the conduct culminated in the withholding of supply of Cambur products  In the case of Tabletop and Kitchen  there were four acts which contravened s    Those acts occurred over a period of about three and a half years from January   to July   during which time  as a result of the respondents  conduct  Tabletop and Kitchen did not discount Cambur products   As to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravening conduct  there are two groups which may have suffered loss or damage and they are the retailers and consumers  There is no precise evidence of loss or damage suffered by either group  As far as retailers are concerned  it was suggested that retailers other than Pete N Peppa or Tabletop and Kitchen may have been induced not to discount  Certainly there is evidence to suggest Mr Caulfield was speaking to other retailers about the price of Cambur products  but I do not think that I could find on the evidence that other retailers suffered loss or did not discount so that they or consumers suffered loss and damage  Mr Milosevic of Pete N Peppa gives some general evidence of loss and damage suffered by Pete N Peppa when he says that the Bamix and Magimix products were the best on the market and Pete N Peppa lost money because they were not selling them and were sending customers to other stores  There is no evidence from Mr Mitchell or Ms Gilbert of Tabletop and Kitchen of the effect of the contravening conduct on the business of Tabletop and Kitchen  I am prepared to assume that some loss was suffered by Pete N Peppa and Tabletop and Kitchen  but I can be no more precise than that  The conduct in each case occurred over a considerable period of time and Bamix and Magimix products were popular in the marketplace  Both businesses sought to discount the products  As far as the effect on consumers is concerned  I am prepared to assume that some loss and damage was caused because consumers could not buy discounted Cambur products from Pete N Peppa and Tabletop and Kitchen referred toRural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is common ground that it is appropriate to make declarations and the only question is the form of those declarations  A declaration under the Act and s   of the Federal Court Act    Cth  must identify the contravening conduct  It must be precise in its terms  such that a person reading the declaration understands the nature of the contravention and  in broad terms  the conduct constituting the contravention  On the one hand  it is not necessary to put all the relevant findings of fact in the declaration  but  on the other  the gist of the conduct  as found  should be identified  Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR   at         per Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ   The declarations I am prepared to make are set out at the end of these reasons  They are similar to the declarations put forward by the Commission  with the qualification that I have identified eight acts of resale price maintenance in relation to Pete N Peppa and four acts of resale price maintenance in the case of Tabletop and Kitchen  I do not think it offends any principle to declare that some acts referred to in the declarations fall within more than one paragraph of s   of the Act and I have framed the declarations accordingly   The Commission seeks a series of injunctions against the respondents  The injunctions it seeks against Cambur Industries would restrain it from engaging in conduct in breach of s   of the Act by virtue of engaging in conduct which falls within the terms of s  a   b   d  and  f  of the Act for a period of three years  Similar injunctions are sought in relation to Mr Caulfield  the first restraining him from being involved in contravening conduct by a corporation and the second restraining him from being involved in conduct where the recipient of the goods is a corporation  see s   referred toTrade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR     In Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR     French J identified other relevant matters as follows       the size of the contravening company           the degree of power it has  as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market     the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended     whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level     whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act  as evidenced by educational programmes and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention  and     whether the company has shown a disposition to cooperate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention
