Australian Trade Commission v Isaac Jewellery Pty Ltd   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlSection   of the EMDG Act provides that the provisions of subsection   thereof apply if the requirements specified in ss  a  and  b  are satisfied  The fulfilment of the requirements in s  b ii  is conditional upon the satisfaction of the CEO of Austrade  and such satisfaction is to be determined by the application of the Guidelines  Once a determination has been made that the requirements are met  s   then directs Austrade to treat the particulars of the previous owner as being those of the applicant  Such determination requires a judgment to be made by the CEO of Austrade  As was observed in Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another   FCAFC         FCR   at   of a decision making process     t  his intellectual process involves matters of judgment and degree    That is  a decision is required  In the application of both s  b i  and  ii  a value judgment must be made by the decision maker  Under s  b i  a decision is required to be made in respect of the question whether the new owner is carrying on the old business or a part thereof  It follows that there has been a decision made by Austrade in respect of which an appeal may lie to this Court pursuant to s   of the AAT Act  Accordingly  the Court rejects the submission that the requirements of s   constitute jurisdictional facts  and that s  b i  is capable of determination by objective facts referred toAustralian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou     AAR  In Comcare v Etheridge and Others   FCAFC         FCR   at   the Full Court considered the nature of an appeal under s   of the AAT Act and determined that an appeal  on a question of law  is narrower than an appeal  that merely involves a question of law    The Court at   referred to the observations in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCAFC         AAR   which expressed approval of the observation of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou     AAR   at   where his Honour said    If the question  properly analysed  is not a question of law no amount of formulary like  erred in law  or  was open as a matter of law  can make it into a question of law referred toBirdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCAFC         AAR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn

FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe Court concludes that  since no factual questions are involved in such determination  the question as submitted is one solely of law  directing the Court s attention to the manner in which the Tribunal failed to discharge its obligations according to law       see Collins v Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Another   FCAFC         FCR   at

of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission and Another   HCA         CLR   at   the High Court of Australia observed    The term  jurisdictional fact   which may be a complex of elements  is often used to identify that criterion  satisfaction of which enlivens the power of the decision maker to exercise a discretion referred toGedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission   HCA         ALJR   at   the High Court said    The expression  jurisdictional fact  was used somewhat loosely in the course of submissions  Generally the expression is used to identify a criterion the satisfaction of which enlivens the exercise of the statutory power or discretion in question  If the criterion be not satisfied then the decision purportedly made in exercise of the power or discretion will have been made without the necessary statutory authority required of the decision maker
