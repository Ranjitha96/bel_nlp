Pacer v Star Kitchens Pty Limited   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAdams v Lambert   HCA    Full High Court   April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Star Kitchens then filed the bankruptcy notice on   August   and personally caused the same to be served  as stated above  upon Mr Pacer on   August    The bankruptcy notice served on Mr Pacer referred to an amount outstanding of     that amount comprised the abovementioned sum of     recorded on the certificate of Local Court judgment as well as an amount claimed in respect of interest accrued since the date of judgment  The calculation of that interest was explained in note   as follows     Judgment was entered against Frank Pacer in the Downing Centre Local Court on   April   for the sum of     plus interest to Judgment date        Interest on the Judgment debt is being claimed for the period from   April   to   August        It is apparent from the Magistrate s reasons for judgment that the amount awarded on   April   by way of quantum meruit was actually   plus costs  rather than      The costs order made against Mr Pacer in the Local Court proceeding initiated by Star Kitchens had not been assessed as at the time of filing the notice  and therefore the costs the subject of that order must have formed no part of the     judgment debt  In that regard it seems likely that the figure of     recorded in the certificate of judgment  which was of course issued on   August   incorporated the interest outstanding on the   judgment  calculated from   May   to   August   as ordered by the Magistrate  In those circumstances the bankruptcy notice would seem to have overstated the amount outstanding  insofar as it purported to levy interest upon the difference between     and   during the period from   April   to   August    That is not however fatal to the notice  see s   of the Act and Adams v Lambert   HCA    Full High Court   April     Before addressing the submissions made by the parties in respect of the application to set aside the judgment  it is appropriate to describe in more detail Mr Pacer s subsequent applications in the Local Court  On   August   following upon the Supreme Court s dismissal of his appeal from the Local Court judgment  Mr Pacer filed an amended statement of liquidated claim in proceedings no    of   which he had commenced in the Downing Centre Local Court against Star Kitchens on   November   as I have earlier recorded  Also on   August   Mr Pacer filed a notice of motion for a stay of the original Local Court judgment until the determination of those new proceedings  On   August   Star Kitchens filed a notice of motion seeking to have Mr Pacer s statement of claim struck out  pursuant either to Part   rule   of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules   as being frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court  or pursuant to Part   rule   as an abuse of process of the Court  Star Kitchen s notice of motion of   August   sought in the alternative an order for security for costs and a stay until such security was provided   On   October   a Magistrate dismissed Star Kitchen s application for summary dismissal  The Magistrate ordered that a stay of the original Local Court judgment should be granted  subject to Mr Pacer paying the abovementioned amount of     into Court as well as an amount necessary to cover the assessed costs of the original Local Court proceedings which had been successfully prosecuted by Star Kitchens  and also the costs of the proceedings in the Supreme Court  The costs of the original Local Court proceedings were assessed and recorded as     in a certificate of judgment dated   October    On the same day a certificate of judgment also issued out of the Local Court which recorded Star Kitchen s assessed costs of the Supreme Court proceedings as
