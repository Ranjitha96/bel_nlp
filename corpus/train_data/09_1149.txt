Nelson v Comcare   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedNelson v Comcare   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  htmlOn   March   the Tribunal affirmed the two decisions made by the respondent dated   September   and   May     Nelson v Comcare   AATA    The applicant appeals to this Court from that decision of the Tribunal pursuant to s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   An appeal under that section must be on a question of law  The applicant s Notice of Appeal raises four questions of law and advances several grounds in support of his contentions in respect of those questions of law  Despite the length of the Notice of Appeal  the applicant s appeal raises only one issue  namely  whether the Tribunal failed to address and make a determination concerning the applicant s contention that his underlying psychiatric condition was   aggravated   within the meaning of the definition of   disease   in s   of the Act by his employment with Centrelink  The applicant accepted that the above formulation of the matters which the applicant seeks to raise on appeal from the Tribunal captures the essence of the applicant s case on appeal  Section   of the Act provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death  incapacity for work or impairment appliedAustralian Postal Corporation v Sellick   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe applicant did argue before the Tribunal that his underlying condition

put  The Tribunal was obliged to turn its mind to the argument and to deal with the question of aggravation  It was a significant part of the applicant s case before the Tribunal  The argument was seriously advanced by the applicant and was worthy of serious consideration  Whilst it is true that the Tribunal is not required to consider and address every submission made to it  serious

htmlThe Tribunal then returned to the concept of   material contribution    At this point in its reasons  it referred to and discussed the judgment of Finn J in Comcare v Sahu Khan   FCA         FCR    The Tribunal then concluded its Reasons with the following  at       After considering all the evidence  in particular the possible factors that may have contributed to the onset or aggravation of the Applicant s psychiatric condition  we find that the circumstances of the Applicant s employment with Centrelink did not substantially contribute to his disease  Mr Nelson is not entitled to compensation pursuant to section   of the Act  It follows that he is not entitled to compensation in respect of medical expenses under section   nor is he entitled to compensation for incapacity under sections           or  A of the Act  The only places that the concept of   aggravation of an ailment   were mentioned at all in the Tribunal s Reasons was at    when s   of the Act was extracted  and at    In the present case  in order to make good the contention concerning aggravation of an existing ailment which the applicant submits was advanced to the Tribunal  the applicant would need to demonstrate that  at the time he commenced his employment with Centrelink  he was suffering an ailment within the relevant definition and that that ailment was aggravated  ie made more severe  by his employment by Centrelink or that the aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by his employment by Centrelink  The notion of material contribution was explained by Finn J in Sahu Khan   FCA       FCR    In that case  his Honour concluded that  in order to assess whether the aggravation of an ailment was contributed to in a material degree by the employee s employment  the Court was obliged to evaluate all relevant contributing factors in order to determine whether the employment made a contribution which was more than a mere contributing factor  His Honour described the exercise as a matter of fact and degree   Sahu Khan   FCA       FCR   at    p      The fundamental premise of the applicant s argument is that the Tribunal simply failed to address his case based upon alleged aggravation of an existing ailment  viz his underlying psychiatric condition   The Tribunal described the applicant s complaint at   of its Reasons as a complaint to the effect that his psychological condition was sustained because of his employment  That language tends to suggest that the Tribunal regarded the applicant s case as being confined to a case based upon the contention that he sustained an ailment as an employee of Centrelink  being an ailment that was contributed to in a material degree by Centrelink  The terms of the general formulation of the issue in   of the Tribunal s Reasons tend to suggest that the Tribunal did not regard aggravation of an existing ailment as being an alternative basis for the applicant s claims before it appliedDennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal
