  ACSR  The power conferred by s  A  of the Act is  subject to the Court and judge being satisfied that the conditions of s  C  are met in relation to the video link  an exercise of discretion that would not be ordered unless the Court or judge was satisfied that recourse to such a link was  in the particular circumstances of the case  appropriate  So understood  what was done in other cases is only of limited assistance  if any  So much was recognised by the Supreme Court of New South Wales  Austin J  in Australian Securities   Investments Commissioner v Rich   Ors     ACSR   at   although his Honour went on to observe that there are broadly two approaches exhibited by the observations in the cases one generally in favour of the use of audiovisual absent any impediment telling against its use  and the other a more cautious approach requiring good reason to be shown before leave to give evidence by means of video link was granted  At   his Honour observed    Apart from dealing with obvious practical matters such as comparative costs and the difficulty created by differences in time zones  the cases touch upon some recurring themes  the appropriateness of audiovisual facilities for centrally important evidence  the assessment of credit where evidence is given by audiovisual link  difficulties raised by the use of documents for cross examination in audiovisual evidence  technological difficulties due to lapse of time between transmission and receipt of questions and answers  and difficulties posed by the use of audiovisual facilities where the cross examination is lengthy  There are also comments on the general approach to be taken by the court to a proposal for evidence to be adduced using audiovisual facilities  I shall refer briefly to each of these matters

approval by a Full Court of this Court in Odhiambo v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     I agree with these observations  They illustrate the point that the choice in every case cannot be determined solely by reference to general principles because it is the application of those principles to the facts and circumstances of the particular case which must determine the choice  in the circumstances of a particular case  a matter may point one way and in another case it may point another way  At the end of the day  the exercise of the discretion as to what is appropriate in a particular case will involve a balancing exercise as to what will best serve the administration of justice consistently with maintaining justice between the parties  see Giles CJ in Sunstate Airlines at    The Present Case In the present case  I have come to the conclusion that I should decline to make the direction for the following primary reasons    There is no evidence before me that the Cooling Off Witnesses are not prepared to come to Sydney for the hearing or  through illness or otherwise  are unable to come  I accept that they are not compellable  but   of the   are still employees of StoresOnline and as StoresOnline will be bearing the cost of all travel and accommodation for all Cooling Off Witnesses  there is no financial disincentive for them in coming  References to their losing commission income while travelling and during their short stay here carries little weight  if any  particularly as it could no doubt be adjusted in their favour  by StoresOnline treating it as a  one week off  in the  two weeks on one week off  arrangement for Sales Staff deposed to by Mr Klotz     In my view  the overall savings in cost  by taking the evidence of the Cooling Off Witnesses by video link rather than having them come here to give their evidence viva voce   will be at best marginal and at worst more expensive  The savings deposed to by Mr Klotz are  in the scheme of things  not significant and do not take into account all the costs associated with and all the costs which will arise as a result of  recourse to a video link  It will  as submitted by the ACCC  require the ACCC to have an agent or agents at the remote location or locations to assist in the identification of documents during the course of cross examination  it will undoubtedly lengthen the time it takes to complete the cross examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses each day will at best be a half day due to time zone differences with attendant increase in the costs incurred for the additional time of counsel and instructing solicitors  and it would be common ground that these latter costs would quickly absorb and overtake any savings as between travel and accommodation costs on the one hand and the direct cost of utilising videoconference facilities on the other     Clearly there are issues of credit involved as between the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the Cooling Off Witnesses and the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the ACCC s witnesses who purchased StoresOnline packages at the relevant Workshops in Australia going to the factual issue of whether or not the purchasers of such packages were told  at any time up to and including the point of sale  about the  cooling off period   In my view  it is in the interests of maintenance of justice between the parties that that evidence  from both sides  be given in person     It is also clear that the cross examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses will go beyond their evidence in relation to the  cooling off period  issue  They will also be cross examined in relation to other allegations of breaches contained in the statement of claim  as well as on the systems and procedures in place with a view to ensuring compliance with the Undertaking  So understood  their evidence is  contrary to the submission of StoresOnline  centrally important to the outcome of the case     The anticipated size of the Court Book suggests that the Cooling Off Witnesses will be taken to a large number of documents in the course of their cross examination  I accept that the management of such a task can be effectively handled whilst utilising videoconference facilities albeit  as mentioned above  at an additional significant cost  At one level then  this consideration is central  But where  as here  issues of credit are involved  it impels a conclusion in favour of the evidence being given in person  There are other matters which I have weighed into the balancing exercise in reaching the conclusion I have  in addition to the primary matters referred to in   above  On their own  they are not critical  However  as part of the balancing exercise they are  in my view  relevant  for example  the Cooling Off Witnesses are all people who regularly travel  both domestically and internationally  for or on behalf of StoresOnline  While having them travel from the United States to Australia and return will involve them in some   hours of travel each way within a relatively short timeframe  this is something to which they are accustomed in the course of their duties  It could not be seen as imposing on them an unusual personal or physical burden  The motion must be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding seventeen   numbered
