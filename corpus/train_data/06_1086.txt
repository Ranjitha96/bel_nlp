Court in Parker v The Queen at pars     as follows      Applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so  the legislated time limits are not to be ignored  The applicant must show an  acceptable explanation for the delay  it must be  fair and equitable in the circumstances  to extend time     Action taken by the applicant  other than by way of making an

Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlDriver FM further found that in any event relief should be refused because the applicant had engaged in a scheme with an unknown person in order to mislead and deceive the Minister amounting to misconduct and the applicant should not enjoy the fruits of this scheme  Driver FM cited NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   in support of this proposition  Limitations of time in respect of filing and serving notices of appeal of decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court in the Federal Court are set out in O   r   Federal Court Rules   The rule provides        The notice of appeal shall be filed and served          a  within   days after              i  the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced     ii  the date when leave to appeal was granted  or    iii  any later date fixed for that purpose by the court appealed from  or            b  within such further time as is allowed by the Court or a Judge upon application made by motion upon notice filed within the period of   days referred to in the last preceding paragraph          Notwithstanding anything in the preceding subrule  the Court or a Judge for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal  The applicant in this case did not apply to the Court within   days of the judgment of Driver FM  The decision of Driver FM was handed down on   March   and the application for an extension of time was filed in this Court on   April   two days outside the timeframe  It follows that the applicant is required to seek the leave of this Court pursuant to O   r   to file and serve a notice of appeal  The first respondent  in written and oral submissions asserted that    the court below did not err in concluding that the protection visa application was valid notwithstanding that the applicant has signed it in a false name and made false claims  citing NAWZ   the court below never had jurisdiction so its order to dismiss the application with costs was an appropriate order   alternatively if the court below did have jurisdiction  there was no error in concluding that the protection visa application was valid and as such the application should have been dismissed with costs   even if the court below had jurisdiction and the protection visa application was invalid  relief should have been refused anyway given that the applicant had knowingly participated in a deception of the minister  The submissions of the applicant and the submissions of the first respondent are somewhat divergent  The applicant has directed his submissions  including assertions in his affidavit of   April   and his oral submissions  towards the delay in filing his notice of appeal  and addressing the decision of the Tribunal  The first respondent has focussed on the issue of the validity of the protection visa application and the validity of the decision of the Tribunal as determined by Driver FM  The case before Driver FM was determined by his Honour on the issue of the validity of the visa application and the Tribunal hearing  I have briefly recounted the reasons for this in this judgment  Driver FM explains the background in more detail in his judgment  In this case the applicant sought a show cause order in the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to r     Federal Magistrates Court Rules   which is as follows        Show cause hearing         At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause  the Court may             a  if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed    dismiss the application  or    b  if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed    adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court  or    c  without making an order under paragraph  b  make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application              To avoid doubt  a dismissal under paragraph  a  is interlocutory  Hearing the application on   February   it appears his Honour dismissed the application insofar as it attacked the merits of the Tribunal decision  As clear from r     that decision was interlocutory  His Honour went on however to grant the application in relation to the validity of the protection visa application and the Tribunal decision  which the learned Federal Magistrate heard on   March    The applicant could have sought leave to appeal the decision of Driver FM of   February   in relation to the dismissal of the show cause application relevant to the merits of the Tribunal decision  He did not do so  and is not doing so now  Instead he lodged an amended application in the Federal Magistrates Court as already discussed  Unfortunately  from the grounds which have been put before me in this matter  it is possible that the applicant did not understand that his Honour was dismissing that part of his application  To that extent  submissions of the applicant in relation to the merits of the Tribunal decision  and why he was unsuccessful before the Tribunal  are not relevant in this case  I note  for the benefit of the applicant  that this Court has a limited jurisdiction in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal  and in fact has no jurisdiction to review findings of fact by the Tribunal  nor investigate the merits of the applicant s claim  except to the extent that errors of law may be demonstrated  I also note however although this does not form part of my decision that the Tribunal appeared to give careful consideration to the claims of the applicant  including giving him the benefit of the doubt in respect of a number of his claims  but nonetheless affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa for reasons stated in their Decision Record  In relation to the submissions of the respondent  the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in NAWZ is applicable  Although made in the context of s   of the Act  I note in particular comments of their Honours at par        We do not consider that the irregular manner of filling in and signing of the false application resulted in the invalidity of the application  It was a false application but it was  in formal terms  a valid application  In this case  the applicant had completed an application for a protection visa under a false name  and signed it  As Driver FM pointed out  that fact alone does not render the application invalid  it was the applicant s application regardless of what name he chose to use on it  and it was a complete application regardless of whether the claims and other details in it were true or false  Further  in my view it would be contrary to public policy to allow the applicant to claim that the process of lodgement of a protection visa was flawed because he had lodged the first application under a false name  for whatever reason  cf NAWZ at par    Accordingly on this reasoning both the decision of the delegate of the Minister and the Tribunal were valid appliedParker v The Queen   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe principles applicable to an extension of time are well settled  Whilst it is important that parties observe the time limits set by the Rules  the Court does have discretion to extend time to permit a notice of appeal to be filed in order to avoid injustice where a party has missed a prescribed deadline for filing   Parker v The Queen   FCAFC   at pars      The applicant must however demonstrate  special
