austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant  Clough Engineering Ltd  by motion seeks an order granting leave to appeal from a judgment  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No     FCA   given on   December    The motion is supported by an affidavit of Natalie Jane Wigg sworn   January   deposing to the applicant s belief that there are reasonable grounds to appeal  The grounds of appeal are set out in a draft Notice of Appeal dated   January    The first respondent  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited  ONGC  has filed an affidavit sworn on   February   by its solicitor Mr Dean Edward Grondal  It contains matters concerning the pending arbitration proceedings commenced in India by Clough against ONGC in which various very substantial claims are made arising from the Construction Contract to which I refer below   Clough and ONGC  are parties to a construction contract  Construction Contract   The formal contract was made on   January    It is a lump sum contract in excess of US  million and is for the development of certain oil and gas fields in the Krishna Godavari Basin located off the coast of the State of Andhra Pradesh in India  Additionally  onshore facilities were to be constructed at Odalarevu  near Amalapuram also in Andhra Pradesh  Clough is an Australian company  ONGC is an Indian company   By instruments dated January    performance guarantees  each of the second to fourth Respondents  Banks  equally between them guaranteed the payment of   of the contract price to ONGC  This equated to a little more than US    million appliedD cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   The well known test generally applied is whether the decision below is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by an appellate court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused  supposing the decision to be wrong  D cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc

Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     French J with whom the other members of the Court agreed  said that a  prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal  if the judgment  although interlocutory  has the practical operation of finally determining the rights of the parties   Clough contends that for the Court to refuse leave would effectively deny it of the right to appeal from a final decision as to the construction of an important provision of the Construction Contract as well as in relation to the following matters         a  whether ONGC was entitled under the Construction Contract  on its proper construction  to call on the performance guarantees               b  whether ONGC acted unconscionably in contravention of s  AA of the Trade Practices Act    Cth    TPA   in calling on the performance guarantees  in all of the circumstances               c  whether Clough was  in fact and demonstrably  in breach of an obligation to renew the performance guarantees and an obligation to provide insurance certificates to ONGC  thereby depriving Clough s prima facie claim  which the primary judge accepted was made out  that Clough was entitled to relief for ONGC s contravention of s  AA of the TPA   and              d  whether the performance guarantees are not unconditional but conditional and whether they required ONGC to specify the amount actually payable by the banks  rather than making an umbrella claim for the full amount   I made a final determination as to the proper construction of cl       although the motion then before me was interlocutory in nature  Clough Engineering Ltd  No   at       It submits that this distinguishes this case from those contemplated in Johnson Tiles at    The  practical operation  of the judgment  it says  is not to determine finally the rights of the parties because the proper construction of cl       of the Construction Contract and the entitlement of ONGC to call upon the performance guarantees are all live issues  amongst others  in the arbitration proceedings  Further ONGC  through counsel  undertook to the Court that it would not raise the judgment of this Court as any barrier to those issues being determined again in the arbitration  That is not to say that the judgment of this Court would not be pressed on the Indian Arbitrators by ONGC as carrying considerable weight   The view I take is that the judgment has the practical effect of determining the parties  rights  It is no answer to say that a different result might ensue in a different proceeding in another jurisdiction which could have the result of restoring the position of Clough   In any event  if an appeal were successful it would not be necessary to prosecute that aspect of Clough s claims in the arbitration  The effect  then  of the submission is that the arbitration proceedings provide Clough with a de facto appeal  In my opinion  Clough ought be entitled to exhaust its legal entitlements in this Court citedVisy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     FCR   The judgment  whilst interlocutory  is one on points of substance
