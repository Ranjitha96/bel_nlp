Holdings Pty Ltd v ACCC     FCR     A preliminary question involves the relevance  if any  of the findings of fact made by Heerey J in Visy No   to these proceedings  given that his Honour had before

simply rely on the facts found by Heerey J in deciding whether to uphold the ACCC s claim of litigation privilege  Rather  the primary submission of the ACCC is that the principle of stare decisis should lead me to reach the same result when the settled elements of litigation privilege are applied to the facts relating to the Hodgson Interview transcript which I must independently find based on

stare decisis does not apply because the evidence now before the Court that was not before Heerey J should give rise to different findings of fact and compel a different result  The contents of the stare decisis principle are not in dispute  e g  Re Tyler  ex parte Foley   HCA         CLR          per McHugh J  and Bristol Myers Squibb Company v FH Faulding   Co Limited   FCA         FCR   at          In fact  as we are all taught at law school  the more closely the facts of a subsequent case are aligned to those of an earlier case  the more compelling is the case for the application of stare decisis   Cadbury s third challenge is limited only to the  dominant purpose  element of the privilege claim  Again  given the way in which I have addressed the issues raised in this proceeding  it is unnecessary to address this contention  However  for the sake of completeness  I will say a few words about it  Cadbury accepts that the Heerey J s finding with respect to the date from which litigation was anticipated was part of the ratio of the case  but disputes that dominant purpose was also part of the ratio  I do not accept that submission  In my view  Heerey J s finding as to dominant purpose was part of the ratio in Visy No   in that it was a necessary part of his Honour s decision  It is true that the  principal issue  before the Court in Visy No   was whether litigation could be said to have been reasonably anticipated by   December   Visy No   at    However  the overall question before Heerey J was whether the   documents  including the Hodgson Interview transcript  were protected from disclosure by litigation privilege  Although the date issue may have been the principal issue  in the sense that it was the most contentious and was the focus of argument  it was not the only issue necessary to the Court s decision to uphold the privilege claim  As noted earlier  there are at least two elements to a claim of litigation privilege  both of which must be satisfied in order to make good the claim  Had the Court not made a positive finding with respect to both in Visy No     it could not have upheld the claim  As such  Cadbury s contention now that Heerey J s conclusion with respect to dominant purpose was not part of the ratio of the case must fail  see Bristol Myers at    per Finkelstein J   considering that  the ratio of a case should at least include every ruling on a point of law that is treated by the judge as a necessary step in reaching his ultimate conclusion in a case    Furthermore  nothing that was said by the Full Court on appeal dissuades me from that view  Cadbury cites the reasons of Lander J as recording that the issue before the trial judge  was whether at the time particular documents came into existence legal proceedings were reasonably contemplated  Visy Holdings     FCR   at    That quotation is taken out of context and does not accurately reflect Lander J s views as to the issues in the case  What Lander J actually described as the issues in the case before Heerey J is found earlier in his Honour s reasons  at    emphasis added  There were three issues for determination before Heerey J  The first was whether the ACCC s claim for legal professional privilege was validly made  This issue required a finding as to the date upon which it could be said that litigation was reasonably anticipated by the ACCC  The claim for privilege also raised the question whether the dominant purpose of the creation of the documents was for use in litigation as distinct from investigation  Heerey J found against the applicants and found that the documents were created at a time when litigation was reasonably anticipated and for the purpose of use in that litigation  The respondent filed a notice of contention claiming that Heerey J s order in this regard should be affirmed on the further ground that the documents were privileged having been brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice in relation to the proceeding  Because leave to appeal was refused  the notice of contention does not need to be considered  The second issue required consideration as to whether certain documents relating to the grant by the ACCC of immunity and or leniency to Amcor were discoverable at all or only relevant as to credit  Justice Heerey found that the documents were not discoverable  The third issue was in relation to the pleadings and the applicants  amended defence  in particular  paras    aa   ad   Justice Heerey struck out this part of the applicants  defence   In other words  Lander J  with whom Moore J agreed  explicitly found that the question of dominant purpose was an issue before Heerey J and necessary to his Honour s resolution of the application  I am therefore of the view that the reasons of Lander J in fact support the view that Heerey J s finding in regards to dominant purpose was part of the ratio of the case   For the foregoing reasons  the applicant s notice of motion dated   October   will be dismissed appliedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd     ALR   The ACCC opposes Cadbury being granted leave to uplift the transcript on the basis that the Hodgson Interview transcript is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege   specifically  litigation privilege   held by the ACCC  I previously considered at some length  in these proceedings  the legal principles and elements supporting a legal professional privilege claim  Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd     ALR     Cadbury I    In Cadbury I   I noted that it is settled that for a claim of litigation privilege to be upheld  the document or communication in question must have been made   in anticipation of  or during  litigation  and   for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or evidence for the litigation  Cadbury I at    I observed that there might be a third element of confidentiality  particularly with respect to communications with a third party witness  but that that aspect of litigation privilege is still unsettled  Cadbury I at    Due to a concession on the part of Cadbury  I did not need to consider the confidentiality question further in that decision citedNational Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited v Grosvenor Hill  Qld    FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A preliminary question involves the relevance  if any  of the findings of fact made by Heerey J in Visy No   to these proceedings  given that his Honour had before him among the   challenged documents the same Hodgson Interview transcript now sought here  It is trite that  as a matter of common and statutory law  findings of fact in one judgment are inadmissible in a subsequent proceeding as

appliedPratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In other words there was  as often happens in communications between two parties  a disconnect between the dominant purposes of each party for engaging in the communication  The question is whose purpose is relevant  In Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR     it was made clear  at   that the relevant purpose is that of the person who procured the creation of the communication or document  In this case  the creation of both the communication  the Hodgson Interview  and the document  transcript  containing that communication was procured by the ACCC  that the ACCC had to offer and discuss immunity for Hodgson in order to get them was incidental to fulfilment of that dominant purpose  The correspondence and memoranda relied on by Cadbury  while illuminating the concerns of the interviewee Hodgson and the ACCC discussions of the means by which to meet those concerns and obtain the information sought  do not support a finding that the ACCC s dominant purpose was other than to investigate and prosecute suspected cartel conduct   In my view  a review of all the documents identified by Cadbury confirms that the investigative purpose acknowledged by Cadbury  albeit incompletely  was in fact the dominant one  That is to say  as Cadbury accepted in its written submissions  the ACCC sought an interview of Hodgson to further its investigation  but that statement of purpose is not complete without answering the questions  investigation of what  and  to what end   A letter from the ACCC to Hodgson s lawyers dated   December   and attached to an affidavit of a solicitor for Cadbury answers the first question  It indicates that the ACCC at that time was investigating  alleged cartel conduct engaged in by Amcor Limited and other corporations in relation to the supply of corrugated fibreboard containers   A letter from the ACCC to Hodgson s lawyer dated   December   and attached to an affidavit of a solicitor for the ACCC answers the second question   Cadbury did not argue that Hodgson never received the   December letter  but objected to it on the basis that there was no evidence that it was sent on   December rather than provided to Hodgson at the interview on   December  However  I do not consider that anything turns on whether Hodgson received it on   December or instead   December   The   December letter indicates that the ACCC sought information from Hodgson for the purpose of  the investigation and any ensuing Court proceedings  including execution of affidavits and giving of evidence in Court proceedings  In other words  the letter shows that the dominant purpose of the interview was for the ACCC to obtain and assess evidence for Court proceedings then in contemplation appliedRyan v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Ryan v The Queen   HCA         CLR     McHugh J quoted with approval the following views of the eminent US jurist Dean Roscoe Pound  at    emphasis added    A single decision as an analogy  as a starting point to develop a principle  is a very different thing from the decision on a particular state of facts which announces a rule  When the court has that same state of facts before it  unless there is some very controlling reason  it is expected to adhere to the former decision  But when it gives  sic  further and endeavors to formulate a principle  stare decisis does not mean that the first tentative gropings for the principle     are of binding authority   Emphasis added  As noted earlier  the Court has before it now one of the same documents as was before Heerey J in Visy No   and in respect of which again a claim of litigation privilege is made  Particularly where his Honour s judgment accepting the privilege claim over the Hodgson Interview transcript was upheld by the Full Court  I would expect to be presented with some very compelling reasons for departing from it  Cadbury has pointed to a number of contemporaneous documents comprising internal ACCC memoranda and notes as well as correspondence between the ACCC and Hodgson  It contends that this evidence  much of which was not before Heerey J  leads or should lead to different findings of fact and this provides a compelling reason to depart from the view taken in Visy No     I disagree   It is not necessary to recite the contents of the documents cited by Cadbury in detail  it suffices to say that they were put forward to establish  and do establish  two factual propositions    that the decision to interview Hodgson was made prior to   December   and   there was a great deal of discussion regarding whether and on what terms Hodgson would receive immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation and any subsequent legal proceedings  the Immunity Question   With respect to the first point  Cadbury did not appear to quibble with the proposition that the  in anticipation of litigation  prong of the privilege test turns on when the communication or document was actually generated rather than when the decision to create it was made  Rather  Cadbury contended that the evidence that the decision was taken prior to the date when litigation was found by Heerey J to have been reasonably anticipated supported the proposition that the interview could not have been made for the dominant purpose of the litigation  However that may be  I am independently satisfied based on Cadbury s own evidence  including the letters of   and   December    referred to below  that litigation was reasonably anticipated no later than   December   the date of the Hodgson Interview   On the Immunity Question  Cadbury made the following written and oral submissions regarding dominant purpose based on that evidence   namely  that there was no dominant purpose of the Hodgson interview  but rather a variety of purposes including    to perform the interview directed by senior officials of the ACCC on   December     to obtain information from Hodgson to assist the investigation    to obtain Hodgson s agreement to the conditions set out in the ACCC  s   December   letter offering conditional immunity in exchange for cooperation  and   to confirm Hodgson s understanding that the offer of immunity was conditional  The first purpose described by Cadbury may be rejected out of hand   while the interview may have been conducted at the behest of senior ACCC personnel  one must of course ask why they made that order   The third and fourth purposes ascribed to the interview by Cadbury must be rejected because they reflect a misapprehension of how dominant purpose is to be assessed  I would be prepared to accept that the correspondence shows that the dominant purpose  and possibly even sole purpose  of Hodgson in attending the   December   interview was to obtain immunity  It is therefore unsurprising that the documents would reflect an understanding of this point by the ACCC and an attempt to respond to the interests of the interviewee citedRe Tyler  ex parte Foley   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Cadbury s primary contention is its second   that stare decisis does not apply because the evidence now before the Court that was not before Heerey J should give rise to different findings of fact and compel a different result  The contents of the stare decisis principle are not in dispute  e g  Re Tyler  ex parte Foley   HCA         CLR

are aligned to those of an earlier case  the more compelling is the case for the application of stare decisis followedVisy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd v ACCC     FCR   In Australian Competition and
