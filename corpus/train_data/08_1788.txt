Klewer has had every opportunity to present submissions  including numerous written submissions  in support of the appeal  Other than to reassert the fact that she holds the Korora property on trust for Robert Klewer which his Honour did not accept  she has not suggested any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in respect of his Honour s finding that there was no trust  Ms Klewer has not suggested that his Honour s findings of fact in relation to the alleged trust were   glaringly improbable   or that his Honour had in some way   failed to use or     palpably misused his advantage   as the trial judge   Fox v Percy   HCA         CLR     In her oral submissions on   October   Ms Klewer asserts the existence of a trust  express  implied or constructive  She also asserts that there is a written will  which accords with a testamentary disposition of the Korora property   Ms Klewer maintains that she made a  living will  and intended to and did transfer the Korora property to Robert Klewer  so that she held the property in trust for him  However  apart from an assertion that a written version must exist somewhere on a computer disk which she has not been able to locate  there is nothing in writing evidencing such a trust referred toIn re Parsons  Stockley v Parsons     Ch D   As the respondent has pointed out  there is an inconsistency between Ms Klewer s continued assertion that she created a testamentary trust and her statements to the effect that she intended the trust over the Korora property to take effect while she was still alive  If Ms Klewer s intention was to create a testamentary trust  then even if the will were in writing  this would not give rise to any legal or equitable right on the part of Robert Klewer while Ms Klewer remains alive  A   beneficiary under  a  will derives  while the testator remains alive  no legal or equitable right or title from the will  all the beneficiary has is the prospect of acquiring a right or title if the testator dies in the lifetime of the prospective beneficiary without revoking or altering the will    R Meagher  J Heydon and M Leeming  Meagher  Gummow and Lehane s Equity  Doctrines   Remedies   th

  FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The appellants appeal from a decision of Raphael FM dismissing their application for a declaration that the Korora property is non divisible among Ms Klewer s creditors   Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FMCA    Ms Klewer argued before Raphael FM that the Korora property is not divisible amongst her creditors for two reasons  that the moneys used to purchase the property constituted  protected money  within the meaning of s  D  of the Act and that the Korora property was held in trust by Ms Klewer for Robert Klewer and was therefore not property divisible amongst Ms Klewer s creditors by virtue of the operation of s  a  of the Act   On   March   the appellants filed a notice of appeal   from part of the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court    The ground of appeal was    That the evidence supports the existence of a trust    On   June   an amended notice of appeal was filed from the whole of the judgment of Raphael FM  The sole ground of appeal is    Procedural unfairness    No particulars are provided   At the hearing of this appeal  Ms Klewer says that her grounds of appeal are    Procedural unfairness  because        She appeared by telephone before the Federal Magistrate    She was unable to hear everything that was said during the hearing before the Federal Magistrate    The Federal Magistrate did not cross examine her other children who had filed affidavits    The Federal Magistrate  assumed  what the other children had meant from their statements and drew the wrong conclusions from those statements    She and her son did not have legal representation      That the evidence established an express trust in favour of Robert Klewer  or  in the alternative  an implied or constructive trust
