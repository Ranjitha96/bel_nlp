Inamed Development Company v Morton Surgical Pty Limited   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedJupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd     ALR   It was then contended that none of the evidence of any significance was admissible or  if admissible  was of such little weight that it ought be rejected pursuant to s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   I agree with that submission in relation to a significant portion of the evidence namely that relating to construction of both the patent in suit and the priority document  In my opinion  that evidence does not supply technical explanations from the deponent s field of expertise that would assist in placing the Court in the position of a skilled addressee of those documents  Rather  they constitute the reading of the documents by the deponent    Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd     ALR   at     In my opinion  that evidence is not admissible and  if it were  it would be rejected pursuant to s   of the Evidence Act    Cth    I do not need to make a formal ruling as to admissibility  I indicate I will not grant leave to read paragraphs      inclusive    and      inclusive  of the affidavit   Paragraphs      inclusive  of the affidavit could conceivably be relevant to the issue of inventive step  Standing alone  they would not be sufficient to establish the point  However  the issues raised by s   and s   of the Patents Act    Cth  involve a number of factual aspects that may be proved from a number of sources  As was said in Jupiters   ALR   at       Section   of the Act refers to the hypothetical person  skilled in the relevant art in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim   That person is wholly hypothetical  Much evidence is admissible from persons none of whom would precisely answer the statutory description  Some may be more skilled in the relevant art than others  Some may be skilled and inventive  some may be brilliant  some may be plodders  some may be aware of particular pieces of art claimed to be part of the common general knowledge and others not  It is for the Court  having admitted relevant evidence  to come to a conclusion as to the application of the section      See also  generally  Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd  No       ALR     It is not possible to rule in advance as to that issue citedLenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC  Advances  Ltd     FCR   The role of case management is relevant  The wide scope of O   of the Federal Court Rules is well established  eg Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC  Advances  Ltd     FCR   see also s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   In my opinion  the effect of the decision of the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   on case management has been exaggerated  It dealt with a special situation prevention of litigating a fairly arguable defence some months before a trial date  Even so  it may prove to be the high water mark of anti case management philosophy  probably as a reaction to some perceived over zealous case management in New South Wales at the time  The decision in Sali v SPC Ltd   HCA         ALR       ALJR   still needs to be considered  In any event  the evidence of one expert is not necessary to achieve the attainment of justice citedLockwood
