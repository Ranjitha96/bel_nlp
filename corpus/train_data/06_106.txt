A  v Australian Crime Commission   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedRyder v Morley     FCR   In my opinion  the argument is not sustainable  In Ryder v Morley     FCR     Ryder v Morley   the Full Court  Fox  Jenkinson and Wilcox JJ  rejected an identical argument in the context of s   of the NCA Act   The case concerned a search warrant that was issued to a detective sergeant in the Australian Federal Police  He had been seconded to the NCA to assist it with a particular investigation  The applicant argued that a search warrant that was to be executed for the purposes of the NCA investigation must be issued pursuant to  and subject to the restrictions of  the NCA Act   including in particular s   thereof  and that s   of the Crimes Act  the predecessor of s  E  cannot be prayed in aid of the warrant citedRyder v Morley     FCR   At trial in Ryder v Morley     FCR   Toohey J held that the attachment of the detective sergeant to the NCA did not deprive him of his status as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act   and nor did it deprive him of the right to seek the issue of a search warrant pursuant to s   of that Act  His Honour did not see anything to preclude recourse being had to s   of the Crimes Act   as he explained in the following passage at      It is clear that he was invoking s   and not relying upon any provision of the National Crime Authority Act     Had a member of the Authority required a warrant for the purpose of a special function of the Authority  it was open to that member to apply to a judge of a prescribed court under s    But the warrant was sought by a member of the Australian Federal Police who satisfied a justice of the peace  by information on oath  that a warrant was justified in terms of s   of the Crimes Act         Toohey J also said that s   was conclusive against the applicant s argument       I agree with counsel for the respondents that the subsection simply means what it says and that there is no justification for reading it down  Counsel for the applicants argued that if a police officer seconded to the Authority could rely upon s   to justify the obtaining of a warrant under s   of the Crimes Act     the limitations in s   could be set at naught  But that is not so  The limitations in s   apply when the Authority relies upon a special investigation which it is conducting to obtain a search warrant in the terms of that section  But if a constable can satisfy a justice of the peace  in terms of s   of the Crimes Act     that a search warrant is justified  the justice may issue a warrant under that section  There is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about s     in my view the subsection is designed for the sort of situation that arose in the present case      I consider that his Honour s reasoning is compelling   On appeal from Toohey J  the Full Court said at        It is submitted that  bearing in mind relevant parts of s     and other provisions in the Act protective of individuals being investigated by the Authority  see ss     it cannot have been intended that the protection could be subverted by reliance on s   of the Crimes Act     We have in what we have already said attempted to show the different purposes and functions of s   of the Crimes Act   and s   of the Act  In our view  it is not to be assumed that the latter negatives the operation of the former  Indeed  the contrary is expressly provided for  s        We are of the view that the provisions of the Act referred to cannot properly be construed as involving any restriction on the use of s   of the Crimes Act   for purposes such as those under discussion  On the contrary  once an offence is known or suspected  s   acts as a convenient corollary to s   and other powers of the Authority   In the present case  the applicant attempted to distinguish Ryder v Morley on the ground that Toohey J and the Full Court did not know whether the search warrant was obtained in connection with an NCA special investigation  In my view  the supposed distinction is not made out  It is founded on a statement in the Full Court judgment that  we do not know whether it was a  special investigation  which deals with a  matter relating to  a specified  relevant criminal activity  and is not confined to things used or believed to be intended to be used for the commission of a crime   It is not clear whether the Full Court was saying that it did not know whether it was a special investigation at all  or whether it was saying that it did not know that the special investigation had the particular features it mentions  However  it does not matter  The applicant s whole argument in Ryder v Morley invited the Court to assume that a search warrant could have been issued pursuant to s   of the NCA Act   In other words  the argument invited the Court to assume that the search warrant in question had been sought in connection with a special investigation by the NCA  The Court was well aware that the power conferred by s   of the NCA Act could only be exercised in connection with a special investigation  The thrust of the argument the Court was addressing was that  as s   was available  the legislative intention was that it should apply to the exclusion of s   of the Crimes Act   Both Toohey J and the Full Court addressed the merits of this argument on the assumption that s   was available and that its conditions could have been satisfied  It follows that the observations made both by Toohey J and the Full Court concerning the relationship between s   of the NCA Act and s   of the Crimes Act were premised upon an assumption  favourable to the applicant in that case  that the warrant had been sought in order to advance a special investigation by the NCA and so could have been obtained under s   of the NCA Act  citedMalubel Pty Ltd v Elder   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  For the foregoing reasons  I consider that Ryder v Morley is Full Court authority directly contrary to the argument that the applicant advances in this case  Ryder v Morley was followed by Moore J in Malubel Pty Ltd v

Australian Federal Police   FCAFC         FCR     Hart   at     the Full Court  French  Sackville and RD Nicholson JJ  explained the approach that should be adopted to the construction of Pt  AA  The Court said       The construction of statutes authorising the search of premises and the seizure of things from them begins with the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose  This reflects the primary object of all statutory construction which  according to Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  is  to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute   The importance of purpose and policy was emphasised in that case by reference to the observation of Dixon CJ in Commissioner for Railways  NSW  v Agalianos   HCA         CLR   at    the context  the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed                  The purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them  Rogers v Moore     FCR   at   per French J  Recognition of that purpose may yield a construction of the legislative words that is not necessarily narrowly defined  Remaining ambiguity or doubt whether of meaning or application will  in accordance with authority  be resolved in favour of the rights and freedoms of the subject         There is a significant emphasis in the case law on the need to apply a  strict  construction to such provisions  This is because  as a general rule  the search of premises and the seizure of goods therefrom has always been illegal unless authorised by law  The manifestation of that authority has traditionally been in the form of a warrant                         Where  strict construction  is invoked it is necessary to keep in mind what that term means  In the context of penal statutes it was said  a long time ago  and yet consistently with contemporary doctrine   Scott v Cawsey   HCA         CLR   at   per Isaacs J  to reflect nothing more than a requirement that         a Court should be specially careful  in the view of the consequences on both sides  to ascertain and enforce the actual commands of the legislature  not weakening them in favour of private persons to the detriment of the public welfare  nor enlarging them as against the individuals towards whom they are directed         The invocation of  strict construction  in penal statutes was described by Gibbs J as  perhaps one of last resort  Beckwith v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at    It should not distract from the primary object of statutory construction enunciated in Project Blue Sky  The search and seizure provisions of the Crimes Act are not punitive  They are not to be treated as penal provisions  It is more appropriate to see them as subject to the general principles that govern statutory interference with established common law rights and freedoms  Potter v Minahan   HCA         CLR   at   per O Connor J   Bropho v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ  Coco v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ  Brennan  Gaudron and McHugh JJ         Notwithstanding these general considerations  effect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences  Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue and or execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred  The need to recognise the operational realities in which warrants are executed was acknowledged by the learned primary judge  who referred in that connection to Dunesky v Commonwealth     A Crim R   at     per Lockhart J  See also Baker v Campbell   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J  The tension between the public and private interests involved in the issue and execution of search warrants was referred to by Lockhart J in Crowley v Murphy     FLR   at      Northrop J agreeing at     The Court concluded its discussion by observing that        there is no requirement that the Court approach that task armed with a prima facie hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers  Privacy is but one of the interests to be taken into account in construing legislation authorising the exercise of such power   The applicant submitted that the Full Court s reference in par   to the  gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them  supports its argument  I disagree  When the relevant passages in the judgment of the Full Court are read as a whole  it is plain that the Full Court was not suggesting that information can only be gathered under a search warrant if it serves the dual purpose of both determining whether offences have been committed and facilitating proof of them in a criminal prosecution process  Moreover  I do not consider that the Full Court was referring to proof in a criminal prosecution process  as distinct from proof in the broader context of a criminal investigation that may or may not result in a prosecution citedHarts Australia Ltd v Australian Federal Police     FCR   The limitation that the applicant
