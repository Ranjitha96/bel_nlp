SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd  No     HCA         CLR     Anshun  No     the Court was concerned with an appeal from the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria which had upheld an order of McGarvie J staying forever an action by the Port of Melbourne Authority in relation to a claim by way of indemnity  His Honour had ordered a stay because he thought that it was an abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and reasonably should have been litigated in earlier proceedings   Gibbs J  with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed  said at       In support of the objection to competency before us  Mr  Griffith naturally relied upon the decision of the Privy Council in Tampion v  Anderson     A L J R      A L R    where it was held that an order staying an action on the ground that it is frivolous  vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court is an interlocutory judgment  Their Lordships in the course of their reasons refer to a number of authorities  but none of those authorities was a case in which a stay had been granted on the ground that there was an estoppel of the kind which McGarvie J  found to have been raised in the present case      If the view expressed in Licul v  Corney     A L J R   at p    is correct  and the true test of finality is whether the judgment or order  as made  finally disposes of the rights of the parties  it would seem clear that the order made in the present case was a final judgment  It is not necessary to consider whether the view expressed in Tampion v  Anderson is one which is consistent with the view taken in the Australian authorities  There may well be a difference between a case in which the action is frivolous or vexatious in the ordinary sense  or in which the proceedings disclose no reasonable cause of action  and a case in which the abuse of process lies in an attempt to litigate an issue which is res judicata  and Tampion v  Anderson has nothing to say about a case of the latter kind   Kenny J said      The distinction between an interlocutory and final judgment is not always a clear one  In this case  however  the decision of the High Court in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd  No     HCA         CLR     Anshun  No     provides an authoritative answer  In Anshun  No     the High Court unanimously held that an order that a proceeding be stayed as an abuse of process on the grounds of estoppel and res judicata was a final judgment  for the purposes of appeal  The approach of the High Court in Anshun  No   is equally applicable in relation to applications for leave to appeal in this Court  see  e g   The Lardil Peoples v State of Queensland   FCA         FCR   at         per Dowsett J  Anshun  No   applies with even stronger force in this case than in case of The Lardil Peoples   because the proceeding from which the current appeal is brought was dismissed on the same bases as in Anshun  No      The disagreement amongst judges was adverted to by Selway J in S  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   where he said      The original application made by the applicant was by Notice of Appeal  There may be some disagreement in the cases as to whether an order dismissing an action on the basis that it is vexatious and or an abuse of process is an interlocutory order  contrast Re Luck   HCA         ALR   at       and Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun   HCA         CLR    As the decision of the High Court in Re Luck is the most recent  I should follow it  This is consistent with other recent practice in this court  I refer  for example  to the decisions of the Full Court of this Court in Wride v Schulze   FCAFC

HCA  html  In a later decision of the High Court  Re Luck   HCA         ALR     Luck   Gleeson CJ had refused Ms Luck leave to issue a writ of summons and statement of claim which had been the subject of a direction made by Callinan J pursuant to O   r   of the High Court Rules  The question before the Court was whether Gleeson CJ s order was final or interlocutory   The Court in Luck   after referring with approval to the dicta of Lord Evershed in Hunt v Allied Bakeries Ltd     All ER   at   said at      Given the long established English rule  the decision in Tampion and our decisions in Pye  Hall  Carr and Bienstein  we see no valid reason for departing from the rule laid down in Tampion   An order is an interlocutory order  therefore  when it stays or dismisses an action or refuses leave to commence or proceed with an action because the action is frivolous  vexatious  an abuse of the process of the court or does not disclose a reasonable cause of action   Their Honours did not refer to Anshun  No   in Luck    The disagreement amongst judges was adverted to by Selway J in S  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   where he said      The original application made by the applicant was by Notice of Appeal  There may be some disagreement in the cases as to whether an order dismissing an action on the basis that it is vexatious and or an

No     I am thus placed in the difficult position of deciding which of the above decisions of my colleagues I should follow  With some hesitation  and with great respect to Kenny J  I have concluded that the view adopted by Selway J is the preferable view  The unqualified nature of the statement in Re Luck at   which is highlighted in   above seems to me to carry considerable weight as it was made in a case decided after Anshun No    Additionally  I note that the Full Court in Wride v Schulze   FCAFC   placed reliance on Re Luck at   and made no reference to Anshun No         I conclude that the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in respect of which the notice of appeal was filed is an interlocutory judgment  As mentioned above  s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  operates to prevent an appeal being brought from an interlocutory judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court unless the Court or a judge gives leave   The respondent  on this application  has urged me to follow the decisions which followed Luck rather than Anshun  No     In Lashansky v Bruvecchis Pty Ltd   FCAFC     the Full Court of the Federal Court  of which I was a member  Madgwick  Lander and Crennan JJ  considered the decision of the High Court in Luck   the earlier decision of the Privy Council in Tampion v Anderson   and the earlier decision of the English Court of Appeal in Hunt v Allied Bakeries Ltd   and concluded that an order dismissing an action because it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action was interlocutory  In that case  the decision in Anshun  No   was not cited to the Court   The High Court said in Luck at      That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not  If the legal effect of the judgment is final  it is a final order  otherwise  it is an interlocutory order    Footnote omitted   In those circumstances  I am disposed to follow the decisions which have followed Luck and proceed upon the basis that leave to appeal is required distinguishedMZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In MZWHW v

the order made finally determines the rights of the parties in the principal action before the Court citedMZWHN v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my opinion  the Court can have regard to the jurisdiction which was exercised by the Court below in determining whether the effect of the order which was sought is to finally determine the issues between the parties  Where the Court is exercising its summary jurisdiction to dispose of the matter without proceeding to examine the matter on its merits it is more likely that the order made is not a final order but an interlocutory order because the order does not usually finally determine the legal rights of the parties  MZWHN v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   per Crennan J appliedD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries     FCR   The tests that have to be considered in an application for leave to appeal are well know  D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries     FCR    On an application such as this  an applicant must establish that the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Court of Appeal  If so  the applicant must also satisfy the Court considering the question of leave that substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  Of course  the two tests are not considered independently of each other but are interrelated   In my opinion  there can be no doubt that the applicant has failed to satisfy the Court that the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being re considered by the Full Court  Except for the claim of bias  the grounds which gave rise to the order dismissing the application were in substance the same grounds which had previously been ventilated before Smith FM in the Federal Magistrates Court and on appeal to this Court  and in the application for special leave to the High Court   The Magistrate was right to conclude that the application was in that respect an abuse of process
