Stockford Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The decision of Finkelstein J in Re Korda  in the matter of Stockford Ltd   FCA         FCR     Stockford   drew attention to some issues relating to the fixing of the remuneration of administrators and has indirectly led to the present proceeding  Finkelstein J said  at      Although s  E requires the remuneration to be  fixed  by the creditors or the court  the section does not specify how it is to be  fixed   It could be  fixed  as a periodic salary  a lump sum  a percentage of some amount  such as the value of the company s assets under the administrators  control  or according to the amount of time spent by the administrator determined by reference to a scale or formula  The matter is simply left at large  So also is the basis upon which the quantum of the remuneration is to be determined  That is  the section is silent on the factors to be taken into account both for deciding the appropriate method of  fixing  an administrator s remuneration and in determining the amount to be  fixed   The only guidance that is given  and it is given by necessary implication  is that an administrator is entitled to reasonable remuneration  That offers little assistance to the tribunal that is required to decide what is reasonable in a particular case   It will be observed that the reference to  reasonable  remuneration is a gloss upon the words of the Act and is described by his Honour as arising from  necessary implication   That implication may  no doubt  be given effect to in the operation of s  E  but is of doubtful relevance to the construction of s  E   There is much else of relevance in the judgment in Stockford which is too lengthy to reproduce but some other passages repay reproduction  His Honour said  at   and        The natural meaning of the word  fix  in the context of an entitlement to  such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of  creditors  is

who fixed their remuneration      emphasis added  Finkelstein J did not decide the point at issue here in Stockford   It is also notable that much of the discussion in Stockford related not so much to the question of whether fees are  fixed  but whether the fees  if fixed  are reasonable   It is submitted for the plaintiff that the resolutions in the present case do not suffer from the defect which existed in Stockford as there is only one rate fixed for each person who does any work in connection with the administration  Once the person and his or her category is known  and the time spent is known  the guide can be arithmetically applied to arrive at the result  Thus  the resolution here does avoid one of the problems which brought down the arrangement in Stockford   Counsel also relied upon the specific monetary limits or caps to avoid the criticism that the arrangements would otherwise be open ended citedVardon v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth
