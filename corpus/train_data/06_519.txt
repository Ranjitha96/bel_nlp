edu au au cases cth HCA  html  When I was delivering my judgment ex tempore in this matter on   April   it occurred to me for the reasons I then gave   Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA   at        the first judgment  that charge   was bad for duplicity  Johnson v Miller   HCA         CLR    Then Dixon J said   CLR at        For  in many cases  evidence of more than one offence cannot be admitted  and under one charge to take evidence of a number of separate instances of the commission of the same offence because each will indifferently fit the complaint is to pursue a course contrary to law  It cannot be enough to require the complainant to elect among the instances he has proved after his evidence has been given in full  Where an information or complaint is so drawn as to disclose more than one offence and one set of facts amounts to each of the various offences covered by the charge  as was the case in Johnson v  Needham     KB     LT   the proper course is to put the complainant to his election  In such a case  to wait to the end of his evidence before doing so may be convenient and may cause no injustice   But it is the converse of the present case  where the question is whether the prosecutor should not be required to identify one of a number of sets of facts  each amounting to the commission of the same offence as that on which the charge is based  In my opinion he clearly should be required to identify the transaction on which he relies and he should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint  in spite of its apparent particularity  is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the complaint  For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act  matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge  The court hearing a complaint or information for an offence must have before it a means of identifying with the matter or transaction alleged in the document the matter or transaction appearing in evidence    emphasis added  On   April   I directed the applicant to file and serve by   April   written submissions as to whether charge   was bad for duplicity  whether it ought be amended and if so what amendment was sought  The applicant applied to amend charge   in its submissions dated   April    I also directed the respondent to file and serve any submissions in response by   April    The respondent has not filed any submissions   The applicant has submitted that the principle in Johnson v Miller   HCA         CLR   is designed to prevent unfairness and prejudice  It seeks to amend charge   so as to read       The Respondent is guilty of contempt of Court in that in breach of the order referred to in paragraph   herein  the Respondent has from   December   February         Being the date first date on which there is evidence in respect of symbol and wording  i e   the  sign  on the Website  Tab       used and displayed a sign  symbol and device on the website www naturalfloorcoverings com au  Website  that is the same or substantially identical with the Applicant s registered Trade Marks Numbered   and   including the following  The applicant contends that the use of the sign which appeared in the sequence described in the first judgment   FCA   at         as alleged in the amended charge   is to be treated as a single act rather than a sequence of acts  The whole sequence  it was argued  constituted a depiction which  when taken together  amounted to the display of one sign which was the same or substantially identical with the sign specified in order   and amended charge     I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case no injustice has been caused to the respondent by allowing the hearing to have proceeded as it did notwithstanding the duplicity in charge    Here  the facts were substantively unchallenged  Rather  it was the interpretation of the unchallenged facts which was in issue  The applicant has identified the evidence on which it relies in support of the charge as being that in Ms Than s affidavits sworn   March    pars  a   e  and   March    pars     and Mr Dowe s affidavit sworn   March    pars     and the screen grabs at pages       The amendment of charge   which has been sought will confine the unchallenged evidence to a narrower use for a shorter period than before  The respondent has had ample opportunity to consider his position and has made no submissions as to the course I should follow   I am of opinion that in the circumstances and for the reasons above  I should allow the amendment of charge   as sought   Johnson v Miller     CLR at   cf John L Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    HCA         CLR   at     s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  see too s     I will allow the respondent the opportunity to consider whether he wishes to call any evidence and to make submissions as to whether he ought be permitted  if he so chooses  to further cross examine in respect of amended charge       I certify that the
