Co    at       the effect of this section  which the court has interpreted so as to give it wide powers      is to lessen the distinction between a voluntary and compulsory winding up   Given the more substantive character of the applications contemplated by s  a  the preceding observations are even more apposite in applications made under that provision  Whether the Court should proceed to entertain applications for the determination of substantive rights and award final relief as between competing creditors and others in an application under s   is a matter of discretion  As Young J said about s   in Deane Willcocks   NSWLR    at       There are many questions where the only order that the court should make is that the liquidator or the claimant proceed in the ordinary courts in the ordinary way for the determination of a dispute  However  there are many other situations where the court can summarily solve the difficulty that has arisen in the liquidation by an order under the section in a cheap and efficient manner  Where this can be done it is  just and beneficial  to exercise the power   In my opinion it is open to the Court  in a suitable case  to entertain an application for the determination of questions under s   by joining affected parties with competing interests as defendants and permitting them to file cross claims for declaratory relief as between themselves and any other interested parties and the liquidator so that there can be a res judicata between all of them  Such a course may be appropriate where the evidence necessary to determine the questions and the competing claims is largely documentary and amenable to expeditious hearing and determination  Otherwise the parties can simply commence their own substantive proceedings   On the basis of the information provided at the directions hearing and the nature of the factual matters underpinning the questions raised by the liquidator  it appears likely that the resolution of the competing claims reflected in the liquidator s questions could proceed expeditiously on a largely documentary basis  I accept that there may be some oral evidence going to questions of estoppel in relation to IMF  Although the proposed statement of claim outlines a somewhat complex and convoluted sequence of transactions  the heavy documentary emphasis suggests that a largely documentary case can be run citedEquity Funds of Australia  In Liq      CLC     A direction given or a question determined under s   or s   as the case may be  will protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or determination  In relation to a determination under s   it may be an open question whether it establishes a res judicata between the liquidator and any parties affected by it who are

from personal liability would not however affect the rights of creditors and beneficiaries as between themselves     So far as s   is concerned  McLelland J was of the view that it does not enable the court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments and that the function of an application for directions under that section is to give the liquidator advice about the proper course of action in the liquidation and not to determine rights and liabilities arising from pre liquidation transactions  at    See also Re JW Murphy and PC Allen     ACSR   at    McLelland CJ  citedRe GB Nathan   Co Pty Ltd  In liq      NSWLR   The facilities provided by ss   and   have a long ancestry  Section   of the former Corporations Law was considered by McLelland J in Re GB Nathan   Co Pty Ltd  In liq      NSWLR    He traced its origins back to the Joint Stock Companies Winding Up Act    UK  which allowed an official manager to apply for directions from the Master from time to time  A similar facility has long existed for trustees  administrators and executors  As McLelland J said  at     These various statutory provisions for directions were a development from the practice of the Court of Chancery under the general law in giving directions to those entrusted with the administration of property under the control of the court  Two main classes of such persons were   trustees of trust property  or executors or administrators of a deceased estate  under administration by the court pursuant to a decree for general administration  and   receivers  and managers  appointed by the court in respect of property the subject of litigation   A direction given or a question determined under s   or s   as the case may be  will protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or

sufficient flexibility in the procedures of the Court to enable proceedings begun as an application for directions to be converted into proceedings for the determination of substantive rights  Re GB Nathan   Co   NSWLR   at    In Melbourne Asset Management Nominees   FCR   Northrop J said  at       It has been accepted that Courts have power to make final orders in preference claims on an application by a liquidator under sections similar to s   of the Corporations Law   There is no logical reason why final orders binding on other persons cannot be made on applications under s   with respect to other subject matters    And further  at         I can see no reason why binding orders cannot be made where the parties affected have been given the opportunity to be heard citedRe JW
