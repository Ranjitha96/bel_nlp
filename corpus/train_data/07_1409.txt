v K S Easter  Holdings  Pty Ltd     NSWLR   Mahoney J adopted a threefold enquiry in determining whether a binding contract had been concluded between the parties  His Honour said that it would be of assistance to distinguish between three questions          Did the parties arrive at a consensus    If they did  was it such a consensus as was capable of forming a binding contract    And  if it was

Australian Wool Innovation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I discussed a number of these cases in Macdonald v Australian Wool Innovation Ltd   FCA   at     and      That case concerned two senior scientists who left their employ with a large public company because they were offered the opportunity to engage in a high risk  but high reward  venture with the respondent  They claimed they had entered into an agreement with the respondent which was binding and legally efficacious  but that the respondent had repudiated that agreement  The respondent denied that any such agreement had been concluded   I held that the applicants had established the existence of the binding agreement pleaded  The board of the respondent  a public company  had specifically considered and approved a detailed and documented proposal for the particular venture  Not all the  i s were dotted and not all the  t s crossed  However  the critical elements had all been agreed  and those that were not expressly agreed would readily be the subject of implication   The present case is a far cry from Macdonald   Even on Mr Quinlan s case a number of essential terms were uncertain or lacking  Alternatively  if those terms are not regarded as  essential  they were terms of the kind that would ordinarily be expected to be agreed in a complex agreement involving major property developments and potentially large amounts of money  I refer in particular to matters such as        the funding arrangements that would be put in place to support the venture  ie to purchase and develop properties    the duration of the venture    how and when profits would be distributed  and    the exact terms upon which the   would be paid  if called upon referred toSinclair  Scott   Co Ltd v Naughton   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There are many cases to the same effect  See for example Sinclair  Scott   Co Ltd v Naughton   HCA         CLR   at

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Even accepting Mr Quinlan s account of the relevant conversations  he has not established that the parties arrived at a consensus  If they did  it was not a consensus that was capable of forming a binding contract  And  if it was  viewed objectively  in accordance with Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     the parties did not intend that the consensus at which they arrived should constitute a binding contract   In arriving at that conclusion  I have given weight to the fact that the discussions between the parties concerned major property developments  It would have been plain to Mr Quinlan that any venture of the type he contemplated would have required millions of dollars in finance  The arrangement that he asserts could never have gotten off the ground without the Brady interests being prepared to contribute large amounts of money  Mr Quinlan had no significant assets  and no capacity to borrow even relatively modest amounts of money   I have also given weight to the fact that  at the relevant time  Mr Quinlan and Mr Brady were barely acquaintances  This was not a handshake deal done between longstanding business associates  where perhaps some latitude in relation to formality might be accorded discussedToyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd     VR   A particularly helpful statement of the relevant legal principles is to be found in Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd     VR    The issue in that case was whether a binding agreement had been made in December   between two Toyota companies  and the respondent  for a rescue package  the respondent having been in financial difficulties for some months  The negotiations resulted in a letter dated   December   which  together with a one page enclosure referred to the  now agreed to conditions   The respondent claimed that Mr Morgan had telephoned a senior Toyota official shortly after receipt of the letter  and accepted the offer contained in it   It was important to note that the enclosure  which contained the details of the rescue package  set out various conditions relating to the offer  a timetable under which those conditions had to be met  and a statement to the effect that if the financial position indicated that the Ken Morgan group could not be viable even after the current offer was concluded  Toyota would not proceed with that offer   The trial judge held that a binding agreement was made in December   the terms of which were set out in the letter and the enclosure  On appeal  the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria overturned that finding
