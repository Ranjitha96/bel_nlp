Repatriation Commission v Norton   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreversedNorton and Repatriation Commission   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  The late Mr Perrin Goodwin served in the Australian Army in Vietnam from   April   until   March    He made a claim under the Veterans  Entitlements Act    Cth  for compensation for allegedly war caused liver cancer caused by cirrhosis of the liver  His claim was refused by the Repatriation Commission and that refusal was affirmed by the Veterans Review Board  Subsequently to the Board s decision Mr Gordon died as a result of the cancer  The present respondent  as executrix of his estate  appealed under s   of the Act to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  which upheld her appeal  Norton and Repatriation Commission   AATA    The Commission now appeals to this Court citedRepatriation Commission v Deledio   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The operation of the reasonable hypothesis mechanism and the reverse onus of proof under the Act are explained in Repatriation Commission v Deledio   FCA         FCR   at       The hypothesis said to be raised by Mr Goodwin s claim for the purposes of s  A of the Act relied on the Statement of Principles Concerning Alcohol Dependence or Alcohol Abuse SoP No   of    It was that  i   severe stressors  related to his service  ii  caused alcohol dependence or abuse which  iii  caused the cirrhosis which  iv  caused the liver cancer  Steps  iii  and  iv  were not in dispute   There was an alternative hypothesis  relying on SoPs No   of   and No   of   that the stressors caused generalized anxiety disorder which in turn caused the alcohol dependence or abuse and the subsequent cirrhosis and cancer  This was rejected by the Tribunal and was not relied on by the respondent on the present appeal   The Tribunal was required to follow the approach explained by the Full Court in Deledio at        The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person  No question of fact finding arises at this stage  If no such hypothesis arises  the application must fail     If the material does raise such a hypothesis  the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the  Repatriation Medical  Authority under s  B  or    If no such SoP is in force  the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and  in consequence  the application must fail     If an SoP is in force  the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one  It will do so if the hypothesis fits  that is to say  is consistent with the  template  to be found in the SoP  The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist  and be related to the person s service  as required by ss  B d  and  e   If the hypothesis does contain these factors  it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts  nor otherwise fanciful  If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template  it will be deemed not to be  reasonable  and the claim will fail     The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  or in the case of a claim for incapacity  that the incapacity did not arise from a war caused injury  If not so satisfied  the claim must succeed  If the Tribunal is so satisfied  the claim must fail  It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it  In so doing  no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved   Relevantly for present purposes  ie ignoring the anxiety disorder based hypothesis which is no longer relied on  the Tribunal at   found that a reasonable hypothesis relating to a causal connexion between Mr Goodwin s operational service had been raised  namely that  a stressor of sufficient severity might have resulted in the worsening of pre existing alcohol abuse or dependence   Emphasis in original   The Tribunal said at   after referring to a number of medical reports  that it was unable to find in the reported histories the necessary criteria for alcohol dependence  and thus  found  that Mr Goodwin suffered from alcohol abuse     Emphasis in original   In my opinion  the Tribunal erred by failing to form an opinion whether the alcohol abuse hypothesis fitted  or was consistent with  SoP No   of     Deledio step    The Tribunal did not identify  in the material before it  necessary elements which the SoP required   Although there was ample material as to Mr Goodwin s heavy drinking while in Vietnam  the diagnostic criteria for  alcohol abuse  in cl  b  of the SoP requires very specific manifestations  as set out at   above   recurrent  use resulting in failure to fulfil major role obligations or in physically hazardous situations  or recurrent alcohol related legal problems or social or interpersonal problems  There was no attempt to identify such manifestations in the material   Further  the Tribunal did not attempt to identify the date of clinical onset or clinical worsening of alcohol abuse so as to see whether the same occurred within two years of Mr Goodwin s experiencing the alleged stressors  This was a factor which had to exist before it could be said that a reasonable hypothesis had been raised connecting the alcohol abuse with the circumstances of Mr Goodwin s service  cl  b  and  d    Since this matter will have to be remitted  I do not think I should say anything further about the merits of the events alleged to constitute severe stressors  At Deledio step   a fact finding exercise is not involved  in contrast to step     The appeal will be allowed  the decision of the Tribunal set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal differently constituted  for further hearing and determination according to law  In its notice of appeal the Commission did not expressly seek an order for costs  Since it is not suggested that the respondent was responsible for the errors of the Tribunal  I do not propose to make any order for costs   I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey    Associate Dated    August

resulted from the objective subjective effect of a severe stressor that might evoke intense fear   Repatriation Commission v Stoddart   FCAFC         FCR    It said at   that the  relevant factors  were those in cl    a   b  and  d    Clause  b  and  d  are quoted at   above  cl  a  refers to suffering from a psychiatric disorder at the time of onset of alcohol abuse as already mentioned  this is no longer relevant   The Tribunal said that  Mr Goodwin met these criteria    After rejecting the anxiety disorder hypothesis the Tribunal said  all emphasised words are in the original     The Tribunal finds that the stressors nominated by Mr Goodwin do not meet the severity delineated in DSM IV  a diagnostic manual  and adopted by SoP No   of   concerning GAD  generalised anxiety disorder  but do meet the requirements of Factor  b  of SoP No   of   which states              b  experiencing a severe stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical onset of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse  or         d  experiencing a severe stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical worsening of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse           This SoP defines experiencing a severe stressor in the following terms      means  the person experienced  witnessed or was confronted with  an event or events that involved actual or threat of death or serious injury  or a threat to the person s or other people s physical integrity  which event or events might evoke intense fear  helplessness or horror  emphasis added          The Tribunal considers that the inclusion of the word might in this definition lowers the standard of proof  Might is defined in the Short  sic  Oxford Dictionary  Third Edition  amongst other definitions  as expressing a possibility  Both Dr Walton and Dr D Ortenzio have related such a possibility and Dr Percival qualified it as a probability  The use of the term might in the Tribunal s opinion shifts the weight in the assessment in the objective subjective analyses  Stoddart  of claimed stressors toward the subjective analysis  and in light of the psychiatric opinion  the Tribunal finds that the stressors described and in particular the bar theft accusation and search  do meet the SoP s criteria     The second of the four elements of this complex hypotheses argued in the alternative to the first is upheld  and as a result the remaining two elements flow directly from this finding  resulting in the decision that Mr Goodwin s death was causally related to his operational service     The construction which Full Court decisions have placed on this expression in the context of the SoP can be summarized as follows     The event must be one which  i  the person actually perceived as involving actual or threatened death or serious injury and  ii  which could reasonably be so perceived by someone with that person s knowledge and experience  There are both subjective and objective elements  Repatriation Commission v Stoddart   FCAFC         FCR   at            It is sufficient if a threat is  actually and reasonably  perceived  notwithstanding that there was in fact no threat  Stoddart at        To be  confronted  with the event the person does not necessarily have to be physically present  Woodward v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at           Risk  is used in the sense of  an indication of probable evil to come  something that gives indication of causing evil or harm  Stoddart at     In the passage at   of its reasons  quoted at   above  the Tribunal misunderstood the term  The use of the word  might  has nothing to do with  shift ing  the weight     towards the subjective analysis   The word  might  accommodates the possibility that a person of particular fortitude might be confronted with an event involving  for example  threat of death  but does not react with  intense  or any  fear  helplessness or horror   Such a person would be  literally  fearless  Nevertheless  such an event might evoke the actual  and objectively reasonable  intense fear etc in an ordinary person  At the other extreme  the definition excludes an event which  objectively  does not have the possibility of evoking the reaction of intense fear etc  The definition thus sets out the limits within which the Stoddart subjective and objective tests are to be satisfied  The concluding part of the definition  which event or events     is setting out the objective criteria which the event must satisfy  Of course  the event must also be one which the person  subjectively  perceived as involving a threat of death etc and which a reasonable person could  objectively  so perceive citedWoodward v Repatriation Commission     FCAFC         FCR  http www
