There is no jurisdictional error apparent in the Tribunal s decision or in the decision of Smith FM  The Court is satisfied that there is no merit in the applicant s substantial application appliedHunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   The Court observes that in considering whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under O   r   of the Rules  the Court must be satisfied that there is an acceptable explanation for the delay  that there would be no undue prejudice to the respondent if the Court were to grant leave  and that there is merit in the substantial application  see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   at      There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the   day time limit prescribed by O   r   of the Rules   As to delay  the applicant claimed at the hearing before the Court that her ignorance of Court procedure resulted in her failure to comply with O   r   of the Rules  Because the applicant is unrepresented and the delay is not extensive  the Court is prepared to accept this explanation   There is no evidence before the Court that the Minister would be prejudiced if the Court were to grant an order dispensing with compliance with O   r   of the Rules consideredIyer v Minister for Immigration
