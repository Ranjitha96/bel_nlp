Phoneflasher   I have done so because there is an issue as to the proper construction of the order  on construction see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd  at   ff  The ACCC has tendered evidence taken from the phoneflasher website which indicated that  i  on   January   the number of retail outlets in Australia listed as having Phoneflashers available for sale  was   and  ii  on   March   the website listed more than   such retail suppliers  Order   of the consent orders required the company to provide the ACCC with the required names and address of the retail outlets to which it had provided corrective signs and letters on or before   December    No such names were by then provided  Letters informing the respondent of the breach were sent to Phoneflasher Co s solicitors and to Mr Jorgensen   An ACCC officer in late December   observed a Phoneflasher display stand in an Adelaide retail centre  On speaking to the manager she was informed that the manager had not received the notice required to be sent in the order   On   January   a letter from the company s lawyers was received by the lawyer for the ACCC  It enclosed a letter from Mr Kerville of   January   which stated that  i   the company ceased trading over   months ago and there are few customers on the books   ii  the person  who took over the distribution at that time has also since ceased trading  and  iii  the ACCC notices had been sent  to prior Phoneflasher customers shown on the attached list   That list contained eight names and addresses citedSecretary of State of Trade and Industry v Deverell   Ch
