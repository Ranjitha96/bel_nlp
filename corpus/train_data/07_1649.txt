that will not  in all likelihood  eventuate  It cannot  therefore  lead to consumer confusion for the purposes of the Act  However  to cover this hypothetical case  the Court s order will state that bourbon in the statement of goods does not include bourbon which is labelled only as  whiskey  or  whisky    The relevant surrounding circumstances provide additional reasons why there would be marginal  if any  confusion  Carelessness or stupidity are considerations to be disregarded in any comparative analysis  This consideration has greater weight in a market where the purchase of products is not one of impulse  but requires some degree of consideration  Unlike All Fect   this case does not deal with confectionary that targets consumers of less discerning habits  such as children  A purchaser must be at least   years of age and would  in all likelihood  consider the second feature of the marks  There is no deceptive similarity between the marks   Similarly here  the point of difference is the second element of both marks  OAKS and LIVET  What appears at   to   is equally applicable in this comparison  OAKS and LIVIT do not hold the same meaning  the marks are vastly different in a visual and aural sense   There is no deceptive similarity between the GLENN OAKS and GLENMORANGIE marks  Again  the second feature in the marks is distinct both visually and aurally  It is this feature that the consumer would be drawn to in terms of identifying a difference between the brands  Even allowing for imperfect recollection  there is no deceptive similarity

approach in Pianotist Co s Application     RPC   at   is oft cited  There  Parker J said     You must take the two words  You must judge of them  both by their look and by their sound  You must consider the goods to which they are applied  You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods  In fact  you must consider all of the surrounding circumstances  and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks are used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks   Beck Koller at   indicates that family marks are only to be regarded as one of the  surrounding circumstances which is required to be taken into account  when making a comparison  Pianotist   as approved in High Court

in confusion because a family of  GLEN  marks exists in the market  The applicant relied upon a Trade Mark Office decision in McDonalds Corporation v Bellamy     IPR   at   to support the submission  There  the delegate said     In  the line of  family  trade mark cases   the trade marks of an opponent have been found to have a common element  usually a prefix  which is so thoroughly associated with the opponent s goods or services that the use by another person of a trade mark incorporating that element  would deceive or confuse   In both Woolworths Metro and McDonalds there was only one registered owner of the relevant trade marks  Several United States authorities  including J   J Snack Foods Corp v McDonald s Corp   F d    Fed Cir   and American Standard Inc v Scott   Fetzer Co   USPQ      TTAB   support the distinction referred to at     appliedBeck Koller   Co     RPC   The family marks argument is not persuasive  The applicant is not the registered owner of all the  Glen  marks  Beck Koller   Co     RPC   at   provides guidance  in dicta  as to how family marks should be examined     When an application for registration is before the Registrar  it frequently happens that the search for conflicting marks reveals several marks having some characteristic feature in common with the mark of the application  which marks may stand on the register in the name of one proprietor only  or in the name of several different proprietors          If  therefore  all the marks were owned by one proprietor  the Registrar would presume that the latter was using a  series  of marks and judge the conflict between the applicants  mark and each of the proprietor s mark with this consideration in mind          On the other hand  if the registered marks were owned by several different proprietors  this would be a circumstance which might considerably assist the applicant who would be in a position to submit that the common characteristic was one well recognised in marks in use in the particular trade  In short  when the Registrar comes to compare the applicant s mark with the registered marks      the presence of marks on the register other than the one with which the comparison is being made is regarded as one of the surrounding circumstances which he is required to take into account       Emphasis added  The  applicant  referred to in that passage is the applicant for the trade mark  So if the marks were owned by the same party  that would have gone against the applicant  but where there were a number of prior registered marks belonging to different parties  that was in the applicant s favour  In the present case  the respondent is the applicant for the trade mark  The passage above cuts in favour of the GLENN OAKS mark   Beck Koller at   indicates that family marks are only to be regarded as one of the  surrounding circumstances which is required to be taken into account  when making a comparison  Pianotist   as approved in High Court authorities  remains the primary test of deceptive similarity  Therefore  the existence of family marks is only a relevant factor in the totality of the assessment of whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion  In this case  it supports the respondent citedJ   J Snack Foods Corp v McDonald s Corp     F d    Fed Cir   In both Woolworths Metro and McDonalds there was only one registered

the distinction referred to at     citedPowell s Trade Mark     RPC   As a matter of commonsense and consistency with the purpose of the Act  the respondent s position is to be preferred  The function of a trade mark is to indicate the origin of the goods  Powell s Trade Mark     RPC   at    If the evidence establishes a common characteristic well recognised in marks in use by different owners in the particular trade  for example  Glen  this would reduce the chance of confusion as the consumer is aware that different owners maintain different trade marks  albeit names starting with the same word or letters   The consumer s attention is  therefore  likely to be more attuned to the second element in the relevant mark  For example OAKS in GLENN OAKS or LIVET in GLENLIVET  In particular  awareness of the second element would be a matter of habit for involved scotch whisky consumers referred toErven Warnink BV v J Townsend   Sons Hull Ltd   RPC   Passing off is a tort that does not

the earlier grounds  that has not been established   The application must be dismissed   The delegate said that the applicant s opposition was justified  The applicant was correct in saying that use of the mark on the goods for which the application was accepted was likely to cause confusion  On the other hand the respondent s amendment to his statement of goods following the hearing was sufficient to eliminate that likelihood  As both parties thus had a measure of success  the delegate considered they should bear their own costs  That is also the view to which I have come  The cross
