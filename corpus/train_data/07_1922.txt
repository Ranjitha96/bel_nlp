Calderbank offer  Woodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng  No    FMCA   discussedLott v JBW   Friends Pty Ltd     SASR   In dealing with this issue the learned Magistrate discussed Lott v JBW   Friends Pty Ltd     SASR    The work there in question was a graphic bar with the words  Opera in the Outback   The report does not contain a reproduction  Mullighan J held that it was a  drawing   His Honour said at     The graphic designer had to create a design and make choices about the layout  font  colour and dimensions of each part of the design  Having perused the graphic     I do not regard it as so simple as to deny copyright         The selection of the font from a computer program is no less creative than manual drawing      In the present case her Honour  correctly in my view  pointed out at   that Lott is not authority for the proposition that anything a graphic designer prepares is a drawing   The same point was made by Mr Minahan  counsel for the respondents  in his written submissions  The submissions  he said  involved the use of a computer and selection of typeface and decisions about layout and presentation including headings and indentation  The same could be said for a newspaper  However neither the submissions nor a newspaper would be regarded as a drawing   Her Honour adopted the statement in Ricketson  S The Law of Intellectual Property  Copyright Designs and Confidential Information   at par       Essentially  a drawing is a two dimensional work in which shapes and images are depicted by lines  often without colouring   I would agree that this is the ordinary meaning of the term  drawing   The Macquarie Dictionary gives us several definitions of the noun  drawing             representation by lines  delineation of form without reference to colour       a sketch  plan  or design  esp one made with pen  pencil  or crayon   In the context of the visual arts  the traditional distinction has been between paintings  which are coloured  and drawings  which are monotone  usually  but not always  black upon white  The statutory definition  particularly by its inclusion of maps  makes it clear that for the purposes of the Act something may be a drawing notwithstanding that it is coloured  However  the essence of a drawing remains the concept of a representation of some object by a pictorial line citedMillar   Lang Ltd v Polak     Ch   Certainly for something to be a  drawing  for copyright purposes no great complexity or  as the statute tells us  artistic quality is required  In Millar   Lang Ltd v Polak     Ch   the works held to be drawings included words such as  Greetings   Friends ever    Good luck   Lest we forget  and  For old times sake  in a distinctive form within an ornamental oval or circular scroll  In Roland Corporation v Lorenzo   Sons Pty Ltd     FCR   the devices held by Pincus J to be drawings were based on the letters R and B but  as is apparent from the report at   were quite stylised  As his Honour said at   they were  by no means random and were plainly drawn with care  to obtain an effect   Clearly a letter or letters of the alphabet can provide the subject matter for a drawing  One thinks of the illuminated manuscripts of medieval works such as the Book of Kells  However  in the present case the text is fulfilling a semiotic function  It is communicating to the reader the message that within the cardboard box will be found a wooden photo box with   albums which hold     x   cm photos  The pictorial image of that box is conveyed by a photograph  which is not a drawing citedRoland

issue was at least touched on in the court below  It is discussed at     of the judgment  Mr Minahan objected to this late amendment  citing the decision of the High Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong  No     HCA         ALR   at     It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case  Except in the most exceptional circumstances it would contrary to all principle to allow a party  after a case has been decided against him  to raise a new argument which  whether deliberately or by inadvertence  he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so   The application to amend should be refused  primarily for the reason that the proposed amendment lacks arguable merit  The notion of compilation involves a collecting and putting together or arranging or organising of disparate data  That is not the case with the appellant s label  It is simply a photograph and a description of an object  It conveys the one message   The appellant s case was pleaded in the common law tort of passing off as well as alleged contraventions of ss   and    c  and  d  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Section   prohibits conduct in trade or commerce which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive  More specifically  s  c  and  d  prohibits representations that goods or a corporation have sponsorship or approval which they do not have appliedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     FCR   In the court below  concentration was very much on the passing off claim  However  as the Full Court has recently

the learned Magistrate s findings support a conclusion that this was a case of deliberate copying  I would apply the principle in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F S Walton   Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     On the trade practices causes of action the appellant s damages claim is based on the number of sales of the respondents  offending boxes  The appellant claims the gross profit on an equivalent number of sales it says it has lost   There were   such sales by the respondents  The lowest profit margin for the appellant  being that on its small photo boxes  was      The resultant figure is     appliedI   L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers  Brisbane  Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my view  the appellant s approach is a realistic one  The competing products were presented side by side to consumers  As already noted  the effect of the offending packaging was likely to induce consumers into thinking that they were getting the same product from the same source but would be saving money by not having to pay for more elaborate packaging  which they did not need  The misleading and deceptive conduct only has to be one among a number of causes which contributes to a consumer decision harmful to a plaintiff  As Gleeson CJ said in I   L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers  Brisbane  Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       In most business transactions resulting in financial loss there are multiple causes of the loss  The statutory purpose would be defeated if the remedy under s   were restricted to loss of which the contravening conduct was the sole cause   While the appellant s claim is based on gross profit lost  that seems a practical measure in the circumstances of this case  It is a modest claim because it assumes that all sales lost were of the small box  which had the lowest margin  It would be an artificial exercise to attempt to calculate some proportion of that profit which represented savings of fixed costs  This case was properly brought in the Federal Magistrates Court  a jurisdiction which is expected to operate as informally as possible  Federal Magistrates Act    Cth  ss  a  and     In a case of this nature parties should not feel they have to engage forensic accountants and similar experts   The appeal will be allowed and the judgment below set aside  In lieu thereof there will be judgment for the appellant against the respondents  the liability of the first respondent under s  c  of the Trade Practices Act was not in dispute   The amount of that judgment will be     plus appropriate interest under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth    There remain the questions of costs  As already mentioned  the learned Magistrate made an order for indemnity costs  The respondents had made Calderbank offers as follows      April   an undertaking to cease selling products with the offending packaging      April   the undertaking    for costs and   damages      May   the undertaking    for costs and   damages      June   the undertaking    for costs and   damages   The time for compliance with this offer was extended on two occasions    I direct that the appellant within seven days file written submissions as to interest and costs and that the respondent file answering submissions within seven days thereafter   I certify that the preceding sixty three
