S  v Minister For Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedCDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe power to receive evidence on appeal is given to the Court by s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  which provides that the court has  power     in its discretion  to receive further evidence       An identically worded provision in the Family Law Act   was considered by the High Court in CDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR    McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ referred to the established common law conditions under which new evidence might be admitted in an appeal by way of rehearing as articulated in Wollongong Corporation v Cowan   HCA         CLR   namely  that it was necessary both that the evidence sought to be adduced on appeal could not with reasonable diligence have been obtained for use at the trial  and that  if the evidence had been available at the trial  it was reasonably clear that an opposite result would have been produced   CLR at    In CDJ   their Honours held that these principles were inapplicable to a situation in which the discretion to admit further evidence did not arise under the common law but was given by statute   CLR at    They held that the exercise of the discretion under a provision equivalent to s   of the Federal Court Act was essentially a matter of statutory construction  and should not be approached as though the common law principles  conclusively indicate the proper construction of the statutory provision   at    In the exercise of the statutory power  their Honours held  the  critical factor  was the subject matter of the proceedings with which the appeal was concerned  because  the purpose of the power to admit further evidence is to ensure that the proceedings do not miscarry   at    They held that  under the statutory power  the court hearing the appeal  weighs factors  although it may of course develop guidelines for weighing those factors and exercising the discretion   at    A little later in their judgment  their Honours said that the common law rules as to the admission of fresh evidence  cannot exhaustively define the scope of the discretion  under the statutory provision  at   emphasis added   McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ then proceeded to advert to a number of considerations  any one of which may  in an appropriate case  influence the exercise of the judicial discretion to admit further evidence  First  they pointed out that the principal purpose of the statutory provision was to give the court a discretionary power to admit evidence which would demonstrate that the order under appeal was erroneous  This was a power which facilitated the avoidance of errors which could not otherwise be remedied by the application of conventional appellate procedures  Alternatively  and in practice in a subsidiary way  the purpose was to give the court discretion to admit further evidence to buttress the findings already made  at    Secondly  their Honours referred to the principle that a provision conferring judicial power on a court should be construed liberally  and without the making of implications or the imposition of limitations not found in the words used by the legislature  at    Thirdly  it was relevant that the appellate court was hearing an appeal against an order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction  It was unlikely that Parliament should have intended that the statutory provision  equivalent to s   should be construed in a way that would have the practical effect of obliterating the distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction  Fourthly  their Honours stressed that the availability of further evidence should not be treated as the equivalent of a ground of appeal  proof of which prima facie entitled the appellant to a new trial  Their Honours continued       Ordinarily  where it is alleged that the admission of new evidence requires a new trial  justice will not be served unless the Full court is satisfied that the further evidence would have produced a different result if it had been available at the trial  Without that condition being satisfied  it could seldom  if ever  be in the interests of justice to deprive the respondent of the benefit of the orders made by the trial judge and put that person to the expense  inconvenience and worry of a new trial      Fifthly  their Honours doubted the value of a  usefulness  test  and rejected the proposition that an appellate court might admit further evidence merely because it was useful  Sixthly  the appellate court would  readily  admit further evidence which was not in dispute  and which the court was able to evaluate and to take into account without the necessity for a rehearing  They noted that evidence of this kind was particularly likely to be admitted where it related to events occurring after the trial  In such a case the likely effect of the further evidence on the appellate court s view of the evidence before the trial judge was the important consideration  They continued     Where there is no need for a new trial or extensive taking of evidence  other discretionary factors such as the availability of the evidence at the trial and the need for finality of litigation are likely to be more relevant in the exercise of the discretion than the effect that the evidence would have had at the trial      Seventhly  their Honours said that the power to admit further evidence must be exercised judicially  adding a comment which related specifically to the Family Law Act but which  when considered more generally  amounted to the proposition that the discretion to admit further evidence should be affirmatively exercised only if that evidence were relevant and admissible according to ordinary principles  or by statute  and if there were no reason for suspecting the credibility of the evidence  at    Eighthly  on the subject of a party s failure to adduce the evidence before the primary judge  their Honours said  at      Where the evidence has been deliberately withheld  the failure to call it will ordinarily weigh heavily in the exercise of the discretion  In other cases  the failure to call the evidence even if it could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence may be of little significance  No invariable rule concerning the failure to call the evidence can or should be laid down in view of the wide discretion conferred on the court by the section  The High Court judgment in CDJ has been considered twice by a Full Court  In Cottrell v Wilcox   FCAFC     the Full Court held that the judgment in CDJ was applicable to the discretionary power available under s   of the Federal Court Act  at    Referring to that discretion  the Full Court said  at        That discretion is confined only by the requirement that it be exercised judicially and consistently with the judicial process  CDJ v VAJ at      It is  with respect  curious that the Full Court referred to page   of the Commonwealth Law Reports in this respect  since that page occurs within the reasons for judgment of Gaudron J  who dissented  Probably  however  the proposition upon which the Full Court relied is equally harmonious with the broad propositions underlying the judgment of the majority  McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ  Importantly for present purposes  I do not read Cottrell as precluding me from deriving guidance from the various specific considerations to which their Honours in the majority in CDJ referred  as set out above  The other Full Court judgment to which reference must be made is NASB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    This was a judgment given on   February   which  when amended by a corrigendum issued on   May   contains the following passage       In order for this Court to receive further evidence  generally speaking  cf   Cottrell v Wilcox   FCAFC       FCA   at     citing CDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR   at     per Gaudron J      per McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ and     per Kirby J  it will be found that two conditions must be satisfied  first  the party seeking to adduce the evidence must show that it could not  with reasonable diligence  have been adduced at the trial  and  secondly  the evidence must be such that very probably the result would have been different  see  for example  Orr v Holmes   HCA         CLR   at     per Latham CJ  The second condition has been variously expressed in the cases  but the point made in all of them is that it is not enough that the new evidence was relevant and otherwise admissible  and may have affected the result  Language referring to  at the lowest   probability  and at the highest   certainty  of a different result  has been used  cf R v Copestake  Ex parte Wilkinson     KB   at    of such importance as very probably to influence the decision  and  of such weight as  if believed  would probably have an important influence on the result  Orr v Holmes at    high degree of probability that the admission of the new evidence would result in a different verdict  Florance v Andrew     ALR   at    such a different complexion on the case that a reversal of the former result ought certainly to ensue  Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   at      as agreed by the parties   almost certain that        an opposite result would have been reached by the primary judge       Although this passage contains an echo of the common law criteria referred to in Wollongong Corporation   and held to be inapplicable under a statutory provision like s   in CDJ   the Full Court s reference to CDJ does  on my reading of it  make it tolerably clear that it considered that CDJ ought to be applied in the exercise of the discretion under s    Particularly  the Full Court statement that  in relation to the second condition  it was not enough that the new evidence was relevant and otherwise admissible  and may have affected the result  is in broad conformity with the fourth consideration adumbrated in CDJ to which I have referred in par   above
