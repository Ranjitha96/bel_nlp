SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedApplicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Minister submits that the Act authorises the Tribunal to continue to review the decision to its conclusion even though the particular Tribunal member has determined the matter previously and relies upon Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj   HCA         CLR    The Minister also relies upon Applicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   at       and submits that the duty of the Tribunal to review the delegate s decision under s     of the Act continues until one of the outcomes described in s   of the Act is reached  The Minister submits that because the Tribunal s first decision was attended by jurisdictional error by reason of a failure to comply with s  A of the Act  it is not a valid decision under the Act and the Tribunal s duty of review accordingly continues until it validly reaches an outcome envisaged by s   of the Act referred toAustralian National Industries Ltd v Spedley Securities Ltd  in liq      NSWLR   In view of the adverse findings made by the Tribunal member relating to the credit of the appellant  the withdrawal of the first decision gives no confidence that an impartial mind could be brought to hear the further enquiry  Apprehension of bias has been found to exist in proceedings where an adjudicator has made previous findings as to a witness s credit on the same set of facts  see Australian National Industries Ltd v Spedley Securities Ltd  in liq      NSWLR   at     Livesey   HCA       CLR   Grassy v The Queen

ALR   The Minister relied upon Bilgin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   to support the submission that the review was properly conducted  In that decision Finkelstein J found no basis to support the claim of apprehended bias  Further  the decision did not concern two decisions by the same Tribunal  Accordingly the facts are distinguishable and the Minister s reliance on this decision is misconceived   Because of the adverse findings by the Tribunal member of the appellant s credit and the falsity of his documents in the first decision  the Court is satisfied that a fair minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal member would not bring an impartial mind to bear in making to second decision referred toCoulton v Holcombe   HCA

required to continue its review of the delegate s decision until one of the outcomes in s   has been reached  However  the statutory obligation to do so does not authorise the Tribunal to depart from its duty to provide a hearing which complies with the requirements of s     The Court is satisfied that an objective observer might reasonably apprehend bias on the part of the Tribunal member from the conduct of the Tribunal in its reconsideration of the appellant s application after comprehensively rejecting the appellant s claims  evidence and credit in the first decision  The second decision was accordingly attended by jurisdictional error and was not   fair  as required by s   of the Act  The Court finds that the Tribunal should have been constituted differently for determination of the second review   For the above reasons the Court grants leave to the appellant to rely upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and allows the appeal  noting that there was no error by Scarlett FM in respect

decision and the reasons for decision  that a fair minded informed observer would reasonably apprehend a lack of impartiality in the sense discussed  does not carry with it the conclusion that there

considerations include the prospects of success of the new grounds  whether an acceptable explanation has been provided as to why they were not raised in the Court below  whether it would be efficient to hear the new grounds  the interests of the appellant  the precedent value of any consideration of the issues  whether there is any prejudice to the respondents and whether any such prejudice can be remedied  and where in all the circumstances do the interests of justice lie   The Court pays regard to the following considerations  First  while no explanation has been provided for the abandonment of the ground of apprehension of bias by counsel in the proceedings before Scarlett FM  the Minister has not claimed that any significant prejudice would result if leave is granted  This ground was raised by the appellant in his original application for review of the Tribunal s second decision and the Minister had prepared and filed a response to that ground in the Federal Magistrates Court  As noted by Madgwick J in NAJT   FCR   the Minister in migration appeals is not in the position of a personal litigant and does not bear the financial risks and strains of personal involvement in litigation   Secondly the principle of the need for finality of litigation has not been adversely affected  The appellant has conducted the proceedings within the strict time limits imposed by the Act and this matter has proceeded to appeal without delay  The appellant s application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal has not used more of the Court s resources than is usual in matters of this

  We would not consider it appropriate  or just  in the particular circumstances of this case  to fix the appellant with the consequences of what seems to us to have been an error of judgment by his former counsel in abandoning a point which had originally been taken  and which was plainly viable  It would be wrong to permit the Minister s decision to deport the appellant to stand if evidence exists which demonstrates that decision to have been affected or induced by actual bias
