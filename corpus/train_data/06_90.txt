have the consent of the Commissioner for Taxation  and that in my view is an important and different circumstance to those of the present case   The approach of His Honour in Crosbie has been considered and rejected in the other cases referred to above  In Wanted World Wide  Lander J of this court refused to follow Crosbie and distinguished the authorities relied on in that case  At   His Honour sets out the reasoning and governing considerations in favour of his conclusion that s  FF allows orders to made by consent without the necessity to make a finding after examination of all the evidence  He considered that the court was entitled to act on the admissions and be satisfied that an order could be made  His Honour placed particular emphasis on the practical advantages of enabling an order to be made on the admissions of the parties before the court  in order to avoid a waste of time  effort  resources and expense  His Honour considered that the Court is entitled to act on admissions and be satisfied that an order should be made  He considered that the construction given in Crosbie operates to defer parties coming to a significant agreement with the liquidator to avoid costs  He referred especially to the significant expenditure to procure an expert s reports to establish undisputed insolvency at the expense of unsecured creditors  In that case  His Honour acted on the admissions and made the order   I consider that on a purposive approach having regard to the practical considerations as to expense  time and the importance of considered admissions in the absence of any real contest are powerful considerations sufficient to demonstrate that Crosbie was clearly wrong  with the consequence that I am not obliged to follow the reasoning the that case   Accordingly  I propose to apply the reasoning of Lander J and the line of authorities on which His Honour relied and are referred to above  The challenged transactions are insolvent transactions of the company under s  FF   s  FE and s  FC   Mr  Hines  for the director Mr  Evans  points out that if the order under s  FF is made  there could be prejudice to other directors who have not been served and who are not present before me  He submits that the consequence of an order under s  FF is that each person who was a director at the time the payment was made is liable to indemnify the Commissioner in respect of any loss or damage results from the order  He refers to authority that any payment by the Commissioner will be loss or damage within s  FGA   Mr  Hines then says that the operation of s  FGA is not simply to raise a rebuttable presumption under s  E    because an action under s  FGA is not a  recovery proceeding  in relation to the company as it cannot be described as an application under s  FF by the company s liquidator  Therefore  if the order is made  he says  any liability to indemnify of the other directors cannot be rebutted by them  The answer to this submission  in my view  is that because the liability the liability is a consequence of the operation of s   FF  it is sufficiently related to that section  and it can therefore be said that any recovery under s   FGA is a recovery proceeding within s  E  The operation of the two sections in the circumstances set out in s   FGA is sufficiently close to make the presumption under s  FE  rebuttable  Liability under s  FGA is dependent on an order being made under s  FF in the present circumstances  In addition  there is provision for defence to liability under s   FGA in s  FGB  to    Another concern is the possible detriment to the other directors  who are not present  if an order is made between the plaintiff and the defendant is that any director liable under s   FGA  has a statutory right of indemnity against the other directors  For these reasons  I am persuaded that orders ought be made in relation to the implementation of the settlement between the liquidator and the Commissioner having regard to the admissions made and the evidence put before me   Two other matters arose on   February   when the matter came on for hearing  This was the first of three days set aside for the hearing  Mr  Evans was represented by Mr  Hines  who sought leave to make substantial amendments to the pleadings  and to file further affidavits in support  which would necessitate a substantial adjournment and require vacation of the hearing dates  Mr  Evans sought adjournment of the hearing and undertook meet any costs of the Commissioner thrown away as a result of the adjournment   I refuse an adjournment  having regard to the lateness of the application and the history of the matter  The extreme lateness of the application and the attempt to radically vary the issues as originally framed on the first day of the hearing would clearly necessitate additional evidence on both sides  No adequate notice was given to the Commissioner  No acceptable explanation was given for the failure to raise the new issues and prepare additional evidence at an earlier date  At the time the original defence to the cross claim was filed and served  Mr  Evans was legally represented and was legally represented before me on   February   citedDean Willcocks v Commissioner of Taxation  No     NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  There is some conflict in the
