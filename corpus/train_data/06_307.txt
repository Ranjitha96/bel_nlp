Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there was jurisdictional error in that the decision of the Tribunal was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could make it   Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   and that its fact finding process was  tainted by extreme irrationality or illogicality    This ground was said to arise because  as expressed in its conclusion quoted above  the Tribunal had formed a  perception  without logically reasoning to it  The decision was arbitrary without a logical course of reasoning   This argument is without foundation  Plainly in par   of its reasons the Tribunal was using  perception  in the sense of a conclusion or finding  not some idiosyncratic or capricious impression  It was entirely open to the Tribunal to conclude on the evidence  and particularly that relating to the offence itself  that the applicant was a man who was  in the language of the Tribunal   self absorbed  emotive and vengeful   There was every reason to think that if released and at large in Australia he might continue to pursue Mrs Flowers  This was a case where even if the risk of re offending could be assessed as slight  the possible outcome if the risk eventuated would be catastrophic  involving the death of or serious injury

scope and purpose  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited   HCA         CLR   at      At best it was evidence  Even if it had been ignored there would have been no legal error by the Tribunal  still less jurisdictional error   But in any event there is no reason to conclude that the Tribunal did not pay regard to Dr Sale s report  Moreover  the character and medical problems detailed by Dr Sale are by no means confined to the lymphoma question  It is a considerable distortion to impute to Dr Sale the view that  i  all the applicant s criminal behaviour was due to his fear of lymphoma   ii  it is now established he does not have lymphoma   iii  ergo there is now no risk of further criminal behaviour  and in particular  towards his wife   The appeal will be dismissed
