In the matter of Thomas Richard Wenkart  Wenkart v Pantzer   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredDoolan v Dare   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The relationship between s   and s  U of the Act was considered by the Full Court in Doolan v Dare   FCAFC         FCR    Their Honours  conclusions in this regard concerning the Act as in force at the time with which this proceeding is concerned may be summarised as follows   a  The Act assumes the existence of a right to be remunerated where a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed in the expectation that he or she will be remunerated and there is no prior arrangement to act gratuitously   b  s   and not s  U  provides the mechanism for fixing the remuneration to be paid to a trustee   c  s  U merely prescribes what is to occur at the first meeting of creditors in relation to a trustee s remuneration  and in the case of s  U  at later meetings of creditors   d  s  U  requires that a trustee s stated wish to be remunerated at the rate prescribed by the Regulation be minuted  it does not require that effect be given to that wish   e  a motion fixing the trustee s remuneration passed in accordance with s  U is a resolution for the purposes of s    f  s   does not prevent the creditors from fixing the trustees  remuneration in relation to work to be undertaken thereafter in a sum or at a rate less than that which would otherwise flow from the application of the prescribed rate  the trustee s entitlement to a minimum level of remuneration is established by s  B  and   g  it is therefore incorrect to state that a trustee is permitted to elect to be remunerated at the prescribed rate  entitlement to remuneration at the prescribed rate arises by operation of s   when work is done for which no remuneration is fixed   Neither party contended that  as a consequence of Mr Pantzer s failure to comply with the requirements of s  U  the first meeting of Dr Wenkart s creditors was a nullity  Dr Wenkart s argument was that the failure to comply with s  U  rendered ineffective the resolutions of the creditors fixing Mr Pantzer s remuneration  He additionally submitted that the proper construction of s  U  when read with s   is that it is not possible for creditors at their first meeting to approve any remuneration for work done by the trustee   It seems to me that Dr Wenkart s argument that the failure to comply with s  U  rendered the creditors  resolutions ineffective is inconsistent with the conclusions of the Full Court in Doolan v Dare as to the significance of s  U  Their Honours took the view that s   and not s  U  provides the mechanism for fixing the remuneration to be paid to trustees  I therefore conclude that Mr Pantzer s failure to comply with s  U  did not affect the validity of the motions carried at the first meeting of Dr Wenkart s creditors concerning Mr Pantzer s remuneration nor the motions on the same topic carried at later meetings   I also reject Dr Wenkart s submission as to the significance of s  U  when read with s    Section  U  requires the President of a meeting of creditors other than the first meeting of creditors to request the trustee to lay before the meeting a statement of the amount of remuneration drawn by him or her from the funds of the bankrupt estate  That is  it is concerned with the drawing of remuneration  not the approval of remuneration  Nothing in s  U  or s   suggests that the legislature intended to prevent creditors at their first meeting fixing by resolution of the creditors the remuneration of the trustee for work done before  at or  subject to the issue of prospective approval referred to below  after that meeting   The practice of creditors approving future remuneration of a trustee in bankruptcy by reference to time charging at the recommended rates set out in the IPAA guidelines is well established  see  for example  Pattison v Bellin at    No instance of any Judge expressing disapproval of the practice was drawn to my attention  In Doolan v Dare the Full Court referred to Finkelstein s consideration of the history of the  fixing  of fees of insolvency practitioners and observed at   that the provisions of the Corporations Act    Cth  with which his Honour was concerned differ substantially from the provisions of the Act concerning the remuneration of trustees  In the above circumstances I do not consider it appropriate for a single judge to determine that a practice apparently sanctioned by other judgments of the Court is inconsistent with the Act  Having placed reliance on the view expressed by Finkelstein J  Dr Wenkart will be free  if so advised  to press his argument in this regard before the Full Court citedIn Re Dare   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The provisions of s  b  of the Act were also considered by Drummond J in In Re Dare   FCA         FCR   at      His Honour agreed with French J that it is necessary to read down s  b  to avoid absurdity  noting that the legislative intent could not have been to proscribe the long standing practice of members of partnerships being appointed as trustees and bringing their earnings as trustees into the pool of partnership income  Drummond J also expressed the view at   that it was difficult to identify any policy in the Act that would be served by reading the subsection as preventing a trustee dealing as the trustee chose with his or her income so long as the dealing was for the trustee s benefit  Finding guidance as to the limitation that should be placed on s  b  in its precursor  s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  his Honour concluded that the subsection would not strike at an employee trustee paying over or arranging to have paid to the trustee s employer his or her fees earned as trustee  Although Drummond J did not give express consideration to the position of an independent consultant trustee  I see no reason to limit the general approach adopted by his Honour so as to exclude its operation in respect of an independent consultant trustee   Considering it appropriate to follow the approach adopted by Drummond J in In Re Dare  I reject the submission that Mr Pantzer s arrangements concerning his remuneration as trustee of Dr Wenkart s bankrupt estate contravened s  b  of the Act  I also reject the alternative submissions that to the extent to which Mr Pantzer was paid remuneration in excess of the amount that he actually received from the Partnership he is liable to Dr Wenkart as the residuary beneficiary of the trust estate in respect of that amount   It is not in dispute that persons in the employ of the Partnerships assisted Mr Pantzer in the performance of his duties as trustee of Dr Wenkart s estate  Those persons were not accurately described as either partners or staff of Mr Pantzer   Section  U  of the Act required Mr Pantzer  at the first meeting of Dr Wenkart s creditors  to state the respective rates at which his remuneration and that of the other persons who would be assisting him would be calculated  It appears from the minutes of the meeting that Mr Pantzer sought to comply with this requirement by providing creditors with a copy of the document described in   above citedKorda  in the Matter of Stockford Limited   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Korda  in the Matter of Stockford Limited   FCA         FCR   at   Finkelstein J expressed doubt as to the validity of the practice of creditors  fixing  the prospective fees of liquidators on a time charge basis  Dr Wenkart submitted that the Court should conclude that this practice is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act citedNilant v Macchia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A first meeting of creditors is  in my view  a proceeding under the Act within the meaning of s   of the Act   Nilant v Macchia   FCA         FCR   per Carr J at   and Weinberg J at      The defect in the resolutions was in the circumstances  I conclude   a formal defect or irregularity   s   citedPattison v Bellin   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  However  the motion carried at the meeting held on   March   approving Mr Pantzer s remuneration and  that of his partners and staff  from   March   to   March   in the sum of     suggests that by   March   Mr Pantzer s claimed remuneration from   December   calculated on the approved basis had reached the limit of   fixed by the creditors at their first meeting  I therefore conclude that the approval of     for remuneration from   March   to   March   was an amount additional to the amounts approved at the first meeting of creditors  On the same basis I conclude that the motion fixing the further remuneration of Mr Pantzer from   March   to a limit of     beyond which further approval would be required from creditors was intended  together with the approval in respect of     to constitute approval for additional remuneration in a further amount of    It might have been arguable that by this motion the creditors reserved to themselves the fixing of any further remuneration beyond that amount  cf the resolution of creditors considered by Goldberg J in Pattison v Bellin   FCA         FCR   at   and    It does not appear that it has ever been so argued   I conclude that on the proper construction of the above resolution  the creditors purportedly approved Mr Pantzer s remuneration as follows   a      for the period from   October   December    b    for future remuneration from   December    c      for the period from   March   March      d      for future remuneration from   March   and   e      in accordance with para  a I  of the s   proposal    These amounts are reflected in the first eleven payment items shown on Mr Pantzer s schedule  see   above    The practice of creditors approving future remuneration of a trustee in bankruptcy by reference to time charging at the recommended rates set out in the IPAA guidelines is well established  see  for example  Pattison v Bellin at    No instance of any Judge expressing disapproval of the practice was drawn to my attention  In Doolan v Dare the Full Court referred to Finkelstein s consideration of the history of the  fixing  of fees of insolvency practitioners and observed at   that the provisions of the Corporations Act    Cth  with which his Honour was concerned differ substantially from the provisions of the Act concerning the remuneration of trustees  In the above circumstances I do not consider it appropriate for a single judge to determine that a practice apparently sanctioned by other judgments of the Court is inconsistent with the Act  Having placed reliance on the view expressed by Finkelstein J  Dr Wenkart will be free  if so advised  to press his argument in this regard before the Full Court   On   December   Cutler Hughes   Harris advised Hunt   Hunt that Mr Pantzer s costs  expenses and remuneration were as follows  A  Trustee s remuneration These figures do not include any realisation and interest charges or GST payable that may become due or other possible liabilities such as insurance     B  Anticipated Trustee Costs and Expenses   to finalise all matters in the bankrupt estate in the event that all costs  expenses and remuneration are paid as at   November       C  Trustee s Legal Fees and Disbursements   as at   November       A  Total Further Anticipated Legal Fees and Disbursement   depending on terms of s  proposal and date of acceptance    to unknown   Total costs of Administration   in the event that a s  proposal goes ahead which excludes any dispute as to the trustee s entitlement for full remuneration and payment of his full costs and expenses as set out above     By a memorandum dated   January   Hunt   Hunt repeated their request to Cutler Hughes   Harris for an itemised account of their costs   By a letter dated   January   Mr Pantzer advised Hunt   Hunt    My solicitors did not state in their facsimile to you of   December   that an itemised Bill of Costs had been provided by it to the creditors  My solicitor s statement was that the Trustee              will provide an itemised Bill of Costs  as provided by Cutler Hughes   Harris  to the Creditors            I have been issued with legal Bills of Costs in relation to the estate for work up to November    My solicitors are currently preparing Memoranda of Fees in relation to the work done since that date  The Bill of Costs which I have received  are of course  available for inspection by the creditors at any time        Please find enclosed copies of the bills with which  I  have already been issued  Upon receipt of the Bills of Costs from Cutler Hughes and Harris relating to work done from November   I will provide you with those copies                  Would you please confirm that your clients still require a taxation of those bills        In the event that your clients require taxation of the bills  would you please indicate             a  Which creditor will provide me with the costs of making an application for taxation of the bills  and      b  Which creditor will undertake to provide payment of those costs or provide me with security for the payment of those costs         by return letter       The evidence does not identify the copy bills apparently enclosed with the above letter consideredRe Hurt  Ex parte Hurt     ALR   It is not necessary for me to express a view on whether the practice whereby the respective Partnerships charged in their own names for Mr Pantzer s work as trustee was objectionable  I note  however  that in Re Hurt  Ex parte Hurt     ALR   at     French J expressed the view in the context of an employed trustee in bankruptcy that a trustee should render accounts for work done as a trustee in the trustee s own name  His Honour observed at   that while the scope of s  b  of the Act must be read  somewhat less than literally to avoid absurdity  it could well be infringed by an arrangement under which the trustee in effect seeks to alienate his remuneration at source by abdicating to his or her employer the right to charge for the trustee s services citedWenkart v Pantzer     ALR   In Wenkart v Pantzer     ALR   at     I said    Subsection   does not operate  in my view  to prevent a trustee whose remuneration is fixed  for example  on a time spent basis  from causing some of the ordinary duties required by the Act to be performed by the trustee to be undertaken  in whole or in part  by persons under the trustee s supervision and control  If the section were to so operate it could be expected significantly to increase the costs of the administration of estates by rendering it impractical for a trustee to instruct less highly remunerated personnel to undertake aspects of the trustee s duties under the trustee s supervision        I conclude that subs   does not operate to require a taxing officer to disallow claims for remuneration by Mr Pantzer where the ordinary duties required by the Act to be performed by the trustee were performed by a person acting on behalf of Mr Pantzer and under his supervision and control  This view is consistent with the view expressed by Rogerson J in Re Ladyman     ALR   at   that a trustee can claim to be reimbursed for the cost of services rendered by persons employed exclusively by him or her  I also note that the Guide to Hourly Rates published by the Insolvency Practitioners  Association of Australia  which is recognised by reg     assumes that work will be undertaken by persons other than the trustee himself or herself   I am not satisfied in the circumstances of this case that the erroneous description in the resolution of creditors of those who assisted Mr Pantzer rendered those resolutions ineffective to fix Mr Pantzer s remuneration  It may be assumed that the creditors accurately understood that the persons concerned were partners or employees of the Partnerships  Nothing in the evidence suggests that the precise nature of the relationship between those persons and Mr Pantzer was of any real interest to the creditors citedWenkart v Pantzer  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Additionally  as I noted in   FCA   at     Mr Pantzer s claim for   of the sum of      ie     has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings  In Wenkart v Pantzer  No     FCA   published on   October   Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed  On that day Mr Pantzer s claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge  The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is  in my view    days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim  namely   March    reg     of the Bankruptcy Regulations   as then in force   This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer s schedule referred toWenkart v Pantzer   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   October   I published reasons for judgment in this matter   Wenkart v Pantzer   FCA    On that day I stood the proceeding over to a date to be fixed for the purpose of making orders giving effect to those reasons  Having regard to the complex history of the matter I additionally invited the parties to draw to my attention any issues on which I had inadvertently failed to rule   No agreement was reached between the parties as to the orders appropriate to be made to give effect to my reasons for judgment  Dr Wenkart took the view that my published reasons for judgment did not deal with all of the issues required to be resolved in this matter   The proceeding was therefore relisted to allow the parties to make further submissions  On   November   Mr Sheahan SC appeared with Mr Green for Dr Wenkart  Mr Creais  solicitor  appeared for Mr Pantzer and Mr Rea appeared for Hapday Holdings Pty Ltd  These reasons for judgment should be read together with those published on   October     Additionally  as I noted in   FCA   at     Mr Pantzer s claim for   of the sum of      ie     has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings  In Wenkart v Pantzer  No     FCA   published on   October   Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed  On that day Mr Pantzer s claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge  The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is  in my view    days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim  namely   March    reg     of the Bankruptcy Regulations   as then in force   This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer s schedule   The accuracy of Mr Pantzer s schedule so far as it concerns payments made to Cutler Hughes   Harris is not challenged by Dr Wenkart  Payments by Mr Pantzer to Cutler Hughes   Harris in the aggregate amount of   are evidenced by a list of cash payments  the Cash Payments List  made during the period of the administration by Dr Wenkart s bankrupt estate provided to Dr Wenkart s then solicitors  Bruce   Stewart  by Mr Pantzer s then solicitors  Sally Nash   Co  under cover of a letter dated   October   and placed in evidence by Dr Wenkart  At the heart of the dispute between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris is the question of whether all of the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris are required to be taxed to determine the total quantum of the costs that Mr Pantzer is entitled to recover from Dr Wenkart  see order   of the consent orders made on   March   which are reproduced in   FCA   at       Mr Pantzer s case is that there was no request for any of the amounts paid to Cutler Hughes   Harris to be taxed under s   of the Act other than the amount of   paid on the date that Dr Wenkart s bankruptcy was annulled  Robert Gorczyca of Bruce   Stewart  as the firm was then known  gave evidence that the first occasion on which he was provided with an accounting of the former bankrupt estate of Dr Wenkart was when he received the Cash Payments List  see   above   Before being retained by Dr Wenkart  Bruce   Stewart acted for creditors of Dr Wenkart s bankrupt estate  The evidence suggests that the only advice given by Mr Pantzer to Dr Wenkart and the creditors of his estate during the course of Dr Wenkart s bankruptcy is that referred to in   and   above  I therefore accept the accuracy of Mr Gorczyca s evidence in this regard   However  Dr Wenkart s primary submission concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris is that this proceeding has been conducted on the basis of an agreement by Mr Pantzer to have the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris taxed  and that this agreement is reflected in the orders made by Lindgren J on   October    Those orders are reproduced in   FCA   at     It is therefore necessary to review the history of the dealings between Mr Pantzer and Dr Wenkart so far as they touch on the legal costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris   The s   proposal put forward by Dr Wenkart by letter dated   January   provided for certain bank cheques to be given to Mr Pantzer subject to the acceptance of the proposal by his creditors  One of the proposals was    the amount of      in accordance with your letter of   December   less the cash on hand you currently hold  as advised to be approximately   in the form of a bank cheque for your outstanding legal fees  including any associated with the current proceedings  due to Cutler Hughes   Harris up to the date and conclusion of the Section   meeting and its implementation   I infer that there had been communication between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer before Dr Wenkart formulated his s   proposal  This appears to be confirmed by par   of an affidavit sworn by Mr Pantzer on   March    That paragraph reads as follows    At the date of the Section   proposal being put to me by the bankrupt on   January   I determined the amount of the Trustee s remuneration and costs and disbursements incurred in the administration of the bankrupt estate at that time  Those amounts were     payable to me as Trustee and     payable to Cutler Hughes   Harris  In proceedings   of   my rights to recover remuneration  costs  charges and expenses were preserved   The context in which Lindgren J came to make orders in this matter on   October   was that the docket judge  who was then Beaumont J  was unwell  Lindgren J was thus more than usually dependent on information provided to him by the parties  respective legal representatives  On   March   Beaumont J had made the consent orders that are set out in   FCA   at     Those orders provided  in effect  that Dr Wenkart charged the Paddington property to secure the remuneration  costs  charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was  or might become  lawfully entitled as trustee of his bankrupt estate and recorded that Dr Wenkart  agreed to pay the same within   days of determination of the quantum of the same or at such other time as the parties may agree   I observe  incidentally  that there is no suggestion that the parties have agreed another time   The orders made by Lindgren J on   October    see   FCA   at     although made after the filing of the cross claim  were intended to enable the amount to which Mr Pantzer was  lawfully entitled  as trustee of Dr Wenkart s estate to be quantified  Those orders in effect  obliged Mr Pantzer to require the persons who had provided services to him with respect to Dr Wenkart s bankrupt estate  other than Cutler Hughes   Harris  to supply bills of costs pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act and additionally obliged Mr Pantzer to notify Dr Wenkart of his claim for remuneration in respect of services provided after the annulment of Dr Wenkart s bankruptcy  I observe incidentally that the absence of any reference in the order to Mr Pantzer s entitlement to remuneration for services provided before the annulment of Dr Wenkart s bankruptcy supports my above conclusion that Mr Pantzer s entitlement in that regard had by that time been quantified  His Honour noted that Dr Wenkart conceded that upon completion of taxation of the claims for costs and remuneration referred to in the orders  the amount taxed would be amounts to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled within the meaning of the orders made on   March     The explanation for Mr Pantzer not being obliged by the orders made on   October   to require Cutler Hughes   Harris to supply bills of costs can be found in the transcript of the hearing on that day before Lindgren J  On that day Mr Johnson of counsel appeared for Mr Pantzer  One of the matters debated before his Honour was a procedure for quantifying the amounts to which Mr Pantzer was  lawfully entitled  within the meaning of order   of the consent orders made on   March    Mr Johnson told his Honour    The position that we would seek is orders that we are lawfully entitled to a quantified amount of remuneration and costs and  your Honour  either to give directions as to who that procedure  sic  is to be quantified and then that attached to the charge       Mr Johnson later observed    Well  if your Honour was then minded to consider a position of a regime for quantification  we would say there should be some conditions  because we re concerned about this matter dragging on   Mr Johnson went on to advise his Honour that the judgment of Beaumont J of   May    ie Wenkart v Pantzer   FCA   dealt with the amounts due to Cutler Hughes   Harris  That judgment concerned Mr Pantzer s entitlement to the amount of Ms Sexton s certificate of taxation of   February    Mr Johnson agreed with Lindgren J that  because Beaumont J had already determined the amount to which Mr Pantzer was entitled in respect of the costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris  those costs should be an exception to the order obliging Mr Pantzer to require service providers to supply bills of costs  Shortly thereafter the transcript records the following exchange concerning the way in which the orders to be made by Lindgren J should be drafted        His Honour      We have excluded from that order legal services provided to Mr Pantzer by Cutler Hughes   Harris  Now is that correct  That covers all legal services irrespective of when provided by Cutler Hughes   Harris      Mr Johnson  I believe it does  your Honour  And I also believe it extends to their out of pocket expenses  including counsel fees         His Honour  In other words  that is already subject to the existing taxation      Mr Johnson  Yes  Again  I will check Ms Sexton s taxation records on that  your Honour         It does not appear that Mr Johnson later qualified or withdrew his affirmative answer to the last of Lindgren J s above questions and his Honour thereafter made the orders dated   October     For the reasons given above  it appears that Mr Johnson s understanding on   October   of the ambit of Ms Sexton s taxation was erroneous  However  I see no reason to conclude that Dr Wenkart s legal representatives were aware of Mr Johnson s error  Dr Wenkart s solicitors had requested a comprehensive taxation of the costs of Cutler Hughes   Harris  I conclude that it is not now open to Mr Pantzer in this proceeding to adopt an approach that is inconsistent with the basis upon which Lindgren J was invited to make the orders dated   October     The transcript of the hearing before Lindgren J on   October   also reveals that on that day Mr Johnson accepted that the orders that Lindgren J was being invited to make would extend to other legal services provided to Mr Pantzer  including by him and his instructing solicitors  Sally Nash   Co  Nonetheless  Mr Pantzer now submits that the amounts paid by him to Mr Johnson  Sally Nash   Co and Mr P Walsh of counsel are all amounts to which he is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart because Dr Wenkart made no request for the relevant bills of costs to be taxed pursuant to s   of the Act  Again  I take the view that it is not now open to Mr Pantzer in this proceeding to adopt an approach that is inconsistent with the basis upon which Lindgren J was invited to make the orders dated   October    The bill of costs of Sally Nash   Co was certified by a taxing officer on   December    The respective bills of costs of Mr Johnson and Mr Walsh were certified by a taxing officer on   January    The quantum of Mr Pantzer s costs in respect of the legal services provided by those legal representatives was determined within the meaning of order   of the orders of   March   by the respective certificates of taxation   As mentioned above  the significance of the date   October   is that it is the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer s deemed cross claim seeking  an order in aid of  the Court s  order made on   March   by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of the  Paddington property   see   FCA   at       As noted in   FCA   at         the Full Court disagreed with the construction initially given by me to the orders made on   March   and   October    Nonetheless it is  I think  uncontroversial that Dr Wenkart s agreements to pay the remuneration  costs  charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is  lawfully entitled  from him is an agreement to pay within   days of the determination of the quantum of  the same   The charge over the Paddington property secures the payments by him of the relevant amount within that period of time  That is  Mr Pantzer is not entitled to exercise rights under the charge created by order   of the consent orders until Dr Wenkart defaults on his agreement to pay  By filing his cross claim Mr Pantzer sought to exercise rights in reliance on that charge   There is no dispute between the parties that the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart s bankrupt estate was      It is the payments made by Mr Pantzer that are controversial or perhaps  more accurately  the identification of the date or dates upon which the quantum of the amount or amounts to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled was determined   As indicated above  I accept that the creditors of Dr Wenkart s bankrupt estate authorised Mr Pantzer s remuneration in an aggregate amount of      Mr Pantzer s schedule reveals that between   December   and   March   he paid himself   cents more than the creditors had authorised  This may be ignored on the de minimis principle  The total amount of authorised payments made by Mr Pantzer to himself by way of remuneration earlier than   October   was thus
