Federal Magistrate considered the second claimed breach of s  A  of the Act that country information was not put to the appellant  He held  correctly  that the country information fell within the

application and that the appellant s reference in his review application to the statement in the protection visa application did not refer to that information  However  his Honour found the appellant did provide the information that he left China legally at the hearing before the Tribunal  The Tribunal had asked specific questions about the appellant leaving China legally and the appellant had answered those questions  He held that the appellant would have clearly understood the nature and importance of what he was saying and that he had not only acknowledged the information in his

cth FCAFC  html  The present case is on all fours with NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    The appellant in NBKT provided written submissions to the Tribunal in support of her application for review  which consisted in a letter from her advisers and a statement by herself  expanding upon the claims stated in her protection visa application and introducing further claims  In NBKT Young J  with whom Gyles and Stone JJ concurred  held that by filing written submissions with the Tribunal that expressly referred to and incorporated the statement of grounds which were attached to her visa application  the appellant invited the Tribunal to refer to her protection visa application  There was therefore little doubt that she intended the Tribunal to look at the visa application and its attachments  Young J held that this was a sufficient basis for the conclusion that the information was given by the appellant in that case for the purposes of the review and was excepted by s  A b  from the duty of disclosure   The appellant s statement in his application for review and in his written submissions indicate he intended the Tribunal to look at the visa application and the statement in it and to supplement that statement by reference to the application for review and written submissions   In NBKT Young J considered in obiter whether testimony at the Tribunal hearing was given by an applicant for the purposes of s  A b  in circumstances where it consisted in responses to questions asked by the Tribunal member  Young J agreed with the approach taken by Heerey J in VWBF    NBKT is Full Court authority that where an applicant adopts a protection visa application at a Tribunal hearing  whether by volunteering such adoption  or in answer to a question  the applicant gives the information in the protection visa application to the Tribunal   The appellant claims that the Tribunal should have sought evidence from  or relating to  Mr Meng  his former migration agent  because he was responsible for entering incorrect information in the statement in the protection visa application   For the reasons set out above the Tribunal did not have a duty to obtain evidence  There could be no non compliance with s   of the Act in respect of the Tribunal s failure to obtain evidence from or about Mr Meng   I am of the opinion that the appellant s express invitation to the Tribunal  in his application for review  Section D Your reasons for making the application  to  Please read my statement submitted to the Immigration Department  constituted that statement in its entirety as  information  which the appellant  gave  for the purpose of his application  Accordingly s  A b  of the Act had application  NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at    Furthermore his statement in his written submissions to the Tribunal  referred to above that he would like to provide further information
