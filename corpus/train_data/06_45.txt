HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Alternatively  even if it can be said that the present proceeding is based upon a cause of action that differs in certain respects from the case that was determined by Gray J  so that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply  it is at least arguable that principles of issue estoppel  or Anshun estoppel  prevent these claims from being pursued  See generally Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   see also VWZG v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at          The applicant was not represented before me  She said that she had signed the   June   letter indicating that she wished to withdraw her application for review in circumstances where she had not appreciated the effect of adopting that course  She was not legally represented at the time  and had merely been given informal advice by a migration agent  She claimed  in relation to this proceeding  that she had approached a lawyer to act for her  but had been told that there was some impediment to that lawyer doing so  She indicated that the lawyer had expressed concern about being personally liable for any costs that might be incurred in pursuing the litigation   I must say that I have some difficulty in accepting this account in its entirety  Nonetheless  even if what I was told was correct  the applicant still faces difficulties in pursuing this application referred toRe Commonwealth of Australia  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  If the time limits set out in the High Court Rules are applicable to this proceeding  the principles that govern the exercise of the power to enlarge time under those rules were outlined with great clarity by McHugh J in Re Commonwealth of Australia  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR    In particular  his Honour observed that a case  would need to be exceptional  before the time for commencing proceedings was enlarged by many months  In deciding whether or not to enlarge time  the Court may take into account any explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings  and the applicant s prospects for success in the proceedings  Moreover  as the constitutional writs are directed at the acts or decisions of public bodies or officials  the public interest requires that there be an end to litigation regarding the efficacy of such acts or decisions   At   of his reasons for judgment  McHugh J observed     Independently of the merits of the case  I find it difficult to see how a person who  with knowledge of the decision  delays   months before seeking relief could ever be granted an extension of time to quash such a decision unless some conduct of the respondent or the public body or official had brought about the delay  As the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council said in Ratnam v Cumarasamy    t he rules of court must prima facie be obeyed   The time for seeking certiorari is six times  and the time for seeking mandamus is twice  the period in which an application for special leave to appeal to this court can be brought against a judgment or decision  The periods for applying for certiorari and mandamus give a person affected by an adverse decision or judgment ample time in which to commence proceedings in this court  In all but very exceptional cases  they should be rigidly applied when  as here  more than one year has elapsed between the decision and the commencement of proceedings in this court    footnotes omitted  In Applicant M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     a Full Court  Heerey  Dowsett and Bennett JJ  cited these comments of McHugh J  and said at      Applying those observations and  by analogy  the time limits in the High Court Rules to the present case  relief should be declined for reason of delay   It may be noted that the expression  by analogy  in the passage set out above lends support to Gray J s view that the time limits set out in the High Court Rules do not ordinarily apply to matters that have been remitted to this Court  It is  of course  possible that the judge who remits the matter to this Court will order that those time limits do apply  However  that did not occur in this case   I should add that although the applicant seeks an order nisi for a writ of prohibition  as well as an order nisi for a writ of certiorari  and there is no specific time limit in the High Court Rules in relation to prohibition  it is plain that she can gain no comfort from this  Prohibition is not an appropriate remedy when challenging a decision of the Tribunal that has already been made  There is nothing left to prohibit  Once the Tribunal has made its decision  it has no further function to perform referred toRe Ruddock  Ex parte Reyes     ALR   If the order nisi for a writ of prohibition is directed to the Minister  seemingly with the intention of preventing her from giving effect to the Tribunal s decision  the remedy may  nonetheless  be inappropriate  In Re Ruddock  Ex parte Reyes     ALR     Reyes   McHugh J held that even if certiorari was granted to quash the Tribunal s decision  there should be no order for prohibition against the Minister  His Honour said at      there is no ground whatever in a case such as the present for the issue of a writ of prohibition against the minister  As was conceded  as the law stands at the moment and on the facts of the case  the minister was under a duty  in accordance with s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act   to deport the applicant  No claim for prohibition could possibly be made on the basis of his personal fault or breach of the law or jurisdictional error   McHugh J went on to say that the proper remedies in a case in which a decision of the Tribunal is challenged are certiorari and mandamus  both of which should be directed to the Tribunal   The reasoning in Reyes seems difficult to reconcile with the later decision of Merkel J in Thayananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   in which his Honour accepted the possibility that prohibition might be an appropriate remedy in cases of this type referred toThayananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct
