Armacel Pty Limited v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAdam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Philip Morris Incorporated     CLR   For reasons set out below  I propose to grant a stay with liberty to apply  A stay is an interlocutory order and a court must remain in control of its own interlocutory orders  Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Philip Morris Incorporated     CLR   at     There are two matters which have troubled me in exercising my jurisdiction to grant a stay  The first is the ordinary vicissitudes of litigation in another country  It may therefore be that  despite the views of Mr Smith  the US District Court will decline to apply the Trade Practices Act   If that were to occur  it may be appropriate to lift the stay  There may be other circumstances existing in the litigation in the United States which would also make it appropriate to consider such an application   The second is that  in my view  Smurfit is in clear breach of the Agreement in two respects  First  it has refused to submit to the jurisdiction of New South Wales by filing an appearance in this proceeding  On any view  it was bound to do so referred toApscore International Pty Ltd v Grand Canyon Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I also accept that it is entirely possible that at the final hearing the alleged representations will add little if anything to the claim for breach of contract  see Apscore International Pty Ltd v Grand Canyon Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA     However  the short answer to these submissions is to be found in Dr Bell s concession that the trade practices claim is not colourable  It follows from this that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the trade practices claim which has more than a trivial connection with the overall controversy  That is sufficient to warrant the grant of leave under O   r    The motion to set aside service thus ought to be refused   Whether there ought to be a stay depends upon the answers to the remaining questions referred toAggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA  the Angelic Grace      Lloyd s Rep   The fifth issue is  whether in the event that Smurfit is unsuccessful on its motion  I ought to grant Armacel s motion for an anti suit injunction  The principal question which arises under this issue is the stage that the US District Court proceeding has reached and whether to restrain it       would be not only invidious but the reverse of comity  Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA  the Angelic Grace      Lloyd s Rep   at     In early   a representative of Smurfit made contact with Armacel in an email requesting information about Armacel s technology  At that time  Mr Frank Matich of Armacel was in discussion with a number of other American companies that were interested in licensing the technology   The background to Armacel s discussions with potential American licensees appears to be that in late   it won an award from an American association as technology innovator of the year in the United States  Details were published in various magazines and journals  as a result of which Armacel received enquiries from countries in North and South America for the exploitation of the technology referred toAiton Aust Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd     FCR   Second  Smurfit is in breach of the Agreement to attempt to mediate the dispute in Sydney  In my view  that was an agreement to embark upon a process of dispute resolution and is enforceable as such  Aiton Aust Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd     FCR   at    I accept that the Agreement does not nominate a particular person to be the mediator  nor does it establish the machinery for the appointment of such a person  However  the better view in this case is that if the parties cannot agree the identity of a mediator  the Court can do so with the assistance of its powers under s  A of the Federal Court Act    Cth  and O   of the Federal Court Rules   see Booker Industries Proprietary Limited v Wilson Parking  Qld  Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR   at     referred toBlair v Curran     CLR   The first requirement draws attention to the need to identify with precision the issue which was necessarily decided in the earlier proceeding to see whether it is identical with an issue sought to be raised in the later proceeding  Blair v Curran     CLR   at   Makhoul v Barnes     FCR   at     The observations of Dixon J in Blair v Curran at   make it plain that the question which is the subject of the first requirement may be one of fact or law referred toBooker Industries Proprietary Limited v Wilson Parking  Qld  Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Second  Smurfit is in breach of the Agreement to attempt to mediate the dispute in Sydney  In my view  that was an agreement to embark upon a process of dispute resolution and is enforceable as such  Aiton Aust Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd     FCR   at    I accept that the Agreement does not nominate a particular person to be the mediator  nor does it establish the machinery for the appointment of such a person  However  the better view in this case is that if the parties cannot agree the identity of a mediator  the Court can do so with the assistance of its powers under s  A of the Federal Court Act    Cth  and O   of the Federal Court Rules   see Booker Industries Proprietary Limited v Wilson Parking  Qld  Proprietary

    The rehearing is conducted on the basis that the respondent should have the opportunity to put before the Court any additional material which may suggest that leave ought not to have been granted under O   r   Bray at   Clough v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No     FCA   at    referred toBurgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     FCR   Nevertheless  I am satisfied that the Trade Practice Act claim is not  colourable  in the sense referred to in Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     FCR   at    Ultimately  Dr Bell conceded that this was so referred toCarl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner   Keeler Ltd  No       AC   The High Court has adopted the formulation of Lord Guest in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner   Keeler Ltd  No       AC   at   of three requirements for the creation of an issue estoppel  Kuligowski v Metrobus   HCA         CLR   at     The requirements are  first  that the same question has been decided  second  that the decision was final  and third  that it was in proceedings between the same parties or their privies referred toCastillon v P O Ports Ltd   QCA  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QCA  html  The second requirement may be satisfied even if the earlier judgment is interlocutory  Castillon v P O Ports Ltd   QCA   at   ff  The requirement of finality has been broken down into two separate conditions  namely that the decision must be  final and conclusive  and  on the merits  The Sennar  No       WLR    HL  at     This passage from Lord Brandon s speech was referred to with apparent approval in Schnabel v Lui   NSWSC   at     Castillon v P O Ports Ltd at   and Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd v Madzoski   WASCA   at      The need for caution in the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel is well established  especially where the estoppel is said to arise from a judgment of a foreign court  and in an interlocutory context  The Sennar  HL  at   Castillon v P O Ports at   Desert Sun Loan Corp v Hill     All ER   at     The Sennar is also authority for that proposition as was accepted by Holmes JA in Castillon v P O Ports at     Having approached the present matter with what  I hope  is the requisite degree of caution  I have come to the view that the present case is indistinguishable from The Sennar and that  accordingly  Armacel is barred by an issue estoppel from contending that cl       is an exclusive jurisdiction clause  In coming to this view  I have considered the decisions of the House of Lords  and the Court of Appeal in that case  The Court of Appeal decision is cited as  The Sennar   No       Lloyd s Rep     It seems to me that the reasons for judgment of Kerr LJ and Sir Denys Buckley  Cumming Bruce LJ concurring  make it clear that it is not possible to avoid the consequence of issue estoppel by simply re characterising the issue as one which is sought to be litigated in accordance with the law of a different jurisdiction   As Kerr LJ said at   it was not open to the plaintiffs to say  simply    What we seek to litigate here are issues under English law  and it does not matter that we litigated precisely the same issues under other systems of law in Holland   The facts of The Sennar are of some importance  The plaintiffs  who were the holders of a bill of lading  invoked the jurisdiction of a Dutch Court by arresting a sister ship of The Sennar in Rotterdam  They brought an action for damages in the Dutch Court which held that their only cause of action lay in contract and that the Dutch court was bound to decline jurisdiction because the contract contained a clause under which the parties submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Sudan   The plaintiffs then began an action in the Admiralty Court of England  However  although they succeeded on the jurisdictional question at first instance  the Court of Appeal held that they were barred from suing in the English Court by reason of an issue estoppel arising from the determination of the Dutch Court as to the construction and effect of the exclusive jurisdiction clause   Kerr LJ observed at   that the classification of the plaintiffs  claim  as a matter of private international law  fell to be decided by Sudanese law as the proper law of the bill of lading  He said at   that by applying Sudanese law  the Dutch Court of Appeal had adopted the correct approach under the English rules of private international law   However  as I have said  Kerr LJ at   also rejected the proposition that it was open to the plaintiffs to seek to re litigate under English law the same issue that had been litigated under other systems of law in Holland   His Lordship observed at   that to accept this proposition would altogether remove the possibility of an issue estoppel arising  from any decision by any Court  on the jurisdiction clause  It would permit uncontrolled forum shopping and run directly counter to the policy behind the doctrine of issue estoppel referred toCentury Insurance Limited  In Prov Liq  v NZ Guardian Trust Limited  unreported  FCA  Lee J    May   The Court should not grant leave unless it is positively persuaded that it should do so  Voth at    However  the threshold is not high  The Court is not required to trawl through the material to determine the strength of the case  Rather  the Court s task

Dowty at     I do not consider that I should approach the question with an adverse pre disposition to the claim for negative declaratory relief  Challenger Group Holdings Ltd v Concept Equity Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at      This issue in the US District Court is not hypothetical  Our courts should be slow to criticise the approach of the foreign court to the question of negative declaratory relief  It must be a matter of discretion in all the circumstances  Moreover  the US District Court has held that it does have jurisdiction and no point was raised in the Pennsylvania proceeding about negative declaratory relief referred toClough v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The rehearing is conducted on the basis that the respondent should

SASR   It is true that a distinction exists between choice of law and submission to the jurisdiction so that the mere choice of New South Wales law does not automatically point toward submission to that jurisdiction  eg Contractors Ltd v MTE Control Gear Ltd   SASR   at   referred toDesert Sun Loan Corp v Hill     All ER   The need for caution in the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel is well established  especially where the estoppel is said to arise from a judgment of a foreign court  and in an interlocutory context  The Sennar  HL  at   Castillon v P O Ports at   Desert Sun Loan Corp v Hill     All ER   at     Nevertheless  in Desert Sun Loan   Evans LJ stated at   that an issue estoppel can arise from an interlocutory judgment of a foreign court on a procedural issue where

Indemnity Association     NSWLR   Whether a jurisdiction clause is an exclusive jurisdiction clause is a question of construction of the particular contract  having regard to the relevant surrounding circumstances as far as is permissible  FAI General Insurance Co Ltd v Ocean Marine Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association     NSWLR   at     The principles to be applied in determining the contractual intention of the parties were stated by Giles CJ Comm Div in FAI at      The absence of the word  exclusive  is not determinative  Other language in the jurisdiction clause and the overall nature and effect of the contract are to be considered   However  cl       falls to be construed against the background that this was a contract made between business people negotiating at arms  length who must be presumed to have intended some certainty as to where their disputes would be litigated  The relevant courts  ie the courts of New South Wales or  subject to what I say below  the Federal Court  would have jurisdiction by reason of the choice of law clause  The parties agreed to mediate in Sydney  It is therefore difficult to see why they would not have intended that all their disputes be resolved in New South Wales  Sohio Supply Co v Gatoil  USA  Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at     cited in FAI at     and   referred toFencott v Muller   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The effect of Smurfit s submission on the first issue is that  no prima facie case having been established under the Trade Practices Act   the claim for breach of contract does not fall within the accrued jurisdiction of the Court under the principles stated in Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   at       The second issue is whether the decision of the US District Court was final and conclusive and  on the merits  so as to give rise to an issue estoppel precluding Armacel from contending that cl       is an exclusive jurisdiction clause   The third issue is the proper construction of cl        That is to say  the question is whether that clause provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of New South Wales  Also falling within this issue is the subsidiary question of whether a submission to the jurisdiction of New South Wales is a submission to the jurisdiction of the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court  Senior Counsel for Smurfit submits that it is not  This issue only arises if Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel    Nor am I satisfied that the Trade Practices Act claims are  trivial or insubstantial  in their relationship to the overall controversy  Fencott v Muller at   Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at       Nevertheless  in certain circumstances the Federal Court picks up the laws of the States under s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth  in the exercise of federal jurisdiction  John Robertson   Co Ltd v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    Thus  a matter heard in the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court would pick up the rules of State law  at least in those instances in which the laws of New South Wales apply generally eg to matters of procedure  The federal jurisdiction also includes accrued jurisdiction over non federal matters as referred to in Fencott v Muller   In addition  the Federal Court has jurisdiction in associated matters under s   of the Federal Court Act  appliedHenry v Henry     CLR   Alternatively  Smurfit seeks a stay of this proceeding on the ground that the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR   and Henry v Henry     CLR     The fourth issue  which only arises if I am satisfied that the jurisdiction of New South Wales is non exclusive and that Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel  is whether this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum  ie  whether this proceeding is vexatious or oppressive in the strict sense  Voth at     Henry v Henry at         It is prima facie vexatious and oppressive to commence a proceeding in an Australian court if another action is already pending between the same parties  raising the same issues in another country  The existence of simultaneous proceedings with respect to the same controversy is a highly relevant consideration but it does not necessarily follow that there should be a stay of the Australian proceedings  Henry v Henry at     CSR v Cigna at  ff    The test to be applied is whether having regard to the controversy as a whole  the Australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the Voth sense  CSR v Cigna at    The considerations include which forum can provide more effectively for complete resolution of the matters in controversy  which proceeding was commenced first and the stage that each of the proceedings has reached  Henry v Henry at     The problems which arise if the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the same matter are such that  prima facie   the continuation of one or other of them must be seen as vexatious or oppressive in the sense

Australia Corporation Ltd v HIH Casualty   General Insurance Ltd  in Liquidation    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The position seems to me to be unlike that which existed in Reinsurance Australia Corporation Ltd v HIH Casualty   General Insurance Ltd  in Liquidation    FCA    There  it was established on the evidence that the trade practices claims could not be maintained in the United States and that the remedies which would have been available in the English court were more restricted than those that were available under the Trade Practices Act   see at         Accordingly  I am not satisfied that Armacel is deprived of a legitimate forensic disadvantage in being forced to bring its claim in the United States   There is some force in Dr Bell s submission that the dispute has a closer factual connection with the United States than it does with Australia  The principal issues in the contract claim appear to be the reasonableness of Smurfit s efforts to exploit the technology in the United States and whether it was entitled to disconnect Armacel s machine  The latter question may raise the application of United States environmental law issues
