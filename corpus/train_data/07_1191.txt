debt from a firm of solicitors called Lennon Settle Mazzeo Lawyers  the Assignor   The learned Magistrate held at   that the bankruptcy notice was an abuse of process  His Honour found at   that it had been issued  solely for the purpose of securing payment of the debt   The Creditor had failed to take  appropriate action to otherwise recover the debt or even make demand upon the Debtor   at    There was  his Honour found at   a collateral purpose in that the Creditor and the Assignor had a  contrived arrangement  to circumvent the operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   The Assignor was said to be a secured creditor for a much larger amount  By  syphoning off  a small debt to the Creditor  the Assignor could bring about the Debtor s bankruptcy without having to surrender his security  as required by s   had it been the petitioning creditor  at     The debt the subject of the bankruptcy notice was     being the amount taxed by Master Bruce of the Supreme Court of Victoria as the costs of the Assignor pursuant to orders made against the Debtor in the Supreme Court in   and    The Master s Certificate was issued on   January    The notice of assignment dated   May   was in evidence  although not the assignment itself  The notice of assignment was in these terms     To  Mr Karl Etl  aka Karel Etl    Of    Richardson Street  Essendon       NOTICE OF ASSIGNMENT OF DEBT

was served with a bankruptcy notice in respect of the assigned debt  As required by the statutory form  the notice included the statement     You are required  within   days after service on you of this Bankruptcy Notice     a  to pay to the creditor the amount of the debt  or        b  to make an arrangement to the creditor s satisfaction for settlement of the debt      The notice also stated that payment could be made to the Creditor at Level     Queen Street  Melbourne   citedAllesch v Maunz   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Debtor swore an affidavit in support of his application  Leaving aside some grounds which were dismissed by the learned Magistrate and not raised on appeal  the Debtor deposed that he was solvent and that any creditor s petition against him would amount to an abuse of process in view of the fact that any such sequestration orders would be  foredoomed to failure based upon my solvency   He deposed that he had  assets which exceed   million in value and my liabilities are far less than that figure   The affidavit continued         Further I believe that the Bankruptcy Notice also amounts to an abuse of process by reason of the fact that the assignor of the relevant debt previously filed another Bankruptcy Notice against me in this Court arising out of another proceeding filed in the County Court and has not pursued any bankruptcy proceedings against me on the basis of that principal judgment debt  I believe it has not done so because it knows that I am a solvent person         The appeal proceedings brought against the assignor arose out of that principal County Court proceeding  The purported assignor of the debt was my previous solicitor in Family law proceedings  Messrs  Lennon Settle  and they know full well that I am a solvent person with ample assets  I believe that the Bankruptcy Notice has been filed as an illegitimate attempt to cause me stress and vexation  knowing full well that I am a solvent person  It smacks of an abuse of process designed to persecute me and designed to ulitise this Court s a debt collector when there are ample alternative remedies available to any judgment credit or assignee thereof to collect any judgment debt owed by me      The Debtor s speculation about the beliefs and motives of the Assignor and the Creditor would seem to be inadmissible  No objection was taken  However  as this is an appeal by way of rehearing  the judgment appealed from can be set aside where there is legal  factual or discretionary error  Allesch v Maunz   HCA

Unsupported speculation of this kind has no probative value citedMaxwell Smith v S   E Hall Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  His Honour referred to statements of principle including those in Maxwell Smith v S   E Hall Pty Ltd   FCA   when Jacobson J cited a number of propositions including at        If it is apparent to the Court that the purpose of a bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay a debt  rather than to invoke the Court s insolvency jurisdiction  the issue of the bankruptcy notice will be an abuse of process    Authorities cited  The learned Magistrate at   found the evidence of the Debtor s solvency  clearly deficient   This aspect has not been pursued on the appeal citedEtl v Settle   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  His Honour at   thought that the Creditor had been  less than frank  with the Court in divulging the true circumstances leading up to the execution of the assignment  He noted that the assignment itself had not been produced and there might have been formal defects in it  His Honour continued         In any event  applying the authorities to which reference has been made  I am satisfied that the bankruptcy notice has been issued as a means to secure payment of the debt and further that it has a collateral purpose  On that basis  I am satisfied it is an abuse of process and should be set aside         It is clear on the evidence before me that the Creditor has issued the bankruptcy notice solely for the purpose of securing payment of the debt and has failed to take any appropriate action to otherwise recover the debt or even make demand upon the Debtor for payment of the debt  The demand made on the Debtor was a demand made by the assignor prior to the assignment of the debt         The collateral purpose in my view having regard to the history set out in the court s earlier decision in Etl v Settle   FMCA   was to circumvent the operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   I am satisfied that the close relationship between the Creditor and the assignor illustrates that this procedure undertaken for the first time by the Creditor was a procedure which had as its collateral purpose a benefit to the Creditor s friend and professional colleague of avoiding the operation against the assignor of s   of the Bankruptcy Act          I am satisfied on the material before me  including the history set out in the Court s earlier judgment to which I have already referred  that there was a benefit to the assignor of  syphoning off  a small part of the total debt allegedly owed by the Debtor to the assignor in a manner that would enable the current Creditor to pursue a sequestration order after the issue of a bankruptcy notice in a manner which would not attract the operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act to the detriment of the assignor                 The use of bankruptcy proceedings in this contrived manner in my view is an abuse of process  as it has clearly been undertaken at least in part to satisfy  the  collateral purpose of obtaining a benefit to the assignor of becoming a Creditor without sacrificing security  This contrived arrangement is an inappropriate use of bankruptcy proceedings and a blatant attempt to avoid the consequences of the operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   citedSchellenberg v Tunnel
