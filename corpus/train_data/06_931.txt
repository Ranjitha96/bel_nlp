S P I  Spirits  Cyprus  Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd  No     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSabre Corp Pty Ltd v Russ Calvin s Hair Care Co     FCR  Specifically  the orders sought are as follows       a  Paragraph   seeks an order  pursuant to Order  A rule   of the Federal Court Rules or otherwise   that the Russian Federation provide discovery  of documents within listed categories in the schedule to the amended notice or as otherwise ordered by the Court   b  paragraph   seeks an order  in the nature of a Sabre order   Sabre Corp Pty Ltd v Russ Calvin s Hair Care Co     FCR   requiring FKP and FGUP to take steps to obtain such documents in the possession  custody or control of the Russian Federation  and par   seeks an order for the provision of such documents to Spirits together with verifying affidavits   c  paragraph  A seeks an order that the amended notice of motion be stood over for consideration  if necessary  of a stay of the cross claim in the event of non compliance with any order in terms of par   or pars   and    The  otherwise  alternative basis to O  A r   of the Federal Court Rules of the order sought in  a  above  is that the Russian Federation is the  true  or  real  applicant plaintiff on the cross claim  not FKP and FGUP  which are but  nominal  applicants plaintiffs  It is not in dispute that FKP and FGUP are Russian State owned enterprises  that they are separate legal entities which are distinct from the Russian Federation  FKP is a  federal treasury enterprise  being a commercial organisation which holds property settled on it by the Russian Federation  by right of operational management   FGUP is a  federal State unitary enterprise  being a commercial organisation which holds property settled on it by the Russian Federation  by right of economic management   In her affidavit Ms Mozgonenko confirms the foregoing  at   and   and explains what is meant by the terms  by right of operational management  and  by right of economic management   at     and Mr Tsyplakov  in his affidavit  confirms that he  substantially agrees  with Ms Mozgonenko on all these matters  at    On the conclusion I have reached  it is not necessary that I deal with the motion insofar as it seeks an order in terms of par   of the amended notice a Sabre order requiring FKP and FGUP to take steps to obtain the documents  within the listed categories or as otherwise ordered by the Court  in the possession  custody or control of the Russian Federation  and an order in terms of par   thereof for the provision of such documents to Spirits together with verifying affidavits  Nevertheless  again in deference to the submissions that were made  I should indicate why  had it been necessary to consider this aspect of the motion  I would have been minded to dismiss it  First  there must be a real likelihood that the party  in this case FKP and FGUP  who is to take steps to obtain access to and discover the documents which are in the possession  power or control of a third party  would be given access to the documents upon request  See Sabre at      This likelihood must be established by evidence  Gambro at        In the present case  Spirits has made no attempt to establish this  There is nothing in the evidence from which the inference could be drawn that any documents within the very broad categories requested by Spirits would be provided by the Russian Federation or its ministries  agencies and instrumentalities appliedWillis   Co v Baddeley     QB  After careful consideration  I have come to the conclusion  not without some hesitation  that the Russian Federation is the  real  applicant plaintiff in the cross claim because the claims made therein are brought and made on behalf of the Russian Federation by FKP and FGUP  and not in their own right  see Willis   Co v Baddeley     QB   Abu Dhabi National Tanker Co v Product Star Shipping Ltd     All E R        Lloyd s Rep    cf
