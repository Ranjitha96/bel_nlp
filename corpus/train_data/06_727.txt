   at   per Tamberlin J   In the present case  as I have noted  the relief sought by the applicants includes restraining orders against the respondent  Order  A r   has been applied where an applicant seeks relief of this kind  as distinct  for example  from damages  in consequence of default by a respondent  Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd   FCA     For myself  I am inclined to think that some caution should be exercised before granting default relief of the kind sought in this case simply on the basis of the pleadings  In particular  the sanctions that can be invoked where a respondent contravenes a restraining order should be borne in mind  Order  A r   vests a discretion in the Court  Depending on the circumstances  it may be appropriate for the Court to require some evidence  for example  that the respondent has infringed an applicant s copyright as alleged in the statement of claim before making restraining orders or orders requiring a respondent to deliver up on oath infringing copies of copyright material  as the applicants seek here    In the present case  Mr Cobden SC  who appeared with Ms Richardson for the applicants  read a number of affidavits in support of the motion  These satisfy me that the respondent has infringed the copyright of the various applicants in the identified films by selling or offering for sale DVDs that constitute copies of the films  The evidence also satisfies me that  unless restrained  the respondent is likely to continue his infringing activities  The evidence also supports the other relief sought by the applicants  There is therefore no need to consider whether it would have been appropriate  in the absence of such evidence  to grant the restraining orders sought by the applicants on the basis of the pleadings alone citedChappell   Co Ltd v Associated Radio Co of Australia Ltd   VLR   The restraining orders the applicants seek have been carefully drawn and follow the form approved by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Chappell   Co Ltd v Associated Radio Co of Australia Ltd   VLR   at      Indeed  the orders proposed in the present case are somewhat narrower than those made in Chappell v Associated Radio    In summary  I am satisfied that    the respondent is in default for the purposes of O  A r     each of the applicants appears entitled to relief in the form of restraining orders on the statement of claim    the Court has power to grant the relief sought  and    it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion so as to make the orders sought   Accordingly  I propose to make the orders sought by the applicants in the motion  These include restraining orders  an order for delivery up on oath of the infringing copies of the applicants  films and an inquiry as to damages     I certify that the preceding fourteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville   Associate Dated    June   Counsel for
