is in the context of these principles   No reason has been advanced to sub divide these groups into any sub classes or areas of specialisation  The question is whether the advertisements would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct  or silence  has been directed  Where  as here  the representations are made to various classes of the public  the characteristics of the members of that class are relevant in order to determine whether a misconception is likely to arise from the conduct alleged   Campomar at     Astrazeneca at    The question is whether a not insignificant number of doctors  pharmacists or patients will be misled   ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     per French J  National Exchange Pty Ltd v ASIC   ATPR     at    It is therefore necessary to assess the reactions or likely reactions of the members of each class to whom the conduct was addressed   Campomar at    The representations are to be tested by their effect on ordinary and reasonable persons within those groups   Campomar at     It is not necessary for GenRx to establish that Ms Crisp  or anyone else  was actually misled or that she took steps consequent upon her misunderstanding   Astrazeneca at    However  it is relevant that Ms Crisp laboured under an erroneous assumption as to the substitutability of new Coversyl  arising from the use of the stamp issued by Servier and used by the prescribing doctor   Astrazeneca at   Taco Bell at    I am not satisfied that Ms Crisp s assumption was extreme or fanciful  To the contrary it was  for a busy pharmacist who dispenses numerous different drugs daily  a reasonable reaction on the part of an ordinary and reasonable pharmacist  The stamp did not simply cause confusion or wonderment   Campomar at   it misled Ms Crisp  It caused her to take remedial action  without which she would have continued to believe that brand substitution for Coversyl was not generally permitted  Accordingly  Ms Crisp laboured under an error   Taco Bell     Mere confusion on the part of patients is not sufficient to establish a contravention of s   of the Act  Where there is no evidence of actual misleading  the question raised by the pleading is whether patients were or were likely to have been misled by the use of the stamp on patient prescriptions   Campomar at   Astrazeneca at     Doctors who read medical journals would be familiar with advertising for different drugs  The first banner advertisement would be recognised by doctors as an advertisement for Coversyl  Although it is in small type  there is an  elucidator    Astrazeneca   that Servier has placed the advertisement  The statement  BRAND SUBSTITUTION NOT PERMITTED  appears directly next to the red box containing a tick and the exhortation  tick the box   The hypothetical ordinary or reasonable medical practitioner is familiar with the tickable box adjacent to the words  BRAND SUBSTITUTION NOT PERMITTED  appearing on standard prescription forms and its purpose  A doctor appreciates that he or she has the option to tick that box when writing a prescription for a specific brand of drug and that  if ticked  the pharmacist is not entitled as a matter of law to substitute another brand of drug for that which appears on the prescription form  A doctor reading the advertisement as a whole would know that Coversyl is a branded product which  without the exercise of the doctor s discretion to tick the box  can be substituted by  a  flagged generics   The first banner advertisement is an exhortation to tick the box and would be read as such  The doctor would associate the advertisement with the box on the standard form of prescription which he or she can decide to tick  He or she would understand that the advertisement was urging the doctor to tick that box as part of the completion of the prescription for Coversyl  I do not accept that it would be read or understood by a doctor to represent that brand substitution for Coversyl is never permitted or permissible  It does not say that the doctor cannot instruct that there be no substitution  or that the doctor is not permitted to allow substitution  or that  a  flagging has not been or is not permitted  There is no suggestion of a Government or TGA source  The fact that the box is pre ticked is not sufficient to suggest that a regulatory body has made a decision not to permit substitution   There would be no need for an advertisement or for the doctor to tick the box if there was no  a  flagged generic  or substitutable generic  drug for Coversyl  The advertisement does not represent that there are no substitutable drugs or that brand substitution is not permitted  in the sense that the doctor could not permit such substitution  Doctors would not be misled into thinking there is some regulatory bar to brand substitution for Coversyl   In Astrazeneca the Full Court considered whether advertising flyers that were sent to general practitioners regarding a particular asthma medication were misleading or deceptive under s   of the Act  The flyers contained references to a clinical study and its results  The Court noted that in order to determine whether any breach of s   had occurred  it was necessary to determine whether the conduct would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the mind of that section of the community to whom the conduct was directed  at      The Court noted that the representations in the advertisement were not made to identified individuals or to the public at large  at   but to   ordinary or reasonable members of the community of general practitioners throughout Australia       The representations as claimed were not misleading or deceptive when viewed  in their entirety  as marketing documents directed to that class  at      It can be assumed that the class of medical practitioners would  as in Astrazeneca   have some knowledge of clinical trials and that the class would accordingly view such material in a different fashion to the public at large   I do not accept that the references to non clinical factors would be understood by doctors as referring to regulatory matters  Doctors  by reason of education and experience  would understand that drugs are publicly available as a result of expenditure on research by innovator or originator companies  These are factors of importance to some medical practitioners  see    GenRx submits that  although it is apparent that some of the reasons are not clinically based  doctors would be misled into thinking the reasons are   reasonable or proper reasons to take into consideration when prescribing Coversyl    They may be so led but it would not be misleading  Doctors are entitled  in their discretion  to take into account matters that are clinically related  although not specifically concerning the medication for that patient  For some ordinary and reasonable doctors  such as Drs Barlow  Ferrari  Flecker and Lambie  investment by originator companies in Australia and the undertaking of research  funded by profit on existing drugs  are important  reasonable and proper reasons for ticking the box to prevent generic substitution  Doctors would understand the factors of  investment in Australia   all profit to research  and  patient and doctor support  as linked to the company that manufactures and sells Coversyl and not as factors relevant to regulatory decisions  They would understand that they were being asked to take those factors into account in forming the decision whether or not to tick the box on the prescription   These representations  in the first whole page advertisement  are not misleading as alleged appliedCampomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The inquiry as to whether a representation to the public or a section of the public contravenes s   of the Act is a question of fact to be decided by considering what was said and done against surrounding circumstances   Campomar Sociedad  Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR     This is not a case of representations alleged to have been made to specific individuals  GenRx s case is that the representations in the printed stamp and in the advertisements are made to the public or a section of the public  A prescription written by a medical practitioner provides information to the pharmacist and to the patient for whom the prescription was written  The sections of the public to whom the stamp representations are directed are medical practitioners  doctors  pharmacists and patients who take or who are prescribed new Coversyl   No reason has been advanced to sub divide these groups into any sub classes or areas of specialisation  The question is whether the advertisements would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct  or silence  has been directed  Where  as here  the representations are made to various classes of the public

groups   Campomar at     Ordinary and reasonable doctors so misled would not be insignificant in number or proportion  I am not satisfied that ordinary and reasonable doctors  including general practitioners not specialised in hypertension and the mechanisms of blood pressure regulation  would generally have been aware of the Europa study and so discount the message otherwise conveyed by the advertisement  as did Drs Barlow and Ferrari  Indeed  Dr Flecker acknowledged that doctors might have thought that Coversyl was only listed in relation to its previously established indication of hypertension  The fact that some doctors reading the advertisement might be aware of the Europa trial and its results  or were otherwise aware that perindopril erbumine had been indicated both for hypertension and for stable coronary artery disease since   does not preclude the statements in the second whole page advertisement being misleading   ConAgra at   per French J    It follows that the representation conveyed by the second whole page advertisement is misleading or likely to mislead doctors in its reference to  now indicated for stable coronary artery disease   By linking that statement to perindopril arginine  the advertisement represents that perindopril erbumine is not so indicated  That also amounts to a misrepresentation  as perindopril erbumine has been so indicated since     Servier has undertaken not to place for publication any advertisement which contains the words  Now indicated for stable coronary heart disease  or any substantially similar phrase which contains the word  now  until determination of this matter citedGenRx Pty Limited v Les Laboratoires Servier     IPR   After GenRx sought interlocutory relief in these proceedings   GenRx Pty Limited v Les Laboratoires Servier     IPR     Servier undertook not to distribute the stamp further and has issued to doctors a second form of stamp  The text of that stamp  about which GenRx does not complain  is  In the pleading  GenRx alleges that the stamp  when used on patient prescriptions  conveys the following express or implied representations  the stamp representations     Brand substitution not permitted for COVERSYL       Brand substitution not permitted for COVERSYL      Brand substitution for New COVERSYL is never permissible       There are no other perindopril products substitutable with New COVERSYL   GenRx submits that the stamp conveys an impression of a bulk  blanket prohibition on substitution for Coversyl  That impression  GenRx submits  is reinforced by the use of the passive voice in the stamp  In that regard GenRx contrasts the second stamp  which uses the active voice and makes it clear that it is the doctor s decision not to permit substitution  GenRx accepts that Servier is entitled to attempt to persuade doctors to tick the box  However  GenRx submits  in the stamp and in each advertisement Servier has represented that there is some regulatory prohibition on generic substitution of Coversyl  GenRx submits that those seeing the stamp will be misled into thinking the stamp  with a pre ticked box  comes from a regulatory body such as the TGA  GenRx says that the stamp therefore represents that there is a regulatory reason why there can be no substitution for Coversyl and that doctors who accept this will use the stamp to convey that message to the pharmacist citedHornsby Building Information Centre v Sydney Building Information Centre     CLR   In Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Deane and

Act except to point out two matters  First  that subs  c  uses the word  benefit  and prohibits representations that   represent that goods or services have sponsorship  approval  performance characteristics  accessories  uses or benefits they do not have    Secondly  that the classes of alleged misleading conduct include a representation that the product has a difference where  it submits  any such difference is not a distinction of significance and is accordingly not a benefit   Janssen Pharmaceutica Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd     IPR    No further submissions in relation to these matters and no other submissions in relation to these sections were made by GenRx or by Servier   No submissions were directed to the other criteria in those sections  No submissions were made as to whether  if Servier were found to have contravened s   it would follow that subs  a  and  c  or s   would also have been contravened  Accordingly  I do not propose to deal further with these allegations   For convenience and in summary  the conclusions to which I have come are as follows    The stamp issued by Servier to doctors to be printed on prescriptions for Coversyl contains representations that are misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead pharmacists and patients within s   of the Act  The stamp representations are not likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners      Servier is liable for the stamp representations and has thereby contravened s       The first banner advertisement representations are not misleading or deceptive or likely to
