Mitchell v Bailey  No    includes corrigendum dated   July     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMitchell v Bailey  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn   July   I handed down judgment in Mitchell v Bailey  No     FCA    Having considered a petition which had been filed in the High Court and referred for trial in this Court I concluded that the Australian Electoral Officer  AEO  for Victoria had erred in ruling that nine ballot papers  cast in the election for a Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of McEwen  held on   November   were formal  I found that a further   votes  which the AEO had determined were informal were formal and should have been counted  As a result of these decisions I determined that the first respondent had been certified correctly as the candidate who had been elected for the Division  She had been so elected by a margin of   votes after the preferences of other candidates had been distributed  The parties sought an opportunity to consider my reasons before making submissions as to what orders should be made by the Court  The parties agreed on the orders which they wished the Court to make  Pursuant to O   rule   of the Federal Court Rules   they submitted minutes of consent orders on   July    The agreed orders were       The petition is dismissed    The Commonwealth pay the Petitioner his costs of and incidental to the petition  including costs reserved by Crennan J on   February   and any other reserved costs  on a party party basis  The Commonwealth pay the First Respondent her costs of and incidental to the petition  including costs reserved by Crennan J on   February   and any other reserved costs  on a party party basis    Written submissions were filed by all parties supporting the making of these orders    At no stage was the Commonwealth a party to the proceeding  The second respondent expressly disavowed any right to speak on behalf of the Commonwealth in relation to costs issues  For this reason I listed the matter for hearing on the question of whether a costs order could be made against the Commonwealth without the Commonwealth being afforded the opportunity to be heard  At the hearing senior counsel for the second respondent advised the Court that an appropriate officer within the Department of Finance and Deregulation had been advised of the proposed orders and would write to the Court advising that the Commonwealth did not oppose the making of such orders  By letter dated   July   Mr Marc Mowbray d Arbela  the Assistant Secretary  Legislative Review Branch  Financial Management Group of the Department of Finance and Deregulation advised the Court that he was authorised  to convey the position of the Commonwealth in relation to costs   That position was that the Commonwealth did not object to the Court making the orders which were sought followedNile v Wood   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Nile v Wood   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J said that the discretion to make a costs order against the Commonwealth under s          may properly be exercised when the proceedings have arisen because an officer of the Commonwealth has failed properly to perform his function or when the proceedings have resulted in some public benefit  In such cases it may be appropriate that the public purse ought bear the costs or some of them  I do not suggest that these categories are exhaustive  but it would not be appropriate to exercise the discretion whenever a litigant chooses to put the validity of an election to the test  Some warrant for imposing a liability on the funds of the Commonwealth must appear before it is appropriate to make an order  citedHudson v Lee   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlDeane and Toohey JJ  in a passage which was subsequently said by Gaudron J  in Hudson v Lee   HCA         CLR   at   to be cast in  wider  terms  said  at   that     This power to order costs against the Commonwealth  which is unlikely in the ordinary case to be a party to proceedings before the Court of Disputed Returns  is not constricted by reference to the principles controlling the making of an order for costs inter partes  It is a general power conferred upon the Court of Disputed Returns  in the exercise of its special jurisdiction  to order that the Commonwealth pay the costs of a party whenever the Court considers it appropriate so to do  We would not attempt to confine it by definition beyond saying that it should be exercised when considerations of what is fair and just support  on balance  an order indemnifying a party against costs which the party may have incurred in connexion with an electoral petition  In my view it is appropriate that the orders sought by the parties in relation to costs should be made  The proceeding raised issues which were novel and which it was in the public interest to resolve  The Court found that a significant number of inadvertent errors had been made during the scrutiny of reserved ballot papers  The petitioner had been prejudiced by an even greater number of errors than had been alleged in the petition  These errors would have affected the outcome of the election had it not been that an even greater number of errors were made which prejudiced the successful candidate  The fact that these errors had occurred and required correction by the Court is probably a sufficient reason  standing alone  to make the orders sought  There were  however  a series of novel issues which it was necessary to resolve in the course of the proceeding  Those issues included  Whether the parties  or their legal advisors  could be provided with access to the reserved ballot papers consistently with the provisions of s  iii  of the Act and  if so  on what conditions  Whether the Act imposed any statutory obligations on an Australian Electoral Officer which  if not complied with  could give rise to a contravention of the Act  What processes should be adopted by the Court in order to deal with a petition which alleged that errors had been made by an Australian Electoral Officer in determining the formality of reserved ballot papers  Whether the Court should engage in merits review or judicial review of decisions made by an Australian Electoral Officer under s   of the Act   It was  in my opinion  necessary and desirable  in the public interest  that these issues should be resolved
