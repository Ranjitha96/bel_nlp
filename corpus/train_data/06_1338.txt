Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlI awaited the judgment of the Full Court in SZEEU   Ors v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     FCA   before coming to my decision and gave the parties the opportunity of making submissions in light of that judgment  Counsel for the appellants then sought leave to further amend the notice of appeal by taking one ground as follows           The Tribunal constructed a jurisdictional error when it failed to comply with s  A of the M igration Act   Cth     Particulars          a  The Tribunal considered the following information was part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate to refuse the applicants protection visas           i  The applicant husbands education and employment history provided in the protection visa record           b  The Tribunal did not disclose the particulars of the information to the applicants in writing     c  The information was not exempted from disclosure by s  A b      d  The information was specifically about the applicant husband  The amendment was opposed on two bases  Firstly an entirely new point should not be permitted to be raised at this stage of an appeal in judicial review proceedings  Secondly the proposed ground raises a question of fact  namely  what was provided by or on behalf of the appellants to the Tribunal for the purposes of s  A b   Counsel for the appellants submitted that it can be deduced from a reading of the decision of the Tribunal  taken with the documents which were before the Tribunal  that it had relied upon material supplied only in the visa application  However  counsel for the Minister correctly points out that that conclusion cannot be drawn in the absence of a transcript of what took place before the Tribunal  If the issue had been raised in the Federal Magistrates Court  the factual issue could and would have been properly investigated
