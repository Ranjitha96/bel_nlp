Handbury Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Patcorp Investments Ltd     CLR   The taxpayer submitted that the shares were issued when Nominees and Mr Handbury  were entitled as against the company to be registered  citing Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Patcorp Investments Ltd     CLR   at    The taxpayer said that  t hat point was the point at which the allotment consideration was provided and the contract was executed on their part  that is  the point at which the debts owing by the company to them were set off against the debt owing by them to the company for the allotment moneys   According to the taxpayer  the consideration was the setting off of the allocation moneys owed by Nominees and Mr Handbury against the debts owed by Magazines  In consequence  the  leaving time  for the purposes of Div   and s     coincided with the extinguishment of the liabilities to Nominees and Mr Handbury   The taxpayer noted that step   in s     requires identification of  the liabilities that the leaving entity takes with it when it ceases to be a subsidiary member   The taxpayer submitted that  at the point when Magazines ceased to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group  it also ceased to be indebted to Nominees and Mr Handbury and  therefore  those debts were not  a liability of the leaving entity at the leaving time that can or must be identified in the entity s statement of financial position   In consequence  the taxpayer submitted that Magazines did not  take with it  any relevant liabilities on ceasing to be a subsidiary member  and that liabilities to Nominees and Mr Handbury extinguished at the leaving time were excluded from the sum deducted under step   from the allocable cost amount for the leaving entity  as calculated under s       By excluding the extinguished debts from the step   deduction  the taxpayer argued that its net capital gain was reduced by     Nominees and Mr Handbury did not become members of Magazines  that is  the holders of the shares in the company  until their names were entered in the share register of the company on   July   see St Helens Farm   CLR at   per Aickin J  and Patcorp Investments   CLR at       per Gibbs J and   per Jacobs J  See generally HAJ Ford  RP Austin and IM Ramsay  Ford s Principles of Corporations Law  Butterworths  Australia    vol   at      When their names were entered in the register  the shares came into existence as separate items of property  see Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd  In Liq    HCA         CLR   at     St Helens Farm   CLR at   per Aickin J  also Commonwealth Homes and Investment   CLR at   per Dixon J  It follows that Nominees and Mr Handbury did not acquire any beneficial interest in shares in Magazines until   July   at which point Magazines ceased to be a member of the consolidated group referred toHepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation

HCA         CLR   at   the taxpayer submitted that  in the context of Pt       of the   Act    appeals to a legislative policy of matching  appropriate economic outcomes  are of little assistance in interpreting the legislation  noting examples where the   Act departed from  economic outcomes  and copies of press releases by the relevant government Ministers in relation to proposed amendments to

Additionally  citing Hepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   and Anderson v Commissioner of Taxes  Vic    HCA         CLR   at   the taxpayer submitted that  in the context

unanticipated results  referred toEnvestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Under Pt       of the   Act   the consolidated group is treated as a single taxpayer represented by the head company  The assets of a subsidiary member are treated as being held by the head company  As already noted  the head company inherits the tax history of the subsidiary member when it joins the group  Plainly enough  the regime established by Pt       is intended to reflect  within the tax framework  the commercial and economic realities of corporate group dealings  compare s      See generally Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at       per Mansfield J  As his Honour commented in Envestra at    t hat process obviously required rules  including to set the cost for income tax purposes of the assets that a subsidiary member would bring into the group   Just as rules are needed for this purpose  so too rules are needed to govern the situation when a subsidiary member leaves the group  A subsidiary member leaves the group when it ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the head company   As the earlier discussion shows  the drafting style used in Pt       is a distinctive one  it specifically directs attention to the objects of the scheme as a whole and in respect of aspects of the scheme  and to the particular principles that are instrumental in achieving these objects  see e g   ss                       and          The more detailed provisions  or  rules  that are to be applied to give effect to these principles are to be construed in light of these principles and objects   This appeal is concerned with what happens when a subsidiary leaves the group  The object of Division   which governs this situation  is set out in s     namely   to preserve the alignment of the head company s costs for membership interests     established when entities become subsidiary members  s      The means by which this is to be achieved is  by recognising the head company s cost for those interests  just before the leaving time   as an amount equal to the cost of the leaving entity s assets at the leaving time reduced by the amount of its liabilities  s      The legislation is directed to quantifying the head company s cost for membership interests  just before the leaving time  to be done in the manner indicated  This is the principle that is intended to achieve the object of preserving the relevant alignment referred toRe Port Supermarket Ltd  In liquidation    NZLR   When used in connection

for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The broad subject matter is the tax treatment of consolidated groups and leaving members  Section     expressly states that the object in s     preserving the relevant alignment of head company s costs for membership interests is to be  achieved by recognising the head company s cost for those interests  just before the leaving time  as equalling  the cost of the leaving entity s assets at the leaving time  reduced by its liabilities  In this context  the phrases  just before the leaving time  and  at the leaving time  are intended to refer to essentially the same time  Whilst it might be thought that the use of different words was intended to refer to different points in time  just before  as opposed to  at  this interpretation would not  so it seems to me  make much sense in this context  It is to be borne in mind that the calculation under s        is for the purpose of determining the tax liability of the consolidated group be reference to the assets in the subsidiary company that is about to leave the group  Absent any contrary indication  it seems most reasonable to make this calculation done just before the company leaves the group  It therefore makes much better sense if the expression  at the leaving time   a somewhat elastic phrase  is understood as synonymous with the phrase  just before the leaving time   The phrase  at the leaving time  has a different connotation from the phrase  at midnight  which was discussed by Stone J in Tio v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at      If the phrase  at the leaving time  is properly to be understood as meaning  just before the leaving time  in s     then  in the absence of any contrary indication  the same phrase is to be understood in the same way elsewhere in Div   and Pt       and  in particular  in s         I reject the taxpayer s submission that the phrase  just before the leaving time  and  at the leaving time  refer to different and distinct concepts   There are a number of considerations that provide further support for this approach  First  as the analyses accompanying the Commissioner s written submissions showed  the taxpayer s construction would mean that the gain made on the sale of the shares was not brought to tax under Pt      That is  the taxpayer s construction would leave out of account under this regime the deduction of liabilities of about   million  which were said to be due to Mr Handbury and Nominees  although  as the taxpayer pointed out  part at least might be taxed on some other basis  The result would appear to be inconsistent with the principles on which Pt       is said to be based  especially s     and with its stated objects  It is worth emphasizing that the overarching object is to align the cost of the membership interests in a leaving entity with the cost of the net assets of the entity when the head company held all the membership interests in the leaving entity  see ss      and      It is scarcely necessary to refer to s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  to affirm the principle that a construction that promotes the objects of the statutory regime in Pt         as a whole and in specific aspects  is to be preferred to a construction that does not promote these objects  Whilst I accept that  in the taxation context  a consideration of this kind is not necessarily determinative  nonetheless it seems to me an important one  I reject the taxpayer s argument that I should not place much weight on this consideration referred toWhim Creek Consolidated  NL  v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   Payment for shares may  by agreement  be effected by a set off in discharge of a debt owing by the company to the intending member  see Whim Creek Consolidated  NL  v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at    This was what happened in this case  There was no execution of the contract in respect of the shares until the set off was effected  which was on   July    An entitlement to be registered did not arise before this date  There was therefore no  leaving time  before   July   referred toCommonwealth Homes and Investment Company Limited v Smith   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There was some
