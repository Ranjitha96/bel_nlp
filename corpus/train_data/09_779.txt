P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd  ACN       v Australian Securities and Investments Commission  No     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlOn   April   I overruled a threshold or preliminary objection to the motion by ASIC and the second and third respondents  Brookfield Multiplex Limited and Brookfield Multiplex Funds Management Limited  collectively  Multiplex  that the applicants were precluded from bringing the motion as it re litigated a matter not open to them on an interlocutory hearing because the matter had already been determined against them by the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    ASIC and Multiplex submitted that the motion amounted to an abuse of process  On the same day  I dismissed a notice of motion filed by Multiplex on   March   seeking orders that the applicants  motion be dismissed or permanently stayed as an abuse of process of the Court  ASIC sought leave to appeal against the orders  The Full Court granted leave to appeal  allowed the appeal  set aside the orders and ordered that the thirty six specified documents and forty one transcripts of examination of twenty three witnesses produced to the Court pursuant to the subpoena were protected from production to  and inspection by  the applicants and Multiplex on the ground of PII  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    An application by the applicants to the High Court for leave to appeal was refused  The parties were in agreement as to the process of analysis and consideration which I should undertake in determining a challenge to an application for production and inspection of documents produced under subpoena on the ground of PII because the documents might tend to disclose the identity of an informer or informers  The first step is to determine whether the documents disclose the existence of an informer or informers to ASIC  The second step is to determine whether the documents tend to identity an informer or informers to ASIC  If they do  the second step also involves determining whether the documents can be redacted or masked in such a way that  in their masked form  it will not be possible  even by the conveying of  a shrewd idea  to identify the informer or informers  The third step is to undertake a balancing exercise and determine whether  in the circumstances of this case  the documents to the extent to which they are not redacted or masked are of sufficient importance for the applicants  conduct of the proceeding to outweigh the importance of not disclosing the identity of the informer or informers  ASIC and Multiplex submitted that the Full Court had decided this balancing exercise against the applicants and that it was not open to the applicants to raise this issue and that I was bound by the Full Court s finding  The position and circumstances facing the Court on the hearing of the present motion are different from the circumstances facing the Court at the time I made the order on   November   dismissing ASIC s application  The relevant different circumstances are as follows   a  it has been made public  and the applicants are now aware  that the basis for ASIC s claim that the documents and transcripts are protected from production and inspection on the ground of PII is that inspection will disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC  The exact number of informers is irrelevant for present purposes     b  the identity of Mr Stuart Cummins as an informer to ASIC in relation to the affairs of Multiplex has been disclosed  The consequence is that there is no longer any confidentiality attached to Mr Cummins  identity as an informer to ASIC or as a   person entitled to protection pursuant to Pt    AAA of the Corporations Act    Cth   the Act     c  the Full Court handed down its decision on   July    As a result of the disclosure of the identity of Mr Cummins as an informer to ASIC  ASIC accepts  subject to it reserving its rights in respect of any appeal which it may seek to bring against my ruling on   April   that production and inspection of the following documents cannot be objected to by it on the ground that they would or might disclose Mr Cummins  identity as an informer to ASIC  The documents numbered   a                                    and   on the ground that they would or might disclose Mr Cummins  identity as a protected discloser and informer to ASIC      b                          and   in redacted or masked form  ASIC still opposes the production and inspection of documents numbered         and   on the ground that inspection of those documents would or might disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC who are entitled to protection in respect of their disclosures to ASIC pursuant to Pt    AAA of the Act  For the same reason ASIC continues to object to the production and inspection of all forty one transcripts citedP Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission  No       ALR  There is a considerable background to the applicants  motion and this proceeding which is set out in my earlier ruling on   April   P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission  No       ALR    I do not propose to rehearse it in detail and I incorporate that ruling in these reasons citedP Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhen the return of the subpoena first came before the Court  ASIC objected to the production of the documents and transcripts for inspection on the ground of PII  At the time the basis for the objection that they tended to reveal the identity of informers to ASIC was not disclosed publicly in open hearing  I rejected ASIC s objection  in substance  on the basis that the identity of the informers  which ASIC was seeking to protect from disclosure  was already known within Multiplex and I set out my reasons in a confidential schedule to the published judgment  P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         ACSR    On   November   I ordered that ASIC s application that the documents and transcripts were protected from production for inspection on the ground of PII be dismissed citedAreva NC  Australia  Pty Ltd v Summit Resources  Australia  Pty Ltd  No     WASC  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  htmlThe practice or task of undertaking the redaction or masking exercise in respect of documents the subject of an order for discovery or inspection is well accepted  However  there have been different approaches to the manner in which such redaction or masking is to be undertaken and as to the principal basis for the practice  The various approaches are discussed and analysed by Martin CJ in Areva NC  Australia  Pty Ltd v Summit Resources  Australia  Pty Ltd  No     WASC   followedSankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Sankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   at     Stephen J considered whether Loan Council documents in issue might be the subject of redaction or masking  The informant had sought the production of the Loan Council documents for the purpose of establishing that the claimed proposed borrowing of   billion was not the subject of Loan Council consent  Stephen J said at      At the conclusion of argument it seemed to me scarcely credible that an inspection of the papers would not reveal the practicability of extracting material in itself quite innocuous  consisting perhaps of no more than the figure of approved Commonwealth borrowings not in fact availed of  which would provide evidence of this negative character  Were production of such material  and of such material only  to be permitted  no public interest would be prejudiced and at the same time the course of justice would not be impeded unnecessarily  Authority for such a course is to be found in Conway v Rimmer   Lord Reid   contemplated that part only of a document might properly be withheld  according to it alone privilege from production  Lord Pearce said   that the court might call for and itself inspect a document and then  if  part of a document is innocuous but part is of such a nature that its disclosure would be undesirable  it should seal up the latter part and order discovery of the rest  provided that this will not give a distorted or misleading impression   A statement of the outcome of the inspection of the Loan Council documents which has in fact been undertaken by this Court appears at the end of the several statements of reasons for judgment in this case      In the result  the High Court undertook an inspection of the Loan Council documents and ordered disclosure of those parts that disclosed only the figure of borrowing approved by the Commonwealth  As I have noted earlier  par   above  ASIC accepts that  subject to any appeal against my ruling on   April   the following documents cannot be the subject of objection to it on the ground of PII  namely                                   and    ASIC made a similar submission in relation to the documents numbered                         and   in a redacted or masked form  I have considered the redaction or masking proposed by ASIC in relation to those documents and have also had regard to the confidential affidavits filed by ASIC which bear upon the redaction and masking of these documents  I have reached the conclusion that the redaction and masking undertaken by ASIC goes beyond the redaction and masking which are necessary in order to ensure that the documents do not have a tendency to disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC  I set out in confidential Appendix A to these reasons the redaction and masking of these documents which I consider should be undertaken  This appendix will only be made available to ASIC s legal advisers and the deponents of its affidavits for the purpose of determining the form of any public non confidential order which I should make  Adopting and adapting the observation and words of Stephen J in Sankey v Whitlam  supra  the applicants submitted that it  seemed scarcely credible  that an inspection of the forty one transcripts would not reveal the practicability of extracting material in itself quite innocuous without revealing or tending to reveal the identity of any informer  I have considered whether I should accept that submission and undertake the exercise of seeking to redact and mask parts of the forty one transcripts so as to leave those parts which are  in general terms  innocuous  on the basis that they do not identify or tend to identify an informer or informers  I have reached the conclusion that I should not undertake this task for the following reasons  The transcripts record the evidence of twenty three witnesses  The identity  occupation  role  employment title and employer of each of them is disclosed in the transcripts  If I were to redact or mask the transcripts so as to leave the  innocuous  parts so that the names  occupations  roles  employment titles and employers of the various witnesses and the organisation or company which employs them or with which they were involved were still disclosed  the applicants  legal advisers would still be left with material by which a shrewd idea would be conveyed as to the identity of an informer or informers other than Mr Cummins followedAttorney General  NSW  v Stuart     NSWLR  I am satisfied that the confidential material relied upon by ASIC discloses the existence and identity of an informer or informers to ASIC other than Mr Cummins  It is implicit in the Full Court s reasoning that the Court reached the same conclusion  It was accepted by all parties that the protection of the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC from disclosure is a legitimate and accepted basis upon which to object to the protection and inspection of documents on the ground of PII  see  for example  Rogers v Home Secretary   AC   Cain v
