BRGAI of   v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAbebe v The Commonwealth     CLR  Finally in relation to this ground of appeal I note that it is for the appellant to make his case to the Tribunal  and not the reverse  Abebe v The Commonwealth     CLR   at    The third ground of appeal appears to be  to some extent  a variation of the first ground of appeal  In any event  however  it is clear that the Tribunal had provided the appellant with an adequate opportunity to present argument and give oral evidence in that  inter alia  The appellant failed to appear before the Tribunal at the hearing scheduled on   February   and the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision without taking any further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it  s  A  No jurisdictional error is identified by this ground of appeal citedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX   HCA  http www austlii edu au au

constitute  information  within the meaning of s  A  which needed to be communicated in writing to the appellant  VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at

appellant s claim that he had been advised poorly by his migration agent  the Federal Magistrate observed that it is well settled that bad or negligent advice or conduct by an agent which falls short of fraud is not alone sufficient to set aside the decision of the Tribunal  SZFDR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR    The appellant s Grounds of Appeal pursuant to his Notice of Appeal filed   June   are as follows   The Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  fell into jurisdictional error in that it denied procedural fairness to the appellant as well as acting in breach of its obligations under the law  in breach of section  A of the Migration Act        Particulars  The Tribunal did not provide the Applicant with the opportunity to respond to the lack of evidence regarding his application  as the Applicant could not sufficiently understand the language or the contents of the notification letter from the Tribunal  thus also unable to respond to the Tribunals invitation  given the clearly significant language and cultural barriers  This deprived the Applicant of a fair opportunity to respond      The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that it failed to disclose adverse findings   Particulars  The Tribunal failed to disclose to the Applicant  clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review and ensure that the Applicant fully understands the significance of the review and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review      The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that it failed to provide adequate opportunity to present arguments and give oral evidence   Particulars  The Tribunal had failed to provide the Applicant with an adequate opportunity to respond to the lack of evidence and present his arguments because the Tribunal was  unable to make a favourable decision based on the given materials alone   The letter was itself not in a language understandable by the Applicant which resulted in the Applicant being unable to respond fully and appropriately  As a result  the Applicant was unaware of the nature of the hearing and the consequences it bears on the effect of the decision to refuse his visa thus being deprived of the opportunity to arrive at that understanding to give oral evidence and present his arguments  Before me both the appellant and the Minister were represented by counsel citedSZGWH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii
