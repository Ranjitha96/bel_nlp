Monsanto Company v Syngenta Seeds Pty Ltd   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedHooper v Kirella Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The order for identity discovery is sought to identify that company  Syngenta resists the order sought  It refers to cases which hold that a material factor in deciding whether to make an order are the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the action against the person whose identity is sought to be discovered  see eg  Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    It then points out that not only is Monsanto unable to identify a prospective defendant  it is also presently unable to articulate a cause of action against that unknown defendant  Accordingly  so the argument goes  Monsanto is simply not entitled to an order   I accept as correct that in most cases an applicant for identity discovery must show some prospects of success in its proposed action  A defendant s privacy should not be invaded unless there is good cause  But there is no absolute rule that an applicant must show some prospects of success as a condition to obtaining an order  In the first place  r   does not contain any such requirement  Second  there may well be cases where the imposition of such a condition would lead to injustice  This case is a good example of one where it would be unjust to refuse an order because the applicant is unable to show prospects of success  The reasons are so obvious they need no further elaboration   The criterion that I would apply is whether Monsanto has shown that it has a claim that is worth investigating  It may be true that two levels of investigation are required    one to identify the prospective defendant and another to assess the merits of the claim against that prospective defendant  But this should be no bar to an order under r     There is no need to spend much time considering whether Monsanto has a claim worth investigating  I think it clear that it has such a claim  First  there is a reasonable basis for believing that Monsanto s patent may have been infringed  Second  it seems clear enough that some company in the Syngenta group is involved  In any event  the order will not cause much inconvenience citedSabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin s Hair Care Company     FCR   In the result  there will be an order for identity discovery and the application for information discovery will be stood over  It is appropriate there be a Sabre order as well  see Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin s Hair Care Company     FCR    Monsanto should bring in short minutes of order for me to consider  If there is a dispute about the breadth of what they will seek  as I suspect there might be  I will relist the matter       I certify that the preceding twelve   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein   Associate Dated    March   Counsel for the Applicant  D Shavin QC  H M J Rofe     Solicitor for the Applicant  Clayton Utz     Counsel for the Respondent  T J Walker     Solicitor for the Respondent  Freehills     Date of Hearing    March       Date of Judgment    March         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
