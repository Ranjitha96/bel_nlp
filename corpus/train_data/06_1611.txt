United Salvage Pty Ltd v Louis Dreyfus Armateurs SNC   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedMeehan v Jones   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Meehan v Jones   HCA         CLR   the Court considered a contract which referred to  a satisfactory agreement     for the supply of a satisfactory quantity of crude oil   In that case  it was submitted that the contract was illusory and that it merely gave a discretion or option to one party as to whether the promise would be carried out  The Court rejected this submission  and although it agreed that it was for the purchaser to determine whether he had entered into a satisfactory agreement for the supply of a satisfactory quantity of crude oil  it also held that the purchaser had an obligation to act honestly in deciding whether the terms of an offer of finance were satisfactory  In addition  Gibbs CJ observed at     that the expression  satisfactory  could be given content  This observation is relevant in the present circumstances  Although each case must turn on its factual context  in my opinion  the Court can and will give content to the expression  satisfactory deed of release  as expressed in the Offer of Compromise in the present case   Having regard to the evidence  it is my view that the insertion of this requirement played no significant part in the rejection of the Offer of Compromise because there was no reference to it in the challenges to the terms of the Offer made by the plaintiffs solicitors  The subsequent offer made in January   by the plaintiffs seeking twice the amount offered by the defendants indicates that it was the amount of the award offered by the defendants which was the real cause of the dissatisfaction of the plaintiffs  The requirement relating to a  satisfactory deed of release  was not an operative cause of the rejection   For these reasons  I do not accept that the Offer of Compromise was uncertain  illusory or oppressive in any sense  or incapable of being accepted by a reasonable addressee
