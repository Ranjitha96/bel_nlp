matter for the decision maker to decide what is relevant and what is not  It is largely for the decision maker  in the light of the matters placed before him  to determine which matters he regards as relevant and the comparative importance to be accorded to matters which he so regards  Sean Investments Pty Ltd v MacKellar     ALR   at    As long as the decision maker considers those things that the legislation requires to be taken into account and ignores any prohibited consideration  the grounds of failing to take into account a relevant consideration  or taking into account an irrelevant consideration  will not be available  Nor are those grounds available where the essence of the compliant is that the decision maker paid either too little or too much attention to a relevant factor  Aronson   Dyer  Judicial Review of Administrative Action   nd ed    p     The applicant sought to make a case that the Minister was bound to take into account the impact of maintenance dredging  the impact of oil or chemical spills  and the impact of the removal and disposal of toxic sediment in the north of Port Phillip by implication from the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act  The subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act was approached in the following way  The Act employs an assessment process to inform the Minister s decision  The process requires an assessment of relevant impacts of the action contemplated  s    Relevant impacts are impacts which the action has  will have  or is likely to have  on the protected matters  s    An impact is defined as an event or circumstance which is a direct consequence of the action  or where the event or consequence is an indirect consequence of the action  the action is the substantial cause of the event or circumstance  s  E   Certain secondary actions are within the definition of impacts if they are the foreseeable consequence of a primary action  and within the contemplation of the person undertaking the primary action  s  E   The applicant s written supplementary submissions then contended at       It can be discerned from the scope and purpose of the EPBC Act that        a  a subsequent action made necessary by the action and the impacts of the subsequent action  and  b  a risk assessed as overall significant  or as not insignificant or negligible  by reference to both the terms of likelihood of occurrence and in terms of the magnitude of consequences       ought to be taken into account   In order to establish this ground  the applicant presumably intended that the words  ought to  be read as  must  appliedMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On the evidence  I infer that the Minister did consider whether to inform other ministers under s  a  of his proposed decision to approve the channel deepening project  and he determined not to do so on the advice of his department  He was entitled to rely on the recommendations of his department and their officers  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs CJ  and     per Brennan J   Peko Wallsend    There is therefore no basis for the claim that the Minister failed to comply with s   in this regard   Having found that the Minister considered whether to inform other ministers of his proposed decision to approve the channel deepening project  the next question is whether the belief that other ministers did not have administrative responsibilities relating to the project was so unreasonable that a reasonable minister could not have formed that belief  The applicant must establish that the Minister s conclusion  when viewed objectively  was  so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable  person  could have reached  it  Bromley London Borough Council v Greater London Council     AC   at   per Lord Diplock  See also Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury

Mason J   As to the first limb of the ground  it was necessary for the applicant to establish that s  a  bound the Minister to take into account the three allegedly relevant matters  The proper approach was explained by Mason J in Peko Wallsend Ltd at     as follows         a  The ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration can only be made out if a decision maker fails to take into account a consideration which he is bound to take into account in making that decision  Sean Investments Pty Ltd v MacKellar     ALR   at   CREEDNZ Inc v Governor General     NZLR   at       Ashby v Minister of Immigration     NZLR   at                               b  What factors a decision maker is bound to consider in making the decision is determined by construction of the statute conferring the discretion    If the relevant factors and in this context I use this expression to refer to the factors which the decision maker is bound to consider are not expressly stated  they must be determined by implication from the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act  In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations  this Court has held that  where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined  the factors that may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion are similarly unconfined  except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision maker may legitimately have regard  see Reg  v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     adopting the earlier formulations of Dixon J in Swan Hill Corporation v Bradbury   HCA         CLR   at     and Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission  NSW  v Browning   HCA         CLR   at    By analogy  where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute  the court will not find that the decision maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act
