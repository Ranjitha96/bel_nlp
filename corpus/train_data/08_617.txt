CLR   Triad also seeks to argue that clear and unambiguous words are required before a provision will be construed to take away property without compensation  Bropho v State of Western Australia and Another     CLR   at      It is claimed that s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  should not be construed as permitting the Court to remove the property rights of another person other than the company against which orders were sought  BGR    Grounds   to     and   of the draft notice of appeal raise the question whether  even if power were available to the primary Judge to make Order   his Honour erred in making such order  This question raises the issue of the statutory construction of s   of the Corporations Act    Cth    Grounds     and   of the draft notice of appeal also raise the issue of the appropriateness of Order   in respect of other relief which was granted by the Court pursuant to the orders of the primary Judge   TFI and Mr Bax oppose the orders sought in Triad s application for extension of time  They submit that no proper or satisfactory explanation has been provided by Triad for the delay in bringing of the application for leave and that there would be substantial and material prejudice to TFI  Mr Bax and all BGR companies if leave were granted  They also assert that the proposed appeal is futile and a waste of costs and resources  TFI and Mr Bax submit that it is inconceivable that Mr Gulson could not have understood the reasons of the primary Judge   TFI and Mr Bax submit that there were two scenarios which the primary Judge had to consider in remedying the oppression of TFI  namely Option A and Option B  His Honour made orders having the effect of Option B  TFI and Mr Bax challenge the factual assertion by Mr Gulson that Mr Gulson acted promptly after learning of Order    It is submitted that Mr Gulson was fully aware of the consequence of the primary Judge making orders in accordance with Option B  but that he consciously chose not to appeal whilst costs were being incurred by the other parties   TFI and Mr Bax also submit that there is no evidence that Triad s former lawyers did not understand the effect of Order    In the absence of evidence from them it is submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that there exists a proper or satisfactory explanation for the delay in pursuing the appeal   It is claimed that TFI has to date paid   to fund recovery action by the liquidator and both TFI and Mr Bax have incurred heavy legal costs  The liquidator has made interlocutory applications to the courts  served statutory demands and incurred costs which would have been avoided had Triad filed a notice of appeal in time  It is submitted that the continuation of these proceedings would be wasteful and cause severe inconvenience referred toCadence Asset Management Pty Ltd and Others v Concept Sports Ltd and Others     ACSR   In considering an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment the

Pty Ltd   Ors   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  Additionally  it is submitted that the Court proceeded beyond the relief sought and made orders which were unnecessary or inappropriate  see Cadwallader v Bajco Pty Ltd   Ors   NSWCA   at     The relief claimed in the proceedings only sought orders for the winding up of BGR  the appointment of a liquidator and the repayment of overpaid consultancy fees in order to address the oppression   Triad submits that the Court must have expected the liquidator would perform its statutory duties in connection with the administration of BGR as required by ss   and   of the Corporations Act    Cth  and reg       of the Corporations Regulations    Cth   Triad submits that an order such as Order   interferes or displaces the function of the liquidator to adjudicate in respect of a proof of debt  and accordingly such order could not reasonably be an accurate reflection of the Court s intention   Triad also submits that there is sufficient doubt to warrant the slip rule decision being reconsidered by the Full Court because the primary Judge relied upon matters not contained in his Honour s earlier reasons to dismiss the slip rule application which is inconsistent with the requirement that the Court should objectively consider whether the orders reflect the published reasons  the primary Judge appeared to proceed on the basis that Triad carried an onus to propose a new regime of orders to give effect to the Court s reasons  the Court must have contemplated that the liquidator would perform his statutory duties in connection with the administration and that Order   would  uncorrected  interfere with the liquidator s functions  the Court s intention is its objective intention to be gleaned from its reasons  the Court could not have intended by Order   to objectively extinguish Triad s action against BGR and to have effectively ordered specific performance of the alleged agreement  and the Court could not have intended to make orders which afforded TFI relief beyond which was necessary or appropriate  see Cadwallader v Bajco Pty Ltd   NSWCA   at       With regard to the last submission  Triad submits that an order compelling the winding up BGR  the appointment of Mr Kerr as liquidator and the repayment of the overpaid consultancy fee  i e  those incurred in   and   would have addressed the oppression   The answer to each of the submissions concerning  sufficient doubt  lies in the clear findings of his Honour contained in the first reasons  Contrary to Mr Gulson s contention  the primary Judge found that the debt owed by BGR to both TFI and Triad for consultancy fees in the period   to   had not been extinguished  However his Honour found that the oppression which existed in the management of BGR against TFI caused by Triad would be remedied by the refund by Triad and Cordato of consultancy fees paid during   and   by repayment of the overpaid monies arising from the February   distribution  by payment of the sum of   to TFI  and by distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the Main Camp Station by way of fully franked dividends to all parties in accordance with their shareholding  By virtue of such orders  the oppression which his Honour found resulted from Triad s actions would be remedied  The Court finds that such orders reflected the intentions of the primary Judge   Order   gave effect to part of the arrangement resulting from his Honour s findings  The relief which was sought in the slip rule application by Triad would have resulted in an order directly contrary to his Honour s findings  namely that upon payment of the fully franked dividends to the shareholders after the payment of   by BGR to TFI  neither TFI nor Triad would have any entitlement to consultancy fees   The order which was sought in the slip rule application would have resulted in the dismantling of one of the essential orders made by his Honour to redress the oppression  In response to the submission that his Honour relied upon matters in the slip rule application not previously contained in his reasons  it is apparent that such matters are merely explanations for his reasons rather than matters upon which he relied in reaching his decision   The Court can find no error in the primary Judge s approach  Comparing Order   with the primary Judge s findings  it is apparent that it gives effect to that part of his Honour s decision which was integral to the scheme to overcome the oppression   For the reasons indicated above the Court finds that the decision of the primary Judge is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court referred toDecor Corporation Pty Ltd and Another v Dart

notice of appeal raise the question whether the Court has power under s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  to extinguish a debt owed by the company to another person  Triad submits that these grounds raise a constitutional issue  namely whether s   allows for the acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms as required by s  xxxi  of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act    Cth   the Constitution    Triad seeks to argue that the debt owed by BGR to Triad for consultancy fees was Triad s asset which could only be extinguished or released by agreement for valuable consideration

ground of appeal  the Court refers to The Commonwealth of Australia v WMC Resources Limited   HCA         CLR   where Gaudron J said at     If a law modifies or extinguishes a statutory right which has no basis in the general law in circumstances in which some person obtains some consequential advantage or benefit in relation to property  that law may and  ordinarily  will effect an acquisition   In the present case there was no acquisition of property resulting from the operation of a Commonwealth law  Rather  the extinguishment of Triad s right to consultancy fees  even if such

Food Improvers Pty Limited and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Limited and Ors  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   February   the primary Judge delivered reasons for judgment in proceedings NSD  see The Food Improvers Pty Limited and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Limited and Ors  No     FCA    the first reasons    Mr Gulson testified that the right to consultancy fees had been cancelled and not merely suspended  In the first reasons the primary Judge rejected such contention and found that it would have been unfair to the shareholders to work for BGR with no prospect of remuneration even if BGR s fortunes improved  His Honour found at     I am of opinion that the parties agreed in March   that BGR s liability for payment of the consultancy fees which would otherwise become due under cl     would be made subject to a condition that BGR be able to pay before the consultant were entitled to issue tax invoices   During   negotiations had taken place between the joint shareholders of BGR in respect of the payment of consultancy fees exceeding   claimed by TFI through Mr Bax  Meetings had been held between the partners at which the two scenarios  Option A and Option B  were suggested for the distribution of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Station among the shareholders  It is common ground that payment to the shareholders by way of fully franked dividends was beneficial to them for tax reasons  His Honour found that no agreement was reached between the parties despite the extensive negotiations to resolve their differences concerning TFI s claim for consultancy fees   Before the primary Judge Mr Gulson claimed that he had not concerned himself with the details of the draft settlement deeds involving Options A and B and had never read their provisions relating to the payment of consultancy fees to TFI  The primary Judge did not accept such assertion   Main Camp Station was sold on   December   for    His Honour concluded at   that the negotiations to settle the partners  disputes culminated in Cordato s letter dated   January   that proceeded upon the basis that the method of distribution  would be in accordance with Option B    However BGR  at the direction of Mr Gulson and without consultation  wrote to TFI on   February   advising that an interim dividend of   had been declared  Such funds were derived from the proceeds of the sale  The primary Judge found at   that    For months the plaintiffs were told that a distribution would be made in accordance with Option B  Instead  they were confronted with a fait accompli when a different form of distribution was made without any further consultation in February     His Honour found that the distribution on   February   was unfairly prejudicial to TFI   Having found that TFI had suffered oppression  the primary Judge considered the relief to be granted  At   his Honour said    An order for specific performance of an agreement to distribute in accordance with option B is not appropriate because no contact so to distribute was made  But it is not the end of the matter  Both Triad and Food Improvers are entitled to render invoices so as to be paid over   million each in consultancy fees which had not been invoiced  Food Improvers has established that it is entitled to receive interest from BGR on its loan of    The plaintiffs  position is that they wish Food Improvers to receive only   by way of a payment for the consultancy fees forgone  Likewise  Mr Gulson has indicated that he and Triad do not wish to receive any consultancy fees  As the difference between options A and B showed  Triad was fiscally better off by receiving only dividends which would be fully franked together with the corresponding imputation credits  And  Mr Lombardo gave advice that that was best for both Triad s and Food Improvers  positions   His Honour then said     The negotiations in September   and all the correspondence up to the time of the distribution on   February   demonstrated that all the shareholders were content to have a payment of   made in respect of Food Improvers  entitlement to consultancy fees and thereafter a distribution made in accordance with the balance of option B  Having regard to the oppression which I have found in respect of the way Food Improvers has been treated  I am of opinion that it would be appropriate to make an order requiring BGR  Triad and Cordato Partners Services to cause the payment of a tax invoice for   plus GST  when issued by Food Improvers  in respect of the compromise of its entitlement to consultancy fees payable by BGR   His Honour continued at     The dividend paid on   February   should be set aside and BGR should be required to give effect to a distribution in accordance with the mechanism in option B  That is  the   consultancy fee plus GST should be paid to Food Improvers by BGR and then a dividend paid to its shareholders which would be used to repay their loan accounts  The amounts so received by BGR would then fund a second dividend to its shareholders  It may be possible for the parties to agree some payments between them of net amounts instead of this  in light of the fact that the earlier payments have been made  Food Improvers will also be entitled to have the dividends paid to it by BGR treated as fully franked   In summary  the primary Judge made orders which had the same effect as Option B  The effect of the order necessarily subsumed the claim by Triad against BGR for consultancy fees by the payment of fully franked dividends  The combined effect of the orders was to remedy the proved oppression by resolving the claims of TFI and Triad upon BGR for consultancy fees and to achieve an equitable winding up of BGR for its shareholders   The alternative proposal  namely Option A  was one in which both TFI and Triad would be paid the whole of their entitlement to consultancy fees  His Honour found that such payment  followed by the residue distribution from the sale of Main Camp Station  would be less advantageous to all parties   Pursuant to the first reasons  his Honour also found that Triad was to refund consultancy fees paid to it in the period between   July   to   February   and after   February   later calculated in the amount of       On   February   the primary Judge made orders in relation to certain aspects of the relief and stood the proceedings over to   February   for the making of further orders   On   February   the primary Judge made orders that are not relevant to the present applications  His Honour stood over the proceedings to   February   for the making of additional orders   On   February   after a further hearing before the primary Judge  his Honour made additional orders  Those orders  inter alia  effectively adopted the provisions of Option B  Order   of such orders  Order   provided    Declares that other than as provided in these orders the first plaintiff and the second defendant have no subsisting entitlement to consultancy fees from any of the first  fourth  fifth  sixth  seventh and eighth defendants   On   February   the primary Judge also found that Triad and Cordato had been overpaid in respect of the interim dividend declared by BGR on   February    Triad and Cordato were ordered to repay those monies  being   and   respectively   His Honour also said at     I also considered that it was appropriate to make an order that BGR actually pay to Food Improvers the consultancy fee of   plus GST  For the reasons that I gave in my principal judgment   FCA   at         Triad should receive only a distribution of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Plantation by way of a fully franked dividend  and should not be able to claim consultancy fees in the liquidation  Likewise  because Mr Bax said that  for its own reasons  Food Improvers wished to have its distribution made by payment of the consultancy fee  limited to   plus GST  together with the balance as a fully franked dividend  Food Improvers should not be able to make any claim further for consultancy fees in liquidation  For those reasons I made declarations that neither Food Improvers nor Triad had any subsisting entitlement to consultancy fees having regard to the adoption of option B in the resolution   On   February   the primary Judge also ordered Triad and Cordato to repay BGR   of all amounts paid by way of legal costs and disbursements in respect of the proceedings   On or about   March   Triad received a letter from Gadens Lawyers  Gadens   Such letter informed Triad that Gadens were acting for the liquidator  David John Kerr of BGR  The letter demanded payment of     said to be owing to BGR by Triad pursuant to the Court s orders  Triad then engaged new lawyers  namely Shaw Reynolds Bowen   Gerathy Lawyers  and Andrew Peter Quigley of that firm had carriage of the matter   On   November   the primary Judge delivered his written reasons in respect of the slip rule application  see The Food Improvers Pty Limited and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors  No     FCA    the slip rule reasons   In such reasons his Honour considered Options A and B and observed at     By informally agreeing to distribution in accordance with Option B the parties were adopting a position that neither wished to assert their full legal rights to be paid under Option A    Since Mr Gulson was positively asserting there was no such entitlement  I found that he had indicated that he and Triad did not wish to receive those consultancy fees   Food Improvers  No     FCA   at      That finding was inevitable given the joint rejection of distributing in accordance with Option A consideredThe Food Improvers Pty Ltd and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors  No     FCA  http www

Food Improvers Pty Ltd and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors  No     FCA    As to the adoption of Order   his Honour said at     I also made an order that the resolution of the directors of BGR made on   February   declaring and effecting payment of the interim dividend  which I found to be oppressive  be set aside and substituted a resolution which sought to give effect to what was proposed in option B  I was of opinion that it would be too cumbersome to order meetings of BGR or its directors to take the procedural steps necessary to implement and vote for the resolution consideredThe
