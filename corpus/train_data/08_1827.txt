have been made are summarised by Sackville J in Seven Network News Limited v News Limited   FCA   at         I incorporate that passage in these reasons   Mr McGregor identified   items where he disagreed with Ms Gourlay s assessment  With one exception  it seemed to me that Ms Gourlay had taken quite a conservative approach and that her opinion should be accepted  The one exception was in relation to expert witness fees where the fees paid were very much in excess of the scale rate  I thought the sum suggested by Ms Gourlay should be reduced by     The net result is that I assess the gross sum at    By way of a check  this sum is roughly half of the amount actually paid by Black   Decker  so that gives additional comfort that the gross sum assessed is not excessive citedSony
