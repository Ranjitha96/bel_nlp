discussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   ATPR    Finally  in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   ATPR       his Honour had to consider a proposed four year time limit  Of this limit  his Honour said  at    It provides a limit to the remedy of contempt of Court for breach  More particularly  it sets a period during which the party restrained will have a very powerful incentive to ensure that there is no further contravening conduct  By the end of that period it is to be hoped that the procedures and  perhaps  the culture of the organisation will be such that further contravention is unlikely  It seems to me that the undertakings which have been obtained in relation to compliance programs are appropriate for that purpose discussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases

FCA         ALR     George Weston Foods   at   Gyles J expressed a reservation concerning the time limit of three years proposed by both parties in that case  His Honour found it difficult to see the reason for the time limit in relation to a properly framed injunction  bearing in mind that under s   of the Act the Court has power to rescind or vary an injunction granted under s    Gyles J had occasion to consider the question again in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland  Aust  Pty Ltd   ATPR     where  again  a time limit of three years was proposed  His Honour  at   repeated the reservation he had voiced in George Weston Foods but granted an injunction limited to three years on the basis that in the circumstances it was not necessary to subject Liquorland  Aust  Pty Ltd to the threat of contempt of court for any longer period  In forming that view  his Honour referred to the existence of a compliance programme  a change in New South Wales licensing laws  and the sharp shock that had been administered to the company by the proceeding discussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation   Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd     FCR  Young J and Stone J have also had occasion to consider the question of time limits on injunctions granted on the Commission s application  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation   Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd     FCR     IPM   the Commission sought a final injunction against the respondent Union  Young J unequivocally rejected  at   a final injunction as  plainly inappropriate  and would  not contemplate an injunction that operates indefinitely  in a case where the relevant conduct had come to an end  His Honour observed that in such a case  any injunction should be for only a limited period of time  and noted that this course was commonly taken in the authorities  For her part  Stone J  in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd   ATPR       incorporated a two year time limit in the injunction that she granted  even though  as in IPM   the Commission sought a permanent injunction  Her Honour regarded the purpose of the injunction in the case before her as being not to restrain apprehended repetition but to deter the contravening party from repeating the contravention  Her Honour referred to the following observation by French J in ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR    There is room in the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence  That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court     The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act   In imposing

to the company by the proceeding referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd   ATPR    In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd   ATPR     at   Selway J stated in relation to price fixing   Once it is understood that deterrence  and particularly general deterrence  is the primary principle in the imposition of penalty for price fixing  then at least two conclusions flow from that  First  it means that penalties for collusive price fixing will need to be substantial and significant  This is  of course  reflected in the size of the maximum penalty upon corporations of   million  However  it also follows logically from the principle  Collusive price fixing  particularly between tenderers is difficult to detect  Public enforcement often only occurs with  a tip from an affected party or an insider   see Marshall   Meurer   Bidder Collusion and Antitrust Law  Refining the Analysis of Price Fixing to Account for the Special Features of Auction Markets      AntiTrust Law Journal   at    Given these difficulties and the potential for large profits from such practices there is a chance that those in the market place might be prepared to factor the risk of a low penalty into its pricing structure as a  business cost   That would be inimical to the statutory purpose of ensuring that the practices do not occur  The penalty must be sufficiently high that a business  acting rationally and in its own best interest  will not be prepared to treat the risk of such a penalty as a business cost referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v McPhee   Son  Australia  Pty Ltd   ATPR    The difficulty of detection of collusive price fixing understandings was referred to by Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McPhee   Son  Australia  Pty Ltd   ATPR     at      This form of contravention commonly occurs in secret and between parties who seek a mutual benefit  The risk of detection is often low and the potential gain to the contraveners  and damage to the community  large  Therefore the penalty needs to be correspondingly high referred toAustralian Competition and

whether the conduct was systematic  deliberate or covert  The Commission refers to J McPhee   Son in which a pecuniary penalty of     million was ordered in relation to making and attempting to make price fixing arrangements  As another illustration  the Commission refers to non compete agreements in which one party might derive no direct benefit in a particular market or market segment because it has merely agreed to stay out of that market or segment  For airlines with a   or less share of the Australian segment of the Air Cargo Market  the Commission proposed no uplift or increase in the base penalty  The Commission did not propose to discriminate between those with   or less  but accepted that all would have been likely to derive a relatively minor benefit in the Australian segment  which would probably be less than the base penalty  Over the relevant period  Qantas carried approximately   of all air cargo to and from Australia based on weight  well above the   level  Some   of Qantas s fuel surcharges were obtained on flights to and from Australia  Qantas s penalty in Australia must reflect the fact that Qantas s activities had the most significant connection with Australia

extensive judicial consideration  In Riverstone   Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a  market in Australia  a market must be wholly within Australia  His Honour said  at   that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products  As the Commission points out  a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act  especially in the modern telecommunications era  The definition of  market in Australia  in s  E excludes  however  a market that is wholly outside Australia  Part of the present global and international air cargo market necessarily falls within the territorial boundaries of Australia  The Fuel Surcharge Understanding necessarily affected

Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR    The  totality principle  as it is called in the criminal law  is applicable  that is to say  the total penalty for related offences should not exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved  Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR     at    What follows under this heading is paras     of the Joint Submissions   Nature and extent of the contravening conduct  including its deliberateness        The conduct subject to penalty was engaged in by Qantas  freight division throughout the world  The understanding was to implement the Fuel Surcharge Understanding as widely and as fully as possible but  in some locations in giving effect to the Fuel Surcharge Understanding  the amount of the fuel surcharge varied according to what the participants thought was profitably achievable  and in some locations no surcharge was maintainable      Within Qantas Freight  its involvement in the conduct was not particularly clandestine  It did not however disclose the conduct to Qantas  most senior management or Board  Qantas Freight representatives throughout the world sought or gave pricing intentions or assurances at the direction of Frampton or Cooper but for many of them it was seen as a normal part of business  They would openly report their discussions back to Cooper  The conduct simply continued after Frampton and Cooper left       In many jurisdictions prior to the investigations of this conduct  the local representatives did not consider their discussions particularly secret  In some locations  such as Hong Kong and Japan where local regulators had to approve price increases  Qantas Freight representatives would meet with competitors to jointly propose a surcharge and would minute their meetings and agreement      The conduct ceased in February   when allegations concerning the understanding were publicised following  raids  undertaken by regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe  The cartel could have been defeated at any time in most localities by any major carrier in that locality declining to impose the surcharge  The cartel could have been defeated to and from Australia had Qantas declined to participate     The amount of loss or damage caused        The revenue generated by Qantas as a result of the fuel surcharges to and from Australia during the relevant period was approximately   million  Qantas Freight carried   of the cargo carried to and from Australia  This however does not demonstrate the actual loss to shippers or their customers because  absent the Fuel Surcharge Understanding  some price increases would have occurred to cover the increased costs of fuel  which did increase over the relevant period  It may have also been that some carriers would have been forced to exit certain routes  allowing the remainder to impose other increases with less constraint  These competitive outcomes cannot be known  It is the case that each of the parties to the Fuel Surcharge Understanding had different arrangements for the acquisition of fuel and acquired it in different places  many  such as Qantas  also had hedging arrangements  The Fuel Surcharge Understanding did not accordingly reflect any of the parties  actual costs  Further  a surcharge increase could stay in place even after the price increase that triggered it had gone  different trigger steps were used in the Surcharge Methodology when it was reducing from when it was increasing       Neither the Commission nor Qantas are aware as to what proportion of the surcharge was ultimately borne by any particular consumer or business in Australia  As a general rule  the ultimate consumer will bear most if not all of the transport cost  in the price paid for the cargo  others in the supply chain  such as a wholesaler or retailer will absorb some part of the cost some part of the time  These others involve persons both in Australia or overseas  They will be more likely to absorb the loss if the goods comprising the cargo have been sold prior to the transport cost increase but may also have to do so if their competitors do not have the same costs  Nevertheless it may be assumed that the cost of surcharges on cargo comprising imported goods would be largely borne by Australians whereas the same costs on cargo comprising exported goods would be largely borne by overseas buyers      Businesses in Australia importing cargo on which a surcharge was paid  even if they passed it on totally to their customers  would also be negatively impacted if they competed with domestic goods  but again the effect on any particular consumer or business cannot be known or quantified     The size of the contravener        As noted in paragraphs   to   above  Qantas has assets of nearly   billion and during the relevant period was the  th largest airline in the world in terms of revenue passenger kilometres  Over the relevant period Qantas carried approximately   of the air freight to and from Australia and its nearest competitor carried about    Its total profits before tax for the year ended   June   was     billion  It derived revenue of   million from the carriage of air freight for the same financial year  Many of Qantas  principal competitors are of a similar or even larger size although none is as large in the Australian segment of the Air Cargo Market     The period over which the contravening conduct extended        Qantas  contravening conduct for which penalties can be imposed extended over a four year period from   to   inclusive     Degree of power it has  as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market        Qantas does not know  and does not have access to any reliable information to allow it to assess  its share of the Air Cargo Market       In the segment to and from Australia  Qantas holds about    Its nearest rival holds about   and there are at least ten significant competitors which are major international carriers and which have market shares to and from Australia of between about   and    Qantas clearly has the largest market share in the Australian segment but is and was unable to act without being constrained by its competitors     The circumstances in which the conduct took place        Whilst the volatility of jet fuel prices certainly sparked the conduct  and some price adjustment would have been implemented by participants unilaterally to reflect this  the fuel surcharge timing and amount did not reflect the actual changes in costs of the competing airlines or the degree to which general price rises accounted for movements in fuel costs  The conduct substantially reduced competition for the carriage of air cargo  The parties were aware that the US Department of Transport had comprehensively rejected the conduct as anticompetitive  The conduct required the participation of all major carriers in each port or region to be successful     Participation of senior management        Qantas Freight s participation in the Fuel Surcharge Understanding was arranged by Frampton and Cooper and implemented by regional managers of Qantas Freight in offices around the world  It was not known to the Qantas Board or its most senior managers  Whilst the most senior person in its air cargo operation was involved  there was  since   a level of more senior executives between him and the Chief Executive Officer  Qantas nevertheless accepts that Frampton  the head of Qantas Freight  a division generating over   million revenue a year  is properly classified as a senior executive of Qantas     Culture of compliance with the Trade Practices Act        Qantas did have a program of trade practices compliance in place during the period of the contravening conduct  That program proved to be inadequate in identifying  preventing or even limiting the extent of the conduct  Persons responsible for monitoring and preventing such conduct only became aware of it after raids of their competitors  premises overseas were conducted by regulatory agencies      Qantas has recognised the inadequacy of its compliance program  It has substantially upgraded the program and its new program is presently being implemented throughout the world     Co operation and Contrition        Qantas has fully co operated with the Commission s investigations since Qantas contacted the Commission in mid    Qantas promptly provided the Commission with critical information about collusive understandings  including frank and detailed admissions of its own participation in those understandings as it became aware of them and insofar as it was able  Qantas did so aware that immunity was not available to it in relation to its fuel surcharge conduct and knowing that it was highly likely to face very substantial penalties       To this end Qantas interviewed  and made available for interview by the Commission  over   of its staff and former staff and voluntarily searched for and produced documents from its operations throughout the world relevant to its and other airlines involvement in the contraventions  It brought to Australia at its own expense all staff willing to be interviewed by the Commission even though those staff could not have been compelled under section   of the Act  The Commission has not needed to serve any section   notices on Qantas       Qantas  efforts have made available to the Commission information and documents identifying the involvement of other participants which have not been produced or made available as yet by these persons  Qantas has consistently demonstrated a commitment from its Board and Chief Executive Officer to identify and report to the Commission the extent of its involvement in the contraventions and to ensure the breaches are not repeated  Qantas has demonstrated genuine contrition for its involvement in these contraventions       Whilst Qantas was not able to secure the co operation of some of its former staff  less than   in all countries  the Commission is satisfied it has used its best endeavours to do so  Qantas has offered to the Commission  and undertakes to the Court  to continue to provide this very high level of assistance with the investigation  and possible prosecution  of cases against other participants      Qantas through its solicitors and in house counsel willingly participated in a series of discussions with the Commission to bring an agreed resolution of the matter before the Court  As a result of those discussions Qantas and the Commission have reached agreement as to the appropriate penalty to be suggested to the Court  Qantas has also assisted the Commission in the preparation of the relevant settlement documents including the admissions       As already mentioned  Qantas has reviewed and upgraded its current trade practices compliance program      The Commission fully accepts that Qantas is entitled to very substantial credit for having admitted contravening the Act  indeed actively self reporting  assisting the Commission in its investigations  upgrading its compliance program and agreeing with the Commission on the appropriate penalty to put to the Court  see Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR  P         Qantas  co operation with the Commission has saved the Commission and the Court  and ultimately the community  the cost and burden of litigating an extremely lengthy and expensive case       The number of possible participants  the fact that numerous witnesses and documents are not within the jurisdiction  the need for translations and the sheer scope and duration of the conduct would make this likely to be the largest and most expensive investigation ever conducted by the Commission       It is obviously of benefit to the Commission s investigations that respondents are encouraged to co operate in appropriate cases  In these circumstances the parties submit Qantas is entitled to a very substantial discount on the penalty that otherwise would have been appropriate  which  given the regularity of the contravening conduct over the four year period and the maximum applicable penalty per contravention of   million  could have been very much higher  This discount should reflect not only its extraordinary levels of assistance in locating witnesses and material to make appropriate admissions as soon as possible but also in using its best endeavours to assist in the investigation and possible prosecution of other participants       Considering Qantas  outstanding cooperation in relation to its own case and as against other parties  the Commission has accepted a very substantial reduction in agreeing on an appropriate penalty to recommend to the Court     Similar conduct in the past        The Court has not previously found contraventions against Qantas in relation to the Act     Other regulators        The Commission notes that Qantas has already paid a penalty in the United States of US  million in respect of its conduct  Qantas expects to pay a very substantial penalty in Europe at the conclusion of EU investigations  The penalty in the United States was very substantially discounted as a result of Qantas  co operation with authorities there  Qantas expects similar considerations to be applied by European authorities where Qantas has also co operated with enquiries and made appropriate admissions     Conclusion on appropriate penalty        The Commission and Qantas submit that  when all the factors and circumstances referred to above are taken fully into account  a pecuniary penalty of   million is appropriate  in that the parties consider that the suggested amount falls within the range that the Court  unaided by the parties  agreement  would have considered appropriate  I did not find the present case straightforward and therefore sought and received further submissions from the Commission which were supported by Qantas  My difficulties arose from the following considerations          The anti competitive arrangement was a global one and this raised a question as to its territorial connection with Australia and the question of whether the same conduct contravened laws of other jurisdictions so that penalties imposed on Qantas in them should be taken into account    Identification of the extent to which Qantas profited from the Fuel Surcharge Understanding  and    The extent of the discount for Qantas s early admission of contravention and cooperation with the Commission  There are two relevant territorial connection provisions in the Act  ss   and  E  In the present case  the relevant market is a worldwide market for air cargo services  including  but not limited to  the carriage of cargo by air to and from Australia  see   above   In these circumstances  the primary territorial and jurisdictional limit is that found in s    Section   provides  relevantly  that Part IV of the Act extends to engaging in conduct outside Australia by bodies corporate incorporated or carrying on business within Australia  Qantas is incorporated in Australia  Section   provides  relevantly  that for the purposes of ss   and  A  competition  means competition in any market in which a party to the contract  arrangement or understanding in question supplies or acquires goods or services  Section  E provides  relevantly  that  market  means a market in Australia
