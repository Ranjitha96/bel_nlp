Australian Medic Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited  ACN        No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAustralian Medic Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI recently published my reasons in this matter and directed that the parties bring in draft Minutes of Orders  Australian Medic Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited   FCA    While I gave them the opportunity to put on submissions on costs  I indicated my then present inclination was to make no order as to costs  That view reflected my appreciation of the balance of wins and losses on disputed issues and claims made in the proceedings viewed as a whole  I need not reiterate the nature of the claims and cross claims in any detail other than to say that  a discrete cross claim for breach of confidence apart  collectively the various claims fell broadly into two classes  One large class related to claims for alleged breaches  and for wrongful repudiation  of a distribution agreement  These claims were surrounded by the predictable  satellite Trade Practices Act claims  The other class of claims related to intellectual property  The principal claims here related to trade marks owned by AMC and to breach of AMC s copyright although the latter both was surrounded by satellite claims such as passing off and was collaterally attacked initially in a Trade Practices Act claim  later abandoned by Hamilton   My findings on AMC s claims resulted in my dismissal of all of its intellectual property related claims  On the contract claims I found Hamilton to be in breach of the Distribution Agreement in several respects but only nominal damages were awarded citedTimms v Clift   QCA         Qd R  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QCA  htmlThis narrative rather illustrates that while there were in substance two major areas of dispute between the parties  the parties  real successes were essentially defensive ones  It is appropriate to say  in my view  that as a matter of substance and reality  Hamilton won the claim  It is equally appropriate to say that the discrete breach of confidence claim apart  AMC won the cross claim  cf Timms v Clift   QCA         Qd R   at    This outcome needless to say helped inform the inclination I foreshadowed as to an appropriate costs order appliedCalderbank v Calderbank     All ER  The parties have now put on extensive submissions in relation to costs  It emerges that Hamilton on   February   made an offer of compromise of the entire action which it says was in accordance with the principle stated in Calderbank v Calderbank     All ER    That offer was rejected by AMC on   March and a counter offer made  On   March   Hamilton made an offer of compromise of AMC s claim in compliance with O   of the Federal Court Rules   It was not accepted  A subsequent O   offer was made on   June    It likewise was not accepted  I am now asked to consider the appropriate incidence of costs in light of the offers to which I have referred  It is necessary to consider them seriatim  Before so doing I should refer briefly to the breach of confidence cross claim  Hamilton was entirely successful in its claim against AMC in establishing liability  An account of profits has been ordered  I dismissed a like claim made against Dr Keung  Hamilton s claim was a small  self contained and  in my view  routine breach of confidence matter  As will be seen from my reasons the liability question could be dealt with shortly  I am satisfied that  in relation to it  it should be ordered that AMC should pay Hamilton s costs of the claim on a party and party basis and that Hamilton should pay Dr Keung s costs in relation to its unsuccessful claim against him     The Calderbank   Entire Action Offer  of   February  This offer was made by Hamilton to resolve  all issues in dispute  with AMC  The offer made was that  in consideration for the termination of the Distribution Agreement and in return for AMC  a  discontinuing its claim in the action and  b  providing an all encompassing deed of release  on terms to be agreed  in respect of any past or future claim whatsoever against Hamilton  Hamilton would take all steps necessary  and available to it  to affirm ownership of the Fuyunhon and Tuotoning marks by your client  release your client from its obligations pursuant to the restrictive covenant imposed upon your client by Clause       of the Distribution Agreement  thereby allowing your client to lawfully sell its competing  Fuyunhon  products in Hong Kong    discontinue its cross claim in the Action  including the proposed amendments to our client s cross claim as advised in our   February   letter    forgive and write off the sum of     owed by your client to our client and subject of invoice no EXP     provide your client with any reasonable assistance that it requires to prosecute its litigation against Forward Company currently on foot in Hong Kong  grant your client a limited licence to sell its inventory of Hamilton products in Hong Kong  provide your client with an all encompassing release  on terms to be agreed in a Deed  in respect of any present or future claim against your client  pay your client the sum of   AUD  inclusive of any GST payable  which amount is inclusive of any claim for costs and interest by your client  and As is well accepted  the non acceptance of a Calderbank offer can be a relevant matter for consideration on the question whether the discretion to order costs should be exercised on an indemnity basis rather than in accordance with the Court s usual practice of ordering party and party costs  if its non acceptance is followed by a result to the offeree which is less favourable than the offer made  see MGICA   Pty Ltd v Kenny   Good Pty Ltd     FCR     on the primacy of the ordinary practice see Re Wilcox  Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd  No       FCR     and see generally on Calderbank offers  Dal Pont  Law of Costs             nd ed     The significance for costs purposes to be attributed to a rejected Calderbank offer falls  increasingly  for determination by reference to criteria of reasonableness  Was the offer a reasonable one in the circumstances  Was its rejection unreasonable when viewed in light of the circumstances existing at the time of its rejection  See eg University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA         ALR   at   Dal Pont at      In making that determination  the circumstances of the litigation and the parties  understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their respective cases can be relevant considerations  see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at     In its Calderbank letter Hamilton indicated that  if AMC did not accept its offer  Hamilton would deliver a formal offer of compromise in accordance with the Federal Court Rules   It went on to indicate that the offer would be for a monetary sum only citedMGICA   Pty Ltd v Kenny   Good Pty Ltd     FCR  As is well accepted  the non acceptance of a Calderbank offer

Machinery Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs Mansfield J indicated in Smith v   Machinery Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     O   of the Federal Court Rules provides a structure which encourages the parties throughout a proceeding to offer and to consider a fair and reasonable compromise of their proceeding while also providing a party with the means of protecting its position in relation to costs against an opponent with unrealistic expectations of the proceeding s likely outcome  The Rules prescribes both the formalities for an offer to be characterised as one made for O   purposes and the costs consequences of unaccepted offers  Relevantly for present purposes O   r   provides        If           a  an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant  and          b  the applicant obtains judgment on the claim to which the offer relates not more favourable than the terms of the offer          then  unless the Court otherwise orders           c  the applicant is entitled to an order that the respondent pay the applicant s costs in respect of the claim incurred up to   am on the day after the day when the offer was made  taxed on a party and party basis  and          d  the respondent is entitled to an order that the applicant pay the respondent s costs in respect of the claim incurred after that time  taxed on an indemnity basis appliedPort Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc  No       ALR  So is created a rebuttable presumption of indemnity costs  it then being incumbent on the applicant to show reason why the Court should  otherwise order   As Hely J indicated in Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc  No       ALR   at           the prima facie position should only be departed from for proper reasons which  in general  only arise in an exceptional case       See also Futuretronics com au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd   FCAFC    While emphasising that it is impossible to state exhaustively the circumstances in which a discretion to the contrary might be exercised  it is established that the fact that an applicant acted reasonably in rejecting an offer of compromise is not itself a sufficient reason to displace the operation of the rule  Futuretronics at    As Dal Pont has indicated  at             a party who rejects an offer cannot reasonably compain if  due to  the

citedSunlec International Ltd v Carroll Australasia Pty Ltd   WASC  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  htmlI would note in passing AMC made a further counter offer on   June   in which  inter alia  it reduced the monetary sum it required to be paid to    See also Sunlec International Ltd v Carroll Australasia Pty Ltd   WASC   at     At no stage in this matter prior to the publication of my reasons in the principal proceedings had AMC sought declaratory relief in relation to its proprietorship and beneficial ownership of the Fuyunhon and Tuotoning marks or to its ownership of the copyright in the Hong Kong packaging and the English language product indications for Urederm  While fact findings to the above effect in relation to the trade marks are implicit in my reasons and are explicit in relation to copyright ownership  I am not prepared now to make declarations to the above effect as AMC now seeks  on the potential significance of injunctions and declarations for the purposes of the O   r   comparison see Sunlec International at    I will later return to this  The second matter to be noted arises from the fact that the O   offer related only to AMC s claim and not to Hamilton s cross claim  This split could well be perceived as a tactical manoeuvre given that the cross claim asserted Hamilton s entitlement to AMC s trade marks  A decision by AMC so to agree to split the respective proceedings  in my view  was not to be expected  It was  in the context of the litigation  quite improbable appliedDigga Australia Pty Ltd v Norm Engineering Pty Ltd  No     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThere are two additional matters that need to be noted  First  the comparison which O   r   requires is between the  judgment on the claim to which the offer relates  and  the terms of the offer   If the  judgment  is less favourable than the offer  the presumption arises  As was observed by the Full Court in Digga Australia Pty Ltd v Norm Engineering Pty Ltd  No     FCAFC   at         The reference in the rule to  judgment  directs attention to  a judgment  decree or order      see s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  s   of the Legislative Instruments Act    Cth  s    judgment  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   We do not think that the comparison between the judgment obtained and the terms of the offer to which O   r   refers embraces a reference to findings made in the reasons for judgment appliedSmith v Madden   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe principle to be applied to the taxation of costs in such cases was stated by Dixon J in Smith v Madden   HCA         CLR   at       In such a case the taxation of the costs of the action and of the counterclaim is governed by the principle that the party receiving the costs of the claim should recover the general costs and whatever was reasonably incurred in bringing and maintaining or defending the action  as the case may be  considered as if there had been no counterclaim  and that the party receiving the costs of the counterclaim should recover the further or increased costs reasonably incurred in bringing and maintaining or defending the counterclaim       Nonetheless  his Honour acknowledged that where the successful  or unsuccessful  party on the claim or the counterclaim was not successful  or unsuccessful  on all issues  it may be appropriate to reflect this in any cost orders made by  for example  costs according to success or failure on costs issues in the claim or counterclaim  but not as between them  at     or by making a percentage or apportionment order in relation to the costs of the claim or counterclaim  at   and see Dal Pont      Though they could be said  if only for reasons of their timing  to raise slightly different issues  I intend to treat the two O   offers together the more so as the change in the offer amount made is not material in the view I take of the matter appliedNexus Minerals NL v Brutus Constructions Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe relief sought by AMC in its Further Amended Statement Claim sought declarations and orders in relation to the terms and effect of particular contractual provisions  rectification and damages for breach of contract  damages and injunctive relief at law and or under the TP Act for  variously  misleading or deceptive conduct  passing off  copyright infringement and conversion as well as other ancillary relief  In light of my conclusions  it cannot be doubted that the judgment on AMC s claim will be less favourable to it than either of the offers made  In relation to the contractual claims for damages for breach of contract arising out of the parallel importation claim and for wrongful repudiation  AMC was claiming substantial damages  In relation to the parallel importation claim  only nominal damages were awarded  Given the apparent object of the claim made was to secure substantial damages and was not to establish a legal right irrespective of the monetary relief awarded  I do not consider that AMC could properly be regarded as having been successful on this issue for costs purposes  As was said in the Full Court in Nexus Minerals NL v Brutus Constructions Pty Ltd   FCA   at         An award of nominal damages ought not today be regarded as a  peg on which to
