Australian Reward Investment Alliance v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond     CLR   Sections     and   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth  make provision for persons  who are aggrieved by decisions  by conduct engaged in for the purpose of making decisions or by the failure to make decisions  to apply for orders of review in respect thereof  In that context  Mason CJ  with whose reasons Brennan and Deane JJ relevantly agreed  said in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond     CLR   at      The distinction between reviewable decisions and conduct engaged for the purpose of making such a decision is somewhat elusive  However  once it is accepted that  decision  connotes a determination for which provision is made by or under a statute  one that generally is substantive  final and operative  the place of  conduct  in the statutory scheme of things becomes reasonably clear           There is a clear distinction between a  decision  and  conduct  engaged in for the purpose of making a decision  A challenge to conduct is an attack upon the proceedings engaged in before the making of the decision  It is not a challenge to decisions made as part of the decision making process except in the sense that if the decisions are procedural in character they will precede the conduct which is under challenge  In relation to conduct  the complaint is that the process of decision making was flawed  in relation to a decision  the complaint is that the actual decision was erroneous  To give an example  the continuation of proceedings in such a way as to involve a denial of natural justice would amount to  conduct   That is not to deny that the final determination of the proceedings would constitute a decision reviewable for denial of natural justice   In relation to the exercise by the Tribunal of its powers  s   of the SRC Act provided     The Tribunal  in reviewing a decision or conduct         a  is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence  and                      b  is to act as speedily as proper consideration of the review allows  having regard to               i  the objectives laid down by section    providing mechanisms for the conciliation of complaints  and if a complaint cannot be resolved by conciliation the review of the decision or conduct to which the complaint relates  that are fair  economical  informal and quick  and            ii  if the complaint relates to a fund the interests of all the members of the fund  and          c  may inform itself of any matter relevant to the review in any way it thinks appropriate  citedRetail Employees Superannuation Pty Limited

     The last mentioned case was reported as Briffa v Hay     FCR   referred toIn re Earl of Strafford  DECD  Royal Bank of Scotland Ltd v Byng     Ch   The learned authors of Jacobs  Law of Trusts in Australia   th edition   said in relation to the general nature of a trustee s power to compromise that it had been considered in England by the Court of Appeal in In re Earl of Strafford  DECD  Royal Bank of Scotland Ltd v Byng     Ch    It was said at    That case establishes that the power is not to be construed narrowly  nor restricted by considerations which do not clearly emerge from the statute conferring the power  In particular  it was held that  in compromising a claim adverse to the trust  the consent of the beneficiaries is not required  citedRe Irismay Holdings Pty Ltd     QdR   In Re Irismay Holdings Pty Ltd     QdR   Lee J identified the matter before the Court as an application raising an important question concerning the powers of a trustee to compromise a dispute with a beneficiary relating to the beneficiary s entitlement to trust property under the trust deed  His Honour ended up considering the matter before him by reference to the power contained in s  f  of the Trusts Act    Qld  which was in substantially the same terms as s  e  of the Trustee Act   At   Lee J said   At first blush it is difficult to see what limitations can be implied into the subsection which do not arise from the language itself      one hardly needs to cite authority for the proposition that expressions such as  claim or thing  and  relating to the trust or to the trust property  are of the widest import and should not be read down unless their context or other circumstances clearly require it     Later  at   his Honour said       Where the very subject matter of the dispute concerns the nature of a beneficiary s interest under the trust then it would seem eminently sensible to confer on the trustee power to settle that dispute provided that the compromise is entered into bona fide and for the benefit of the trust as a whole  an expression which no doubt encompasses the notion that the compromise is reached for the genuine purpose of settling the dispute and not merely as an expedient means of achieving some ulterior or extraneous agenda     in other words the mere fact that a dispute has arisen and an agreement has been entered into is not enough  the agreement must relate to the resolution of the dispute before it can come within the power  citedDowling v St Vincent De Paul Society of Victoria Inc   VSC  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VICSC  html  In Dowling v St Vincent De Paul Society of Victoria Inc   VSC   Nettle J took a somewhat more restrictive view of the breadth of s  f  of the Trustee Act    Vic  being the comparable Victorian provision  That case concerned the efficacy of an agreement to compromise a probate proceeding in which the validity of a will was contested  The question was whether s  f  authorised the executors to enter into the compromise in anticipation of a grant of probate  Nettle J reached the view that s  f  did not authorise an executor to compromise a dispute as to the validity of a will without the consent of affected parties or an order of the Court that bound them  At   his Honour said    Despite what has been said about the breadth of s  f  I do not consider that s  f  empowers an executor as such to compromise a probate proceeding in which the validity of the will is contested      His Honour continued at     The word  claim  is capable in some contexts of including almost any sort of demand  Equally  according to context  the conception of things which relate to an estate may include a very broad range of possible subject matters  But it requires no recitation of authority to establish that the words of a statutory provision are to be read in context and according to the apparent purpose of the provision  And in their context and according to what I perceive to  be  the purpose of the s   of the Trustee Act    claims relating to     the estate  appear as limited to claims upon or against the estate  With respect  I think the observations of Sir Robert Megarry VC in Re Earl of Strafford to be persuasive  The section is concerned with claims against the estate be they from the outside world or as between the beneficiaries not proceedings to determine the title of the executor or trustee   It may be seen from the above that Nettle J took the view that the relevant section could lead to compromises of claims by the relevant trustees or against them referred toNational Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Even if the Tribunal had power under s   and   of the SRC Act  when

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Contrary to the submissions of the second respondent  I am satisfied that each of the questions of law identified in the Notice of Appeal were questions of law within the meaning of s   of the SRC Act  see Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council   HCA         CLR   at   et seq    In my opinion  it was not open to the Tribunal to find that any decision of the Board in relation to the second respondent was unfair or unreasonable   The directions which the Tribunal purported to give to the Board  upon the remission of the complaint  were beyond the power of the Tribunal  Neither the Board nor the Tribunal could provide for a benefit to be paid to the second respondent out of the PSS Fund which did not accord with the Rules and which contemplated calculations being made on the premise that the second respondent could require the date of termination of her employment as an Australian Public Servant to be notionally treated as a date other than that fixed by her employer
