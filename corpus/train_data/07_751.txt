cases cth HCA  html  In considering the applicant s various grounds of complaint  it is of the first importance to restate some of the well established principles in this field  First  this is not a reconsideration of the merits of the decision  As was said by Brennan J in Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR   at        The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository s power  If  in so doing  the court avoids administrative injustice or error  so be it  but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error  The merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant power and  subject to political control  for the repository alone      See also NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALJR   at      and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at      per Gummow J  citedAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  To establish this ground the applicant must show that there was no evidence or other material upon which the President of HREOC could reasonably be satisfied that the decision of the NDPSC was not inconsistent with or contrary to any human right  Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at      per Mason J    The applicant properly and candidly conceded that on the evidence and material before HREOC  it was open for different people to reach different conclusions  So much was conceded in his written submissions when he stated that   the preponderance of detailed evidence presented in this case favours the position of the applicant   Where the preponderance of evidence lies is not a question for the Court to resolve  The question for the Court is whether there was evidence or other material to justify the decision made by HREOC  There clearly was  That is reason enough to conclude that the asserted ground is not made out ref toCollector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   Secondly  where  as here  HREOC decided not to continue to inquire into an act or practice in respect of which a complaint was made to it  HREOC was required   forthwith  to  give notice in writing to the complainant of that decision and of the reasons for that decision    s   of the HREOC Act  It did so  Those

reasons are not required to refer expressly to every argument and all the evidence that might be relevant to its determination of factual issues  cf Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALD   at       In any event  as set out earlier in these reasons for decision  it is neither necessary nor appropriate to analyse the reasons for decision of HREOC in the manner contended

Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at    The failure of HREOC to refer to any one of the matters identified by the applicant does not  of itself  identify error   The contentions also fail for other reasons  First  the question to be considered and answered by HREOC was a question posed by the HREOC Act but it was also a question  when correctly posed  which was to be determined on the particular facts before it  The failure to refer to case law or a particular decision is only relevant if it records a principle of general application which was required to be applied by HREOC which it can be shown HREOC failed to apply or act in accordance with  None are identified ref toEshetu v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   In Eshetu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   Burchett J accepted the definition of natural justice to be commensurate with the statement of principle in Butterworths Legal Dictionary  ed P Nygh and P Butt     The right to be given a fair hearing and the opportunity to present one s case  the right to have a decision made by an unbiased or disinterested decision maker and the right to have the decision based on logically probative evidence         The Applicant did not seek to submit that these circumstances  or any other feature of the matter  founded a case of actual or apprehended bias and expressly disavowed any contention to that effect   Instead  the applicant sought  impermissibly  to use this ground to re agitate the merits of the decision by reference to two headings  an invalid basis for HREOC s decision and the weight of evidence presented  The second matter  the weight of evidence presented  is addressed in Ground   below  In relation to the first heading  the applicant sought to identify the invalid basis for HREOC s decision by reference to what the applicant described as  main considerations  and  additional considerations   None of the considerations raised by the applicant demonstrated that the decision of HREOC was invalid  Many of the considerations raised by the applicant were  in fact  an attack on the merits of the decision of the NDPSC and were in relation to facts and matters about which the NDPSC and the applicant held different views  That is not a proper basis for review under this ground ref toGonzales v O Centro Esprita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal   US   As set out in the written and oral submissions of the applicant  his complaints under this ground were  in the end  directed at identifying what he described as  omissions  from HREOC s decision   i  the absence of any reference to case law   ii  the failure of HREOC to refer to the principle of  least interference   iii  the failure of HREOC to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Gonzales v O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal   US   and  finally   iv  what he described as the  unexplained shift  in position of HREOC from the view expressed by Ms Farrer  the Investigation Conciliation Officer in a memorandum to Ms Gonzalez  the Principal Investigation Conciliation Officer in April   to the decision of the President of HREOC  None of the matters identified by the applicant provide any basis for review under this ground  The question posed by this ground of review is whether there was evidence or other material to justify the decision made by HREOC  There clearly was   Secondly  there is the absence of reference  in the decision of HREOC  to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Gonzales   As Counsel for the Commonwealth submitted  although the Supreme Court of the United States was considering a decision to schedule a sacramental tea plant from the Amazon region under the Controlled Substances Act  US  because of its hallucinogenic properties  the decision is of no assistance to the issues in the present case  The statutory provisions were different  the onus provisions were different and the nature of the proceedings was different  In general terms  the Controlled Substances Act  US  prohibited the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person s exercise of religion unless the government demonstrated that the application of the burden to the person represented the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest  The Court did not reach the least restrictive means issue  The injunction against the prohibition was granted because the government had failed to discharge its burden of proof of advancing a compelling interest   Thirdly  the applicant s reference to what he described as the  unexplained shift  in position of HREOC from the view expressed by Ms Farrer  the Investigation Conciliation Officer in a memorandum to Ms Gonzalez  the Principal Investigation Conciliation Officer in April   to the decision of the President of HREOC is misconceived on three bases  it fails to take account of the decision  it fails to take account of the record of the decision making process and it reflects a misunderstanding of that process   The decision making process of the President was recorded in the following terms       I have considered the reasons set out in the letter to Dr Hanes  I agree the complaint should be declined  I have signed the letter to Dr Hanes and the letter to Mr Holton  JvD  citedGuo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALD   Secondly  where  as here  HREOC decided not to continue to inquire into an act or practice in respect of which a complaint was made to it  HREOC was required   forthwith  to  give notice in writing to the complainant of that decision and of the reasons for that decision    s   of the HREOC Act  It did so  Those reasons   are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error    Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at    Moreover  the reasons are not required to refer expressly to every argument and all the evidence that might be relevant to its determination of factual issues  cf Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALD   at       Secondly  HREOC s reasons for decision are not required to deal with every aspect of the material provided by the Department or the applicant  Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALD    It follows that  even if the applicant had been able to show that the decision did not make express reference to some aspect of the material that he had advanced  this  standing alone  would not establish that HREOC had not observed the procedures required of it by law   Thirdly  HREOC s decision was a decision clearly open to it on the material before it  Much of the applicant s complaints  both in respect of the complaint about failure to comply with procedures and more generally  proceeded from the position that it was enough for him to demonstrate reviewable error to show that HREOC had accepted the NDPSC s view  and thereby rejected the applicant s view  of the plant  That premise is not right  In general terms  the NDPSC considered that the plant  as a known hallucinogenic substance with potential hazards and risks both to users and the wider community  posed a serious risk to public health and safety  The applicant held a contrary view  He claimed that there was no evidence that the plant was a risk to national security  public safety  health or morals  that it had not been demonstrated that the plant was a hallucinogen  that no deaths  injuries  hospitalisation or serious complications had been linked to the plant and that there was no evidence that the plant could become a substance of abuse through its importation into Australia  The question for HREOC was not which of these views was to be preferred  The immediate question  as pointed out earlier in these reasons  was whether to continue to inquire into the complaint  That  in turn  invited attention to whether the decision of NDPSC was inconsistent with or contrary to a human right  That was the question that HREOC considered and determined   Many of the matters relied upon by the applicant were cast in terms that appeared to be directed to seeking a review of the merits of the decision made by HREOC but  on further analysis  were directed to challenging the initial decision of the NDPSC to place the plant into Sch   of the Poisons Standard  Merits review of any decision is beyond the duty and jurisdiction of this Court in the exercise of its judicial review power  In the present case  the position is further removed   the applicant  in substance if not in form  seeks merits review of a decision that is not before the Court  That is not permitted or possible   Some of the matters raised by the applicant appeared to be a complaint that HREOC took into account irrelevant considerations or that HREOC was motivated by improper purposes  These matters may raise other and different grounds of review  namely s  e     a  and    c  of the ADJR Act   However  these matters may be put to one side  There is nothing to suggest that HREOC exercised its power to not to continue to inquire into the complaint made by the applicant under s  a  of the HREOC Act for a purpose other than that for which it was conferred  Further  there is no evidence that HREOC was motivated by   factors other than legal factors  such as the time consuming nature and complexity of this case  the lack of prospects for a reasonable settlement and a desire to remove the case from the Commission s ongoing commitments  or that NDPSC was motivated by improper purposes including   religio political factors     The applicant contended that HREOC took into account an irrelevant consideration  The  irrelevant consideration  was described by the applicant as the  slippery slope  argument  That assertion fails at the outset   HREOC addressed the  slippery slope  argument by summarising the positions adopted by NDPSC and the applicant in relation to the matter in the following terms       The Department states that in addition to being a consideration that is not currently required under the TGA Act and the Regulations in the scheduling of substances in the Poisons Standard  the result would be catastrophic if  despite the strict scheduling of substances  such as Schedule   substances  individuals would be allowed to use hallucinogenic substances such as LSD and cannabis for religious reasons or beliefs  despite the known health and safety risks of these substances  The Department maintains that an individual would not only risk harm  injury or death to himself  but to other members of the public as well           The applicant denies  that if the plant were made available for religious purposes that this would contribute to a  slippery slope  whereby  others could seek the de scheduling of other hallucinogenic substances   HREOC considered the parties  respective position as part of its evaluation of the information provided to it  At its highest  the argument was a factor put to HREOC by the NDPSC to which the applicant responded  HREOC s treatment of the  slippery slope  argument does not reveal that it took into account an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of its power citedHouse v The King   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  HREOC has not amplified what it meant by the reference  in its decision  to the level of restriction adopted by NDPSC being  proportionate to the potential risks associated with the use of the plant   However  what HREOC said in its reasons is in no way inconsistent with it applying what the applicant says is the proper construction of Art   and  in particular  giving that article the meaning described in General Comment   by reference to the notion of the restriction being  directly related and proportionate   It follows that  to make good his complaint of error of law  the applicant must seek to argue from the actual conclusion reached by HREOC that it must have understood the relevant legal test incorrectly  It may be accepted that there may be cases in which such reasoning is permissible   It is reasoning of a kind that may be said to be analogous to the last category of cases described in House v The King   HCA         CLR   at   as warranting appellate intervention in a discretionary decision   But it is reasoning that is available only if no answer to the relevant question is possible except the answer for which the applicant contends that total prohibition of use of the plant cannot be said to the  least restrictive  interference with the use of the plant that is consistent with the object of public health and safety  The premise was not made good   Under this heading  the applicant also referred the court to a number of events which he described as evidence   raising the possibility of interference by organisations or individuals with knowledge of the plant  and which occurred on or about the same time as the plant was placed into Sch   of the Poisons Standard  The events identified by the applicant were the correction to the spelling of the scientific name of the plant in the applicant s medical records and the circumstances of his medical detention on   May   the fact that the first known official reference to the plant in Australia was in a minute prepared by an officer of the TGA on   April   the fact that the applicant was waiting for his paper entitled   Antidepressant effects of the herb salvia divinorum  to be published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology and a conversation the applicant had with a  US journalist   The coincidence of the timing of these events was said by the applicant to provide evidence that the plant was placed into Sch   for reasons other than health and safety  The complaint on this basis is entirely misconceived  In substance and in form  it seeks a review of the decision of the NDPSC  That is not open  Insofar as the applicant seems to suggest that HREOC took into account irrelevant considerations or was motivated by improper purposes  there is nothing to support the applicant s assertion that any of these events taken singularly or cumulatively motivated HREOC or  for that matter  the NDPSC   The complaint of error of law fails citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA

www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section  b  of the ADJR Act provides that a decision may be reviewed on the ground that   procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed    This ground of review has been described as  procedural ultra vires   It is concerned with determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision  Any distinction between directory and mandatory requirements is not relevant  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at      The acts to which this ground of review is directed are usually requirements laid down by an Act to reach a decision within a certain period of time or after a period of consultation   The applicant has not identified a procedure prescribed by the HREOC Act which HREOC has not observed  Instead  under this heading  the applicant asserts that HREOC failed to perform its functions under ss  f  and   of the HREOC Act in that it failed to give proper consideration to the evidence before it  In support of that contention  the applicant referred to what he described as   matters of  key evidence  that the President of HREOC had failed to consider  The matters were said by the applicant to be        the plant was non addictive    the plant was non toxic    there were no health warnings in relation to the plant    the lack of experience and expertise in the Department    the Department breached s  E b  of the TGA in that the Department failed to take into account   the risks and benefits associated

applicant disavowed any suggestion that HREOC was biased    the NDPSC was motivated by improper purposes including   religio political factors      evidence of  behind the scenes  discussions  Three examples were provided  First  an internal review document provided by the TGA in which a Dr P Chipman stated that   Customs might have expressed concern to the TGA by way of telephone calls and it is possible that telephone discussions between the two agencies may not have been filed    The second example provided as evidence of possible collusion or interference in the decision making process was the   surprisingly prompt knowledge by the NDPSC     of US Congressional Bill HR   at the     October    meeting of the NDPSC  which Bill had only been introduced into Congress on the   th October     The third example was an assertion by the applicant that he   was advised by a US journalist that information pertaining to Australia s prohibition of  the plant  may have been leaked to the US Drug Enforcement Agency  and    t his may have occurred just prior to the unsuccessful US Bill HR   which sought to prohibit  the plant  in that country      the concern expressed in the Australian Parliament by Lindsay Tanner that the TGA was unable to identify an authorative scientific source for the plant when considering whether it should be included in Sch   and the fact that this was not referred to by HREOC in its decision   The applicant s contention that HREOC failed to perform its functions under ss  f  and   of the HREOC Act in that it failed to give proper consideration to the matters listed in the preceding paragraph establishes no basis for review under this heading  Neither the general allegation nor any of the specific matters identified by the applicant concerns a
