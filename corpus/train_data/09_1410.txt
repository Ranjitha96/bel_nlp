Strazdins  in the matter of DNPW Pty Ltd  subject to DOCA  ACN       v Birch Carroll   Coyle Limited  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedFekala Pty Ltd v Cenbond Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlNext the respondent argued that  consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Fekala Pty Ltd v Cenbond Pty Ltd   NSWSC     an order for costs ought to be made in the respondent s favour  In that case  the Court was concerned with two interlocutory applications relating to an order under s  D  of the Corporations Act   Section  D operates to protect a company s property during an administration  Section  D allows an administrator to apply to the Court for an order that a chargee or receiver or other person not perform specified functions or exercise specified powers during the course of the administration  s  D of the Corporations Act   The section allows the Court to restrain a secured creditor from realising on the creditor s security  In Fekala Pty Ltd v Cenbond Pty Ltd   NSWSC     the Court was asked to make an order under s  D where the administrators had had considerable time to put forward some firm proposal in relation to a payment due to the secured creditor and even at the time of the hearing could only put forward a speculative proposal  The administrators were not in a position to give any undertaking as to damages  The trial judge  Young J  made the order under s  D only because he thought there was some chance that the secured creditors would benefit by the order being made  He made it a condition of the order  without saying why  that the administrators pay the costs of the application  It seems to me that that case is no authority for any general proposition that when a court makes an order under s  F   the court should award the chargee or the owner or lessor of property its costs  Justice Young did not say that  He merely made it a condition of the order that the costs be paid  In my opinion  that case is not authority for the proposition advanced by the respondent  Next the respondent contended that  if the applicants had applied to the Court for relief under the Law of Property Act    NT  the Court could have made an order for costs in favour of the respondent  The applicants did initially include in their application a claim for relief under that Act but that was abandoned very early in the hearing  The matter did not proceed under that Act  It seems to me irrelevant what powers the Law of Property Act    NT  gives to the Court in relation to costs for applications under that Act citedHayes v Gunbola Pty Ltd     BPR  Next it was put that there is a presumption that where a party seeks an order for relief from forfeiture that the party seeking relief ought to pay the lessor s costs  In support of that contention the respondent relied on Hayes v Gunbola Pty Ltd     BPR    That was a case for relief from forfeiture under s   of the Conveyancing Act    NSW  in which the trial judge  Young J  was of the opinion that  in the exercise of the Court s discretion relief should be granted  His Honour addressed the question of costs and said  it is abundantly clear that as the price of getting relief against forfeiture the plaintiff must pay the lessor s reasonable costs  Hayes v Gunbola Pty Ltd   BPR   at    His Honour referred to Howard v Fanshawe     Ch D   at   where he said the ordinary order was that the plaintiff must bear the costs of the action except where those costs have been increased by the defendant resisting the claim and those costs must be borne by the defendant  He also referred to Langley v Foster     SR  NSW    at   where Simpson CJ in Eq said          prima facie one of the terms imposed should be the payment of all costs  for the plaintiff s own breach of his agreement has given rise to the litigation     this is not a hard and fast rule  for  if it were  a lessor might always oppose relief being granted knowing he would always get his costs from the lessee  If the court thinks the lessor ought not have opposed in toto the grant of relief from forfeiture  the court may make the lessor pay the costs so far as they have been increased by the lessor resisting the claim to relief on any terms     But the court may make  and has in one case at any rate made  the lessee pay all the costs  notwithstanding the lessor contested his claim to relief at all  Quilter v Mapleson     QB    It is a question for the court s discretion in each case citedHoward v
