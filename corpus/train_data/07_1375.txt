Stewart  in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAnstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd     ACLC   There are a number of principles relevant to the exercise of the Court s power under s  B  which are worth restating      the court does not simply  rubber stamp  whatever is put forward by a liquidator  As Giles J said in Re Spedley Securities Ltd  In liq      ACLC   at   in relation to the powers of a liquidator to compromise claims         T he Court is necessarily confined in attempting to second guess the liquidator in the exercise of his powers  and generally will not interfere unless there can be seen to be some lack of good faith  some error in law or principle  or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator s conduct  The same restraint must apply when the question is whether the liquidator should be authorised to enter into a particular transaction the benefits and burdens of which require assessment on a commercial basis  Of course  the compromise of claims will involve assessment on a legal basis  and a liquidator will be expected  as was made plain in Re Chase Corporation  Australia  Equities Ltd   to obtain advice and  as a prudent person would in the conduct of his own affairs  advice from practitioners appropriate to the nature and value of the claims  But in all but the simplest case  and demonstrably in the present case  commercial considerations play a significant part in whether a compromise will be for the benefit of creditors
