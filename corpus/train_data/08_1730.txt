Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedNational Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It was not suggested in this proceeding that  so far as a Commonwealth revenue debt is concerned  there is any express statutory provision which alters the usual position which prevails as between creditor and debtor when a cheque is given in payment of a debt  That usual position was expressed by Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson and Toohey JJ in National Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     at   to be as follows  Generally speaking  when a cheque is given in payment of a debt  it operates as a conditional payment  The payment is subject to a condition that the cheque be paid on presentation  If it is dishonoured the debt revives  Although it is sometimes said that the remedy for the primary debt is suspended  the suspension is no more than a consequence of the conditional nature of the payment  Tilley v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR     at pp            The condition is a condition subsequent so that  if the cheque is met  it ranks as an actual payment from the time it was given  Subject to non fulfilment of the condition subsequent  the payment is complete at the time when the cheque is accepted by the creditor  Thomson v Moyse   AC     at p     It was submitted for the Deputy Commissioner that  in the events which had transpired in this case  that usual position had been altered by the signification by the Deputy Commissioner that he would agree to the dismissal of the winding up application once the proceeds of the cheque had been cleared  It seems to me though that the evidence is more consistent with the Deputy Commissioner s adopting a position which was in accordance with the general position when a cheque is given in payment of a debt  It has been accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation  Subject to the fulfilment of that condition  payment of the then outstanding amount of the debt due to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner was complete upon the acceptance by the Deputy Commissioner on   November   of the cheque then proffered on behalf of Ganter  In this regard  the fact that the proffered cheque was a bank cheque may well have provided a degree of comfort to the Deputy Commissioner in deciding to accept it  but the position would have been the same in law so far as the relationship of debtor and creditor was concerned had the cheque concerned been one where the drawer was other than a bank followedGeorge v Cluning     ALJR    note  Strictly speaking  a cheque  even a bank cheque  is not a form of legal tender  Subject to some particular contractual or statutory provision  the only forms of legal tender remain Australian notes or  subject to the limits specified  Australian coins see s   of the Reserve Bank Act   and s   of the Currency Act   respectively  However  in general trade and commerce  as Mason J observed in George v Cluning     ALJR    note  by reference to Canadian authority  a payment by cheque can amount to sufficient payment if not objected to on that account  In this case there was no objection made by the Deputy Commissioner on account of Ganter s endeavouring to settle its indebtedness by the tendering of a cheque only  as I have noted a signification that it was accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentationfollowedAustralian Mid Eastern Club Limited v Yassim     ACSR   None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque  When the history of Ganter s endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was  by operation of s  C a  the Corporations Act   presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque  A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question  Australian Mid Eastern Club Ltd v

v Visidet Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Gyles J   In my opinion  the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made  As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance  supra  was decided  the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory  By s  A b  of the Corporations Act a creditor is one of the persons who may apply for the winding up of a company  The application for the winding up of Ganter was made by the Deputy Commissioner upon the filing of the application in this Court on   August    At that time  the Deputy Commissioner was  on any view  a creditor  Like Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd  at   I am not persuaded that there is any requirement flowing from the Corporations Act that the applicant must continue to be a creditor at the time when the winding up application is heard  As his Honour there states  ibid  and though it is cited in a number of cases which he notes  the passage from the judgement of Menzies J in Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance  supra  does not support the existence of any such requirement   The true position is that the applicant s status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the company s failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand are sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to order the winding up of the company  That was the conclusion reached by Zeeman J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd     FLR   at    As did Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd  at   I agree with that conclusion  As Zeeman J observed in the Guy Holdings Case  at    in the case of an application under s  P where the debt the subject of the statutory demand has been paid after the filing of the application  the application ought to be dismissed unless there is established some positive reason that a winding up order ought to be made   His Honour is there referring to the way in which  in those circumstances  the discretion vested in the Court on the hearing of a winding up application by s   of the Corporations Act would ordinarily be exercised   In their submissions the solicitors for the company pointed to the observation made by Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd  at    With trading companies the existence of a winding up proceeding is a very serious inhibition and has very serious impacts   I respectfully agree  That is one reason why it behoves a company which wishes to keep trading to pay its debts as they fall due or at least later to comply with the terms of a statutory demand  It is also a reason why  all other things being equal  a Court would be disposed  as a matter of discretion  to dismiss a winding up application if satisfied that the debt owed to the applicant creditor had been paid  Another consideration not to be ignored is the protection of the revenue  Yet another consideration is that Ganter  by its solicitors  initially agreed with the Deputy Commissioner s proposal that on   November   the adjournment of the application for one week ought to be sought  A further consideration is the public interest in whether a company which is presumed to be insolvent ought to be permitted to continue to trade or whether it ought to be wound up   Ganter s change of heart as to the course which ought to be taken on   November   seems to have been multi factorial in origin  Inferentially from the submissions made to me and to the District Registrar it was founded upon what I regard as the misapprehension that the payment of an applicant creditor s debt obliged the Court to dismiss a winding up application  as opposed to that being a factor going to discretion  Likewise  it seems to have been grounded on the belief that the acceptance of the bank cheque by the Deputy Commissioner extinguished the debt then and there  as opposed to so doing upon the fulfilment of the condition subsequent of the cheque s being cleared  Further  it seems to have been grounded upon the belief that  the cheque payment having been recorded as a credit on   November   in its accounts  the Deputy Commissioner was obliged  as a  model litigant  to agree to the dismissal of the winding up application on   November     This  with respect  misapprehends the obligation that falls on those representing the interests of the Crown in civil litigation  One of those interests  and it is a vital interest  is the protection of the revenue  The Deputy Commissioner would certainly have failed in his duty to the Court as a model litigant had the acceptance of the cheque and the terms upon which it had been accepted not been drawn to the Court s attention on   November    It was  Especially as matters then stood as to the clearing of the bank cheque and the Deputy Commissioner s knowledge as to the practice of the NAB in relation to the circumstances in which it would not meet a bank cheque and the time within which any such disposition on the part of the bank would usually be signified  it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Commissioner to resist the dismissal of the application that day  The position then to take was a matter for the value judgement of the Deputy Commissioner in the circumstances in the administration of the taxation laws  The entry in the accounts of the ATO had no more than a provisional quality about it followedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd   TASSC         FLR       ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases tas supreme ct  html  The true position is that the applicant s status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the

www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  For Ganter reliance was placed on the following observation made by Barrett J in Bidald Consulting Pty Ltd v Miles Special Builders Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at      A  plaintiff whose debt has been paid after the time for challenging a s  E demand based on the debt has expired and before the hearing of the winding up application is no longer able to maintain and pursue that application citedMotor Terms Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Assuming that the Deputy Commissioner ought presently to be regarded as an applicant whose debt has been paid  it does not  with respect  seem to me to follow that the application must therefore necessarily be dismissed  In his judgment in Motor Terms Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd   HCA         CLR     at     Menzies J  in what is strictly an obiter dictum   opined  In the course of argument upon this appeal  reference was made to the consequence of a petitioning creditor being paid off between the presentation of the petition and the making of an order  That circumstance would not  in my opinion  put an end to the petition nor would it affect the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the petition although  of course  in such circumstances proceedings might not be continued and  if they were  the court could  in the exercise of its discretion  refuse to make a winding up order upon the petition of a person not then a creditor   In that same case  Barwick CJ  at   also seems to have been of the view that  under the then statutory regime for the winding up of a company  the date for the determination of whether a petitioner was a creditor was the date of presentation of the winding up petition   In my opinion  the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made  As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance  supra  was decided  the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory  By s  A b  of the Corporations Act a creditor is one of the persons who may apply for the winding up of a company  The application for the winding up of Ganter was made by the Deputy Commissioner upon the filing of the application in this Court on   August    At that time  the Deputy Commissioner was  on any view

to be a creditor at the time when the winding up application is heard  As his Honour there states  ibid  and though it is cited in a number of cases which he notes  the passage from the judgement of
