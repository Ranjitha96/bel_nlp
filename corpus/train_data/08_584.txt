Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedMaher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I was referred by the respondent to the judgment of Finkelstein J in Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA    The facts in that case bear a remarkable similarity to those in the present case  It was another case in which Mr Maher made an application to adjourn a trial saying that he was suffering from physical disabilities which prevented him from sitting or standing for any length of time and that he would be unable effectively to present his case without the assistance of counsel  His Honour had declined to grant the adjournment sought  These events occurred on   January     On   February   Mr Maher sent a facsimile transmission to his Honour s associate asserting that he needed an indulgence to delay the matter and that he had notified the respondents by facsimile transmission  The case was called on as scheduled on   February   and Mr Maher didn t appear  His Honour advised counsel that he would stand the matter down for a short time to determine whether Mr Maher was absent by reason of his attendance in another court  When the matter resumed his Honour was advised that Mr Maher was not to be found  At that stage Mr Maher s application was dismissed with costs   Another aspect of the matter  a cross claim  involving Mr Maher was due to be heard later that day and Mr Maher appeared  He advised Finkelstein J that he had just filed an appeal against his Honour s refusal to grant the earlier adjournment  He did not explain why he had not been in court at   am when the matter was called on and his Honour adjourned the hearing of the cross claim until   February    On that date his Honour  through his associate  received a communication from Mr Maher seeking an adjournment of that day s hearing on account of a medical problem and indicating that he would provide a medical certificate confirming this on the next day  A facsimile was sent on the same day to the registry which asked that his Honour be advised that Mr Maher would be unable to attend the hearing of the matter on account of his medical condition   The case was called on as scheduled on that day and the matter proceeded in Mr Maher s absence and was adjourned part heard until the following day  On the following day there was another facsimile sent to his Honour s associate by Mr Maher again asserting an inability to attend court and seeking an indulgence for a further adjournment on account of a medical problem  There were two medical certificates attached which asserted that he was medically unfit to attend court on the previous day and there was also a certification of his unfitness to attend from the second day of the hearing  namely   February     When the matter came back on his Honour determined that the matter would proceed and it did  On the same day Mr Maher sent another facsimile letter to his Honour s associate indicating that he had been in touch with a solicitor  He sought an indulgence for a further adjournment so that he could obtain legal advice  His Honour delivered judgment in favour of the respondent  The following day Mr Maher moved to set aside the judgments and his Honour advised Mr Maher of the matters which it would be necessary for him to establish in order to have that occur  At the hearing of the application which took place later in February   Mr Maher appeared and advised his Honour that he was not prepared to seek an affidavit from his medical practitioners deposing to his illness and sought only to rely on the certificates  Again that approach seems remarkably similar to the one adopted yesterday in argument before me   Having regard to these matters his Honour said    With this history in mind  I am in no doubt that Mr Maher made a deliberate decision not to attend the hearing on Monday   February   in the expectation that the case would not go on in his absence and that he would thereby obtain the adjournment he was refused on the preceding Friday  I am convinced that Mr Maher intended to take whatever steps were necessary to defer the hearing while he continued his attempts to obtain pro bono counsel    Moreover  I simply do not accept Mr Maher s claim that he was physically unable to attend the hearing on   or   February    The medical certificates are unconvincing  And  I suspect that Mr Maher did not obtain an affidavit from his doctor  or secure his attendance by subpoena  because the doctor s evidence would not have assisted his cause    Mr Maher s cavalier attitude is inexcusable  There is no reason why a person who is hell bent on delaying a proceeding in this way should be indulged  I suspect that if a new trial is ordered and Mr Maher still does not have counsel to assist him  he will renew his efforts to have the trial delayed  Tempted as I am to simply dismiss his motion out of hand  I accept that the more important consideration is to determine whether his own claim or his defence or the bank s claim has any merit  If either has merit then it is best left to go to trial  Mr Maher can be suitably punished by an appropriate order in relation to costs  although even that may not put an end to his humbug   Those comments are apposite having regard to the facts of this case  I do not accept that the applicant was prevented by ill health from attending the court at     am on   April    Despite the medical certification given the next day that he was unfit to work he advised that he could attend court at     pm on   April    He had failed to give adequate instructions to solicitors even though he was well aware that Goldberg J had said on the previous Friday that the matter would proceed on   April    This was another calculated attempt at delay   What is to be done  Very reluctantly I have come to the view that the applicant should have the opportunity to present such arguments as he is able in support of his three notices of motion  He should not however be able to do so unless and until he has paid the respondent s costs which were thrown away by reason of the late application for an adjournment of the hearing on   March   and his failure to appear on   April    In this context I have regard to the matters referred to by Sundberg J in his reasons for ordering that security be provided for the respondent s costs of the appeal from the federal magistrate   See at paragraphs   to   of Sundberg Js reasons   I have read Sundberg J s reasons  In my view the applicant s prospects of succeeding in obtaining any of the orders sought in his three notices of motion are slight  The respondent claims   by way of costs thrown away  This amount will  in all probability  tax out at a lesser sum  I therefore propose to order that the setting aside of my orders be made conditional on the applicant paying the respondent   towards its costs  In the circumstances the orders which will be made are    On condition that  by   pm on   May   the applicant pays to the respondent   in respect of its costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment sought and granted on   March   and by reason of the applicant s failure to appear on   April   the orders made herein by Tracey J on   April   be set aside     The applicant s notice of motion dated   April   otherwise be dismissed     If  by operation of order    the orders made on   April   are set aside  the applicant pay the respondent its costs thrown away on the adjournment and incurred by reason of the applicant s failure to appear less any costs paid pursuant to order       If  by operation of order   the orders made on   April   are set aside  the hearing of the applicant s notices of motion dated     and   March   be fixed for   June       The applicant pay the respondent s taxed costs of the motion   I certify that the preceding twenty
