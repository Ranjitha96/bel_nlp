Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   the High Court held that s   is a valid exercise of the Federal Parliament s power to make laws with respect to aliens  Similar arguments to those put in this case were put to the Full Court of this Court in Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    The Court considered the authorities relevant to the relationship between laws providing for the deportation of aliens and the cancellation of their visas and Chapter   of the Constitution and then summarised the effect of those authorities in the following propositions  at          Section  xix  of the Constitution empowers Parliament to make a law providing for the deportation of aliens for whatever reason Parliament thinks fit  unless the Constitution otherwise prohibits the making of the law       Under Chapter III of the Constitution   the adjudication and punishment of criminal guilt by reason of an alleged breach of a law of the Commonwealth appertains to the judicial power of the Commonwealth and cannot be entrusted to the Executive  If  therefore  Commonwealth legislation on its proper construction  purports to authorise the Executive to impose punishment for criminal conduct  the legislation  to that extent  will infringe Chapter III of the Constitution        Whether legislation conferring power to cancel the visa or order the deportation of a non citizen is punitive in character is to be determined by construction of the legislation  not by a consideration of the consequences of detention or removal of the individual       Accordingly  the power to cancel a visa or order the deportation of a non citizen is not to be regarded as punitive in character merely because exercise of the power involves interference with the liberty of the individual or imposes what the individual may see as sanctions consequential on his criminal connections  Neither can detention incidental to deportation of a non citizen be characterised as punitive merely because it involves deprivation of liberty       Legislation conferring a discretion on the Executive to cancel the visa of a non citizen or to deport a non citizen is not characterised as punitive if it can fairly be said to protect the Australian community  This is so even where the pre condition that must be satisfied for the exercise of the power is the conviction of the non citizen for a criminal offence or the imposition of a minimum period of imprisonment       Nonetheless  if in a particular case the decision maker purports to exercise a statutory power to cancel the visa of a non citizen or to deport the non citizen or order to punish the non citizen and not for protection of the Australian community or some other legitimate objective  the exercise of the power may be ultra vires the statute  citedJohnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Whether a person has been absorbed into the Australian community and thereby ceased to be an immigrant requires a consideration of a number of the factual matters of which French J provided a summary in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at        It seems to me that it is likely the applicant fell within the terms of s   of the Act and I am prepared to assume that he held an absorbed person visa on   September     The applicant submits that he could only hold one visa at a time and therefore he did not also hold a transitional permanent visa on   September    He referred to s   of the Act which is in the following terms        A substantive visa held by a non citizen ceases to be in effect if another substantive visa  other than a special purpose visa  for the non citizen comes into effect  followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At the time this appeal was argued before me  the High Court had not handed down its decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   That decision has now been handed down    HCA         ALJR     Nystrom    The decision is a significant one in that it resolves a number of the issues in this case   In Nystrom   the Minister appealed from a decision of the Full Court of this Court  The Minister had cancelled the respondent s transitional permanent visa and the respondent challenged that decision  He submitted that he held an absorbed person visa instead of  or in addition to  the transitional permanent visa  He submitted that the Minister s decision was invalid for jurisdictional error because the Minister had made a decision in relation to a visa he did not hold  He also argued that if he held a transitional permanent visa the Minister in cancelling that visa had erred because he had not taken into account the fact that by reason of s  F  of the Act his decision would also lead to the cancellation of his absorbed person visa  The respondent also submitted that the power in s   was restricted or curtailed by the operation of s   and s   of the Act  It will be apparent from this brief summary that a number of the arguments in Nystrom were the same as the arguments put in this case   By the time Nystrom had reached the High Court it was common ground that on   September   the respondent held an absorbed person visa  As I have said  in the case before me the Tribunal member seems to have assumed that the applicant held an absorbed person visa  although he did not finally decide the point  On appeal to this Court  the Minister argued the matter on the basis that the applicant held an absorbed person visa as at   September   without conceding that that was necessarily the case   A non citizen who falls within the terms of s   of the Act is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on   September    Section   and   of the Act are in the following terms        There is a class of permanent visas to remain in  but not re enter  Australia  to be known as absorbed person visas          A non citizen in the migration zone who         a  on   April   was in Australia  and    b  before that date  had ceased to be an immigrant  and            c  on or after that date  has not left Australia  where left Australia has the meaning it had in this Act before   September   and    d  immediately before   September   was not a person to whom section   of this Act as in force then applied            is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on   September    notfollowedNystrom v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The facts in this case are different from the facts in Nystrom but the conclusion is the same  The Tribunal member said that the delegate s decision was probably invalid because the delegate failed to take into consideration that the cancellation of the applicant s transitional permanent visa also led to the cancellation of his absorbed person visa  In reaching that conclusion the Tribunal member followed the reasoning of the majority of the Full Court of this Court in Nystrom v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    In view of the High Court s decision in Nystrom that conclusion is wrong  The Tribunal member then said that he could not review the decision of the delegate which had the effect of cancelling the applicant s absorbed person visa because no application to review that  decision  had been made by the applicant  I do not think this observation advances the matter because  as the Minister submitted  there probably was no right of review in relation to that  decision   Section   of the Act provides that there is a right of review only from the decision of the delegate under s    The Tribunal member went on to say that a right of review in relation to the deemed cancellation of the absorbed person visa would be of no practical utility because s  F  operates to cancel that visa upon cancellation of the transitional permanent visa  I do not think I need to comment further on this reasoning because  on the reasoning of the High Court in Nystrom   the Tribunal member would not have erred if he had not taken into account the deemed cancellation of the absorbed person visa  As it happens the Tribunal member did take that into account  At the conclusion of his reasons  he said     After considering all the evidence before me and balancing all of the relevant considerations in the Direction  I have decided that it is appropriate to exercise the discretion under s   of the Act in favour of cancelling the applicant s transitional  permanent  visa Class BF    I must also take into account that by virtue of s  F  of the Act  the cancellation of Mr Pull s transitional  permanent  visa class BF involves a deemed decision to cancel his absorbed person visa  assuming  as I have  that he is the holder of such a visa   I find that on the facts of this matter  the considerations referred to in the Direction in relation to the exercise of discretion to cancel the absorbed person visa lead to the same issues and the same conclusions  The consequential cancellation of that visa does not therefore lead me to reach a different conclusion in reviewing the delegate s decision   In conclusion  at the time the Tribunal member made his decision the applicant held both a transitional permanent visa and an absorbed person visa and his submission to the contrary must be rejected  In deciding that the transitional permanent visa should be cancelled the Tribunal member would not have erred if he had not taken into account the fact that would also lead to the cancellation of the absorbed person visa  As it happens  he did take that into account  The fact that there are aspects of the Tribunal member s reasons with which I do not agree does not affect those conclusions  The applicant s first submission must be rejected consideredShaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The applicant s third submission is that s   authorises an impermissible exercise of judicial power in that it authorises the Minister to punish a visa holder for the crimes he or she has committed and for which he or she has already been punished  To the extent that it does that it is said by the applicant to be invalid  The applicant refers to observations made by Spender J in Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at         In the alternative  the applicant submits that if s   does not authorise an impermissible exercise of the judicial power and is valid  nevertheless  in this case  the power was exercised for the impermissible purpose of punishing the applicant for the criminal offences he had committed  In the context of this submission the applicant referred to the following factual matters       The applicant is a non citizen of longstanding  which I assume means that he has been in Australia for a considerable period of time      The applicant has two children in Australia      The applicant was the holder of an absorbed person s visa and was entitled to rely upon the nature of the visa  coupled with the protective elements of s   of the Act  to assume that he had been absorbed in the Australian community      The applicant has no significant ties with his place of birth and would be liable to live a destitute life      The applicant has been punished by the Australian courts for offences committed in Australia while present here as an absorbed person followedShaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Shaw v Minister for Immigration and
