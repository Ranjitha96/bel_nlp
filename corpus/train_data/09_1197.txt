Sunland Waterfront  BVI  Ltd v Prudentia Investments Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedLloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship  Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya  and Anor     FCR  This notice to produce  The provision in the Federal Court Rules in relation to notices to produce is O   r    That rule provides        Where a party to any proceedings serves on another party notice  in accordance with Form   requiring the party served to produce at any trial or hearing in the proceedings  or before any Judge  officer  examiner or other person having authority to take evidence in the proceedings any document or thing for the purpose of evidence and the document or thing is in the possession  custody or power of the party served  the party served shall  unless the Court otherwise orders  produce the document or thing in accordance with the notice  without the need for any subpoena for production            Where the document or thing required to be produced in accordance with subrule   is not produced  the party serving the notice may lead secondary evidence of the contents or nature of the document or thing            Subrule   does not affect the power of the Court to order costs against a party who fails to comply with a notice under subrule        Some principles have emerged in relation to notices to produce under O   r   from prior authorities  It is accepted that a notice to produce  properly issued in terms of O   r   has the same coercive effect as a subpoena  There is also authority that a notice to produce may be used even in respect of an interlocutory hearing  Though examples are to be found of such use it may perhaps require reconsideration at some stage in light of the remarks made in the Full Court in Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship  Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya  and Anor     FCR   at  D  Bremerhaven  where the Full Court makes reference to adjectival rules to be applied at the hearing  being those appropriate to a final hearing  I proceed  though  on the basis that the desired use of a notice to produce by Mr Joyce to secure the production of particular documents for use in relation to the application to be heard on   December   is  at least in theory  permissible under the Rules even though the application to be heard that day is not a final hearing    I note that in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR     Hely J at   having voiced his general agreement with observations made by Hill J in relation to notices to produce  stated      Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O  A for preliminary discovery citedTelstra Corporation v Minister for Communications  Information Technology and the Arts   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThose sentiments expressed by Hely J were quoted with apparent approval by Graham J in Telstra Corporation v Minister for Communications  Information Technology and the Arts   FCA    Telstra   One finds in Graham J s judgment in the Telstra case at para   through to  and including  para   a helpful recitation of authority in relation to practice and procedure concerning notices to produce  The Sunland parties do not challenge the prima facie ability of Mr Joyce to invoke the notice to produce procedure in support of his application on   December   consideredArmacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere is  it must be said  something of an incongruity in respect of a party who  on the one hand  challenges the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the substantive proceeding and  on the other hand  seeks to invoke its compulsory process to support an application that that party is making  It may well be that  again prima facie  that course is impermissible  see Armacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation   FCA         FCR   at     The application to be heard on   December   has about it  though  as noted  an alternative predicated upon an absence of success as to the jurisdictional challenge  The Sunland parties  for their part  recognise the practicalities and also the service of the interests of justice by the hearing of the application for the relief Mr Joyce seeks on that day conjunctively rather than in some staggered way  For that reason there is no formal challenge to the ability to invoke the compulsory process reflected in a notice to produce made by the Sunland parties  Rather  they seek to meet whether the notice to produce should be set aside on the assumption that it is otherwise open to Mr Joyce to invoke that process  That seems to me to be a just way to approach the question of whether the notice to produce should be set aside in the particular circumstances of this case  In other words  whilst I have a particular reservation as to the invocation of the process when jurisdiction is under challenge  I shall proceed on the assumption that it is otherwise regular to have sought to invoke the process  Another question which emerges in terms of practice and procedure is the absence of a grant of leave to Mr Joyce for the issuing of any notice to produce  be it in the form quoted or in some other form  I say that because the notice seeks to have the documents it describes produced at a time other than the hearing which was to occur on   December citedTyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThis notice to produce

    FCR     Hely J at   having voiced his general agreement with observations made by Hill J in relation to notices to produce  stated      Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O  A for preliminary discovery consideredBP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd   FCA     Nicholson J had occasion to deal with an application for leave to serve a notice to produce  His Honour made the observation   with respect  an unsurprising observation   that O   r   did not require leave  but that was in the context of where production was to occur at a trial or hearing  or otherwise as provided in r    His Honour further observed that leave was necessary in the case before him because the notice sought the production of documents other than at a trial or hearing  Mr Joyce s counsel  upon this particular subject being drawn to his attention  applied orally for a grant of leave  Thus there are strictly two applications before the Court today  One is that brought by the Sunland parties for the setting aside of the notice to produce  the other is for a grant of leave for the production of documents on notice prior to the hearing on   December  The Sunland parties describe the notice to produce as  a mere fishing expedition   Their submission is that fails to meet the requisite test of relevance in relation to notices to produce  An alternative submission is made in respect of paras     and   of the notice  that it is oppressive followedBailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe test  so far as the question of relevance is concerned  is one of adjectival relevance  Further  so far as any question of  fishing  is concerned  observations made in the Full Court in Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   are pertinent       E ven if the notices to produce are properly to be regarded as fishing  that concept has undergone substantial rethinking in this Court in recent years  In a number of cases it has been pointed out that O  A r    discovery before action  expressly contemplates what once might have been castigated as fishing and that it would be incongruous if the power to order discovery much less extensive in favour of a party to a proceeding properly brought in the Court than in favour of someone unable for lack of evidence to mount a case citedMcMahon v Gould     ACLR  On   December   insofar as the application turns on matters other than jurisdiction  it is evident that Mr Joyce will seek to persuade the Court that there is unjust prejudice to him in the continuance of these proceedings of a kind described in McMahon v Gould     ACLR   at    One factor to which Mr Joyce proposes to point is that it is  to say the least  likely that evidence in these proceedings  insofar as it is lawfully possible under our law for the same to be disclosed  will find its way to the authorities in the Emirate  So much is accepted by the Sunland parties  The Sunland parties go rather further in terms of the particular qualities that are likely to attend them in relation to these proceedings and in respect of proceedings  both civil and criminal  in the Emirate  That this is so is evident in terms of statements made publicly by the Sunland parties  the contents of which are in evidence before me in the form of a series of Australian Stock Exchange and Media Releases issued under the hand of a Mr Harrison  the company secretary of the Sunland Group  Thus  on   February  the Sunland parties have disclosed openly that      Information has been provided by Sunland to the investigating authorities          I interpolate  in Dubai          and the Sunland Group will continue to provide assistance where required
