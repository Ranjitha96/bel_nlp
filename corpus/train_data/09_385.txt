Tribunal did not consider the submission  founded upon the observations of von Doussa J in O Keefe v Comcare   FCA   and of Mansfield J in Comcare v Moon   FCA         ALD   at     consistent with the

v Comcare Australia     ALD    Burchett J at   there observed    The obligation to furnish reasons  and to furnish reasons which are adequate  is a very important obligation  It is a pillar of the system of administrative decision making by the Tribunal  and it is essential that the Court should insist on its fulfilment  But it is the substance of the obligation that matters   Indeed  as Lord Sumner pointed out in SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack   AC   at   even a Judge s reasons on a question of fact will not be vitiated by  imperfections in form and expression   Section   is not to be construed in a pedantic spirit  but sensibly  If the Tribunal s reasons exposed the logic of its decision  and contain findings on those matters of fact which are essential to that logic  it will not be easy to demonstrate a failure of compliance with the requirement to include  findings on material questions of fact     Emphasis added On reviewing     of the Tribunal s reasons  one can discern two fundamental conclusions or findings on material questions of fact or mixed fact and law    The finding at   that the Tribunal did not accept  that the current condition suffered by Mrs Sagigi was a result of her employment      The finding at   that the Tribunal  simply cannot make a finding that there was any relevant impairment or permanent impairment on the evidence before  it  and the similar finding at   that the Tribunal  cannot find that she has any permanent impairment relevantly under Table      The conclusion or finding in   above is supported by reference to the following process of reasoning    Inconsistencies in the evidence of the applicant in the Tribunal and the histories given to the various doctors  at   and       The evidence of Dr McGill  that the back condition may be related to other factors or an underlying degenerative condition   at       That Dr McGill s evidence was  more plausible  given that he has seen this patient on three occasions  whereas Dr Berry and Dr Bodel have only seen her on two occasions   at   to which I would add  on three occasions over seven years  not five years as referred to at   of the Tribunal s reasons consideredHousing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co     NSWLR  A standard of perfection is not required  It is sufficient if the basis of the decision is apparent  and one can reasonably understand or discern why the decision was reached  In Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co     NSWLR   at   Hutley JA  with whom Samuels JA agreed  said    The extent to which a court must go in giving reasons is incapable of precise definition  A court must not nullify rights of appeal by giving no or nominal reasons  but there is no duty to expound reasons so as to facilitate appeals  This applies particularly to the situation where a judge has to decide between conflicting witnesses  including experts  The choice between conflicting experts may have to be a matter of judgment  not of detailed reasoning referred toO Keefe v Comcare   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlDuring the course of the hearing  counsel for the applicant submitted
