Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong  No     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere is but one directly applicable authority in respect of the Spam Act and the imposition of penalties under that Act  That is a judgment delivered by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Clarity   One finds  with respect  in his Honour s judgment in Clarity  a very helpful collation indeed of relevant principle  It is apparent from Clarity  that Nicholson J was of the opinion that assistance was to be derived in terms of principle from judgments delivered in respect of civil penalties imposed under the Trade Practices Act   I respectfully agree with this approach  To that end  the following general principles are pertinent  the size of the contravening company  the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it occurred  whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management in a corporation or at a lower level  whether the corporation has a culture conducive to compliance with the Act  as  for example  evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures which are taken institutionally in response to an acknowledged contravention  whether the respondent  be it corporate or individual  has cooperated with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention   and this may be part of the size of the corporation  where it is a corporate respondent  the financial position of the contravener and its  his or her capacity to pay  the deterrent effect  both specific and general  of the proposed penalty  the totality principle  and parity and  I think  also relativity of penalty  with other respondents  having regard to individual circumstances of involvement in a contravention  There are other statements in authorities under the Trade Practices Act which are  in my opinion  germane in relation to the imposition of penalty in respect of Spam Act prosecutions  There is no evidence before me in relation to capacity to pay in respect of any of the Respondents  The Authority submits that an approach evident in Nicholson J s judgment in relation to capacity to pay in Clarity  is apposite in the circumstances of this case  His Honour stated at para       Also I accept that the issue of capacity to pay is  although a relevant factor  of less relevance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence  His Honour then makes reference in that regard to Leahy Petroleum  No    Deterrent Effect of the Proposed Penalty I have already made reference to a particular importance in general deterrence in the imposition of penalty in respect of contraventions of this Act  It may be noted that Parliament itself has  in a sense  capped daily maximum penalties so as to avoid what one might regard as exponential and thus unrealistically large penalties for multiple contraventions  That said  Parliament has  nonetheless  provided for penalties which accrue  at least on a daily basis  which are significant penalties  In this case  the Authority seeks penalties which are not particularly large  having regard to theoretical maximums  but are large having regard to totality  but not so large as to offend that principle  The totality principle requires that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved  So far as penalty is concerned  the Authority submits that penalties should fall within the following ranges The Authority submits that  though these penalty ranges are substantial  they do not violate the totality principle  They represent a relatively small proportion of the theoretical legislatively derived maximum amounts in the circumstances of these contraventions  So far as the corporate Respondents are concerned  they are in the order of   to   of theoretical maximums  I agree with this particular submission so far as the application of the totality principle is concerned  Parity and Relativity The proposed penalty ranges do  in my opinion  reflect appropriate parity and relativities  This might be highlighted in the following way  As between Mobilegate and Winning Bid  Mobilegate s conduct covered a longer period    days as opposed to   days  Next  as between individual Respondents  Messrs Owen and Salcedo had a higher level  and a significantly higher level  of authority in the management and control of the corporations than did Mr Maughan  Nonetheless  each of the individual Respondents was involved for over   individual days of contraventions  Mr Maughan s subordination is recognised by the penalty range submitted for him being in the order of     to     of that submitted as apt in respect of Messrs Owen and Salcedo citedAustralian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThese reasons for judgment should be read in conjunction with those which I delivered on   August   see Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong  No    FCA    Pursuant to the directions given on   August   the Australian Communications and Media Authority  the Authority  as Applicant  served upon the Respondents  which and whom I have mentioned  written submissions together with affidavits to be relied upon in respect of penalty or otherwise identified affidavits in respect of which reliance was to be placed  For their part none of the named Respondents has chosen to appear today  That  of course  is their perfect right  One of them  Mr Salcedo  did  though  choose to correspond with the Registry of the Court  He did this by a letter dated   September   received by the Registry that day  That letter now forms part of exhibit    A subsequent exchange of correspondence occurred as between the Registry and Mr Salcedo on the subject of whether it was his intention that the letter stand as his submissions in relation to the penalty hearing followedJ McPhee and Son  Australia  Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThus  under the Trade Practices Act   it is relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the Act was systematic  deliberate or covert  see J McPhee and Son  Australia  Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         ALR   at      In this case  the contravening conduct might aptly be described by each of those adjectives  In other words  it was systematic  it was deliberate and  materially  covert in terms of the ability of those mobile phone users preyed upon to ascertain readily the identity of their predator if they were disposed to seek recourse to the courts to recover moneys lost  I shall elaborate a little further on that aspect in a moment followedTrade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAgain  in terms of Trade Practices Act authorities  there is useful guidance on the role of both specific and general deterrence in the imposition of penalties  In Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd   FCA         FCR   at pages   to   Toohey J  then a judge of this Court  remarked      The penalty should be such as to deter not only the particular offender but others who may be disposed to engage in prohibited conduct of a similar kind  That  in my opinion  is a particularly weighty consideration in relation to Spam Act contraventions  This case discloses on the evidence that while it is possible for a regulatory authority  through diligent investigation  to detect not only those corporations but those individuals involved in contraventions  the task is not an easy or an inexpensive one  It consumes public resources which might otherwise usefully be deployed to other ends  That being so  penalties in respect of contraventions must be such as to deter the unscrupulous from taking a calculated business risk  In other words  in my opinion  penalties must be of such an order that having regard to particular gains which might be involved  it is in effect commercial suicide to seek those gains via contraventions of the Spam Act   Sentiments such as these are evident in prior authority followedNW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   at pages   to    NW Frozen Foods  a Full Court opined      The court should not leave room for any impression of weakness in its resolve to impose penalties sufficient to ensure the deterrence  not only of the parties actually before it  but also of others who might be tempted to think that contravention would pay    followedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd   ATPR    To like effect is the following observation of Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd   ATPR     at       The penalty must be sufficiently high that a business  acting rationally and in its own best interest  will not be prepared to treat the risk of such a penalty as a business cost followedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd  No     FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOf course  a penalty should not be so high as to be oppressive  but it is important in this regard to recall exactly what is meant by that sentiment  That was  with respect  aptly and accurately stated by Merkel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd  No     FCA         ALR    Leahy Petroleum  No   at para   as follows   and this is a reference to observations made by Smithers J in a case  Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws  Australia  Pty Ltd   ATPR       which had been referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods      I therefore respectfully agree with the observation of Smithers J  referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods  to the effect that  a penalty that is of no greater than is necessary to achieve the object of general deterrence  will not be oppressive citedTrade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws  Australia  Pty

cases of the kind encountered in the State criminal courts where  by reference to a high volume of analogous criminal conduct  it is possible to set  and then for sentencing judges to have regard to  particular benchmarks derived from guidance given by a Court of Appeal  I have already referred to theoretical maximums that one might derive in respect of the corporate Respondents  and to the ability to make an estimation of theoretical maximums in respect of individuals  In Markarian v The Queen   HCA         CLR   Gleeson CJ and Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ  in relation to maximum sentences said at       Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities  Judges need sentencing yardsticks  It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance  In their book Sentencing   Stockdale and Devlin observe that             A maximum sentence fixed by parliament may have little relevance in a given case  either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century     or because it has more recently been set at a high catch all level     At other times the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties                   A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful  where it is thought that parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate   And then at       It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required  first  because the legislature has legislated for them  secondly  because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time  and thirdly  because in that regard they do provide  taken and balanced with all the other relevant factors  a yardstick  I turn to look at particular factors designated in s   as relevant  Obviously enough  these factors are measured against the matters pleaded in the statement of claim  and the evidence upon which the Authority seeks to rely and of which notice has been given to the particular Respondents  in particular  affidavits of Mr Weber  filed on   May    May  and   May    Nature and Extent of ContraventionsconsideredWood v Dancertext Pty Ltd   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlIt is relevant to note that Mr Owen was the sole director of IMP when that company was the subject of an infringement notice issued by the authority pursuant to the Spam Act   It is also relevant to note that Mr Owen was an individual respondent in proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court against a company  Dancertext  and him  see Wood v Dancertext Pty Ltd   FMCA    Dancertext   The conduct described in the reasons for judgment of Raphael FM bears particular comparison with the subject of the present proceedings  Mr Salcedo Mr Salcedo was the manager of IMP from June   to May    He was the manager of Winning Bid from April   and the manager of Mobilegate from August   to April    There is also a basis for regarding him  de facto  as a director of Mobilegate even prior to his taking up that position in April    In June   Mr Salcedo corresponded with the Authority on behalf of IMP in relation to complaints which came to form the basis of the infringement notice to which I have referred already
