Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   the Court held that a Tribunal is not obliged to put to an applicant its own appraisals of the applicant s evidence unless they are not an obvious and

indicate a relevant piece of apparently adverse evidence for comment obviously depends upon the importance that may be attached to that evidence and whether the importance was so obvious that it did not need to be underlined  In a body proceeding by inquisitorial methods  procedural fairness may require bringing the attention of the applicant to critical facts that appear to contradict  or cast doubt on  his or her claim  Where an observation about an applicant s case is one that is obvious and natural to the circumstances that evoked it  it is usually unnecessary for it to be specifically

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Epeabaka   HCA         CLR   at   per Kirby J appliedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte S      ALR   The findings of the Tribunal in relation to the summons and verdict documents were available to it on the basis of the comprehensive findings it had made concerning its lack of satisfaction of the appellant s credibility and the truthfulness of his claims  The High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte S      ALR   at   per Gleeson CJ said    It is not necessarily irrational  or illogical  for a finder of fact  who is convinced that a principal witness is fabricating a story  which is considered to be inherently implausible  to reject corroborative evidence  even though there is no separate or independent ground for its rejection  apart from the reasons given for disbelieving the principal witness   The fact that the Tribunal stated that it did not give weight to the documents   based on the findings above   that is  the Tribunal s findings as to the lack of credibility of the appellant  does not constitute jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal  Accordingly the Court dismisses this submission   The Court can find no error in the decision of the Tribunal nor of Turner FM and accordingly the appeal is dismissed citedRe Refugee

a running commentary of its reasons  see SZBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at      In SZBEL   HCA       ALR   the High Court observed of s   of the Act  at     It is also important to recognise that the invitation to an applicant to appear before the tribunal to give evidence and make submissions is an invitation that need not be extended if the tribunal considers that it should decide the review in the applicant s favour  Ordinarily then  as was the case here  the tribunal will begin its interview of an applicant who has accepted the tribunal s invitation to appear  knowing that it is not persuaded by the material already before it to decide the review in the applicant s favour  That lack of persuasion may be based on particular questions the tribunal has about specific aspects of the material already before it  it may be based on nothing more particular than a general unease about the veracity of what is revealed in that material  But unless the tribunal tells the applicant something different  the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision   The appellant was put on notice of the issues for determination at the Tribunal hearing as demonstrated  inter alia  by the following passages from the Tribunal s decision    I told him that I understood that it was easy to get official looking documents in China which were not genuine so that I would have regard to that when I was considering whether to accept that these documents were what they were purported to be   The Tribunal s decision also reveals that the appellant did not experience difficulties in understanding the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing and it specifically noted that the appellant        gave oral evidence with the assistance of a suitably accredited interpreter  He said that he had no difficulty understanding the interpreter and no objection to using her services during the hearing   Later  referring to the appellant s claim that his assistant in running the underground church was arrested  the Tribunal said    I told him that I was finding his evidence about her role very vague and asked him again what precisely she did when she took over the management of the orders for the paper  He responded that she was also a leader  He added nothing more referred toSZCOQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In his written submissions  the appellant referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SZCOQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   in support of his contention that the Tribunal had disregarded the summons and verdict documents that he had provided to the Tribunal  and that the Tribunal had not provided the appellant with an opportunity to comment on issues arising from the documentary evidence he had provided  in breach of s  A  of the Act   Turner FM dismissed the appellant s claim that the Tribunal had breached s  A  of the Act for two reasons  Firstly  the Tribunal had relied on its own subjective appraisals of the claims and evidence advanced by the appellant and this did not constitute   information  within the meaning of the Act  Secondly the independent country information relied upon by the Tribunal in its finding that the supporting documents provided by the appellant were not a reliable source of evidence  fell within the exception to s  A  in s  A b  of the Act   It is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that it had relied on its subjective appraisal of the evidence given by the appellant in its finding that the appellant s claims were not credible  The Tribunal considered the appellant s evidence to be vague  lacking in detail and cogency and that his claims were implausible  It concluded that the appellant was not being truthful with respect to his claims
