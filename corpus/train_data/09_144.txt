SZJLN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAttorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere is no merit in a challenge which would seek to overturn the Federal Magistrate s decision on the basis that the Tribunal s reasons were unreasonable and that the Federal Magistrates Court should have so found  It is important to recall  and the Appellant s submissions both written and oral as is frequently the case do not  and did not  evidence this  that it is no part of the role of the judiciary  either in the Federal Magistrates Court or on this Court  to engage in the making of value judgments or fact finding in relation to whether or not one is satisfied in terms of the Act that there is a claim for a protection visa  To do so is to violate the role consigned to the judiciary and to ignore the counsel provided by Brennan J  as his Honour was  in Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR   at   about a threat to the legitimacy of judicial review by descending into matters that are consigned by the legislature to the value judgment of either the Minister  his delegates or the Tribunal  For these reasons then the appeal must be dismissed    I certify that the preceding twenty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOne sees in those written submissions what  in substance  is a challenge to the credibility findings made by the Tribunal  Such findings are uniquely   par excellence  as McHugh J stated in Re Minister for Immigration  Ex parte Duraraijasingham   HCA         ALR   at para   matters for the Tribunal  When one reads the Tribunal s reasons those findings are logical and reasonable  reasonable in the sense that they are made upon a basis that is readily discernible from the findings of fact the Tribunal chose to make on the material that it had before it appliedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSection  B of the Migration Act provides that the provisions found within Div   of Pt   are an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule  Those provisions include s  A  In this instance it is at least arguable  having regard to the High Court s decision in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR     that the Tribunal went beyond the obligation imposed on it by s  A of the Act  I make that observation because it is possible to regard the letter which the Tribunal sent as disclosing the thought processes of the Tribunal  Be this as it may  it is certainly not a basis for a jurisdictional error case that the Tribunal exceeded the obligation imposed on it by s  A  This otherwise is a case where there is no basis for concluding that the Federal Magistrates Court was in error insofar as any jurisdictional error in relation to s  A is concerned  The first ground of appeal has about it a generality such that when one departs from an apprehension that lying behind it might be a s  A based challenge  one is in the area of speculation  Having regard to the way in which the argument developed this morning it seems to me that the procedural fairness challenge may well be on the basis of a failure to take into account the translated document  exhibit    The Federal Magistrate dealt in what  in my opinion  is an unexceptional way with a challenge of that kind as the learned Federal Magistrate apprehended it  The short point is that the Appellants were given an opportunity to submit a translated document  It is just that  for whatever reason  that opportunity was not availed of  As it happens  the essence of the document  as the learned Federal Magistrate notes  is no different to a finding made in the male Appellant s favour  namely  membership of Shiv Sena in   citedSZGHS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe second of the grounds of appeal  insofar as it goes beyond procedural fairness  is not only a ground which does not appear to have been a basis of challenge before the Federal Magistrates Court  but also  in any event  a ground which would not warrant leave to advance it in this appeal  The Tribunal  in the passage from which I have quoted  looked to and made an express finding in respect of the foreseeable future in the event of a return to India  In this regard  the Tribunal referred to findings it had already made  It suffices to note that those findings were based on a preference of independent country information as to an absence of a particular threat of prosecution  There is  in the Tribunal s reasons in this case  no error of the kind described by Allsop J  as his Honour then was  in SZGHS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at paras     and    What I have stated is sufficient to dispose of the appeal in respect of the grounds stated in the notice of appeal  Neither has any merit  On behalf of the Minister the course was taken  very properly  to engage with submissions advanced in the Appellant s written submissions  which did not find their way into the notice of appeal
