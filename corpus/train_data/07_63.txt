SZIFI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSZIFI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  In this appeal  the Appellant contends that Federal Magistrate Barnes erred in dismissing   SZIFI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   Anor   FMCA   on   August   an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  delivered on   January   affirming a decision of the Minister s Delegate refusing the Appellant s application for a protection visa   The grounds of appeal recited in the notice of appeal filed on   August   are these     GROUNDS     That the Learned Federal Magistrate Barnes did not went in to the question of law and facts  The respondents are showing the appellant as a citizen of Indonesia whereas the appellant hails from different country  The respondents also erred in to question of law as to the persecution and well founded fear of life  This has led to the grave miscarriage of justice      ORDERS SOUGHT     The judgment and the order made by the Federal Magistrate Court may kindly be set aside  The applicant be allowed to remain in Australia til the decision of the review before this Honourable Court    The background facts are these   The Appellant is a married Punjabi man born on   July   in Sialkot  Pakistan  He is therefore a national of the State of Pakistan   The Appellant arrived in Australia on   September    On   September   the Appellant lodged an Application for a Protection  Class XA  Visa with the First Respondent  On   October   a Delegate of the First Respondent refused the Appellant s application  On   November   the Appellant sought review of that decision before the Tribunal  The Appellant contends that he holds a well founded fear of persecution for the political opinions he holds and articulates concerning the need for a restoration of democracy in the State of Pakistan and that he is unwilling to return to Pakistan owing to such fear  Accordingly  the Appellant contends that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugee s Convention as amended by the Refugee s Protocol     Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and   Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees   for the purposes of s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act    The Appellant s contentions in support of the application for a protection visa are these         a  The Appellant is a Sunni Muslim  The Appellant has had the benefit of seven years of education  speaks  reads and writes the Urdu and English languages  was a self employed salesman from   to   has a wife  son and daughter resident in Pakistan  and elected to leave Pakistan lawfully without any difficulty in obtaining travel documentation     b  The Appellant was a member of the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz Group  the M L N G   In documentation lodged in support of the application for a protection visa  the Appellant said that the M L N G was able to secure the maximum seats from the district of Sialkot in both the upper house and the lower house in elections prior to the civil governance of Pakistan by the military  The Appellant contends that he  suffered  due to developing tension between the M L N G and the Pakistan People s Party     c  After the assumption of power by the military  leaders of the M L N G in Sialkot formed a movement for the restoration of democracy  The Appellant was a  front line worker  for the M L N G  participated in processions  and distributed flyers and other literature critical of corruption on the part of military generals    d  The Appellant contends that the army  blackmailed  some of the leaders of the M L N G to join the governing regime  The Appellant says he knows some of these persons as the Appellant was the most senior party worker in the M L N G in Sialkot  As a result  the Appellant was persecuted by the leaders of the military governance group and by the military secret service     e  The Appellant says that he was taken to a police station and assaulted by the police at the instigation of military authorities  The Appellant was told by the authorities that he should not demonstrate against the military governance group and if he did not comply with these demands  false charges would be brought against him as a result of which he would be declared a terrorist and then executed    f  The Appellant contends that he is an activist struggling for the development of a democratic movement in Pakistan  that he was able to obtain a visa through an agent in order to leave Pakistan  and that if he returns to Pakistan he will ultimately be executed because of the opinions he holds and his prior pro democracy activity   Notwithstanding these contentions  the Minister s Delegate rejected the Appellant s application for a protection visa quotedPlaintiff S  v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to these matters  Federal Magistrate Barnes said this at paragraphs     and   of the Reasons for Judgment          The finding that it  the Tribunal  made was that it was not able to be satisfied that the events complained of by the applicant had occurred given the limited particulars and the unsubstantiated assertions  On that basis  the Tribunal was unable to be satisfied that the applicant was at risk of being involved in false cases  declared a terrorist or killed as he had claimed  or that he had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  It is not apparent from the claims set out in the protection visa application  which is the only place in which the applicant made such claims  that the Tribunal failed to properly consider the applicant s claims in the manner contended for by him  Insofar as he seeks merits review  merits review is not available in this court         There is one issue that might be said to be raised by this ground that needs to be addressed  That is the fact that at the commencement of its findings and reasons the Tribunal found that the applicant was a national of  Indonesia  and later in its reasons for decision it found that it was not satisfied on the evidence before it that the applicant faced a real chance of persecution should he return to the  PRC  now or in the foreseeable future  There is absolutely nothing in the material in the protection visa application  the decision of the delegate or the application for review to suggest that the applicant made any claim to be associated in any way with either Indonesia or the PRC  which I take to be a reference to the People s Republic of China      Such sloppy references may well be a typographical error or the result of a use of a precedent  The issue is whether they amount to a jurisdictional error                    In these circumstances  while the Tribunal has clearly made a factual error in referring to Indonesia and the PRC in its reasons for decision  I consider that such factual error is not such as to amount to a jurisdictional error  that the Tribunal has understood the applicant s claims and assessed those claims despite the unfortunate reference to the wrong country on two occasions   The written submissions for the respondent cited authority to suggest that in circumstances where the Tribunal accurately recorded the applicant s claims and referred to his correct  Pakistani  nationality on numerous occasions  such a typing error or computer error was clearly irrelevant   See SZFHM v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FMCA    While such error does not establish jurisdictional error  it is clearly a matter of concern  particularly where it has occurred on more than one occasion in the same decision  However  reading the Tribunal decision fairly and as a whole and with an eye not too finely attuned to error  see Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   it is not apparent that the Tribunal failed to understand or consider the applicant s claims or otherwise erred in a manner constituting jurisdictional error            emphasis added  The First Respondent supports the Reasons of the Federal Magistrate on the footing that although the Tribunal made a number of references to incorrect considerations  the Decision Record of the Tribunal demonstrates that the Tribunal member took into account the substratum of fact put before the First Respondent by the Appellant in support of the application for a protection visa and determined that having regard to the contentions said to give rise to a well founded fear of persecution  the Tribunal was unable to be satisfied that the Appellant was in danger of being implicated in false cases  declared a terrorist and executed at the hands of the authorities  should he return to his country of nationality  Accordingly  having regard to the totality of the Reasons  the First Respondent says that it can be seen that the Tribunal member directed his mind to all the relevant matters and that the Tribunal engaged in a bona fide analysis of the factual matters in an attempt to exercise the statutory power   The First Respondent says that to the extent that there was an error  it was an error within jurisdiction   A question then arises as to whether these failures are jurisdictional failures in which event the decision of the Tribunal is not a decision made  under the Act  and not within the scope of the protection of the privative clause provisions of the Act   Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     The respondent contends that the Tribunal so acted and did not misdirect itself as to the exercise of the power  as the analysis of the facts reveals a consideration of all the circumstances and claims made by the Appellant  However  importantly  an assumption that the Tribunal acted in the way described by Sir Owen Dixon does not qualify the power of the Tribunal and render within power that which is not  Rather  those considerations might qualify  properly construed in the context of the Act overall  the protection and reach of the privative clause   Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth  supra  per Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ     A proper construction of the imperative objective of the Act of a  fair review  and the statutory direction to the Tribunal to exercise the review jurisdiction according to the  substantial justice of the case    of these Reasons  suggests that a jurisdictional limitation upon the relevant decision making power includes both a failure to act fairly and the taking into account erroneous matters  in the course of the analytical process of considering those facts  circumstances and conditions appropriate to the Appellant s claim  Since such failures go to the valid exercise of the power  the proper construction of  Division   Privative clause   s   of the Act having regard to the legislative instrument overall is that the section does not protect the identified failures of the Tribunal

obverse of the notion Sir Owen Dixon had in mind in R v Hickman  Ex parte Fox and Clinton   HCA         CLR   at p   when Sir Owen Dixon observed that invalidity is to be determined as a question of interpretation of the entire legislative instrument in assessing whether steps taken by the administrative tribunal transgress the limits of the instrument  That assessment takes into account whether

obligation to provide procedural fairness  as a function of the proper construction of the legislation itself quotedSDAV v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   The idea that there may be  degrees  of error on the part of an administrative tribunal or that jurisdictional error is to be found in characterising the error of the Tribunal as a  manifest  defect or an  obvious  or an  incontrovertibly  plain error  has become descriptive of the conclusions   SDAV v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at     courts reach in the exercise of supervisory review in determining whether an administrative decision is  an abuse of discretion  and thus ultra vires   At paragraph   of Plaintiff S  v The Commonwealth  supra  Chief Justice Gleeson said this     The concept of  manifest  defect in jurisdiction or  manifest fraud  has entered into the taxonomy of error in this field of discourse  The idea that there are degrees of error  or that obviousness should make a difference between one kind of fraud and another  is not always easy to grasp  But it plays a significant part in other forms of judicial review  For example  the principles according to which a court of appeal may interfere with a primary judge s findings of fact  or exercise of discretion  are expressed in terms such as  palpably misused  an  advantage   glaringly improbable   inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established  and  plainly unjust       Unless adjectives such as  palpable   incontrovertible   plain  or  manifest  are used only for rhetorical effect  then in the context of review of decision making  whether judicial or administrative  they convey an idea that there are degrees of strictness of scrutiny to which decisions may be subjected  Such an idea is influential in ordinary appellate judicial review  and it is hardly surprising to see it engaged in the related area of judicial review of administrative action    In SDAV v Minister for Immigration  supra  Hill  Branson and Stone JJ  observed      The statement that a particular error is a  jurisdictional error  is a statement of conclusion  The conclusion is that  be the error one of omission or commission  some essential or indispensable requirement for jurisdiction has not been met  An imperative duty has not been discharged or some inviolable limitation has been breached and therefore the action or decision is null and void  Plaintiff S  at   per Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  The error may be easy to detect  manifest error  or more difficult but  either way  an action or decision is either one which falls within the decision maker s lawful authority or it is not  If it falls within the decision maker s lawful authority then the error is made  within jurisdiction   If it does not fall within the decision maker s lawful authority then the error is a  jurisdictional error  and as such it cannot be a valid action or decision
