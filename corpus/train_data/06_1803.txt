Multicultural Affairs     FCR   and Hamilton v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   followedPlaintiff S  v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Plaintiff S  v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     Gleeson CJ referred to privative clauses as those clauses which deprive  or purport to deprive  courts of jurisdiction to review the acts of public officials or tribunals in order to enforce compliance with the law  or which limit  or purport to limit  such jurisdiction  Section   is not a provision which makes a decision final and conclusive such that it may not be challenged  appealed against  reviewed or called into question in any court  It contemplates a challenge and provides a challenge to be made in a timely way  Section     which was the subject of consideration in S    attempted to exclude a challenge in clear terms  It is evident that s   does not purport to preclude judicial review but imposes a limitation on the time for initiating that review  In these circumstances  I do not consider there is any substance in the submission that s   gives rise to a privative clause which is invalid or unconstitutional  In my view  it is appropriate to construe clauses fixing time limits with due regard to the necessity to ensure that courts are able to properly exercise their jurisdiction in a timely manner   Further submissions were made by counsel for the applicants regarding the desirability of having uniform extendable time limits for appeal and review of administrative decisions  as referred to in the Second Reading Speech for the Migration Litigation Reform Bill   presented in March    It is said that the purpose of s   is to avoid the potential unfairness of the strict   day time limit while ensuring timely handling of the application  In my view  the section does have the effect of extending the time limit and is a provision favourable to an applicant   I do not consider that there is anything incongruous  capricious or unreasonable in the application of s   in the circumstances of the present case  Accordingly  I do not accept the submission that the clear language of s   can or should be read down on the basis that it produces such results   Accordingly  for the above reasons  I am not persuaded that there has been any error demonstrated in the judgment of the Federal Magistrate and I dismiss this application with costs   I certify that the preceding seventeen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice
