Indigenous Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The appellant is a citizen of India and a Christian  He applied for a protection visa alleging a well founded fear of persecution on the ground that the Indian authorities would be unable to provide him with effective protection against Hindu extremists  His application was refused by a delegate of the Minister and on review by the Refugee Review Tribunal  An application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed by Hartnett FM  VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA     The appellant submits that the Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error because    there was no evidence to support a critical finding of fact by the Tribunal  and    having expressed doubt about some of its findings  the Tribunal did not proceed to consider the consequences if it were wrong   The appellant also sought leave to raise

claims appliedAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  To succeed on the  no evidence  ground the appellant would have to show that there was no evidence at all upon which the finding could have been based  Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at    Thus the question is not whether the court on judicial review would have reached the same finding on conflicting evidence  There was in the present case some evidence to support the finding  as properly understood   The finding complained of must be identified accurately  In the present case the appellant s argument rests upon a misreading of the finding in question  India is a vast country  The Tribunal could not be reasonably taken as saying that it was satisfied that literally in every instance of attacks against religious minorities police across India have always taken action to respond  Viewed in context  the point the Tribunal is making is that while there is some protection generally in India against attacks against religious minorities  the position in Tamil Nadu  where the appellant comes from  is more favourable

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at      http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In M    FCA   Gray J had to deal  amongst other things  with an argument that the Tribunal had wrongly relied on the use by the applicant of his Sri Lankan passport on several occasions in leaving that country  the inference being that because the Sri Lankan authorities had not confiscated it they had no interest in him  His Honour held  at   that the Magistrate was wrong in finding that the provision of the passport as part of the original application for a protection visa was sufficient to exclude the operation of s  A   However  in his Honour s view that was not the end of the matter  He held  at   that because  by means of the written submission of his counsel to the Tribunal  the appellant replied expressly on the terms of his protection visa application he thereby invited reference to the copy passport which was attached to his application form  There could be little doubt that the appellant intended that the Tribunal should look at this material  His Honour said     In my view  he thereby provided the passport  and the information to be derived from it  to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application for review  This was sufficient for the appellant to have been taken to give the information contained in the copy passport to the Tribunal for the purpose of his application for review  and therefore for that information to fall within s  A b  of the Migration Act    In NAZY   FCA   the appellant had made a certain statement in answer to a question in his protection visa application form  The Tribunal in the course of the hearing referred to an inconsistency between the answer to that question and the appellant s oral evidence before the Tribunal as one of the reasons for rejecting his claim  The inconsistency was put orally to the appellant in the course of the hearing  Jacobson J held that s  A  was not complied with  It was put to his Honour that Al Shamry was distinguishable because the appellant had referred to the protection visa application form when asked about it by the Tribunal and said that the information in it was true and correct  Counsel for the Minister relied on Gray J s decision in M    It would seem that Jacobson J did not regard Gray J s decision in M  as wrong  Rather  that case was to be distinguished on the basis that there the appellant had expressly adopted and put forward as part of his application to the Tribunal the earlier information whereas in NAZY the appellant had adopted the earlier information in answer to a question from the Tribunal   M  was not mentioned in SZEEU   Implicitly the members of the Full Court accepted that Jacobson J was correct in treating M  rightly decided  but distinguishable   In another of the cases dealt with in SZEEU   the case of SZDXA   the relevant information was that the appellant had entered Australia on a business visa  The Tribunal originally came to know this from another source but as Moore J said at          it is tolerably clear from the Tribunal s reasons that it discussed this fact     with the appellant and he affirmed he had  Thus it was information comprehended by s  A b  even though it was information also derived from an alternative source   The distinction between this case and SZBMI  see     above  was not explained   In dealing with the same case Weinberg J said at            if an applicant makes a statement during the course of an airport interview that is inconsistent with later evidence given at a hearing  s  A  requires that written notice be given of the possible use of that statement to draw inferences against the applicant  If  however  the applicant repeats the earlier statement at some stage during the course of the hearing  and adopts it as true  and then subsequently resiles from that statement  the Tribunal is not obliged to afford the applicant an opportunity to comment upon the discrepancy  see generally SZEFM   FCA   per Bennett J  This is because the adoption of the earlier statement brings it within the scope of the s  A b  exception  If  however  the Tribunal proposes to use the earlier statement as the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review rather than the later adoption  it must comply with s  A   discussedNAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In NAZY   FCA   the appellant had made a certain statement in answer to a question in his protection visa application form  The Tribunal in the course of the hearing referred to an inconsistency between the answer to that question and the appellant s oral evidence before

on the basis that there the appellant had expressly adopted and put forward as part of his application to the Tribunal the earlier information whereas in NAZY the appellant had adopted the earlier information in answer to a question from the Tribunal   Moore J  at   did not accept that  by adopting the statement at the hearing before the Tribunal the flight information was transformed into information provided by the appellant in his application review   His Honour went on to say     If the Tribunal comes to know of what was said by an applicant at a point before any application for review was made  and views what was said at that time as material to its assessment of what was later said by an applicant  then the mere adoption of the earlier statement during the review process would not result in the knowledge  and relevantly information in the present appeal  being comprehended by s  A b   Different considerations could arise if it was clear the Tribunal treated only the adoption of the earlier statement as the fact relevant to its consideration of the application in the review  In those circumstances the fact of adoption would almost certainly constitute information provided by the applicant in the application on which the exclusion would operate  However  it cannot be said  in this case  that the Tribunal acted in such a way    His Honour said that NAZY was correct  His Honour did not further explain the distinction between mere adoption and the fact of the adoption  I am not sure that I understand it   Weinberg J said  at      The adoption of the earlier statement by the appellant during the hearing before the Tribunal did not render it information provided by him in his application for review   Allsop J  at   agreed with Moore J that the flight information was  information  within the meaning of s  A  but held  contrary to Moore and Weinberg JJ  that such information was part of the reason for affirming the decision  His Honour did

 the Tribunal relied in part on the absence of certain information from the applicant s protection visa application  which was referred to before the Tribunal  Graham J noted that the appellant s migration agent sent to the Tribunal a   page fax which included a statutory declaration made by him in the course of his application for a protection visa  His Honour said at   that the  inescapable conclusion  was that all of the information contained in the fax  which constituted the application for review as submitted to the Tribunal by the appellant s agent  constituted information that the appellant gave for the purpose of the application within the meaning of s  A b   His Honour referred to the statements already mentioned from SZEEU and  at   distinguished the case before him saying

Tribunal had relied on the appellant s educational history in India and in Australia as a basis for its finding as to the reasonableness of relocation within India  The appellant conceded that at the hearing before the Tribunal he had done more than simply adopt information concerning his education in Australia  in response to the Tribunal s questioning he had actively given details of his education in this country  However  he argued that answers regarding his education in India were in response to leading questions from the Tribunal where in effect he was asked to do no more than confirm the details in his original visa application   Kenny J found that the appellant specifically provided the Tribunal with his Indian education details  Her Honour  at   rejected the submission that the information did not fall within s  A b  because it was given in response to questions in the nature of cross examination  The Tribunal s questions  were specific and arose  naturally enough  from the appellant s visa application   Her Honour considered that SZEEU supported the proposition that where an applicant affirms a specific fact before the Tribunal that information will be covered by s  A b    even if it came from another source  Her Honour found  at   that the appellant did not  merely adopt  the education information in his visa application  At the Tribunal hearing he  separately and specifically  gave detailed information about his Indian education   For no apparent reason  almost all the discussion of s  A b  in the cases proceeds on the basis that the provision uses the word  provide   The subsection in fact uses the verb  to give  which simply conveys the notion of delivering or handing over  Shorter Oxford English Dictionary   If this matter were free from authority  there would be much to be said for the view that an applicant  gave  information for the purpose of the Tribunal review application if the information was delivered to the Tribunal by the applicant  whether in answer to a question asked by the Tribunal or whether volunteered  Either way  the information is conveyed from applicant to Tribunal  If we were to read or hear  At the trial  A gave information about fact X to the court  we would take that as equally comprehending the possibility of A giving evidence about X in chief  or in cross examination  or in answer to a question from the judge   Likewise  if an applicant says to the Tribunal  What I said in my visa application is true  and that application contains fact X  the normal meaning conveyed would be that the applicant is giving the information constituted by fact X to the Tribunal  as well as the further fact that fact X had been asserted by the applicant when he made the visa application   In any event  in the
