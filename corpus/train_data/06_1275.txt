SZHCN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toNATL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlAfter extracting the text of s  A  of the Act  Smith FM thereafter referred to NATL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     where a Full Federal Court  Ryan  Finkelstein and Downes JJ  pointed out that the reference in s  A to  particulars of any information    does not require the provision of evidence    and further that  t  he test is whether an applicant is fairly informed of the information considered to be adverse    Upon that basis  his Honour observed     i  n some cases  the objects of the section might only be able to be met by the actual provision of a copy of the source documents for the Tribunal s information  For example  where the Tribunal proposes to draw information from the appearance of a document which can not adequately be described in particulars   His Honour then went on to observe that the      s  A letter sufficiently identified particulars of the information gained from the Moscow Embassy  which was then used in its reasons      The   gist   of that information obtained by the Tribunal  as so described by his Honour       comprised details of a claimed employment  the fact that letters had been given to the Embassy in corroboration of that employment  and that Embassy staff  had confirmed with the rector of the institute the claimed employment and position    His Honour concluded that the letter      sufficiently identified the potential relevance of that information  being that it was inconsistent with the factual claims of the  appellant  to the Tribunal as to his employment in Armenia and that he was in hiding    and that as further stated in that letter in conclusion  those  inconsistencies have the potential to cast doubt on the credibility of your claims to have had problems with the Armenian authorities for political reasons    His Honour therefore concluded that  I am therefore not satisfied that the Tribunal was in breach of its obligations under s  A    citedWin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlSmith FM then addressed what he described as      the situation more broadly from the perspective of    procedural fairness  and assuming that these are capable of surviving notwithstanding the presence of s  B of the  Migration  Act  and held that he was      not persuaded that any failure of procedural fairness occurred in this case  or  i  n particular    that there was any obligation on the Tribunal to provide copies of the source of its information in the absence of any request by or on behalf of the  appellant   His Honour observed further that  w  ithin the  appellant s  submissions is a contention that the Tribunal was obliged to make further inquires as to the true position concerning the  appellant s  academic qualifications and his employment    but pointed out that      there is clear authority that no such duty lies upon the Tribunal    referring thereby to a number of authorities  including the Federal Court decision of Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at    Whitlam  Tamberlin and Sackville JJ  and the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA         ALR   at    per Gummow and Hayne JJ   His Honour further observed that the appellant s submissions  pointed to various factual aspects of the  appellant s  claims  which the  appellant  argued revealed error in the Tribunal s doubting of his credibility    However his Honour pointed out that  s  everal of these facts do not appear  in fact  to have been presented to the Tribunal    and in any event his Honour considered that the same did no more than  argue the merits of the factual assessments made by the Tribunal    and did not  reveal that the Tribunal s reasoning was not open to it on the

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt should first be observed that the Tribunal  which was a respondent in the proceedings below  has not been named as a respondent in the notice of appeal  In the light of the High Court decision of SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA       ALR   at         and   the Tribunal should be joined as a second respondent to the current proceedings  In the context of the present appeal  the appellant sought to tender his affidavit evidence of   July   prior thereto  the appellant had failed to file any written submissions  The Minister indicated that there was no objection to the Court receiving the affidavit as constituting the appellant s submissions  but observed that if it were to be treated as evidence  it  would be objected to   The Minister went on to observe that the affidavit contained material that was not before the Court below or the Tribunal  I have received the affidavit to the extent that it may serve as submissions for the appellant  The principal features of the affidavit are as follows  using where appropriate the text of the affidavit       i  his confirmation that his application for an Australian visa asserted that he  was the Head of the Biology Department at Vanevan University   ii  his claim that  the   th International Congress of Eye Research s Conference Co ordinator wrote to  him  at the University on   August    iii   the head of the Vanevan Institute wrote a letter on  his  behalf to the Australian Embassy in Moscow dated   August   saying that  he  had been head of the  biology  department since   and   iv       the presiding member had been obliged to duly inform  him  of the information considered to be adverse The appellant made the further submission that      the Tribunal s s  A letter did not properly identify particulars of the information obtained from Moscow Embassy  as well as from other sources  and that  g iven  the  importance of the issue I am of the view that the Tribunal was obliged to provide me not only with particulars of the information gained from Moscow but with the copies of letters mentioned in paragraph   of the Affidavit  and to do so for three reasons  which he formulated as follows       i       the Tribunal made its own research  At    CB  it was confirmed that the University does exist in Armenia  However the address of the University is entirely different   ii   a ccording to one of the letters the presiding member relied on  the Vanevan University is located at   Pushkin Street  Yerevan   Armenia   a letter of   August   marked annexure A  was attached to his affidavit   iii   a ccording to information obtained by the Tribunal  the said University is located in a different town  even in a different region  at   Miasnikyan Street  Town of Martuni  Gehgardunik Region  Armenia   reference was thereupon made to what appears at page   of the Court Book  appliedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe appellant submitted that  f urthermore if to accept the Minister s suggestion that the Tribunal affirmed the delegate s decision because it was not satisfied that I had been a PPA member given my alleged lack of knowledge of PPA  or  because  it  was not satisfied by the copy of my membership card  or  because  the Tribunal  was troubled by the fact  that I did not tell about the documents submitted to the Embassy early in the hearing  then it must be accepted that the Tribunal was in breach of s  A of the Migration Act  because  it did not give me the opportunity to comment on this information   The contention such as it was  is misconceived and without juridical foundation  The Minister submitted that those contentions made by the appellant regarding page seventeen of the Tribunal s judgment constituted  a new section  A case which was not put to the Federal Magistrate  in that the appellant contended that that information was not the subject of the section  A notice provided to the appellant  The Minister pointed out rightly that those matters referred to by the appellant were all evaluations of evidence  not information within the meaning of s  A of the Act  Reference was made by the Minister in that regard to the dictum of Allsop J in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at         where his Honour discussed what is encompassed by the statutory notion of information in the context of s  A  of the Act  Allsop J observed as follows       Information does not encompass the Tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes or determinations  Tin at   Paul at   and VAF at    In this respect  it is relevant to recall the root of the word  information  that of which one has been told or apprised  or informed  The distinction can become fine  Paul at    It is a distinction  nevertheless  to be maintained  Also  the fact that appraisal  thought processes and determination are not information does not mean they are not relevant to the operation of s  A  The thought processes of the Tribunal may reveal the relevance of information for s  A b  and may assist in understanding what the Tribunal must say or do to comply with s  A a     b  or  c       In the light of the above authority  I am persuaded that Smith FM was correct to conclude in his decision below that the   s  A letter sufficiently identified particulars of the information gained from the Moscow Embassy  which was then used by the Tribunal in its reasons      The appellant concluded the case on appeal as follows       Moreover  even if to accept that in such circumstances the Tribunal was not in breach of s  A of the Act  it is to be accepted that the Tribunal acted unfairly  And this unfairness is to be regarded as denial of procedural fairness and  itself the issue of apprehended bias  referred toSZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases
