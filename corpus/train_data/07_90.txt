Singh v Secretary  Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedFreeman v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  His Honour then referred to Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCAFC     and earlier cases which the Full Court there approved  and summarised their effect at   as follows     in determining whether particular proceedings are in fact vexatious  a court may take account of proceedings in other courts where  for example  they have authoritatively resolved the particular issue against the person instituting the proceedings  The Full Court also noted that the expression  habitually and persistently  implies more than  frequently  and suggests a degree of stubbornness on the part of the person in question  The element  without any reasonable ground  is of course to be determined objectively  It is immaterial that the person may believe in the justice of his or her argument  and may not understand that the argument has been authoritatively rejected      His Honour considered those observations applicable to s  B b    His Honour concluded at   as follows     The Tribunal was entitled to have regard to  the appellant s  persistence  over many years  in seeking to have set aside the   November   decision  It was entitled to have regard to his entire course of dealings in relation to social security benefits since his accident in   and the fact that his latest foray before it involved an argument that could  and should  have been addressed years earlier  In those circumstances  I can see no error in the Tribunal s having concluded that a limited direction of the kind given was warranted   The respondent has applied for security for costs in the sum of    Apart from recounting the lengthy history of the matter already recorded by Justice Weinberg  the respondent s solicitor also noted various costs orders made against the applicant  none of which has been complied with  To the extent they have been taxed  they total      Other costs orders are yet to be taxed   A bankruptcy notice has issued against the appellant in the sum of      He did not pay the amount of the debt or make arrangements to the creditor s satisfaction within the time stipulated in the notice appliedDranichnikov v Centrelink   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  A single judge may determine an application for security for costs in respect of an appeal  Dranichnikov v Centrelink   FCA     Dranichnikov     The appellant did not appear on the application for security  I was told by the respondent s solicitor that the appellant had informed him that he was unable to attend because he was unwell  The appellant also said that his daughter  who usually assisted him in court  was also unable to attend  There was no other evidence of illness  and the appellant did not ask for an adjournment   As the history of the various proceedings makes clear  the matter before the Tribunal had already been the subject of a series of decisions made internally by Centrelink officers  the SSAT  the Tribunal  the Federal Magistrates Court  this Court and the High Court   The appellant s prospects of success on the appeal are a relevant consideration on any application for security  Dranichnikov at    As Bowen CJ said in J   M O Brien Enterprises Pty Ltd v The Shell Co of Australia Ltd  No       FLR   at   that is especially so in the case of an appeal  where the appellant has had his day in court  The matters the appellant wishes to raise on the appeal have already been decided against him  As appears from Dranichnikov at   that is a consideration pointing to the appropriateness of an order for security  The appellant s appeal is in my view without merit  There is nothing to suggest any error in the decision under appeal appliedCowell v Taylor     Ch D   The appellant has had his day in court on the frivolous and vexatious issue before Weinberg J  In Cowell v Taylor     Ch D   at   Bowen LJ said     The general view is that poverty is no bar to a litigant      There is an exception in the case of appeals  but there the appellant has had the benefit of a decision by one of Her Majesty s Courts  and so an insolvent party is not excluded from the Courts  but only prevented  if he cannot find security  from dragging his opponent from one Court to another      See also Ciappina v Ciappina     FLR   at   and Tait v Bindal People   FCA   citedCiappina v Ciappina     FLR   The
