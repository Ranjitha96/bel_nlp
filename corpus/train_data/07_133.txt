au au cases cth HCA  html  In Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte H   HCA         ALR   Gleeson CJ  Gaudron and Gummow JJ  after adverting to the test of apprehended bias in curial proceedings  said at      Perhaps it would be better  in the case of administrative proceedings held in private  to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings  the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias  Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation  there is  in our view  no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility  as distinct from probability  as to what will be done or what might have been done  To do otherwise  would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof   A reading of the transcript does not disclose any statement or conduct that might give rise to a suggestion that might give rise to apprehended bias  There is nothing in the Tribunal s reasons that could lead a reasonable lay observer to apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial mind to the determination of the matter before it   It cannot be said that simply because the Tribunal rejected the appellant s account a fair minded lay person might think that the Tribunal might not have brought an impartial mind to the hearing  That submission  if accepted  would make decision making impossible citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR  http

Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR   at           and      Section   does not impose a duty upon the Tribunal which  if breached  would involve jurisdictional error   Ground number   appears to be a restatement of ground number   together with the further complaint that the Tribunal was actually biased  No complaint of that kind was made to the Federal Magistrate  No particulars of the complaint had been made on this appeal   I am unable to discern any fact or circumstance which could lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal was actually biased citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Section  B provides that Division   of Part VII of the Act is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule  To that end  the Tribunal is obliged to comply with Division    Section  B has been recently considered by the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat   FCAFC         FCR    In that case  the Court was called upon to construe s  A which is relevantly in the same terms as s  B  The Court held that the intention of the legislature was to provide a comprehensive procedural code for procedural fairness and at the same time to exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule  although the bias rule is not excluded  The legislature intended to reverse the result of the decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Miah   HCA         CLR   where the majority held that the then wording of the Act did not exclude the common law rules of natural justice  There is  on the strength of that authority  no obligation on the decision maker to provide procedural fairness except in accordance with s  B   In this case  there is no suggestion that the Tribunal did not comply with s  B except insofar as it is complained that the Tribunal did not comply with s  A   In paragraph   of the grounds the appellant asserts that the Tribunal failed to act in accordance with s  A of the Act in that the Tribunal did not provide to the applicant particulars of the information that indicated that forged or fraudulently obtained documents are readily available in Bangladesh   That ground was raised in the application for review by the Magistrate and abandoned
