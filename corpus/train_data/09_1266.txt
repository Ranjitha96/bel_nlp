Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Bedroff Pty Ltd ACN         FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd     ACSR  In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd     ACSR    WPS Motorsport  I had occasion to consider a number of authorities bearing upon the question for immediate determination  see paras       of the reasons for judgment in that case  in particular  Since the winding up application was filed  the Deputy Commissioner has determined an objection to the substantive underlying revenue law debt arising from default assessment  It emerges from the affidavit of debt of Mr Gregory Phillips  read on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner  that on or about   October   an objection was allowed against Bedroff s income tax assessment for the year ended   June    The result of that objection decision was that Bedroff s taxation liability for the   year was reduced by     with related penalty being reduced by      As yet  and perhaps surprisingly  the Deputy Commissioner has not yet taken steps to implement that objection decision by the issuing of an appropriate amended assessment  The evidence  though  is that when that amended assessment is issued  the present indebtedness of the company to the Commonwealth  which has risen a little as a result of the running of general interest charge  will be reduced by      On any view  though  what remains is a substantial debt to the Commonwealth appliedRe Octaviar Ltd  formerly MFS Ltd      ACSR  In WPS Motorsport I was faced with a question as to whether  on the evidence to hand  I was satisfied that it was in the interests of the creditors to the company for the winding up application to be adjourned  The evidence put forward on behalf of the company  there to give rise such satisfaction  was  when one analysed it  illusory  That is not this case  While the evidence is certainly of a general nature  it does enliven  in my opinion  sentiments of the kind voiced by Philip McMurdo J in Re Octaviar Ltd  formerly MFS Ltd      ACSR   at    Re Octaviar  in a passage to which I referred in WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd at    In particular  his Honour observed that it will often be the case where not enough is known about what is likely to come from either a liquidation or a deed of company administration regime for a comparison as to relative worth not to be able to be made at an early stage  In Re Octaviar  his Honour referred to a passage from a judgment delivered by Campbell J in Deputy Commission of Taxation v Bradley Keeling Management Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR   at    The passage concerned is in these terms      Ultimately what the court needs to do is to be persuaded  The amount of proof which can result in persuasion  differs with the circumstances in which litigation comes before the court  It is common enough  in applications under s  A   for an administrator to need to seek an adjournment very soon after his or her appointment  at a time when he or she knows very little about the affairs of the company  In that sort of situation  comparatively little material might be needed to justify a short adjournment  As time goes on  however  and the occasion that there has been for the collecting of evidence increases  so the amount of material which might need to be put before the court before it is persuaded  will increase appliedDeputy Commission of Taxation v Bradley Keeling Management Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlIn WPS
