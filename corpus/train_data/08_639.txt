as those of the plaintiff citedAustralian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton   Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the law of passing off  the courts have treated evidence of the intentions of the defendant as relevant to the question of whether a representation is conveyed  SunRice argued that this evidence was determinative  It relied on remarks of Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton   Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    They said  The rule that if a mark or get up for goods is adopted for the purpose of appropriating part of the trade or reputation of a rival  it should be presumed to be fitted for the purpose and therefore likely to deceive or confuse  no doubt  is as just in principle as it is wholesome in tendency  In a question how possible or prospective buyers will be impressed by a given picture  word or appearance  the instinct and judgment of traders is not to be lightly rejected  and when a dishonest trader fashions an implement or weapon for the purpose of misleading potential customers he at least provides a reliable and expert opinion on the question whether what he has done is in fact likely to deceive  Moreover  he can blame no one but himself  even if the conclusion be mistaken that his trade mark or the get up of his goods will confuse and mislead the public  But the practical application of the principle may sometimes be attended with difficulty   emphasis added  However  their Honours concluded that in the end it was still a question of fact for the court to determine whether  indeed  there had been established a reasonable probability of deception or confusion from the use  in that case  of a trademark or device  They held that the main issue in the case was a question which was never susceptible of much discussion  They said   Australian Woollen Mills   CLR at   see too Burford   Sons   CLR at   per O Connor J  Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd

Wright  Porter and Goddard agreed  It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs   Likewise  Mr Young expected the new enhancement to SunRice s rice cake packaging by the addition of the rice representation and words  MADE WITH WHOLEGRAIN RICE  to emphasise potential health benefits to consumers on its various rice cake products  I find this was done because Ricegrowers appreciated that the ordinary reasonable consumer of these products would pay some attention to the packaging beyond merely looking at a colour cue before purchasing  A consumer who intentionally wished to acquire one but purchase the other might feel deceived  cp Australian Woollen Mills   CLR at    While  of course  SunRice would still sell either its tomato salsa flavoured thin corn cake  or its sundried tomato and basil one  I am satisfied that Ricegrowers took sensible and appropriate precautions in designing the packagings for the two tomato products in order to prevent such confusion occurring  It was not in Ricegrowers  interests that such confusion occur between its own products   The difference between the get up of the SunRice products and those of the Real Foods ones in competition with them is  to my mind  far more striking than that of the two SunRice tomato based products  I am satisfied that there was no real possibility of the ordinary reasonable consumer being mislead or deceived or being confused by the get up or packaging of the cheese flavoured and salt and vinegar flavoured  Corn Thins  products  They are distinctly different from their competitor s products in their get up and packaging in the cues of the mark  Corn Thins  as well as colour  printing of their descriptions  and pictorial representations   While the green packaging of the original SunRice rice cakes  until the most recent change  was similar to the green which Real Foods adopted for its sour cream and chives corn cakes  the two get ups are in my view so significantly different that the ordinary reasonable consumer would know immediately on looking at one or the other that they were not the same  The ordinary reasonable consumer looking at the  Corn Thins  sour cream and chives package would know that they were not SunRice s product  or associated at all with the SunRice product that was marketed as its sour cream and chives rice cake followedBurford   Sons Ltd v Mowling   Son   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A trader has a prima facie right to put his goods in any packages which he may think attractive and convenient and in any method which he may consider suitable for carrying on his trade provided that the form adopted is not likely to deceive the ordinary reasonable consumer into mistaking his goods for the goods known in the market as manufactured  put up or sold by another  Burford   Sons Ltd v Mowling   Son   HCA         CLR   at   per O Connor J  affirmed at   CLR     per Griffith CJ  Isaacs and Higgins JJ  O Connor J said that there the plaintiffs had no monopoly in the particular kind of packing which they adopted  which was used in a large number of articles  Those included not only packed soap  but grocery items and a variety of other items  He also said that the plaintiffs could not acquire a monopoly of the form of package by adopting a particular form of packaging  because its use was open to anyone in the trade  But his Honour went on to say that      where  as in this case  a certain method of get up  though open to all traders  has been for many years solely identified with the plaintiffs  goods in a particular market  it is incumbent on a trader who adopts the same method of get up for the purpose of pushing his trade and a similar article in the same market  that he shall clearly differentiate his goods on the face of the package from those of the plaintiffs   Burford   Sons   CLR at   O Connor J found that the question for determination was whether the defendant had made the difference of manufacture and ownership clear on the face of the package when adopting cartons of the same material  colour  shape and size of the plaintiff s packaging  He applied what Lindley MR said in Payton   Co Ltd v Snelling Lampard   Co Ltd     RPC   at    Lindley MR discussed the situation where goods themselves resembled one another  in that case coffee  and were packaged similarly  He said that the issue was not that the defendant s goods or get up was like the plaintiff s by reason of the features common to them and others  Rather  in a passage cited with approval by O Connor J in Burford   Sons   CLR at   in order to succeed in a passing off action  the plaintiff     must make out that the defendant s are like his by reason of something peculiar to him  and by reason of the defendant having adopted some mark  or device  or label  or something of that kind  which distinguishes the plaintiff s from other goods which have  like his  the features common to the trade  Unless the plaintiff can bring his case up to that  he fails   Thus  the mere fact that a defendant makes some distinction on the packaging from similar packaging used by or copied from the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to distinguish the goods from those of or associated with the plaintiff  Burford   Sons   HCA       CLR     Payton   RPC at   affirmed   AC     Borden     WLR at  H  B per Lord Oliver  Lord Oliver said that it was important in such a case for the defendant to see that the goods could really be distinguished from those of or associated with the plaintiff  But  he said the question was how far the defendants  trademark bears such a resemblance to that of the plaintiff  as to be calculated to deceive incautious purchasers  Borden     WLR at  B citing Lord Kingsdown in Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Cloth Co Ltd   EngR         H L Cas   at     However  their

relating to passing off do not necessarily require a plaintiff to establish an exclusive reputation in relation to the use of a particular colour  in that case  purple  They said that the question was whether the plaintiff could establish facts that demonstrate that a particular use by the defendant of the colour was likely to mislead or deceive consumers into believing that there was relevant connection between the defendant and the plaintiff or their respective products  Darrell Lea   FCR at     see too Office Cleaning   RPC at   per Lord Simonds  They observed that both in the context of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act and the common law tort of passing off  trade indicia other than names and logos can become associated with a particular trader  so that use by another trader could give rise to misleading or deceptive conduct or passing off  They said   Darrell Lea   FCR at     If particular branding elements used by a trader have been identified in a special way with that trader in the minds of the members of the public  there may be misleading or deceptive conduct by reason of the appropriation of those particular branding elements by another trader   Black CJ  Emmett and Middleton JJ said  obiter  that whether or not there was a requirement for some exclusive reputation as an element in the common law tort of passing off  Pt V of the Trade Practices Act did not include such a requirement  Under the Act  the question is whether the use of the particular get up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons

ordinary reasonable consumer of the parties  rice and corn cake products was a female aged between   and   years  Most would have middle or older families  i e  school age children or teenagers  but some would not have children  some would be in households with either one or two income earners  She would be working either full time or part time  be married and educated  The ordinary reasonable consumer would be purchasing these products as snack foods for herself and her entire family unit  She would be health conscious and would want to set a good example for her family by her healthy eating  She also would be conscious of her weight and would feel guilty when snacking  She would not want to have foods that were full of fat or sugar  Nor would she want to give her children or teenagers such foods or set a bad example for them   The ordinary reasonable consumer was used to seeing the two distinct families of goods presented on the supermarket shelves in this way  Borden

Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd     IPR   In Borden     WLR at  H  C Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said that a trader could only claim protection for such capricious additions to a commonly used container as distinguished his use of that container from the use of other traders  Thus  the trader may prevent a rival copying the label on boxes or perhaps the distinctive combination of colours on tins but cannot stop the rival using ordinary boxes or tins simply because they happen to be the same shape and size as his  He said that it was not the shape and size of the container which identified the product of a particular trader to the public  but the capricious additions to it by way of distinctive labelling or a combination of colour or graphic design  He referred to JB

contravention of s   to occur the defendant must make a false representation that the defendant s goods are the plaintiff s or are associated in some way with the plaintiff  The focus of s   is on the misleading of others  rather than upon an injury to a competitor  Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd     CLR   at   per Stephen J   In cases of passing off where the wrongful appropriation of the reputation of the plaintiff or that of his goods is in question  a plaintiff who used descriptive words in his trade name would find out that quite small differences in a competitor s trade name would render the latter immune from action  The law recognises the possibility of blunders by members of the public when descriptive words are used by two traders as part of their respective trade names  But  Stephen J said the risk of confusion must be accepted because      to do otherwise is to give to one who appropriates to himself descriptive words an unfair monopoly in those words and might even deter others from pursuing the occupation which the words describe  Hornsby Building Information Centre   CLR at    And  he said that similar principles applied to s     because allowing that section to be used as an instrument for the creation of a monopoly of descriptive names      would be to mock the manifest intent of the legislation    CLR at    The principle is not limited to a name but applies to other descriptive material if it has not given a distinctive character to a product or business  Cadbury Schweppes     NSWLR at     per

 Cadbury Schweppes     NSWLR at     referred toJB Williams Company v H Bronnley   Co Limited     RPC   In Borden     WLR at  H  C Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said that a trader could only claim protection for such capricious additions to a commonly used container as distinguished his use of that container from the use of other traders  Thus  the trader may prevent a rival copying the label on boxes or perhaps the distinctive combination of colours on tins but cannot stop the rival using ordinary boxes or tins simply because they happen to be the same shape and size as his  He said that it was not the shape and size of the container which identified the product of a particular trader to the public  but the capricious additions to it by way of distinctive labelling or a combination of colour or graphic design  He referred to JB Williams Company v H Bronnley   Co Limited     RPC   at   per Cozens Hardy MR and at   per Farwell LJ  In that case  at   Fletcher Moulton LJ had said there

html  And  as Burchett J noted in Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   Of course  a person who places the packets before him  side by side  can also see differences  But that is not how passing off by the imitation of another trader s mark or get up is to be tested  In general  and more particularly in the case of an item likely to be purchased for a small price without long consideration  the comparison which must be made is between the impression of the applicant s goods retained in a customer s mind and the impression made by the sort of consideration he is likely to give to the respondent s product before purchasing it   Ricegrowers argued that the circumstances of the purchase of the competing products by the ordinary reasonable consumer included the following        each of the products was low in price and a routine purchase likely to appear on the ordinary reasonable consumer s shopping list  It was likely to be bought  along with many other items  whilst the weekly shopping was being done  For the ordinary reasonable consumer  looking to purchase this type of snack food  the shopping process is a  low involvement  one  Low involvement purchases are ones which are made frequently  or sometimes on impulse and typically do not involve a large price    the ordinary reasonable shopper has a hierarchy of cues which she uses  even in low involvement purchases when shopping very fast  in order to identify the goods she is purchasing  Ms Anderson said the cues provide shortcuts for the different categories  One such cue is the use of colour packaging of food stuffs such green for sour cream and chives    Ricegrowers argued that when Ms Anderson prepared the marketing brief with The Leading Edge  she said that  Corn Thins  were a routine purchase  the shopping process was generally low involvement and there were shortcuts or cues which aided purchase such as familiar brands  colours  packaging  flavours and claims  e g  the product was   fat free and the claims made in the nutritional information panel on the package      the packaging of the SunRice and Real Foods flavoured products had substantial similarities in the critical cues necessary to grab the attention of the ordinary reasonable consumer    Ms Anderson said that a new product in a crowded category  that is one in which there were many products  had to jump out and attract the consumer to a point of difference  The way in which that was done was to use familiar brands  colouring  packaging  flavours and claims for products so that the product will  work hard  as packaged  to gain the attention of the ordinary reasonable shopper  Consumers rarely go into supermarkets looking for a new product  Generally they scan the shelves in the rice cake and corn cake category from a slight distance and are attracted quickly by the cues before making the decision to take the product    Real Foods were using symbols or logos which were likely  despite differences of detail  to lead the ordinary reasonable consumer to form the impression of a common business or at least of an association  connection or affiliation  Ricegrowers relied on what Burchett J had said in Kettle Chip   FCR at   and argued that             a  Real Foods used a packaging type  flow pack  that it had never previously deployed in that form  Its packaging was virtually indistinguishable from the SunRice packaging  The ordinary reasonable consumer would not notice differences in the plastic flow pack of the SunRice rice cakes compared to the foil flow pack of the Real Foods and SunRice corn cakes   b  the colours and imagery used for the packaging as well as the three flavour types of the two competitors were virtually identical   c  the logo of Real Foods  brand was diminutive on the packaging contrary to the recommendations made to Real Foods by its market research company  The Leading Edge   d  there was minimal  if any advertising   e  Real Foods used the  Corn Thins  name as a brand despite many consumers seeing it as simply descriptive of a category of goods and not identifying it as a brand   Ricegrowers argued that Real Foods adopted the course set out above in order to take a fast and easy option which copied the market leader  SunRice  and sought to emulate its success  Ricegrowers argued that Real Foods had chosen the packaging designs for its new flavoured products which sailed  too close to the wind  to that of SunRice  In effect  it claimed that Real Foods had designed a product knowing it had features of SunRice s products and which were calculated or likely to cause consumers  who would spend little time examining the differences in the products  to purchase them citedKnight v Beyond Properties Pty Limited   FCAFC         ALR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It is appropriate for the court to approach the question of whether s   has been contravened by answering the composite question whether the defendant s conduct was misleading or deceptive in relation to the ordinary and reasonable consumer of rice cakes or corn cakes purchasing them in supermarkets  see Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Limited   FCAFC         ALR   at     per French  Tamberlin JJ and myself   The Court must be cautious against finding fraud merely because there has been an imitation of another s goods  get up  method or trading or trading style  Cadbury Schweppes     NSWLR at     per Lord Scarman  In that case the trial judge had found that the defendant s deliberate purpose was to take advantage of the plaintiff s efforts to develop its product  The plaintiff had launched its product with mass media advertising at great expense prior to the defendant s product being put on the market  He found that the intention was not to pass off the defendant s goods as those of the plaintiff  but to take advantage of the market developed by the advertising campaign which the plaintiff had initiated  The Privy Council upheld findings that there had been no deception because the goods had been sufficiently distinguished  The plaintiff had needed to show that in doing so the defendant infringed the plaintiff s intangible property rights in the goodwill attaching to its product  Cadbury Schweppes     NSWLR at      Their Lordships upheld the trial judge s finding that although the two cans in which the rival traders marketed their soft drink were of the same size  a stock size and shape in the trade  and similar colour  the defendant had sufficiently distinguished its product  The judge found it could readily be seen that they were different  Cadbury Schweppes     NSWLR at         Ricegrowers argued that the collection in its packaging of obvious features in an attractive way not thought of before should be seen as a new idea which created a valuable resource to the person who conceived it  just as might be the case with an original invention for which a patent was claimed  It asserted that  in effect  Real Foods had produced such similar packaging for its three new flavoured corn thins that their get up would convey the pleaded representations to an ordinary reasonable consumer and thus pass off Real Foods  goods as Ricegrowers  citedLeather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Cloth Co Ltd   EngR         H L Cas   Thus  the mere fact that a defendant makes some distinction on the packaging from similar packaging used by or copied from the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to distinguish the goods from those of or associated with the plaintiff

Rather  in a passage cited with approval by O Connor J in Burford   Sons   CLR at   in order to succeed in a passing off action  the plaintiff     must make out that the defendant s are like his by
