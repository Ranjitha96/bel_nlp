VSC  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSC  html  In Advan Investments Pty Ltd v Dean Gleeson Motor Sales Pty Ltd   VSC   Gillard J identified the elements which it is necessary for a complainant to establish in order to make good a charge of civil contempt of Court  His Honour said        In order to prove a civil contempt of Court involving a breach of an order of the Court  the plaintiff has to prove the following                 i  that an order was made by the Court     ii  that the terms of the order are clear  unambiguous and capable of compliance     iii  that the order was served on the alleged contemnor or excused in the circumstances  or service dispensed with pursuant to the Rules of Court     iv  that the alleged contemnor has knowledge of the terms of the order     v  that the alleged contemnor has breached the terms of the order              It is necessary for the plaintiff to prove each element beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with the principles of the criminal law  in proving element  v  it must be proven that the act or omission which constituted the breach of the order was deliberate and voluntary   There is no dispute  and I am satisfied that        Order  e  was made by Gray J on   January       A copy of Gray J s orders was served on Mr Siminton on   January    An amended copy of the orders was served on him on   May    The relevant amendment was the inclusion of the endorsement required by Order   Rule   of the Federal Court Rules      Mr Siminton had knowledge of the terms of the orders     Mr Siminton has put in issue the questions of whether Order  e  is clear and unambiguous  whether the Order has extra territorial operation and whether APRA has established beyond reasonable doubt that he engaged in deliberate conduct which was in breach of Gray J s orders referred toAMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     Merkel J summarised the current state of the law on when disobedience of a Court order will constitute a contempt of court  His Honour said     Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order  and therefore a civil contempt  unless the conduct be casual  accidental or unintentional  see Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginbeeri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     and      However  the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves  deliberate defiance or  as it is sometimes said  if it is contumacious  see Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at       However  as all proceedings for contempt are now regarded as criminal in nature  all of the charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt  see Witham at      See also AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Heatons Transport v TGWU   AC   at   citedAustralian

Authority v Siminton  No        ALR     Mr Siminton lodged an appeal against the findings and orders made by Merkel J  His appeal was allowed in part because the sealed copy of the orders made by

   Further  there are other transactions in the period   May to   August which  although not the subject of contempt charges  appear specifically to relate to Mr Siminton  APRA submits the Court can use this additional evidence to assist it in drawing the inference that the Visa account was being used by Mr Siminton as principal  for his own purposes  and that the use of an account and card in Karen Holzheimer s name was nothing more than an attempt to disguise the fact that Mr Siminton was accessing funds in breach of the Orders      Examples of this additional evidence are

        Charge     reads     On   August       the Respondent  by himself or by his servants or agents  dealt with monies standing to his credit in the Anglo Irish Bank  Austria  AG by giving instructions for the electronic transfer of the sum of   out of an account in his name with the Anglo Irish Bank  Austria  AG and the deposit of that amount into the Visa Account     In paras   to   of its written submissions  APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of Charge            On   August   Mr Siminton effected or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of   to the Visa Account from an account controlled by him at the Anglo Irish Bank in Austria         The total sum of     minus bank fees  was transferred by SWIFT electronic transfer into the Visa Account on   August   in a lump sum         SWIFT is in  sic  acronym for Society of Worldwide International Financial Telecommunications a group which allows customers to transfer money electronically between banks around the world         The SWIFT record held by the Adelaide Bank for the deposit of   into the Visa Account on   August   shows that the                    originated in an account name in the name of Mr Siminton  and       his account was held at the Anglo Irish Bank in Austria                   APRA submits that the transfer of   from the Anglo Irish Bank account to the Visa Account was deliberate  The account at the Anglo Irish Bank is in Mr Siminton s name  Mr Siminton has previously used the Anglo Irish Bank account to pay for investments in Australia                 Further  APRA submits the Court can infer that Mr Siminton  or a person acting on Mr Siminton s instructions  made the transfer  The evidence discloses that he was the person who had authority to operate that account                 The conclusion that Mr Siminton deliberately effected  or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of   from the Anglo Irish Bank to the Visa Account is the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence  Any alternative hypothesis could not be regarded as reasonable in the absence of evidence to support that hypothesis when that evidence  if it exists at all  must be within the knowledge of Mr Siminton           Charge         Charge     reads     Between   August   and   September       the Respondent disposed of

that Order  e  is  relevantly  in identical terms to Order    b  made by Sundberg J on   December    When Mr Siminton was charged  before Merkel J  with having contravened this order he did not contend that it was ambiguous or uncertain or that he had not understood it   The question of whether or not Mr Siminton  in the present proceeding  acted on a bona fide misunderstanding of the order  will fall for consideration  on the evidence  when it becomes necessary to determine what action the Court should take in response to any contravention on the part of Mr Siminton   Mr Siminton also submitted that Order  e  did not have extra territorial operation so as to apply to accounts  otherwise comprehended by its terms  which were held off shore  This objection  as I understood it

specifically to relate to Mr Siminton  APRA submits the Court can use this additional evidence to assist it in drawing the inference that the Visa account was being used by Mr Siminton as principal  for his own purposes  and that the use of an account and card in Karen Holzheimer s name was nothing more than an attempt to disguise the fact that Mr Siminton was accessing funds in breach of the

Austria  AG and the deposit of that amount into the Visa Account     In paras   to   of its written submissions  APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of Charge            On   August   Mr Siminton effected or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of   to the Visa Account from an account controlled by him at the Anglo Irish Bank in Austria         The total sum of     minus bank fees  was transferred by SWIFT electronic transfer into the Visa Account on   August   in a lump sum         SWIFT is in  sic  acronym for Society of Worldwide International Financial Telecommunications a group which allows customers to transfer money electronically between banks around the world         The SWIFT record held by the Adelaide Bank for the deposit of   into the Visa Account on   August   shows that the                    originated in an account name in the name of Mr Siminton  and       his account was held at the Anglo Irish Bank in Austria                   APRA submits that the transfer of   from the Anglo Irish Bank account to the Visa Account was deliberate  The account at the Anglo Irish Bank is in Mr Siminton s name  Mr Siminton has previously used the Anglo Irish Bank account to pay for investments in Australia                 Further  APRA submits the Court can infer that Mr Siminton  or a person acting on Mr Siminton s instructions  made the transfer  The evidence discloses that he was the person who had authority to operate that account                 The conclusion that Mr Siminton deliberately effected  or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of   from the Anglo Irish Bank to the Visa Account is the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence  Any alternative hypothesis could not be regarded as reasonable in the absence of evidence to support that hypothesis when that evidence  if it exists at all  must be within the knowledge of Mr Siminton           Charge

contempt charges being heard and determined before the principal application had been heard  He did not object to the contempt charges being heard immediately after the hearing of the principal application  As events transpired this is what occurred  There were other preliminary objections which can be grouped under two heads  The first was that  for a variety of reasons  provisions of the Act on which APRA relied in the principal proceeding were  unconstitutional   There was also an objection that the principal proceeding was an abuse of process and that it should permanently be stayed  I rejected these submissions for reasons which I gave when dealing with the principal proceeding  see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA   at   to    In any event  these arguments cannot avail Mr Siminton in contempt proceedings  As the Full Court pointed out in Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR   at        An order made by a superior court of record stands and is bound to be observed even though it may ultimately be determined that the order should not have been made or was made without jurisdiction  Whilst the order

Universal Music Branson J  with whom Lindgren and Finkelstein JJ agreed  having referred to Morgan and a number of older authorities  concluded  at     that        the authorities discussed above reveal that an injunction is not rendered invalid  or incapable of founding a charge of contempt  merely because it leaves a respondent with room to wonder whether future conduct falls within it  At least where the true construction of the order is one which ought fairly to have been in the contemplation of the person to whom the order was directed     the Court which entertains the charge of contempt will be required to determine that construction  Of course  it may be highly relevant to the question of punishment that a respondent failed to comply with the order because he  she or it

to other parts of Gray J s orders  for example  paras    a   b  and  c  which restrained Mr Siminton from doing things in the future  Counsel conceded that  if Mr Siminton s construction argument succeeded  no contraventions of Order  e  could be established   In Universal Music Branson J  with whom Lindgren and Finkelstein JJ agreed  having referred to Morgan and a number of older authorities  concluded  at     that        the authorities discussed above reveal that an injunction is not rendered invalid  or incapable of founding a charge of contempt  merely because it leaves a respondent with room to wonder whether future conduct falls within it  At least where the true construction of the order is one which ought fairly to have been in the contemplation of the person to whom the order was directed     the Court which entertains the charge of contempt will be required to determine that construction  Of course  it may be highly relevant to the question of punishment that a respondent failed to comply with the order because he  she or it placed a construction on the order that was not its true construction  referred toRPS v R   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In seeking to make good each of these charges APRA invites the Court to draw certain inferences  This invitation is made in circumstances in which neither Mr Siminton nor any other persons  such as the Holzheimers  who might reasonably have been expected to have knowledge of relevant events  gave evidence  No adverse inference can be drawn merely because Mr Siminton has chosen not to give or call evidence in defence of the charges  The failure is nonetheless of potential significance  This is because  as the High Court explained in RPS v R   HCA         CLR   at           it will seldom  if ever  be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence  The most that can be said in criminal matters is that there are some cases in which evidence  or an explanation  contradicting and apparently damning inference to be drawn from proven facts could come only from the accused  In the absence of such evidence or explanation  the jury may more readily draw the conclusion which the prosecution seeks  As was said in Weissensteiner v The Queen         I n a criminal trial  hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence  if it exists at all  must be within the knowledge of the accused    footnotes omitted    The inferences which APRA invited the Court to draw are founded on uncontradicted evidence  Counsel for Mr Siminton did not make any specific submissions as to why the inferences for which APRA contended should not be drawn   In each case I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those inferences ought to be drawn  that the conclusions contended for by APRA are supported by the evidence and that the evidence does not support a finding that there is any reasonable or rational hypothesis consistent with Mr Siminton s innocence of any of these charges   I am also satisfied that the affidavit and documentary evidence tendered by APRA strongly supports the case made by it and that this evidence establishes each of the matters of fact necessary to make good each of the charges
