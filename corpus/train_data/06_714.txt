Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Fairchild Development Pty Ltd  in liq  in the matter of Fairchild Development Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedGeorge Ward Steel Pty Ltd v Kizkot Pty Ltd     ACLR   Counsel have referred me to the decision of Hodgson J in George Ward Steel Pty Ltd v Kizkot Pty Ltd     ACLR   as providing an example of the use of a provision such as O   r   in circumstances such as the present  It is also submitted that the factors which his Honour took into account in a passage on page   in making the order in that case are all present here  The order was made in the absence of the defendant  The application has been brought promptly  The liquidator is here and represented  as is the petitioning creditor  Australian Securities   Investments Commission has no opposition  although in reality it adopts a neutral stance  A statement of affairs has been tendered and there has been evidence led from one of the directors  from the company s bookkeeper and from an external accountant or financial adviser which indicates that the company is solvent  Most particularly  the financial fate of the company in the short to medium term depends upon its relationship with its bankers  St George Bank  and there is in evidence a letter from that company which  in effect  undertakes to permit payments to be made to satisfy the amount of the demand by the Deputy Commissioner and the costs incurred by the Deputy Commissioner and the liquidator   As I indicated in the course of argument  there is a question in my mind about the preferred method of dealing with this situation because the appointment of a liquidator has consequences which can be likened to those in rem rather than simply being an inter partes order  However  Hodgson J s approach is a clear precedent for what is sought  I am disposed to follow it  including the grant of leave to the directors to bring the proceedings   The practical result of this order is that the proceeding will be restored as a defended matter and then adjourned to a later date  The liquidator ceases to hold office and of course  on one view  apart from the de facto consequences  was never properly appointed  In an endeavour to secure the position  all I can do is to order as a term of granting the application that the company pay the costs both of the Deputy Commissioner and of the liquidator arising out of the making of the order and the making of this application  I also take note of the undertakings to the Court given by counsel on behalf of two of the directors of the company to procure various payments to be made when St George Bank makes the funds available  I stand the matter over until     am tomorrow for orders to be made on the bases that I have indicated  I grant liberty to apply in the meantime     I certify that the preceding five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles   Associate Dated    June   Counsel for the Applicants on the interlocutory process  Mr D Robertson     Solicitor for the Applicants on the interlocutory process  Atkinson Vinden Heazlewoods     Counsel for the Plaintiff Respondent on the interlocutory process  Mr D Crompton     Solicitor for the Plaintiff  Respondent on the interlocutory process  Church   Grace     Solicitor for the Liquidator  Mr PG Cutler     Date of Hearing    May       Date of Judgment    May         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
