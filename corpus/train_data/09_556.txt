in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCAFC         AAR   by Stone J and me particularly at      We expressed our approval of the observation made by Gummow J in TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    FCA         ATR   at     that an appeal  on a question of law  is narrower than an appeal that merely involves a question of law  As his Honour pointed out  where an appeal lies  on a question of law  the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law  That is  the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated as required by O   r  b    The legislature  by creating a statutory right of appeal to a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in the narrow terms of s   disclosed an

discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the Tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law  It is in the specification of the grounds relied
