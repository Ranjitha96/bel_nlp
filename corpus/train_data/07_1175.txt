the Court that challenges at least the substance of Mr O Shanassy s account of the circumstances regarding the drawing down of the Warranty Security Deposit to pay  one half of the sum demanded by Dr Fox  referred toJames v Australia And New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     ALR   In any event  so Foundation s submissions continued  any representation to the effect that Foundation would work to grow the Business was asserted to have been made  on reasonable grounds  Foundation emphasising that      given Foundation s ongoing operation as a large public company operating many medical centres   then  without direct proof of intention on the part of Foundation not to meet the Benchmark  the reasonable grounds are established  and further that  i t is not sufficient that matters represented may have been subject to a change of mind   Foundation referred in that regard to dictum in James v Australia And New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Others     ALR   at   where Toohey J drew attention to principles to the effect that  t  he mere fact that representations as to future conduct or events do not come to pass does not make them misleading or deceptive  though further that  n evertheless  a statement relating to the future may contain an implied statement as to present or past fact  and  may represent impliedly that the promisor has a present intention to make good the promise and it may represent impliedly that he has the means to do so    Of course so much often depends upon the context to and the subject matter of a representation  but in any event Foundation submitted that the decision  relating to relocation  was inherently of that general character   In addressing the  primary objective  theme of clause     of the Business Sale   Purchase Agreement  that clause being the provision of the Agreement per se upon which Idoshore of course placed significant reliance  Foundation asserted that  an objective  was to be distinguished from a guarantee or warranty and that clause     was  couched in appropriate terms as an objective   It was further contended that if the purpose of the clause was to provide a guarantee or warranty  it would have been phrased in definitive terms   Achievement of growth as such  without nomination or specification for instance of a minimum or maximum standard or parameters for the growth  carries somewhat imponderable implications of difficulty in a contractual setting such as clause      In any event that clause has significance independently concerning the making by Foundation of  any material changes  without consultation or consent   As to the operation of clause     of the Business Sale   Purchase Agreement  which records the unspecific themes as to Foundation s stated intention      to grow and expand the Business and  subject to clause      not to  impede the Purchaser  Foundation submitted that the same constituted a  motherhood  statement  since  n o purchaser would pay     million dollars for a business without intending to grow and expand it   Nevertheless contractual significance should be assigned to that contractual acknowledgment  however confined in scope it may be  Foundation submitted further those contractual passages were not to be interpreted as saying that  performance can be expected to automatically continue at existing levels or outstrip them   Foundation was already engaged of course in business operations similar to  though apparently much more substantial than  those conducted by Idoshore at the OSMC at the time the Agreement was formed referred toRenard Constructions  ME  Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works     NSWLR   The first such restatement of principle cited by Idoshore was that enunciated by Priestly JA as a member of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in relation to a building and engineering contract in Renard Constructions  ME  Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works     NSWLR   at      There is nothing in the slightest novel in the implication of terms requiring reasonableness by parties to a contract in implementing terms of the contract      And further at      The result is that people generally    have grown used to the courts applying standards of fairness to contract which are wholly consistent with the existence in all contracts of a duty upon the parties of good faith and fair dealing in its performance  In my view this is in these days the expected standard  and anything less is contrary to prevailing community expectations    In framing those principles  his Honour acknowledged the briefly reported dictum of Dixon J  as he then was  in Gullett v Gardner     ALJ   as follows     This appeal depends upon the interpretation that should be placed upon a transaction of a somewhat curious nature between the two parties  the plaintiff and the defendant  It depends upon its interpretation in the wide sense  not the mere construction of the language in which it is expressed  but the extraction from the documents and the circumstances to which they refer and in which they were made of the full intention which the parties had or are to be considered as having with reference to the question now arising from the events that have occurred   that emphasis appearing in the foregoing dictum was that of Dixon J    To similar effect was the dictum of Handley JA appearing in Renard at    Meagher JA reached the same outcome in decision making  upon the operation of the contractual material addressed  as did Priestly and Handley JJA  though  at   his Honour rejected the notion      that reasonableness could be imported as a limitation on the existence of cl   powers       upon the basis that  s uch a limitation  if it existed  could only arise either from the express words of the contract or by way of an implied term   referred toGullett v Gardner     ALJ   The first such restatement of principle cited by Idoshore was that enunciated by Priestly JA as a member of the New South Wales Court of

of an implied term   referred toPacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Idoshore cited also what appeared more recently in the unanimous reasons of the High Court in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas   HCA         CLR   at    Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ  concerning the bearing of surrounding circumstances upon the construction of written contracts  as follows     The construction of the letters of indemnity is to be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of Pacific would have understood them to mean  That requires consideration  not only of the text of the documents  but also the surrounding circumstances known to Pacific and BNP and the purpose and object of the transaction   The surrounding circumstances implicitly known to Idoshore and Foundation included the nature and extent of Idoshore s then existing business activities  described by the Agreement as the provision of  facilities and services to medical practitioners to facilitate the conduct of their individual medical practices carried out in and from the Premises     such premises being of course the subject of the medical operations of Idoshore s medical practitioners by the time of formation of the Business Sale   Purchase Agreement  As I have foreshadowed  at the time of formation of the Agreement  Foundation was already itself engaged extensively in the operation of business activities of that general description  though on a much larger scale than Idoshore   As I have already placed on record  Idoshore listed the following matters in summary as the principal focus of its case  being of course the case the subject of its several claims  I put aside for the moment Foundation s briefly framed cross claim     a  the representations made to  Mr  O Shanassy about exchanging a higher price for an Earn Up provision   b  the pre contractual representations as to  Foundation s  intention to grow the Business  and  the Heads of Agreement   c  the contractual provisions of the Business Sale   Purchase Agreement setting out  Foundation s  intention to grow the Business     d  the express obligation  of Foundation  not to make any material change to the Business  and    e  the contractual warranties by Idoshore as to maintenance of post acquisition EBITDA    As to  a  above  the same is apparently a reference to representations made in the course of pre contract negotiations  as is explicitly the case in  b  above
