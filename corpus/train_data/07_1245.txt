Full Court asking that its previous order be varied and that the matter be remitted for a new trial  that is to say a hearing de novo   The Full Court dismissed the motion  Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  No     FCAFC    the second Full Court judgment    Cadbury then brought a motion seeking an order that I excuse myself from further hearing the matter on the ground of apprehended bias  The application was based on what I said in the course of the evidence ruling and the trial judgment  I dismissed the motion and stated that I would give my reasons later  Those reasons are as follows   In the evidence ruling I was primarily concerned with the proffered evidence of Dr Brian Gibbs  Associate Professor of Marketing and Behavioural Science in the Melbourne Business School  although there were two other witnesses from Cadbury who would have given similar or related opinions and a Darrell Lea witness who would have given opinion evidence of the same kind but to opposite effect appliedJohnson v Johnson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The test to be applied is not in dispute  It was laid down by the High Court in Johnson v Johnson   HCA         CLR   at   namely     whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide   In the present case  although the apprehended bias application is based entirely on remarks in the evidence ruling and trial judgment  the hypothetical lay observer must be credited with knowledge not only of those remarks but what the Full Court said in its first and second judgments  The fair minded observer is not  a person wholly uninformed and uninstructed about the law in general or the issue to be decided  Johnson at     The lay observer would be aware that Cadbury had criticised the remarks in question  and had on two occasions sought a trial de novo before another judge  The lay observer would understand that the Full Court saw no problem in having the matter further considered by me  In particular the observer would consider what the Full Court said in its second judgment at     quoted above and the observation of Emmett J  speaking for the Court  in the course of argument  see   above    The observer  in considering the criticisms of the utility of expert opinion in consumer cases I have made on policy grounds  would see from reading the first Full Court judgment that similar views had been expressed by other judges of the Federal Court  and had been referred to by the Full Court in the present case without any disapproval   The observer would see that  while there were critical comments on some aspects of Dr Gibbs  evidence  read as a whole and in context the real thrust of the remarks in the evidence ruling was concerned with the effects of expert evidence of this kind in this kind of case  in other words with the policy rationale for what the judge thought the law to be wrongly  as it turned out  Regrettably  the primary judge proceeded upon the assumption that this evidence would not be admissible at common law  an assumption which the Full Court accepted  the heading of s   tells us  Ultimate issue and common knowledge rules abolished   The primary judge should have been aware of s  b    and counsel should have directed his attention to it  Judges  like other citizens  do not always agree with laws  But judges have to administer the law as it stands  The observer would think  as did the Full Court  that this will happen in the present case   Of course there are practical problems  The reasonable lay observer would recognise the difficulty of a judge s task in taking into account new evidence when he or she has already reached a decision on a great deal of other evidence  including  although not limited to  evidence going to the same issues as the wrongly excluded evidence  But that is inherent in the power given by s  c  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  which gives explicit powers to Full Courts to do what the Full Court has done in the present case   Cadbury s motion will be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding forty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice HEEREY
