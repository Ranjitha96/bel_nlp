Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda   Kaiadilt Peoples v State of Queensland   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedThe Lardil Peoples v State of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In considering the agreement  I have had the great benefit of the reasons of Justice Cooper in the  Wellesley Sea Claim    The Lardil Peoples v State of Queensland   FCA     Lardil   and a body of evidence in the form of expert reports and affidavits filed in the Lardil proceedings  Very significant portions of that evidence are relevant to this application  In particular  in Lardil   some   affidavits were filed and   witnesses  representing members of Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt claim groups  gave evidence on Mornington Island  A number of reports from expert witnesses concerning the history and genealogies of the Lardil  Yangkaal  Kaiadilt  and Gangalidda Peoples were filed  This evidence  the  Connection Material  also filed in the present application  was subject to judicial consideration by Cooper J  and a significant part of it was the subject of cross examination  Given that the composition of the claim group in these proceedings is the same as before Cooper J  and having regard to the power in section   of the Act to take into account evidence in other proceedings  it is appropriate that  in the present application  the Court also has regard to that evidence in analysing the history of the claim groups and their connection with the land   In Lardil  Justice Cooper set out  at     a comprehensive history of European contact with the northern part of Australia  the Gulf of Carpentaria and  more specifically  the land and waters the subject of this application  The submissions of the Applicant filed in these proceedings have been helpful in directing me to the relevant historical and anthropological material that goes to establishing the ethnography of the claim group  since first contact  and of their connection to the Determination Area  The following summary of European contact and subsequent settlement in the area as set out in the submissions  gives an understanding of the society that existed at first contact and the changes to that society as a consequence of European contact    From the Connection Material  the Court can be satisfied that  as at the date of sovereignty  the proposed Determination Area was occupied by Aboriginal People  As early as November   Matthew Flinders observed that the islands which he named the Wellesley Islands were inhabited by Indigenous people  As such  Flinders was the first European to document contact with the Indigenous people of the Wellesley Islands  In November   Flinders stayed over a month in the vicinity of the Wellesley Islands to undertake repairs to his vessel  the Investigator  and to replenish supplies of water and wood  He observed  natives  on Bentinck Island  Sweers Island  Allen Island  Horseshoe Island  and Mornington Island  He observed spiral shells used as water containers  and midden material comprising shells and turtle bones on Horseshoe Island  He also observed sleeping hollows on Bentinck Island  and wells  midden material and human remains on Sweers Island  Later explorers confirmed the presence of Indigenous people on the Wellesley Islands and adjoining coastal mainland  In   John Lort Stokes in the Beagle anchored in Investigator Road which is the body of water between Bentinck Island and Sweers Island  He went ashore at Sweers Island and found the well made by Flinders  men  Stokes reported  natives  on Sweers Island  and on Allen Island  He observed  native skulls  and long bones on Sweers Island  and a well at Bayley Point on the mainland  The next serious maritime investigation of the southern Gulf was undertaken by Captain C Pennefather in   on the Pearl  Pennefather was instructed to report on and survey the waters surrounding Sweers and Bentinck Islands  He landed on Sweers and Allen Islands and examined Indigenous fish traps near Point Parker  In the mid  s exploration of the mainland adjacent to the Wellesley Islands took place  Of particular significance was the     expedition lead by Ludwig Leichhardt  which travelled along the southern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria  On the way  Leichhardt recorded camps  tracks and fish traps of Aboriginal people  As a result of the observations of Leichhardt and Stokes  impetus grew for the development of the pastoral industry in the southern Gulf  Queensland became a separate colony in December   and soon after the first  albeit short lived  wave of pastoral development in the Burke district took place  In   pastoralist JG Macdonald established the settlement of Burketown on the Albert River  twelve miles inland from the Gulf of Carpentaria  Sever fever inflicted the residents  and the fever victims were evacuated to Sweers Island  The majority of the population of Burketown was relocated in   to Sweers Island where a township called Carnarvon was established  With the establishment of a permanent residence of European people at Carnarvon on Sweers Island between   and   the Kaiadilt traditional owners were forced to retreat to Bentinck Island  but still visited their country on Sweers Island  William Landsborough  police magistrate  gave accounts of increasingly tense encounters with them on Sweers  Fowler and Bentinck Islands in    The relationship between the Kaiadilt and the European population of Sweers Island deteriorated with the kidnappings of Aboriginal children in   and a violent encounter between the Kaiadilt and government officers in October    Two Kaiadilt men were killed after their group refused to leave Sweers Island while fishing and gathering food there  Historical evidence indicates that the Kaiadilt similarly resisted attempts by the European outsiders to land on Bentinck Island  By mid   the population of Carnarvon had declined to ten residents with the emergence of Normanton as the centre of regional administration  Shortly after  in   the settlement of Carnarvon was abandoned just six years after it was established  The departure of Europeans from Carnarvon allowed the Kaiadilt to return to Sweers Island without interference  When Captain Pennefather in the Pearl landed on Sweers Island in   he recorded seeing  a large mob of natives  who did not allow us to approach them  the Kaiadilt had reclaimed their island  With the revival of the pastoral industry in the Burke District in the early  s  the town of Burketown developed  leading to the Indigenous population of town camps growing to more than   by the late  s  Unlike the Kaiadilt people s intense period of contact with Europeans between   and   the Indigenous inhabitants of Mornington Island and other islands of the Wellesley Group experienced minimal interaction with outsiders during the  th century  In   the Aboriginal Protection and restriction of the Sale of Opium Act  Qld  was enacted  Dr Walter Roth was appointed the Northern Protector of Aboriginals  In   Dr Roth undertook extended visits to Sweers and Bentinck Islands  He also landed at Mornington Island  On this initial visit Roth described stone dams a little to the south of Raft Point on Bentinck Island  He also observed melo shells used for carrying food  shell cutting and scraping tools  wells  sleeping hollows  an alley way for the purpose of trapping dugong on the south west shore of Bentinck Island  and ground ochre in a wooden trough  He observed sleeping hollows  camp fires  and shells used for water carrying on Mornington Island  On Allen Island he observed stone wall fish traps  shells used for water carriers  camp remains with abundant dugong bones  shell scrapers  wells  Roth returned to the Wellesley Islands in   and    He did not make any direct contact with the Kaiadilt  but visited other islands and made contact with a group of Aboriginal peoples on Forsyth Island  One outcome of Roth s visits to the region was the gazettal in   of a Reserve for Aboriginal inhabitants under the provisions of the Land Act    Qld  comprising all the islands in the Wellesley group save for Sweers Island  In   a reserve for the use of the Indigenous inhabitants of the State was declared in respect of Sweers Island  exclusive of freehold allotments in the town of Carnarvon and streets giving access thereto  Roth s successor  Richard Howard  visited the Wellesleys on several occasions and described the Lardil as  isolated  giving no trouble whatsoever to anyone but living their primitive life contentedly after their own fashion   This relative lack of contact with the area s Indigenous inhabitants continued until   when a Presbyterian Mission was established on the south western side of Mornington Island  Despite the development of the Mission into a small but well defined settlement by the early  s  the Superintendent of the Mission RH Wilson noted in   the continuing traditional practices of the Lardil people on the Island  observing that      There are about   people who could be classed as semi nomadic  They visit the Station at frequent intervals  coming in almost every week end  These people carry on a system of barter and bring fish  native roots and berries for which they receive clothing  fish lines  hooks and other such articles  In this way a supply of native foods is secured for the regular Mission inmates  We are thus kept in regular touch with these people and are able to give medical attention  food and clothing in case of need       As noted by Dr Blake in his History Report filed in these proceedings  the policy of forced removal of Aboriginal people both from and to Mornington Island between the late  s and   had relatively little impact on the Lardil  who continued to maintain their cultural and social homogeneity in comparison with many other Aboriginal groups throughout Queensland  By the late  s  Mornington Island Mission comprised the Lardil and neighbouring Yangkaal and a few individuals from mainland gulf groups  Despite systemic attempts by Sweers Islands settlers to eliminate the Kaiadilt people from Bentinck Island in   the Kaiadilt continued to live on Bentinck until the mid  s  when they were finally brought to Mornington Island  Once there  they formed their own camp and continued to maintain their distinct cultural identity  It should also be noted that during the first half of the  th century Gangalidda people  though coming to live in camps on pastoral stations and at Burketown  as well as at the Dumaji Mission established in   continued to move around the coastal country  at least into the  s and  s  Such occupation of the Gangalidda coastal lands entailed considerable movement among people and this included some travel via traditional watercraft between the mainland and the North Wellesley Islands  Waters relatively near to the beach were routinely used for obtaining foods and other resources  In   the reserve created in   in respect of the Wellesley group of islands and amended in   was rescinded and in its place a lease granted to the Mornington Island Shire Council for a period of   years under the Local Government  Aboriginal Lands  Act    Qld   On   August   the reserve with respect to Sweers Island  created in   was placed under the control of the Under Secretary  Department of Community Services and Ethnic Affairs as trustee  The reserve was repealed in    In   a deed of grant in trust under the Aboriginal Land Act    Qld  was granted to the Kaiadilt Aboriginal Corporation as trustee in respect of Sweers  Fowler  Bentinck  Albinia  Little Allen  Horseshoe  Margaret  Bessie and Douglas Islands  At the same time a deed of grant in trust was also granted to the Ngaarrkinaba Mildiji Aboriginal Corporation as trustee in respect of Allen Island   In addition to the extensive and detailed history that has been considered  I also note that the State of Queensland  the State  in its written submissions in support of the Determination  indicates that it has taken notice of Cooper J s findings in Lardil   The State goes on to say that  during the mediation  it raised with the Applicant certain issues with regard to the Connection Material that required further consideration  Supplementary material was provided by the Applicant  to satisfy the State s concerns   As noted  Cooper J in Lardil considered in some detail the connection of those persons he determined to hold native title to land and waters of the area within the external boundary of the Determination Area  In doing so  his Honour had the benefit of the following expert reports    Dr Paul Memmot  Report on the Lardil and Yangkaal People       Dr Paul Memmot  Report on the Lardil and Yangkaal People  Appendix   Genealogies       Dr Nicholas Evans  Report on Kaiadilt People       Dr Nicholas Evans and Penelope Johnson  Wellesley Islands Sea Claim  Kaiadilt Genealogies       Dr David Trigger  Report on Gangalidda People       Dr David Trigger  Wellesley Native Title Sea Claim Gangalidda People Genealogies       Dr Paul Memmot and Dr Nicholas Evans  Report on Sacred Sites in the Wellesley Islands   Vol    and Vol        Dr Thom Blake  Historical Report Wellesley Islands Sea Claim     and    Dr Richard Robins  Literature Survey of Information relating to the Archaeology of the Southern Gulf of Carpentaria and the Wellesley Islands       Cooper J found  at   and   that at and since sovereignty the Lardil  Yangkaal  Kaiadilt and Gangalidda people have existed as culturally separate groups of indigenous people who are direct descendants of the original people who had inhabited the Determination Area   The Applicant s submissions identify   descent groups of the Gangalidda People    descent groups of the Lardil People    descent groups of the Yangkaal People  and   descent groups of the Kaiadilt People  Schedule   to the Proposed Determination further describes the Native Title holders   In addition to the above  the Applicant s submissions argue that  the most significant evidence of occupation by the Applicant in the Determination Area prior to sovereignty is the evidence of the present day claimants themselves   This is a reference to the oral histories of the witnesses who gave evidence before Cooper J  which demonstrate the pre contact connection with the Determination Area  The submissions also note a number of significant individuals within the claim group all of whom     identify their ancestors as Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalildda or Kaiadilt People  and were spoken to in the traditional languages of those peoples  They grew up on the proposed Determination Area and were shown its places and told names by their ancestors  all of whom asserted they were the traditional owners of the area  The people who gave them that information were  in many instances  alive before contact with white people   In those circumstances  the Applicant argues     there can be little reason to doubt the oral tradition of the Applicant group that it comprises the descendants of the people in occupation of the proposed Determination Area at sovereignty   Having regard to the evidence provided by the eminent anthropological experts  and to the findings of Cooper J  I am satisfied that the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt People in these proceedings are descended from indigenous people who were in occupation of the Determination Area  at sovereignty   In their submissions  the Applicant submits that on the basis of the Connection Material provided to the Court        the Court can also be satisfied that each of the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt people have maintained a normative system of laws  customs and beliefs that form part of an integral part of their continuing spiritual connection to the proposed Determination Area from the date of sovereignty until the present  These laws  customs and beliefs are rooted in the pre sovereignty society of the Applicant group  While there are some variations between the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt people as to the specific details of the spiritual  religious and cultural relationships that they have with their traditional country  there are significant features common to each   Cooper J considered a very large body of evidence as to the existence of and identification of the laws and customs  From those laws and customs  Cooper J  at     identified the rights and interests that have survived the assertion of sovereignty   Having considered the extensive material provided by the Applicant  as well as the material judicially considered by Cooper J  I am satisfied that the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt people have maintained a connection with the land and waters the subject of the Proposed Determination  and that their body of traditional laws and customs support the rights and interests recognised at Orders   to   in the Proposed Determination   In their submissions  the Applicant also sets out evidence of the claim group s continued maintenance of a system of land and sea tenure  and the system of law and custom under which the traditional country is divided into estates  and through which the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt people organise and regulate rights and interests in their traditional countries   The evidence demonstrates that the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and Kaiadilt people have established and maintained a system of laws and customs over their country the land and waters the subject of the Determination Area sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Act  I am satisfied that native title exists in those areas  which are described in Schedules    A   B and   to the Orders  Orders     and Schedule   to the Proposed Determination delineates those sub areas within the Determination Area in respect of which each of the Lardil  Yangkaal  Gangalidda and or Kaiadilt people respectively hold native title   Paragraph  a  deals with the identification of the persons holding the common or group rights comprising the native title  This is set out Schedule   to the Determination  The State s submissions refer to an examination of the Connection Material and state that due regard has been had to the findings of Cooper J in Lardil   The State concludes that it is     satisfied that the identity of the Native Title holders set out in Schedule   of the proposed Consent Determination is established by the connection material provided on behalf of the Applicant   Paragraph  b  deals with the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the Determination Area and is set out in orders   to    The State  in its submissions  states that it      is satisfied that the native title rights and interests set out in paragraphs   to   of the proposed Consent Determination are possessed under traditional laws and customs as described in the connection material provided on behalf of the Applicant   Paragraph  c  deals with the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the Determination Area  This is set out in Order   and Schedule    The State has undertaken a careful assessment of historical and current information involving tenures granted or issued by the State to assist in the identification of other interests citedLovett  on behalf of the Gunditjmara People  v Victoria   FCA  http www austlii edu
