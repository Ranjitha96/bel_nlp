Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV Mawashi Al Gasseem   No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The operation of O  A r  c  was considered by Kiefel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd   FCA    Her Honour  at   held that the rule deems a respondent to have admitted the facts alleged in a statement of claim  but not to have conceded the entitlement to the relief sought  Order   r   of the Rules also has the effect of the owner and the vessel being deemed to have admitted the facts alleged in the statement of claim   The power under O  A r   is discretionary  In this instance  I have no hesitation in exercising that power in respect of the claim for judgment for a liquidated sum  The owner and the vessel have never disputed that the claimed sums were advanced and have not been repaid  There is now nothing to suggest that the owner or the vessel has any defence to the claim  Indeed  the owner at material times acknowledged its indebtedness to the plaintiff and to others  The calculation of interest to date has been made in accordance with the pleaded terms of the agreement and the mortgage  and which are both in evidence  and has been verified by affidavit   Kiefel J in Dataline   FCA   expressed the issue pithily in the following terms at     The question is whether declarations should be made on deemed admissions  given that there has been no adjudication by the Court on the facts and the declarations may give the impression that there has   Dataline   FCA   concerned alleged unconscionable conduct by a supplier of internet related services contrary to s  AC of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and of misleading and deceptive conduct contrary to s   of that Act  Justice Kiefel made declaratory and injunctive orders  and imposed pecuniary penalties  under O  A r  c  of the Rules  The respondents had failed to comply with various interlocutory orders and their defence was struck out   Justice Kiefel at     discussed the terms of O  A of the Rules and their analogues in the various Supreme Court Rules for judgment in default of appearance or defence  I respectfully adopt her Honour s comments and conclusions  I do not need to repeat them  Her Honour concluded that O  A r  c  operates so that the allegations of fact in the statement of claim are taken to be admitted  so that the Court then has the power to grant such relief as it considers appropriate on the basis of those deemed admissions  Fairness in the conduct of litigation may require a defaulting respondent to be informed if the relief sought differs materially from that sought in the application  and for the respondent to be given an opportunity to respond to the claim for that more extensive or different relief  No such problem arises in this matter  the relief sought is that claimed in the application  Moreover  although the deemed admissions provide the basis for the relief proposed  her Honour considered that further affidavit evidence may be adduced to support the relief claimed  but not so as to alter the pleaded case  at     As the power in O   r  c  is discretionary as to whether relief as sought should be granted  additional affidavit evidence to support the exercise of the discretion is in my view clearly admissible  subject to her Honour s qualification that it does not alter the pleaded case   Considerations particular to granting declaratory relief under O   r  c  were discussed by Kiefel J at      Again  I respectfully adopt and agree with her Honour s views  In that case  her Honour at   said    It may no longer be correct to have a practice which operates as a prohibition in every case of default and preferable to consider the circumstances pertaining to the particular case and the purpose and effect of the declaration  Millett J made declaratory orders in Patten v Burke Publishing Co Ltd     WLR   where justice to the plaintiff required it  The order however operated principally inter partes and it might be doubted whether it would be of interest to other persons  Cases such as this  involving the protection of consumers  are of public interest  Declarations are often utilised in such cases to identify for the public what conduct contributes  sic  constitutes  a contravention and to make apparent that it is considered to warrant an order recognising its seriousness  It is however important that there be no misunderstanding as to the basis upon which they are made  This could be overcome by a statement  preceding the declarations  that orders are made   upon admissions which  the respondent in question  is taken to have made  consequent upon non compliance with orders of the Court     original emphasis  I have reached the view that I should make the declaratory order sought on the basis of the deemed admissions  and in the light of the additional material relied on by the plaintiff  I have had regard to the background to the action  the nature of the claim  as deemed to be admitted  the apparent strength of the plaintiff s claim  the opportunity of others who may be directly affected by the declaration to have participated in the action  and the interests of fairness to the plaintiff and to others   I shall briefly explain my consideration of those matters citedAinsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA
