discussed by Hely J in Croker v Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Australia   FCA   at         In that case  his Honour did not consider it appropriate to convene and refer the application for

Guarantee Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Both these decisions considered a contrary approach to that expressed by Beaumont J in Endormer Pty Ltd  in liquidation  v Australian Guarantee Corporation Ltd   FCA     in which his Honour held that the jurisdiction to order security for costs of an appeal should more properly be exercised by a Full Court   In my view  a single Judge has jurisdiction to hear an application and  in the present case  it is appropriate to do so rather than convene a Full Court to hear the application for security for costs  Moreover  having heard the matter over several days  I am familiar with the background of the matter appliedKeating v Morris   Ors  Moynihan J  Supreme Court of Queensland    September   unreported  It was submitted by Mr Anthony Morris QC for Mr Cooper that  as I had previously expressed adverse views as to the credit of some witnesses in the matter  there may be a perception of apprehended bias and I should therefore consider disqualifying myself from hearing the application for security for costs  I have considered the principles set forth in the decision in Keating v Morris   Ors  Moynihan J  Supreme Court of Queensland    September   unreported  at        It does not follow simply from my rejection of certain evidence and preference for other evidence that  without more  there is any basis for a perception by a reasonable informed observer that I may be perceived to be affected by apprehended bias on this application for security for costs  Therefore  I reject this submission   The record companies have filed an affidavit by Mr Michael Williams  solicitor for the record companies  dated   March    The file number on the copy of this affidavit on the Court file does not refer to the number assigned to the particular appeals  but to the number assigned to the matter at first instance  In my view  nothing turns on this  as the affidavit was accompanied by two notices of motion  one in NSD   of   and the other in NSD   of   in identical terms  I mention these matters because counsel for E Talk and Mr Bal has contended that it is inappropriate  without a Court order  that evidence on one application for security for costs should be evidence on the other  I do not accept this submission and I make an order that  since the evidence relates to both applications  it may be used in each   Counsel for E Talk and Mr Bal also submits that evidence in the affidavit of Mr Williams which does not pertain to the circumstances of E Talk and Mr Bal should be rejected as against them  I accept this submission  and I have read and used the affidavit only in relation to the particular appellants in question  The form of the affidavit makes it clear which paragraphs relate to each of the appeals and which relate to common matters referred toCowell v Taylor     Ch D   The Court has a wide discretion in relation to the grant of security for costs  There is no general rule because each case depends upon its own circumstances  In relation to an appeal  Courts have given weight to the injustice that might be caused to a successful litigant if the litigant is compelled to contest the matter for a second time without the probability of obtaining the costs if ultimately successful  Cowell v Taylor     Ch D   at    In Equity Access v Westpac Banking Corp
