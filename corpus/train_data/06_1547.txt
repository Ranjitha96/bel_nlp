SZFQW v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Notice of Appeal alleging a breach of the requirements of s  A of the Act was dismissed by Barnes FM in her reasons for judgment  Her Honour said in par          when one considers the Tribunal s reasons for decision  it is apparent that the reason for the Tribunal s findings  including its ultimate finding of a lack of satisfaction that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution  and hence was a person to whom Australia had protection obligations  was based on the inadequacy of the claims and the material submitted by the applicant  The Tribunal referred to the scant details of the applicant s claims and gave examples of such inadequacy    Her Honour continued at par      This is not a case in which the Tribunal purported to rely on any inconsistencies between what appeared in the protection visa application and in the applicant s claims as made to the Tribunal  Rather the decision turned on the inadequacy of the materials provided  In such circumstances  as in SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs       FCA    SZEZI    it cannot be said that there is information which forms the reason or part of the reason for affirming a decision under review subject to the operation of the obligation in section  A     Her Honour referred to the decision of Allsop J in SZEZI and accepted the application of his Honour s comments to the case before her Honour  where Allsop J had said  at par          The Tribunal  having read all the material and having evaluated its content and weight  was unable to reach a specified mental state  It was not satisfied that the appellant had a well founded fear because of subjectively perceived inadequacies in the information  The reason for the decision was simply  and no more than  the evaluative conclusion founded upon the perceived inadequacy of the information  in the sense of an absence of detail and intrinsic explanation which had been invited  It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision  It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason  referred toSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Later her Honour said at par   after having referred to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC        In this case it was the inadequacy of information alone which provided the basis for the Tribunal decision    Her Honour concluded     No failure to comply with s  A  of the Migration Act is established on the material before the Court   Barnes FM was correct to so find  The material before the Court does not disclose any reviewable error in the decision of Barnes FM   The appeal of the appellant is dismissed
