judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court on the ground that the Tribunal breached any or all of ss     and   of the Act  Nor has he particularised the way or ways in which he now alleges that the Tribunal breached those sections  As I can see no apparent merit in the submission that the Tribunal breached those sections I do not consider it expedient in the interests of justice to grant the appellant leave to rely in this Court on a ground not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court   Carey Hazell v Getz Bros   Co  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at       To the extent that the appellant continues to submit that the Tribunal overlooked his claim to fear persecution in India on the specific ground that he had stored ammunition for the BK  I see no error in the way in which the Federal Magistrate dealt with this submission   I am unable to identify any substance in the second ground of appeal referred toCurragh Queensland Mining Ltd v Daniel     FCR   Information will  it seems to me  have been a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review if it provided the basis  or part of the basis  for any finding that formed an essential link in the chain of reasoning that led the Tribunal to affirm the decision under review  cf Curragh Queensland Mining Ltd v Daniel     FCR   at     per Black CJ    The present case is one in which it is not easy to ascertain precisely the Tribunal s reason  or the constituent parts of the Tribunal s reason  for affirming the decision under review  In particular it is not easy to ascertain whether the information provided in the appellant s visa application provided the basis for any finding that formed an essential link in the chain of reasoning that led the Tribunal to affirm the decision of the delegate   The final link in the Tribunal s chain of reasoning was that it was not satisfied that the appellant s fear of persecution by the Indian authorities was well founded  The Tribunal gave two immediate reasons for its lack of satisfaction in this regard  First  that there have been significant changes in the Punjab with the consequence that Sikh militancy is no longer active and even militants who have served their sentences live a normal life  Secondly  that the Tribunal did not accept that the police or the authorities generally were looking for the appellant when he left India or subsequently  There is no reason to think that the information provided in the appellant s visa application provided the basis for the Tribunal s findings concerning changes in the Punjab or the authorities  apparent lack of interest in the appellant   However  it is necessary to  unbundle  the Tribunal s reasons for decision to determine which of the grounds upon which the appellant claimed to fear persecution the Tribunal had in contemplation when it concluded that it was not satisfied that his fear was well founded  It seems clear enough that the Tribunal had in contemplation the appellant s claim that BK hid ammunition on his property and his claim that he had fed BK members because it stated that it was prepared to accept those claims  see   above   However  it is far from clear that the Tribunal had in contemplation his claim to have been a member of BK   The preferable view  in my opinion  is that the Tribunal did not have in contemplation the appellant s claim to have been a member of BK when it concluded that it was not satisfied that his fear of persecution was well founded  I have formed this view on two bases  First  the Tribunal had earlier explicitly rejected his claim to have been a member of BK  By contrast  it was prepared to accept  for the present purpose  other aspects of the appellant s claims notwithstanding that it found them difficult to accept  Secondly  the Tribunal referred to militants  who have served their sentences  living a normal life in the Punjab now  The inference arises that the Tribunal did not turn its mind to whether it was satisfied that BK members or former members  or militants generally  who had not been charged or sentenced were living a normal life in the Punjab now citedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As Weinberg J pointed out in SZEEU   ALR at   the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   by majority held that s  A requires the Tribunal  at the hearing stage  to give the applicant written notice of any information that would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review and that any breach of the requirements of the section will constitute jurisdictional error   Allsop J pointed out in SZEEU   ALR at   that the decision of the High Court in SAAP   HCA       ALR   requires some aspects of the analysis in VAF   ALR   to be rejected  However  I do not understand the authority of the above passage from VAF to have been generally undermined  Nonetheless  their Honours  reference to the  integral  and the  inessential  must be understood more strictly than may originally have been intended  The critical question is whether the information in question was a part  that is  any part  of the reason for affirming the decision   SZEEU   ALR per Allsop J at     The task of ascertaining what was the Tribunal s reason  or the constituent parts of the Tribunal s reason  for affirming the decision under review may not be an easy one  It will require the reasons for decision of the Tribunal to be analysed with care  Ordinarily any statement made by the Tribunal in its written reasons for decision concerning its reason for affirming the decision will carry considerable weight  However  a statement of this kind will not necessarily be determinative  On an application for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal it is for the court itself to determine what was the Tribunal s reason  or as appropriate the constituent parts of the reason  for affirming the decision under review  In doing so the court must remember that in SAAP   HCA       ALR   the majority made clear that it was not appropriate to engage in an evaluative analysis of the triviality  or alternatively the seriousness  of the failure to observe the requirements of s  A  see per McHugh J at   Kirby J at   and Hayne J at   appliedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In context it is clear that the Tribunal s reference to the appellant s  written evidence  is a reference to information provided by him in his protection visa application  I interpolate that if the Tribunal considered that information in the appellant s protection visa application would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming the decision that it was reviewing  it was obliged to give him particulars of that information and assure  as far as reasonably practicable  that he understood why it was relevant to the review   SZEEU v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR     After giving particulars of inconsistencies in the appellant s oral evidence the reasons for decision of the Tribunal state     Although much of the  appellant s  evidence is very unreliable  for the present purpose  the Tribunal prefers the  appellant s  oral evidence as it was given directly to the Tribunal under oath and the Tribunal had the opportunity to at least try and explore and clarify his claims and evidence      The Tribunal s statement of preference for the appellant s oral evidence must be understood to mean that the Tribunal found the appellant s claims as outlined in his oral evidence to be the claims on which the appellant relied and which it was required to consider  The statement does not in context imply complete acceptance of the appellant s oral evidence   The view formed by the Tribunal of the claims made by the appellant in his oral evidence is recorded in the following passage from the Tribunal s reasons for decision     Considering the  appellant s  claims and evidence to this Tribunal  the Tribunal is not satisfied that the  appellant  was a member of BK as claimed as his other oral evidence to this Tribunal about his BK activities does not support the claim that he was a member rather than a  possibly reluctant  supporter  However  although the  appellant  could only say that an unknown amount of ammunition was hidden in a corner of his home by BK and despite police searches it wasn t found  the Tribunal is prepared to accept that BK hid some ammunition at the  appellant s  home during the violent separatist campaign in the Punjab in the  s and early  s  that the  appellant  gave food to BK persons on occasions during those years  as Sikh civilian commonly did  but that the  appellant  did nothing else in relation to BK or any other militant group  The Tribunal also accepts that BK removed the ammunition in   and he had no further contact with them      In considering the  appellant s  claims of detention and torture or beatings  the Tribunal accepts as plausible his claim about the November   detention as independent country information is that at the time of Mrs Gandhi s assassination  many Sikhs were detained  interrogated and tortured  Also the  appellant s  claim about this has been consistently presented  The Tribunal has much more difficulty with his claim to have been detained and tortured in October   in relation to the Beant Singh assassination  because his evidence about this is inconsistent  in written evidence he said he was detained for four days and interrogated but he does not claim to have been mistreated or tortured  in oral evidence to the first Tribunal he said the last time he was detained was in   but in oral evidence to this Tribunal he said that on   October   he was detained and beaten  Also  the Tribunal finds the claim difficult to accept given that the Beant Singh assassination had occurred well over a year earlier  However  for the present purpose  the Tribunal also accepts that the  appellant  was detained in October   for a few days and tortured or at least seriously mistreated  The Tribunal accepts that in being tortured or beaten  the  appellant  suffered a broken wrist  broken leg and lower back injury  and that such harm was so serious as to amount to persecution within the meaning of the Convention  and that it occurred for reason of his actual or imputed political opinion in support of militants  The Tribunal also accepts that on a couple of other occasions  in   and   the  appellant  was detained for a few days  interrogated and verbally abused but not physically mistreated  and that this too was for reasons of his actual or imputed political opinion  Despite the unsatisfactory nature of the  appellant s  evidence the Tribunal has accepted these claims because they are generally consistent with independent country information about the treatment of ordinary Sikhs  as well as Hindus in the Punjab at the time  by the Punjab police during the violence of the  s and early  s    emphasis added  As Weinberg J pointed out in SZEEU   ALR at   the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   by majority held that s  A requires the Tribunal  at the hearing stage  to give the applicant written notice of any information that would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review and that any breach of the requirements of the section will constitute jurisdictional error   Whether particular information was a reason or a part of the reason for a decision of a Tribunal to affirm a decision of a delegate is generally to be determined by reference to the reasons for decision of the Tribunal which may need to be  unbundled  to reveal that reason  or the parts of that reason   SZEEU   ALR per Allsop J  with whom Weinberg J agreed  at       In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   a case decided earlier than SZEEU   FCAFC       ALR     Finn and Stone JJ at   had observed     It commonly is the case that the detail and complexity of the case advanced by a visa applicant  and the information that is given and garnered for the purposes of considering it  results in the Tribunal being confronted with issues that may be of varying importance  relevance and centrality both to the decision to be taken and to the reasoning that in the event sustains that decision  While the reasoning process may advert to  and express views on  such issues  all will not necessarily constitute part of the reason for the Tribunal s decision  Tribunals  no less than courts  engage in their own species of dicta often enough for reasons related to haste and pressure in composition  When a Tribunal s reasons are to be evaluated for s  A  purposes  the Court as a matter of judgment is required to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunal s decision  That task  necessarily  is an interpretative one  In some instances the differentiation of the integral and the inessential may be by no means easy    and made the more so by less than explicit indications in the reasons themselves as to what the Tribunal itself considered to be integral   Allsop J pointed out in SZEEU   ALR at   that the decision of the High Court in SAAP   HCA       ALR   requires some aspects of
