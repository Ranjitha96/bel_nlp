grounds of appeal were in the following terms           Federal Magistrate grossly breached the rules procedural fairness  and also appellant s fundamental right to be heard  by refusing to consider the written submission made by the appellant on the date of final hearing while taking oral submissions made by the legal representatives for the first respondent   sic       Federal Magistrate erred in law by rejecting to apply the law created by the High Court in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   and instead applying a Federal Court cases MIMA v Lay Lat   FCAFC   and SZCIJ v MIMA   FCAFC    This is contrary to the fact that the High Court applied   Kioa  in recent refugee cases in   and     sic       Federal Magistrate erred in law by ignoring the submission that the tribunal breached the s  A thus the tribunal committed an jurisdictional error   sic       Federal Magistrate erred in law in her finding that the appellant is entitled to  limited  rules of procedural fairness  Appellant says that this is contrary to the findings of High Court in cases such as VEAL v MIMA   HCA     SAAP v MIMA   HCA     SZBEL v MIMA   HCA     and NAFF v MIMA   HCA     sic    PARTICULARS    Federal magistrate found that the appellant is not entitled to the rules of procedural fairness established by the High Court of Australia  instead the appellant s only entitlement in procedural fairness is limited to the sections of the Act         Federal Magistrate erred in law by ignoring an important procedural fairness issue raised in the application to the court  in particular the appellant complained that  the tribunal member while taking evidence did not allow the appellant to refer to his written notes and still regarded appellant s changed memory of date of assault  April   and later April   was a serious mistake    sic       Federal Magistrate erred in law by finding that the tribunal is entitled to obtain the independent information from whatever the sources it chooses   sic  This is a serious misreading of s   of the Migration Act        I will now deal with each of the grounds of appeal in turn   In dealing with ground   of the judicial review application in which the appellant had alleged failure by the Tribunal to comply with s  A   the learned Federal Magistrate noted that he had referred in his written submissions to various extracts from judgments of the High Court in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR    She said  at       Counsel for the First Respondent correctly submitted that the common law principles of procedural fairness identified by the High Court in Kioa are not necessarily applicable to the proceeding before this Court  Section  B of the Act has the effect that all that is required of the Tribunal in so far as procedural fairness is concerned is to comply with the provisions of the Act   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat     FCAFC       FCR   and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC    Accordingly  the Applicant s written submissions referring to the common law rule of procedural fairness are misconceived in so far as they relate to the matter before this Court   No separate submissions were made in respect of this appeal ground  It appears to be a revisiting of the Kioa   HCA       CLR   point  The scope of the hearing rule aspect of the rules of procedural fairness is limited by s  B as already discussed  This ground therefore fails   No submission was made in support of this ground  No factual basis for it was identified  This ground fails   The appellant referred to s   empowering the Tribunal to obtain any information that it considers relevant  He contended that this did not authorise the Tribunal to get any information from any source  In this respect there is no basis for the contention that the Tribunal or the learned magistrate erred  In so saying I would express my concern about the quality of some of the information on which the Tribunal acted  A six year old report of a telephone conversation between somebody unknown in a Canadian agency  with somebody unknown in an American University  might not be thought to provide a particularly solid foundation for an important administrative decision which could affect the life or liberty of the person concerned  In fairness however  it must be acknowledged that the independent evidence relating to the treatment of Burghers in Sri Lanka was peripheral to the case and relevant to a matter which the Tribunal raised as a possible basis for the grant of a protection visa  The matter of persecution on the grounds of ethnicity had not been raised by the appellant followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lat   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu
