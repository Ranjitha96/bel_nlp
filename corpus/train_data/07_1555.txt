for Ms Bahonko to seek to suspend the resolution of the substantive applications by seeking a stay of para   of the Substantive Orders dealing with submissions on costs  In any event  the Costs Orders were made by Jessup J on   August    There is no utility in Ms Bahonko seeking leave to appeal from Goldberg J s refusal to stay para   of the Substantive Orders appliedYoung v Secretary for Department of Family and Community Services     ALD   Ms Bahonko in her affidavit of   September   and during the course of her oral submissions  made allegations which are properly described as scandalous  They include allegations of criminal conduct and conduct constituting abuse of office  Those allegations are unsupported and insupportable  Ms Bahonko submitted that she required access to the transcript of the hearing before Goldberg J to make good her allegations  That access is refused on a number of bases  First  access to transcript has never been regarded as an indisputable requirement of a fair trial  see Young v Secretary for Department of Family and Community Services     ALD   at    Secondly  the hearing before Goldberg J did not involve viva voce evidence  Both parties were present at the hearing and made submissions  Moreover  by reason of the nature of the application before me  an application for leave to appeal from the orders of Goldberg J  it was necessary for me to consider the correctness of the decision of Goldberg J  As stated above  that decision is not attended with any doubt  Access to the transcript of proceedings before Goldberg J would be futile  For those reasons  access is refused   In the circumstances  I would not grant Ms Bahonko leave to appeal Goldberg J s refusal to grant a stay of the Substantive Orders  I would dismiss paras     and   of the Notice of Motion and order Ms Bahonko to pay the respondents  costs of and incidental to those paragraphs in the Notice of Motion   Finally  there was no doubt that Goldberg J correctly refused to grant an injunction in the alternative to a grant of a stay  As Goldberg J said the appropriate process was for Ms Bahonko to appeal against the Substantive Orders and the Costs Orders  as she has now done
