of the existence of the disputed debt is required appliedAussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd     ACSR   There is a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court and other Australian Courts that the Court has no power to extend the time for compliance after it has expired  Aussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd     ACSR   and G J Gears Australia Pty Ltd v Brobo Group Pty Ltd     ALR   at   to   and the authorities referred to therein   In Aussie Vic Plant Hire   the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria considered that body of authority  Chernov JA considered that the policy of Pt     of the Act and the mischief which s  F a i  seeks to abrogate makes it implicit that the Court is not empowered to extend the time for compliance with a statutory demand after the period has expired  His Honour considered that Pt     of the Act is a code which provides a strict and self executing regime       Maxwell P and Neave JA disagreed    to    Nettle and Ashley JJA  the remaining members of the Court of Appeal  concluded that as a matter of statutory construction of the Act and  in particular s  F a i  of the Act   read with s     an application to extend time for compliance with a statutory demand may be made under s  F a i  after the time for compliance has expired      and      However  their Honours did not the permit the time for compliance with the statutory demand to be extended after the period had expired on the basis that the view  that the Court has no power to extend the time for compliance after it has expired  had existed for more than   years and one could not say  positively that it was wrong and productive of inconvenience     The High Court granted special leave to appeal  The appeal was heard on   February   and the decision reserved   Consistent with the approach adopted by Nettle and Ashley JJA  I would not permit the time for Ox Operations to comply with the statutory demand to be extended  The period has expired  On that basis  the application for review has no utility and should be dismissed   However  in order to deal with all issues and to avoid unnecessary costs  in the event that the High Court considers that s  F a i  of the Act  whether read alone or in conjunction with other provision of the Act   enables a Court to extend the time for compliance with a statutory demand after it has expired  I propose to deal with the merits of Ox Operations application to set aside LMPD s statutory demand pursuant to ss  G and  H of the Act  citedCrown Joinery Pty Ltd v

applicable to a notice to produce  Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd   VSC   and Crown Joinery Pty Ltd v Lyleho Pty Ltd   VSC    The grounds on which a notice to produce

html  The principles to be applied by the Court in determining an application to set aside a statutory demand are not in dispute  In the present case  the Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between Ox Operations and LMPD about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates  s  H a  of the Act   For a genuine dispute to exist  the dispute must  be bona fide and truly exist in fact   The grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute must be  real and not spurious  hypothetical  illusory or misconceived  Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G M Aldridge Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   citedValoutin Pty Ltd v Furst     ALR   As the liquidator of LMPD submitted  the starting point is s   of the Act   Section   is a facilitative provision which has been given a broad interpretation  Valoutin Pty Ltd v Furst     ALR   at     It provides that          A book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of this Act is admissible in evidence in any proceeding and is prima facie evidence of any matter stated or recorded in the book                        A document purporting to be a book kept by a body corporate is  unless the contrary is proved  taken to be a book kept as mentioned in subsection      Books  is defined in s   of the Act to include       a  a register  and      b  any other record of information  and              c  financial reports or financial records  however compiled  recorded or stored  and              d  a document      but does not include an index or recording made under Subdivision D of Division   of Part     referred toWalsh v Salzer Constructions Pty Ltd   VSCA  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  html  Ox Operations  written submissions referred to Walsh v Salzer Constructions Pty Ltd   VSCA   as support for the proposition that the fact that a company acts as a treasurer for other entities within the same group does not by itself give rise to a debtor creditor relationship  So much may be accepted  But that is not the only relevant fact in this application  The more significant fact is the existence of the prima facie position reflected in the general ledger of LMPD a loan to Ox Operations  The decision may be put to one side   For those reasons  I do not accept that the first ground of challenge raises a genuine dispute   On review  Ox Operations also sought to set aside the statutory demand on a second basis  that Ox Operations was not indebted to LMPD and that the general ledger did not and could not reflect the true position
