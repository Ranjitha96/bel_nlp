www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlHowever  it is necessary to consider the construction of the NTNER Act  including s   to determine whether the exercise of the power under s   is one which is

Jacobs J  There are some general features of the NTNER Act which provide the context for the particular issue  as well as the general context in which it came to be enacted  Its object under s   is to improve the well being of certain communities in the Northern Territory  It specifies by s   and Schedule   the  prescribed areas  to which it applies  they expressly include the Alice Springs town camps  cl   of Part   of Schedule    It is therefore clear that the NTNER Act reflects the legislative view that improving the well being of the residents of the town camps  including by improving their living conditions  is a significant element of the response to the  national emergency   The events leading to these proceedings  set out above  show that the Minister had the desire to bring the accommodation and other infrastructure and services in the town camps to the level available to all Australians  Division   of Part   of the NTNER Act deals specifically with the acquisition of rights  titles and interests relating to the town camps  Subdivisions A and B deal with resumption and forfeiture of leases or land under the SPL Act and the CL Act respectively  In each instance  the Minister is given the powers of the Northern Territory Minister or Administrator in relation to resumption and forfeiture of such leases or land citedVanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlAs the Minister points out  that process contrasts sharply with the process specified for the compulsory acquisition of land under the Lands Acquisition Act    Cth   Under that process  persons whose interests are affected are given an opportunity to be heard before the decision to acquire the land is finally made  Indeed  section   of the NTNER Act provides  inter alia  that ss   and   have effect despite anything contained in the Lands Acquistion Act    Cth   Section   more generally provides  inter alia  that ss   and   have effect despite any other law of the Commonwealth or of the Northern Territory  whether written or unwritten  The express reference in s   to  written or unwritten  laws is  in my view  an expression of the intention that the provisions in  relevantly  Division   of Part   of the NTNER Act  including s   are not to be taken to carry within them the rules of procedural fairness in the face of the meaning of  for example  s   as construed in its terms and in its statutory content  Whilst s   does not  in express terms  exclude the obligation to give procedural fairness when a decision under s   is contemplated  in conjunction with the other provisions to which I have referred that is  I think  the necessary intention of the legislature  See also Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council   NSWCA         NSWLR   per Spigelman CJ at      In my judgment  s   in its terms and in its context demonstrates an intention that the rules of procedural fairness  relevantly here at least reasonable

  HCA         CLR     Gleeson CJ at     referred to the  very breadth of the statutory power  as an argument in favour of inferring the intention to preserve procedural fairness in the making of the decision then under challenge  under s   of the Police Service Act    NSW   In the case of s   of the NTNER Act  however  I think there are clear words indicating a legislative intention necessarily to exclude such processes followedGerhardy v Brown   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlMs Shaw also contended that s   of the NTNER Act should be read as requiring procedural fairness to be given to the residents  including Ms Shaw  before a decision is made because s   declares the provisions of the NTNER Act and actions taken under it for the purposes of those provisions as  special measures  for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   As explained in Gerhardy v Brown     CLR   s   of that Act has the consequence that other provisions of that Act  in particular  those that prohibit racial discrimination in various forms  do not apply to  special measures  as described in Art   paragraph   of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  defined in s   of that Act   Relevantly  special measures are ones  taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups     as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups     equal enjoyment  of human rights and fundamental freedoms  It was argued that Indigenous wishes about their lands and their participation in such decision making as may occur under s   is of great importance  and so s   supports the preservation of procedural fairness when such a decision is to be made  I do not think that s   supports the contention in that way  It is a legislative confirmation that the NTNER Act  in its terms as properly construed  and acts which it authorises  will not breach the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth  because what is authorised by and under the NTNER Act are  special measures   In other words  I consider s   is a legislative declaration that the NTNER Act  and the conduct it authorises  has each of the characteristics described by Brennan J in Gerhardy v Brown   CLR at    In respect of the town camps  that view is also evidenced also from the Second Reading Speech of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill    Hansard  House of Representatives    August   pages      Further  and more fundamentally  s   of the NTNER Act specifically excludes the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   Section   provides      The provisions of this Act  and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions  are excluded from the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth        In my view  the combination of s   and   evinces a clear intention on the part of the legislature to ensure that the NTNER Act and acts done in accordance with that Act  do not contravene the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth    Did the Minister give procedural fairness to the residents in the circumstances My conclusion on the first issue means that it is not necessary to determine this issue  However  as the evidence on this aspect of the case was quite extensive  it is appropriate at least to record my findings on what the Minister and her officers did do in relation to Ms Shaw and the residents and to express my views about it citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA

Callinan and Heydon JJ  at       said that      It has long been established that the statutory framework within which a decision maker exercises statutory power is of critical importance when

at       citedStewart v Goldman   Co Pty Ltd     WN  NSW   The Residents also contend that they will be worse off by the proposed subleases  As a matter of law  I do not consider that is so  I have dealt with that issue above  There are a few additional matters which should be noted  On the evidence  the rent payable from time to time under the tenancy agreements with the Housing Associations was increased  There is the prospect that over time  through the Executive Director  the rents might further increase  That can only occur to the extent that the tenancy agreements in force permit  There is a loss of control as members of the Housing Association of the selection  from the members  of who gets a tenancy of new dwellings in the town camp  but the subleases are subject to the head lease  and so only members of the Housing Associations are eligible  There was no dispute that the proposed subleases would be subject to the terms of the head leases  entitled to the benefits and subject to the burdens of their covenants  Stewart v Goldman   Co Pty Ltd     WN  NSW    at    There is also a loss of control as members over the income and expenditure of the Housing Associations  and over what action is taken in the event of non payment of rent or of other breaches of the terms of a tenancy agreement  because those matters become the function and responsibility of the Executive Director  the Northern Territory or Territory Housing  and then through the Housing Authority  Those decisions may only be made after the consultation with the Housing Associations imposed by clause    c   As a matter of strict interpretation  despite the consultation provided for  the Executive Director or a Housing Authority may adopt a stricter or different view of what is appropriate on those matters than the Housing Associations have done in the past  Thus  whilst I have concluded that the existing tenancy rights and obligations are preserved by the proposed subleases  there is some scope for those rights and obligations to be enforced in a somewhat different way than has occurred in the past  There is some evidence that  in the past  Territory Housing where it has had such a role has adopted a less tolerant attitude to tenants  contraventions of the terms of the tenancy agreements than have the Housing Associations  The Northern Territory has pointed out that  if the Northern Territory or Territory Housing is the relevant Housing Authority  any new tenancy agreements will comply with the requirements of the Housing Act  NT  and the Housing Regulations  NT   They are not requirements which in any material way differ from the terms of the existing tenancy agreements  It has also pointed out that  where it has performed or is performing that role in other Aboriginal Communities  it has established a Housing Reference Group to assist in the selection of new tenants from amongst the eligible persons and to ensure its awareness of cultural concerns and issues which might affect its management of such housing  Consultation processes for such purposes are built into the proposed subleases  There is no reason to think that  despite the concerns of the Residents  the Northern Territory or Territory Housing  or any entity  appointed as a Housing Authority under one of the proposed subleases would act inappropriately or unreasonably or inconsistently with the shared intention of improving the housing and support facilities in the town camps  I  therefore  do not consider that the concerns of the Residents discussed in the preceding paragraph of these reasons provide a sound reason for upholding the Residents  primary contentions  Execution of the Proposed Subleases by the Housing Associations A sublease has been executed by each Housing Association that is a party to the Sublease proceeding  but has not been exchanged  The executed subleases are currently held by the Council  pending the outcome of these proceedings citedRolled Steel

Liquidation  v Gillanders Arbuthnot   Co   HCA         CLR   Dixon J at   said that the question of corporate capacity     must be ascertained according to the true meaning of the memorandum interpreted by a fair reading of the whole instrument  In my judgment  a fair reading of the current Constitutions of those Housing Associations does not reveal such a focused and restricted objective or principal objective as the Residents contend for  Although the name is  town camp specific  the objectives now contemplate each of those Housing Associations serving their objectives beyond that town camp  The definition of  Town Camp  extends to any land owned or leased by an association  and includes the particular town camp  Item    b  includes serving the objectives in Item    a  and generally by  obtaining land  for its members  There is no provision now which specifies the only  or primary  objective to operate the particular town camp  Item     under the heading  Town Camp governed by the Association  clause     has the name of the Housing Association itself I take it to be designating the town camp itself but clause     is a reference to the definitions in the Constitution   and the only relevant definition is that of  Town Camp   Separately  clause     has the heading  Objects and Purposes  and refers to Item      The heading to Item     in that light cannot be the defining purpose or object of those Housing Associations  There is now no expression of the object or the principal object of the Housing Associations being to control the provision and maintenance of housing and other facilities on the land held under their head leases  The objects are more expansive citedIn Re K L  Tractors Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

Principles of Corporations Law  Butterworths Looseleaf Service  at    However  the rule was in any event ameliorated by provisions similar to that in the Corporations Act    Cth  in most  if not all  of the States  Associations Incorporation Acts  see s   Associations Incorporation Act    Vic  s   Associations Incorporation Act    Qld  s   Associations Incorporation Act    SA   There was no such provision in the Associations Incorporation Ordinance    NT  or in the Associations Incorporation Act    NT   Those enactments were repealed and replaced by the Associations Act  NT  enacted in    There is also no such provision in the Associations Act  NT   Part   of the Associations Act  NT  deals with the transfer of property of an incorporated non trading association  Each of the Housing Associations is not permitted to trade  Item     of the Schedule to their Constitutions  Section   Associations Act  NT  permits the transfer of real property by one association only to another body formed for promoting objects similar to its own or charitable objects  or to a council for the area in which the property is situated  That section also imposes procedural requirements  It is not necessary to refer to them  It is not suggested the grant of the proposed subleases is authorised by s   independently of the Constitutions of the Housing Associations  Nor  on the other hand  is it suggested that the grant of the proposed subleases is unlawful so as to prevent the Housing Associations from agreeing to enter into them  Section   is expressly subject to s    Section   restricts a Housing Association from disposing of  or charging  prescribed property  which appears to include a lease under the SPL Act or the CL Act  see the definition of prescribed property in s   except with the consent of the Minister administering that Act  and  by the NTNER Act  that would include the Minister  without the Minister s consent  It is also not necessary to further discuss those provisions as they were not relied upon  or referred to  either by the Residents or by any of the respondents  as informing the proper construction of the Constitutions of the Housing Associations either to grant or not to grant the proposed subleases  There is no doubt good reason for that  The CATSI Act does have a provision similar to that in s   of the Corporations Act    Cth   Section     relevantly provides        An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation has the legal capacity and powers of an individual within and outside Australia            An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation also has all the powers of a body corporate  including the power to  if the corporation s constitution permits  distribute any of the corporation s property among the members  in kind or otherwise            An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation s legal capacity to do something is not affected by the fact that the corporation s interests are not  or would not be  served by doing it citedANZ Executors   Trustee Co Ltd v Qintex Australia Ltd  receiver and managers appointed      ACLC  The Minister did not rely upon s     of the CATSI Act as providing the foundation for the Housing Associations incorporated under it to be enabled to enter into the proposed subleases  That may be simply because there are only three of them  and the condition precedent to the activation of each proposed sublease in clause    a i  referred to above would not be satisfied  It may also be because  notwithstanding its apparent effect  there is some authority to suggest its role is confined to validating corporate dealings with outsiders despite deficiencies in corporate capacity  but not to abrogating restrictions on the exercise of shareholders  or directors  powers  see eg per McPherson J  with whom Lee and McKenzie JJ agreed  in ANZ Executors   Trustee Co Ltd v Qintex Australia Ltd  receiver and managers appointed      ACLC   at    There may be other reasons  It may be that such a provision does not inhibit a member of such an association from asserting that the common understanding of the members and their general intention was for the association to control the use and development of those town camps  and seeking to enforce that position  That sort of contention has been used to support the winding up of a corporation or the just and equitable ground  see Ford s Principles of Corporations Law   th ed    Butterworths  at     p   and the cases there cited  As the issue was not raised  it is not necessary to go beyond those comments  Consequently  it is necessary to consider the second of the questions I have identified above  That is  it is necessary to determine whether the particular terms of the proposed subleases mean that the agreement to enter into them is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole  The Residents as members put their contention quite brutally  for   the Housing Associations have given up all rights  functions and representative activities in relation to their town camps so they cannot discharge their responsibilities to their members under Item     of their Constitutions and under their Rule Books  There is  an equation of   for no rights for at least   years  discussedGambotto v WCP Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlReference was made to Gambotto v WCP Limited   HCA         CLR     Gambotto   as supporting the proposition that a company can act bona fide and fairly  and for the benefit of the company as a whole  but cannot do so if that overrides the rights of existing shareholders  I do not think that decision takes the Residents  position that far  In that case  a small minority shareholder challenged the validity of a proposed meeting to consider amending the company s constitution to enable a member entitled to   of the issued shares to compulsorily acquire the balance  The Court therefore had to address the limits of the power to alter the constitution of the company to enable the appropriation of the shares of a minority  Clearly  it is a very different type of case  The proposed resolution was not shown to be for a proper purpose  nor was it shown to be one which did not operate oppressively in relation to minority shareholders  see per Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ at   and    Their Honours pointed out also at   that the position may have been different if the right to expropriation had already existed in the company s constitution  Senior counsel for the Residents made the submission that the  interests of the members as a whole  was somehow different from the interests of the Housing Associations themselves  In cross examination of a solicitor from Gilbert   Tobin  the solicitors for the Council  he elicited that their advice to the Council  and to a working group including certain Housing Association representatives  did not separately address the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as distinct from those of the Housing Associations themselves  The significance of the distinction  if legally there is one  was not made clear  It is argued that the Housing Associations could not alienate their interests in the town camps under the respective Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases either absolutely or for   years  That was said to flow from the proper construction and understanding of the objects and purposes of the Housing Associations  I have already addressed that contention  No reason was put why those objects and purposes should impose restrictions on the powers of the Housing Associations which preclude their capacity to agree to the proposed subleases as Housing Associations  and different restrictions on their powers because of the interests of their members as a whole  The plurality judgment in Gambotto   CLR pointed out at   that the observations of Lindley MR in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd     Ch   at   that the power of the majority to alter the articles of association of a company must be exercised in a lawful manner and  bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole  was inappropriate where the proposed resolution involved a conflict of interests and advantages  The plurality judgment said at       It seems to us that  in such a case not involving an actual or effective expropriation of shares or of valuable proprietary rights attaching to shares  an alteration of the articles by special resolution regularly passed will be valid unless it is ultra vires  beyond any purpose contemplated by the articles or oppressive as that expression is understood in the law relating to corporations  Consistent with the expression in Gambotto   in Peters  American Delicacy Co Ltd v Heath   HCA         CLR     Dixon J when upholding the validity of an alteration of the articles which discriminated against holders of partly paid shares in favour of the majority shareholders said at   that the resolution     involved no oppression  no appropriation of an unjust or reprehensible nature and did not imply any purpose outside the scope of the power  Those propositions require some comment  There is  in my view  some mixing of concepts in them  In the first place  as the High Court pointed out in Gambotto   CLR  these particular considerations arise where the proposed conduct of the entity expropriates or is intended to facilitate the expropriation of the interests of particular members at the expense of others  That is not this case  The rights of the members of the Housing Associations inter se are unchanged  Secondly  the measure in fact of what is in the interests of the entity itself and its members as a whole will necessarily depend upon the constitution of the entity  a company formed  for profit  is likely to have a constitution which permits conduct which may not be permitted in the case of a not for profit association  in fact  each of the Constitutions and Rule Books of the Housing Associations prohibits them from trading for profit  But it does not follow that  somehow  the measure of what is  oppressive or unfair     is necessarily  applied more rigorously in the case of not for profit associations  The measure will still be the objects and purposes of the association  Thirdly  the second proposition set out in the preceding paragraph is really axiomatic  If a particular course of action is not authorised by the constitution  it may not be undertaken  On the second issue  it is necessary therefore that the Residents show that the agreement to enter into the proposed subleases is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole  or effectively to the interests of the Housing Associations  Inevitably  on such issues  there are matters of judgment  Different members will make different commercial judgments about what is  or is not  in the interests of the Housing Associations  The Residents  submission is that their rights as members of the Housing Associations to have the Housing Associations  separately conduct its activities at the town camps for the benefit of its existing members  have been sold for   years for   without any other return provided as of right for the benefit of the members  I do not accept that contention  It mis describes their entitlements under the proposed subleases  The general effect of the proposed subleases is set out above  If there is power under the Constitutions or Rule Books of the Housing Associations to enter into arrangements such as the proposed subleases  the aspirational objectives of the Housing Associations may be fulfilled or served by the Housing Associations arranging for another entity  such as the Executive Director  to engage in or conduct activities at the town camps to fulfil or serve those objectives for the benefit of the members discussedAllen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd     Ch  The significance of the distinction  if legally there is one  was not made clear

HCA  htmlHaving taken that step  that the proper approach is to determine whether those persons acting on behalf of the Housing Associations are acting for proper purposes and could reasonably have engaged in that conduct  Barwick CJ  McTiernan and Kitto JJ said in Harlowe s Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside  Lakes Entrance  Oil Co N L    HCA         CLR   at         Directors in whom are vested the right and the duty of deciding where the company s interests lie and how they are to be served may be concerned with a wide range of practical considerations  and their judgment  if exercised in good faith and not for irrelevant purposes  is not open to review in the courts  Whether the obligation of the Housing Associations and of those persons on their behalf is founded in the contractual relationship between the Housing Association and its members  or in the fiduciary obligation of the Management Committee of the Housing Associations to the members  or upon the Constitutions and Rule Books of the Housing Associations  in my view the appropriate question is for present purposes the same  I have referred above to the finding that each Housing Association  although having no legally enforceable right to any particular part of the   million  could reasonably expect and assume that a significant proportion of that sum would be spent on housing and facilities at its town camp  They were aware of the fundamental importance of the town camps land to their respective members  They had negotiated with the Minister for over   months  They could reasonably conclude that no  better deal  could be reached  They could reasonably conclude that  if they did not agree to the proposed subleases  the town camps would be compulsorily acquired  They understood the very strong desire of their members to avoid alienation of their land  the land held under the Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases  and so were making the decision which would ultimately preserve their lands rather than have them compulsorily acquired  They had secured some consultation rights  both directly and through the Forum  They were aware that the   million was a package for all the Housing Associations  and its allocation would follow consultation through the Forum  They were aware that the   million was required to be expended over a period of five years  and so would provide promptly benefits to existing members  as well as to future generations  They had consulted widely with their members  They had the support of the Council in their decision  They were aware that  under the terms of the proposed subleases  they could be given a significant and direct ongoing role  as recognised in Recitals I and J of the proposed subleases  and in respect of community land  vacant land and after three years potentially as a Housing Authority   As senior counsel for the Housing Associations argued  the Housing Associations were aware that there was no other realistic opportunity available to secure the potential benefits to the town camps which the expenditure of   million would bring  they knew of the past  years of inadequate funding leading to substantial housing and conditions for the members and tenants  and they believed that that funding to the Housing Associations through clause  a  of the proposed subleases would directly serve their primary function of relieving the poverty  sickness and suffering and helplessness of Aboriginal people in Central Australia  including their members  Finally  they were aware that the proposed subleases would not preclude them from continuing to engage in activities directed to the six  means  set out in Item    b  of the respective Constitutions and Rule Books  save to the extent that certain of those activities would be subject to the role and obligations and activities of the Executive Director under the proposed subleases  and they were also aware of the ongoing important role of the Council
