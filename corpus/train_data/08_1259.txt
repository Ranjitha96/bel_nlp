Gordon J consideredSZDFZ v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In some circumstances a departure by a reconstituted Tribunal from the findings and conclusions of an earlier Tribunal may constitute a denial of procedural fairness and a denial of the opportunity   to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   as required by s   eg SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA    But such is not the present case  The Tribunal s reasons thus contain the following passage  The Tribunal again told the applicant that it had listened to the tapes of his two previous hearings with the first and second Tribunal and that this Tribunal may take into account what he had told previous Tribunals  The Tribunal asked the applicant if he wanted to change or add to anything he had previously said  The applicant stated that he did not  The Tribunal put to the applicant that it was still concerned about why Shouters would ask the applicant  who is not a member of the Shouters  to burn CDs when this task could have been done on a personal computer  in secret  The applicant stated that all he knows is that none of the Shouters do this kind of thing and that perhaps they came to him because he was a good friend of Mr  X  and because he had no religious beliefs and so would not attract the PSB   These were the factual issues later resolved against the now Appellant by the Tribunal  No breach of s   can be discerned  The now Appellant was given every opportunity   to persuade   the Tribunal on each of the issues resolved against him   The final Ground seeks to contend that the Federal Magistrates Court failed to consider the application   properly and fairly    That Ground is without substance   The appeal must be dismissed with costs citedSZFYW v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The decision of the Tribunal was to affirm the decision not to grant a protection visa  The Federal Magistrates Court on   June   dismissed an application seeking review of that decision  SZFYW v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA     The Notice of Appeal sets forth five Grounds   which in summary form contend that the Federal Magistrates Court   erred in law   those errors arising out of   i  the inconsistent findings made by earlier decisions of the Tribunal in respect to the now Appellant s claims     ii  an apprehension of bias arising out of the manner in which the Tribunal considered his claims     iii  a failure on the part of the Tribunal to provide   clear particulars   of information and a failure to comply with s  A  of the Migration Act    Cth   iv  a failure on the part of the Tribunal to provide a   genuine opportunity   to be heard and a failure to comply with s   of the   Act  and    v  a failure to   properly and fairly   consider the application for review   The Appellant appeared before this Court this morning unrepresented  although he did have the benefit of an interpreter followedSZHKA v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The earlier two Tribunals were differently constituted and each Tribunal recorded its decision based upon the findings each had made  A later Tribunal is not bound by findings made by an earlier Tribunal  SZHKA v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCAFC    Gray J there observed        The Tribunal must determine a review by dealing with the issues as they present themselves at the time of its determination  according to the facts as the Tribunal finds them to be at that time  For all sorts of reasons  the facts as they appear to the Tribunal member making the second decision may differ significantly from the facts as they appeared to the Tribunal member who made the earlier decision        In the light of this practical problem  and the part that the reasoning processes of the Tribunal play in the ascertainment of what the issues are  there is a necessary fluidity of those issues until the particular Tribunal member is in the process of grappling with the case  In those circumstances  the Tribunal member cannot regard himself or herself as limited to dealing only with the facts and issues that were perceived by an earlier Tribunal member who has made a decision that has been set aside  The role of the Tribunal s reasoning processes also means that the problem cannot be solved simply by asking the applicant whether there are any new issues  or whether he or she wishes to provide any new information  The possibility that the Tribunal member will himself or herself perceive issues that have not been thought of previously cannot be disregarded       The fourth Ground of Appeal goes on to provide that      With apprehensive bias mentioned above  the Tribunal failed to provide a genuine opportunity at the Tribunal s hearing  and thus the Tribunal has definitely failed to comply with its obligations under s   of the Act   The Ground as to an apprehension of bias has been rejected and there is no other reason why the same fate should not befall this Ground  As required by s   on   November   a letter was forwarded to the now Appellant inviting him to attend the hearing before the Tribunal on   December   and he did in fact attend on that date  This Ground too is rejected  The importance of s   is repeatedly acknowledged  including its importance in providing   a compulsory opportunity for an applicant to persuade the Tribunal face to face   with the person making the decision  SZHKA v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCAFC   at   per Gyles J
