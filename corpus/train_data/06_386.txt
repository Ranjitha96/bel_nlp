FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA   VICTORIA DISTRICT REGISTRY NO  VID   of     BETWEEN  CADBURY SCHWEPPES PTY LTD   APPLICANT AND  DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD   RESPONDENT   JUDGE  HEEREY J DATE    APRIL   PLACE  MELBOURNE         RULING         The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd  Cadbury  has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  Darrell Lea  alleging contravention of ss        c  and    d  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea s use in its chocolate confectionary business of  the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple    Whether right or wrong  I think it is clear that that is the basis on which I admitted the documents  Nevertheless some uncertainty has arisen  Accordingly further argument took place in which  amongst other things  more informative reference was made to s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   the Act  and its application by the High Court in Lee v The Queen   HCA         CLR     The documents in question are    Witness Document no  title and date     A J Nowicki   FrontLine Research     G R K Slater

Research paper Jigsaw stage one February       Engagement Sue Cummings Research September       Sue Cummings Research Report September     R N Heath   Sue Cummings Global Packaging Report May   Senior counsel for Darrell Lea categorized the representations made in these documents in terms which seem to me a fair summary  He said they contain    Assertions as to facts made by the authors  eg as to inquiries the authors have made or things they have done in the preparation of the document    Assertions of opinion on the part of the authors  ie their conclusions based on what they may have seen or observed  and    Assertions as to representations that have been made by third parties  such as participants in consumer surveys and focus groups  and that have been recorded in the document by the authors  For example  in the last mentioned report there are reported statements in relation to Cadbury s peppermint chocolate  The green ooze is coming out  and  The green writing that says peppermint you usually associate green with peppermint    In Lee the appellant had been convicted on a charge of armed assault with intent to rob Mrs Patricia Jones  the owner of a video store in Paddington  Lee and another man came into her shop  One of them produced a gun and demanded money  In an episode no less dramatic than scenes in some of her videos  Mrs Jones threw a cast iron tape dispenser at the man with the gun  picked up the stool on which she had been sitting and jabbed at him across the counter  The gun discharged  The man who had fired the gun picked up the cash register but Mrs Jones hit him again with the stool  The men fled empty handed   Shortly afterwards police officers saw Lee and another man  one Romeo Calin  in Kings Cross Road  The police arrested both men  Calin told the police  both orally and in a written statement  that he had seen Lee  although he did not know his name  and asked him to repay an   debt  He said Lee was walking fast and was sweaty  He also told the police that Lee had said to him     Don t bother me  I have just done a job  I fired two shots  The other guy bailed out      The police allowed Calin to go home  presumably being satisfied he was not Lee s accomplice   When called as a witness at the trial  Calin said that he could not recall any conversation with Lee apart from a request to repay the debt  The prosecution was given leave to cross examine him about his statement  In the High Court s view at   the trial judge s charge to the jury would have been understood as an instruction that if they were satisfied that Lee had said those words to Calin  they were a confession by Lee   Senior counsel for Cadbury submitted that Lee is not explicable on the basis of secondhand  or double  hearsay  He said that the true key to the case was to be found in   of the judgment  quoted at   above   The representation in Lee was not one that a certain thing had happened  but rather that someone had said it had happened   With respect  I do not agree with this reading of Lee   As appears above  their Honours make it clear that  quite apart from the asserted truth basis  secondhand hearsay per se is not admissible under s   see also Ligertwood  Australian Evidence     th ed    at    In a recent joint report on the Act published in December   the Australian Law Reform Commission  in association with the New South Wales and Victorian Law Reform Commissions and after a consultative relationship with law reform bodies in Tasmania  the Northern Territory  Western Australia and Queensland  appears to accept  albeit reluctantly  and with a recommendation for change  that Lee decides that secondhand and more remote hearsay does not fall within s   ALRC Report   NSWLR Report   VLRC Final Report at           Where A in evidence states what B has said out of court that C has said to him  B  if B s intention to assert the truth of C s statement is the sole criterion then the result presumably will turn on the court s finding as to the subjective intention of B  Members of the general populace  unburdened with the laws of evidence  will often assert the truth of something said to them  just as often they will pass on something said for what it is worth  To hypothesise a variation on the facts of Lee   what if Calin was not just a casual acquaintance and creditor of Lee but a close criminal companion of long standing  In the light of that Calin believed  and had every reason to believe  that Lee was telling the truth when he said that he had  done a job   It was the sort of thing which  to Calin s knowledge  Lee habitually did  The hypothetical Calin  unlike the real life Calin  was convinced that Lee had committed the crime  he told the police as much and provided convincing detailed reasons  In other words  Calin asserted to the police that what Lee had told him was true  Would the confession by Lee to Calin have been admissible as truth of its contents  On the asserted truth basis of Lee perhaps yes  but on the secondhand hearsay basis  no   Moreover  where A tenders evidence of a statement out of court by B as to what C had said  and if what C said is admissible if B intended to assert the truth of it  then if C had said what D had said what E had said  E s statement would be admissible as truth of its contents as long as there was an assertion of intention to convey truth by everybody along the chain   I think therefore that the safer ground on which to decide the issue in the present case is that what various study participants  the equivalent of Lee  said to the authors of the reports  the equivalent of Calin  given to the Cadbury officers  the equivalent of the police  is inadmissable as being secondhand hearsay citedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate
