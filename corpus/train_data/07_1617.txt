No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Commission has not proceeded against those on the Amcor side of this cartel because in late   Amcor approached the Commission and admitted liability  The Commission applied its Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct  published in   under which the first party to disclose a cartel of which the Commission is unaware will receive an immunity  provided it is not the  clear leader  gives full and frank disclosure  and continues to cooperate with the Commission  In unrelated litigation Amcor had sued former executives and obtained a Court order for a search of their premises  Incriminating material  including tape recordings of conversations  was discovered and on its solicitors  advice Amcor approached the Commission  Details of these events will be found in my earlier judgment on an interlocutory application  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at          A vast range of consumer goods are packaged in CFP  They include groceries  beverages  dairy products  fruit  produce  meat  poultry  seafood and confectionery  Returnable plastic crates  shrink wrap and other packaging products compete in segments of the CFP market  but otherwise there are no packaging materials which are reasonably substitutable for  or in close competition with  CFP products in relation to the packaging of the goods mentioned  CFP is used to make the ubiquitous cardboard box   The type of CFP products and associated services supplied by Visy and Amcor would vary substantially between customers due to differing customer requirements in terms of board paper type  strength  construction  sheet size  design style  print characteristics and method of assembly  Different board grates were used in the manufacture for supply of CFP products to suit the different applications of the products  Corrugated boxed were supplied in a number of different styles  CFP products could have printing applied either in a pre print or post print process citedMinister for Industry  Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR     The fact that the Commission and the respondents have proffered a penalty agreed as between themselves is relevant  although not of course conclusive  since the responsibility of imposing penalties is conferred by the Trade Practices Act on the Court  see generally Minister for Industry  Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR       Cartel behaviour of the kind with which this case is concerned is extremely destructive of the competition on which the prosperity of a free market economy depends  Often the profits can be immense  and the risk of detection slight  Of its nature  cartel behaviour is likely to occur in secret and between parties who seek mutual benefit  In the present case  detection occurred purely by chance when Amcor s solicitors  in the course of quite unrelated litigation  stumbled across incriminating material  Even then the present resolution may not have been reached were it not for two additional factors  First  the Commission s immunity policy and  secondly  the fact that there were not only witnesses prepared to give evidence  but also tape recordings of damning conversations   The progressive increase in the maximum penalties mentioned above shows how gravely the legislature regards this kind of conduct  Price fixing and market sharing are not offences committed by accident  or in a fit of passion  The law  and the way it is enforced  should convey to those disposed to engage in cartel behaviour that the consequences of discovery are likely to outweigh the benefits  and by a large margin   Critical to any anti cartel regime is the level of penalty for individual contravenors  We tend to overlook the fact that corporations are constructs of the law  they only exist and possess rights and liabilities as a consequence of the law  Heavy penalties are indeed appropriate for corporations  but it is only individuals who can engage in the conduct which enables corporations to fix prices and share markets   Many countries with free market economies have recognised this reality by enacting laws which make cartel conduct by individuals subject to criminal sanctions  including imprisonment  In the United States this happened as long ago as   with the Sherman Act   U S C  More recently  as shown by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development report Hard Core Cartels Third Report on the Implementation of the   Recommendation   Paris    the following countries have laws providing for terms of imprisonment for cartel conduct  Canada  France  Germany  Ireland  Israel  Japan  South Korea  Mexico  Norway  Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom   The Australian Government appointed an expert committee chaired by former High Court Justice Sir Daryl Dawson to report on Australia s competition laws  In April   the Dawson Committee in its report   Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act   recommended  Report p   that  in the light of submissions made to it and growing overseas experience  criminal sanctions deter serious cartel behaviour and should be introduced   On   February   the Treasurer  the Honourable Peter Costello MP  announced acceptance of the recommendations of the Dawson Committee and stated that the Government would amend the Trade Practices Act to provide for a term of five years imprisonment  as well as increases in other penalties  The Treasurer noted        Dishonesty goes to the heart of serious cartel conduct  where customers are deceived when purchasing goods or services unaware that the price and supply of those goods and services were determined by collusion  rather than competition         Although  as already mentioned  the Act was amended last year to raise corporate penalties  the Government hasn t yet got around to introducing
