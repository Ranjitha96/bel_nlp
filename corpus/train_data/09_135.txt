Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Limited v Pioneer KK  includes corrigendum dated   September     FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBlount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe issues raised in the appeal  to be considered afresh by this Court   Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR   at   cover the same issues as faced by the Registrar  They are  broadly  Is Pioneer Computers a  person aggrieved  as required by s   of the Act as it stood at the time when the non use applications were filed  What use has Pioneer KK established of the Pioneer KK marks on the removal goods and the removal services  What properly comes within the description of the expression  computer peripheral devices  Would there be confusion if the registrations for the Pioneer KK marks were amended by way of removal of the removal goods and the removal services  or conversely  if the registrations for the Pioneer KK marks were maintained in their present form  If the Pioneer KK marks are liable to be removed under s  a  or s  b  of the Act in respect of the removal goods and the removal services  should the discretion available under s   of the Act be exercised Before turning to a consideration of the Pioneer KK marks  it is useful to identify the parties  Pioneer Computers Pioneer Computers was incorporated on   December   and has traded under that name since that date  Pioneer Computers is the manufacturer and vendor of computer products and services and has conducted business under its corporate name  Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Limited  since December    It has used the trade mark PIONEER in Australia in relation to desktop computers  notebook computers  servers and other computer related goods and in relation to installation  repair and support services for computers  It uses the mark PIONEER on its website  on invoices  on stationery and on publicly distributed promotional material  Most of the computers that Pioneer Computers sells are built to order and  since late   those built to order computers have been able to be ordered online via Pioneer Computers  website  www pioneercomputers com au   An appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks is in the Court s original jurisdiction  None of the powers of the Court under s   of the Act affect the s   application  which goes to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine an application for removal of a trade mark  The hearing is a  hearing de novo  where the judge reviewing the decision of the Registrar begins afresh and exercises any discretion exercised by the Registrar  The parties may adduce evidence as provided for in s   of the Act which evidence may include evidence

  with whom Emmett and Besanko JJ agreed  the expression  person aggrieved          embrace  s  any person having a real interest in having the Register rectified  or the trade mark removed in respect of any goods  as the case may be  in the manner claimed  and thus would include any person who would be  or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his being  appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense by the Register remaining unrectified  or by the trade mark remaining unremoved in respect of any goods  as the case may be  in the manner claimed  In Campomar   the Full Court was dealing with cosmetic and perfume products sold by reference to the word  Nike   Justice Sackville  with whom Lehane J agreed  concluded that it was sufficient for Nike International to be a person aggrieved that  by reason of an established reputation in one field  the sporting field  the public would be likely to think that the appellants  cosmetic and perfume products had Nike International s approval or sponsorship  This was not reversed on appeal  The question whether computers and associated products on the one hand and the goods sold by Pioneer KK under the Pioneer KK marks on the other are the same class of goods or a similar class of goods is answered differently by the parties when considering whether Pioneer Computers is a person aggrieved and whether the public considers that the goods are sufficiently similar to give rise to possible confusion  In considering the issue of  person aggrieved  Pioneer KK submits that Pioneer Computers is only a person aggrieved for the category of computers  and services in relation to these   Pioneer KK submits that Pioneer Computers is not a person aggrieved in respect of any of the other removal goods and removal services  including computer peripherals  which Pioneer Computers does not supply under its PIONEER mark  That is  Pioneer KK submits that care should be taken to subdivide the goods and services within the registered classes to consider which category is actually sold citedConde Nast Publications Pty Ltd v Taylor     IPR  Pioneer Computers submits that the date at which the Court should consider the facts relevant to the exercise of discretion under s   is the date at which the non use is to be determined  namely  the expiry of the relevant period or  alternatively  the date at which the removal applicant must establish that it is a person aggrieved  namely the date of the non use application  There is no material difference between those dates  Pioneer Computers accepts  however  that events after the relevant date may cast light on earlier circumstances   Conde Nast Publications Pty Ltd v Taylor     IPR   at    While Pioneer Computers submits that the time to consider any confusion is the expiration of the relevant period  it concedes that this is  in a sense    artificial   particularly given the length of time between the relevant period and the hearing of these proceedings  Pioneer KK says that the relevant date for a passing off case is the beginning of the conduct complained of  The discretion to maintain a trade mark registration must  Pioneer KK submits  take into account whether anyone would be deceived if the Pioneer KK marks remain on the Register in their current state or are removed from the Register insofar as the removal goods and the removal services are concerned  The date of that assessment is  Pioneer KK contends  the date of hearing  although confusion leading up to that date would also be relevant referred toE   J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlPioneer Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer KK  The use of the marks indicates a connection in the course of trade with the registered proprietor of the marks  Pioneer KK  It cannot be said that the use of the marks by Pioneer Australia is somehow deceptive by indicating a different origin of the goods  see also E   J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA         IPR   at      The products sold by Pioneer Australia were created and supplied by or on behalf of Pioneer KK  That is  the quality control of manufacture was exercised by the Japanese company  The exercise by Pioneer KK of quality control over goods and services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by its subsidiary  Pioneer Australia  is sufficient for me to conclude that use of the Pioneer KK marks by Pioneer Australia was under the control of Pioneer KK and authorised by it  While the non use applications filed by Pioneer Computers were defective insofar as the ground in s  a  is concerned  I will briefly consider the issue of intention to use the Pioneer KK marks  I note that intention to use refers to intention as at the date of filing of the application for registration  Intention to use the Pioneer KK marks with respect to computerscitedE   J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Pty Ltd  No     FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlPioneer Computers relies upon the requirement under the Act and Regulations  s   of the Act and Regulations     and       which require a trade mark applicant to specify the goods and or services in respect of which it is sought to register the trade mark and proscribes the use of expressions such as  all goods  or  all services  the goods or services must be indicated by name  Pioneer Computers submits that it follows from s   of the Act  which requires that a trade mark owner establish use in relation to the particular goods and or services for which removal is sought  that there is a clear policy not to allow use for one good or service to stand as use for another good or service even though they fall within a class or broad description   Moove  No   at    Pioneer KK nominated the goods for which it sought and obtained registration  In the second Pioneer KK registration  the goods were specified by the general term  computer peripheral devices  followed by list of specific devices which differ from each other  for example  printers and keyboards  The specification thus encompasses the specific goods nominated and any goods that can be described as  computer peripheral devices  that are not otherwise specified  Pioneer Computers submits that Pioneer KK cannot  by establishing use on optical disc drives and jukeboxes  rely upon that use of the mark for the other goods encompassed by the general term  computer peripheral devices   Rather  it says that the term is residual and covers goods not otherwise specified in the trade mark registration  Pioneer Computers submits that DVD drives and DVD writers fall in a distinct niche market segment that is laser and optical drives which have been specifically provided for in the second Pioneer KK trade mark registration  It submits that Pioneer KK is not entitled to a monopoly for the additional term  computer peripheral devices  for which  it says  no use has been established  The exercise of the discretionary power to remove a mark under s   of the Act is as at the date upon which the Court makes the order for removal   E   J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Pty Ltd  No     FCA         IPR   at   per Flick J   This is a hearing de novo and the parties have adduced evidence in this hearing directed to the exercise of discretion  As it happens  the date for consideration of the evidence is not determinative of the outcome  The evidence relied upon by Pioneer KK is of confusion during the relevant period  of convergence of computer and audio visual technologies and of brand extension by other companies operating in the computer and audio visual fields that was evident in that period and predicted at that time to continue  The evidence with respect to post relevant period convergence and potential for confusion has simply validated that prediction  The facts

the case may be  in the manner claimed citedHermes Trade Mark   RPC  In E   J Gallo at     Flick J stated that the following factors set out by Falconer J in Hermes Trade Mark   RPC   were of assistance in considering the exercise of the discretion  there had been no abandonment of the trade mark  the registered proprietors of the mark still had a residual reputation in the mark  there had been sales by the registered proprietors of goods for which removal was sought since the relevant period ended  the applicants for removal had entered the market without having taken steps to ascertain from the Register whether anyone had a right to exclude their use of the mark  the registered proprietors were not aware of the applicant s sales under the mark   Pioneer KK says the first four factors are applicable in this case  Pioneer Computers says that the present case is not one for the proper exercise of discretion to allow the Pioneer KK marks to remain on the Register and that no sufficient reason appears or has been established for doing so in respect of the removal goods and the removal services  The relevance of s   of the Act to the exercise of the discretion in s  By amendment in   s   was added to provide that without limiting the matters that the Registrar may take into account in deciding under s   not to remove a trade mark from the Register  the Registrar may take into account whether the trade mark has been used by the registered proprietor in respect of  a  similar goods or closely related services  or  b  similar services or closely related goods  The parties disagree as to whether or not the matters now raised in s   are able to be taken into account for the purposes of the unamended section  that is  whether it was necessary to insert s   to add discretionary factors not previously available  or to clarify that they were always available to be taken into account  There is no limitation within s   on the discretion  nor any indication of the factors to be taken into account  In the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill    Cth  by which s   was introduced  it is stated that  c  urrently  it is not clear that the Registrar is able to take use on closely related goods or services into account  when deciding whether to exercise his or her discretion not to remove a trade mark from the Register   and that the amendment was for the purposes of clarifying the Registrar s discretion  Interestingly  the example that is given in the Bill is a registration for computer software goods where the business has specialised in the provision of a custom development of software systems service with the view that they are seen as closely related services and goods followedKowa Company Ltd v NV Organon   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Registrar accepted that while use of the Pioneer KK marks had been demonstrated on computer peripherals  no use had been shown on the remaining removal goods and the removal services within the relevant period and Pioneer KK could not establish circumstances that were an obstacle to the full use of the registrations  On the basis that it is not necessary for exceptional circumstances to exist before the Registrar may apply the power found in s   in favour of an opponent   Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon   FCA         ALR   at   per Lander J  the Registrar concluded that  despite non use being established for a range of the removal goods and for the removal services  it was not viable to limit the registrations by removing the removal goods and the removal services from the Register  The basis for this was that the difference between computer goods on the one hand and audio  audio visual and home entertainment products on the other does not enable the drawing of  fine lines  between those goods for which use was demonstrated and those the subject of non use  The Registrar considered the evidence as to the likelihood of deception or confusion among consumers  She concluded that Pioneer KK had a significant reputation in the Pioneer KK marks and in the word  Pioneer   The Registrar took into account the time before the relevant period  when Pioneer KK produced and sold entire computer systems under the brand  Pioneer  and under the first Pioneer KK mark  although such sales were limited  as well as evidence as to its future plans for research and development of products that combine home entertainment and computing in one package  The Registrar concluded at   that it was not appropriate to make a distinction between the computers and associated products of Pioneer Computers and the audio  visual and electronic products of Pioneer KK  She concluded that there was a   high likelihood of deception or confusion in the marketplace    While recognising that Pioneer Computers had seemingly used PIONEER honestly for over   years  had goodwill in the computer marketplace and intended to continue to use the trade mark PIONEER in connection with goods and services unless prevented from doing so  the Registrar concluded that the public interest was best served by declining to amend the registrations  Rather  she concluded that the public interest was best served by retaining the registrations in total and preserving the established trade marks  In Kowa Company at   Lander J rejected the submission that a party seeking the exercise of the discretion needs to show  exceptional circumstances   In E   J Gallo at   Flick J agreed with Lander J that there is no requirement to establish exceptional circumstances  With respect  I also agree with Lander J that there is no warrant to read a requirement for exceptional circumstances into s   consideredKraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation     FCR  The expression  person aggrieved  has been discussed in Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation     FCR   by Sackville J  with whom Sheppard and Tamberlin JJ agreed  and by Jacobson J in Health World Ltd  ABN         v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA         IPR     As was said by McLelland J in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd     NSWLR   at

possibility of his being  appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense by the Register remaining unrectified  or by the trade mark remaining unremoved in respect of any goods  as the case may be  in the manner claimed  Without refining the breadth of the expression  Sackville J gave some examples of a person aggrieved in Kraft Foods at  referred toLever Brothers  Port Sunlight Ltd v Sunniwite Products Ltd     RPC  At   his Honour referred to Lever Brothers  Port Sunlight Ltd v Sunniwite Products Ltd     RPC   where  in respect of a mark registered for soap  detergents and cosmetics  a manufacturer of a soapless detergent was not a person aggrieved in respect of the registration for cosmetics referred toMagnavox  Aust  Pty Ltd s Trade Mark     AOJP  It is not unreasonable  particularly in an area of technology the subject of rapid change  for an applicant for a trade mark to include within the class of goods for which the trade mark is registered  products which may not be able to be strictly described  The statement of goods should not be construed so narrowly that it fails to include goods clearly within the designated class that have not yet been developed  As was said in Magnavox  Aust  Pty Ltd s Trade Mark     AOJP   at     the rights arising from the registration of a trade mark should not be confined to the stage of technological development of goods specified when the mark was registered    The general term  computer peripheral devices  as used is an appropriate term to describe the range of goods marketed by Pioneer KK in the areas of computer and optical technology  given the rate of change and advances in those technologies  Further  as the technology has changed and as it is used  some devices may be internally connected or externally connected to a computer  One example is the DVD drive in a larger or smaller notebook computer  It seems artificial to restrict the description of a category of goods on the basis of a distinction drawn by the definition where the distinction is not drawn in use of the term in the marketplace  where it depends upon the way in which the goods are used  sometimes idiosyncratically  and where the use of a particular device as an internal component or an externally connected device may change as the technology changes  In any event  for the reasons that follow in considering discretionary matters  the distinction is not determinative of the decision regarding whether or not to remove the removal goods from the registrations for the Pioneer KK marks  The specific inclusion of certain computer peripheral devices in the Pioneer KK trade mark registrations Pioneer Computers says that optical devices  including DVD ROM drives and DVD writers  constitute a separate category of information technology products that comprise a niche market and that they should not be considered as satisfying the range of products encompassed by the general term  computer peripheral devices   As noted above  Pioneer Computers further argues that in the present case  the separate inclusion of various goods  including optical disc drives  in the second Pioneer KK trade mark registration means that these products are not encompassed by the term  computer peripheral devices  as used in the registration  In this case  the inclusion of computer peripheral devices in the description of the goods for which the second Pioneer KK mark was registered seems to have been as a  catch all  and an expression to encompass goods yet to be developed and so yet to be specifically described  The Explanatory Memorandum does not really assist  Section   makes it clear that it has been inserted without any attempt to limit or qualify the discretion provided for in s    The Explanatory Memorandum itself speaks of  clarification   This can either recognise that s   expands the discretion or that it simply makes it clear which factors could already be taken into account under s    In my view  use of a trade mark on closely related goods or services could already be taken into account in exercising the discretion under s   in the unamended section  As I read s     the discretion to be exercised is not limited  For the purposes of s     account may be taken of use of the trade mark on closely related goods or services  even in cases commencing prior to the introduction of s    This has particular relevance in the case of goods that are at the forefront of technological change  Justice Dixon  as he then was  said in The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Rohm and Haas Company   HCA         CLR   at   that the basis of a claim to proprietorship in a trade mark so far unused is found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark  the intention to use it on or in connection with the goods and the application for registration  In Magnavox   the Assistant Registrar considered a mark which had not been used across the scope of the goods claimed  In coming to a conclusion as to use across a class of goods  I agree with the Assistant Registrar  at   that   the rights arising from the registration of a trade mark should not be confined to the stage of technological development of goods specified when the mark was registered    The relevant date for the exercise of the discretioncitedMcHattan v Australian Specialised Vehicle Systems Pty Ltd

complete cessation of the use by Pioneer Computers of any mark which is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to  the Pioneer Trade Mark   The allegation of infringement of Pioneer KK s registered marks was general and not restricted to the removal goods and the removal services  A general allegation was sufficient in New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co operative

Computers submits that Pioneer KK has failed to establish that use by Pioneer Australia of the Pioneer KK marks for the services which the Australian company did provide in the relevant period was use by the Australian company as the authorised user of the marks and that the benefit of any such use accrued to the Japanese parent  Accepting that Pioneer Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer KK and a distributor of Pioneer KK s products  Pioneer Computers submits that this does not establish that Pioneer KK exercised any relevant control within the meaning of s   of the Act over Pioneer Australia s use of the Pioneer KK marks in the relevant period  There is no evidence of a license   Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks   HCA         CLR   at    Accordingly  Pioneer Computers submits  Pioneer KK has not established that Pioneer Australia was an authorised user within the meaning of s   of the Act of the Pioneer KK marks in respect of the removal services in the relevant period  Pioneer KK relies upon the fact that the products sold under the trade marks were manufactured by or on behalf of Pioneer KK and that the documents  including manuals and test protocols  were created by the Japanese company and supplied to the Australian subsidiary for supply to customers in Australia  Use under the control of the owner of the trade marks is authorised use  ss   and   of the Act   As pointed out by Aickin J in Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha at   a slight connection such as selection and quality control  or control by Pioneer KK of Pioneer Australia in the

Register remaining unrectified  or by the trade mark remaining unremoved in respect of any goods  as the case may be  in the manner claimed  Pioneer Computers relies upon the policy of the Act to facilitate the removal of an unused trade mark and the public interest in the integrity of the Register which  it submits  will generally demand the removal of an unused trade mark   Shanahan at      However  as Shanahan also points out at     the underlying policy of the Act is to give the Court sufficient flexibility to give effect to public interest considerations  This includes the flexibility not to order removal even though the trade mark is unused in the sense required by s    The authors suggest that removal may not be appropriate where  for example  the trade mark is nonetheless well known either from earlier use or from advertising or publicity coming from abroad  A further consideration  as noted by McLelland J in Ritz Hotel and by the Registrar in this case  is where removal could be   potentially conducive to public confusion     Ritz Hotel at    Pioneer Computers submits the following in support of its contention that the Court should not exercise its discretion in favour of Pioneer KK  Pioneer KK has had a sufficient length of time to use the Pioneer KK marks  since   and   respectively  and there is no evidence of any present intention on the part of Pioneer KK to expand its products within the removal goods or the removal services  It is not in the public interest  nor is it reasonable  that a trade mark owner should be permitted to  hoard  trade marks for goods and services that it has not used and has no present plans to use  Pioneer KK s business is specifically in the field of audio and audio visual products  particularly for entertainment  as evidenced by the slogan  It is not in the business of manufacturing IT equipment  apart from the one period between   and   when Pioneer KK manufactured the Palcom computer  It does not manufacture computer products  It exited that market  The legitimate interests of Pioneer KK as the trade mark owner are protected by s   and s   of the Act with respect to the tests for infringement of the registered marks  They are also protected by the Trade Practices Act    Cth   To maintain trade mark registrations for unused goods and services would be to substitute the rights properly given under ss   and   with that provided in s    Pioneer Computers has used the name  PIONEER  as part of its corporate name and as its trade mark in relation to computers  particularly personal computers  notebook computers and servers  for   years  The retention of the removal goods and removal services on the Register would empower Pioneer KK to take action against Pioneer Computers in circumstances where it does not have a legitimate interest to protect because there is no use in relation to the removal goods or the removal services  It is misleading to the public to maintain a registration in respect of goods and services that are not used by Pioneer KK under the Pioneer KK marks  The parties have co existed for   years without any apparent confusion in the marketplace  There has been little demonstrated confusion to date and any future confusion is readily able to be remedied as it has been in the past  Pioneer Australia has known of Pioneer Computers and its business from about   giving rise to an inference that Pioneer KK does not consider Pioneer Computers  business as relevantly within or impacting upon Pioneer KK s business  How should the discretion be exercised Approximately   of Pioneer Computers  annual turnover is from sales to governments and their departments through its Government  Education and Corporate Division  It has been an Australian Government Endorsed Supplier since    It has substantial contracts with State governments and all computer equipment that has been supplied to those governments has  since   been supplied under or by reference to the trade mark PIONEER  The support and servicing of personal computers  notebooks and servers  and the provision of on site training and service has  since   been provided through Pioneer Computers  Service Division  predominantly for PIONEER branded built to order computers under warranty citedSchutz Werke GmbH   Co KG v Forecast   Trading Pty Ltd     IPR  Regulation     provides for the declaration to state that an inquiry has been made and to set out the findings of the inquiry  It does not provide for proof even at a prima facie level of the case to be made  The onus for showing intention and or use once an application for removal is made shifts to the trade mark owner  who is required to rebut the allegation  s   of the Act   There is no requirement that the statutory declaration prove the alleged non use or satisfy any evidentiary onus  The application and supporting statutory declaration need only   mirror the statutory provisions     Shanahan at     citing Schutz Werke GmbH   Co KG v Forecast   Trading Pty Ltd     IPR    Neither the Act nor the Regulations require that within those documents  an applicant for removal must establish sufficient interest in the non use application or prove its case  Pioneer KK did not raise any issue concerning the validity of the applications or compliance with Regulation     before the Registrar  Pioneer Computers submits that as a matter of discretion Pioneer KK should not be permitted to rely upon any such defect in this application to the Court which is an appeal from the Registrar s decision  Pioneer KK points out that it is not a question of discretion but of mandatory compliance  s  a  provides that an application must be in accordance with the Regulations and this application represents both the initiating process before the Registrar and before the Court citedSettef SpA v Riv Oland Marble Co  Vic  Pty Ltd     IPR  Pioneer KK emphasises that it only needs to show some use of the removal goods during the relevant period to maintain its registration  The fact that use of the mark may have been discontinued in relation to some goods after that time cannot  it submits  be relevant to the present application  Further  Pioneer KK points out that it does not need to prove significant sales of goods or provision of services during the relevant period  One sale of each type of good would be sufficient  providing that sale or use of the mark is bona fide and not de minimis   Settef SpA v Riv Oland Marble Co  Vic  Pty Ltd     IPR   at    The characterisation of the goods sold by Pioneer KK Pioneer Australia is and has been a market leader in optical drives in Australia  Purchasers of its products included consumers  businesses and government organisations  Pioneer Australia has provided end user support for its optical drive products  It is common ground that Pioneer KK is a manufacturer of audio and audio visual equipment including radios  televisions

  HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Explanatory Memorandum does not really assist  Section   makes it clear that it has been inserted without any attempt to limit or qualify the discretion provided for in s    The Explanatory Memorandum itself speaks of  clarification   This can either recognise that s   expands the discretion or that it simply makes it clear which factors could already be taken into account under s    In my view  use of a trade mark on closely related goods or services could already be taken into account in exercising the discretion under s   in the unamended section  As I read s     the discretion to be exercised is not limited  For the purposes of s     account may be taken of use of the trade mark on closely related goods or services  even in cases commencing prior to the introduction of s    This has particular relevance in the case of goods that are at the forefront of technological change  Justice Dixon  as he then was  said in The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Rohm and Haas Company   HCA         CLR   at   that the basis of a claim to proprietorship in a trade mark so far unused is found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark  the intention to use it on or in connection with the goods and the application for registration  In Magnavox   the Assistant Registrar considered a mark which had not been used across the scope of the goods claimed  In coming to a conclusion as to use across a class of goods  I agree with the Assistant Registrar  at   that   the rights arising from the registration of a trade mark should not be confined to the stage of technological development of goods specified when the mark was registered    The relevant date for the exercise of the discretioncitedTotev v Sfar   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlAn appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks is in the Court s original jurisdiction  None of the powers of the Court under s   of the Act affect the s   application  which goes to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine an application for removal of a trade mark  The hearing is a  hearing de novo  where the judge reviewing the decision of the Registrar begins afresh and exercises any discretion exercised by the Registrar  The parties may adduce evidence as provided for in s   of the Act which evidence may include evidence not before the Registrar  see discussion in Totev v Sfar   FCAFC         FCR   by Emmett J at   and   Blount at   followedUnilever Australia Ltd v Karounos     FCR  Further  in the demand  Pioneer KK sought generally to prevent Pioneer Computers from any use of the mark PIONEER and demanded a complete cessation of the use by Pioneer Computers of any mark which is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to  the Pioneer Trade Mark   The allegation of infringement of Pioneer KK s registered marks was general and not restricted to the removal goods and the removal services  A general allegation was sufficient in New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co operative Company     IPR   for Gummow J  at   and in Unilever Australia Ltd v Karounos     FCR   for Hill J  at   to find that the recipient of the allegation was a person aggrieved in respect of all of the goods classes for which the relevant trade marks were registered
