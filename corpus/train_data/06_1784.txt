edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Minister submitted that the matters alleged by the applicant concerning prison conditions could not amount to torture  relying on de Bruyn v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC         FCR   at   per Kiefel J  with whom Spender J  expressly  and Emmett J  by necessary implication  agreed   In relation to the applicant s complaints concerning the Departmental submission s use of HIV statistics  the Minister submitted that the Departmental submissions had relied on a clearly appropriate and probative source  which was the Centre for Disease Control   One of the grounds identified in the applicant s first affidavit was that the Minister s power under s   was unconstitutional  However  this ground was not touched upon at all in oral submissions  Further  the applicant stated on a number of occasions at the hearing that he relied upon pages   to   of his supplementary book  whereas his written submissions under the heading  Constitutional challenge  commence at page    From this I infer that his constitutional challenge was not pressed   There is no general entitlement to an oral inquiry and none arose in this case  Nor was the Minister obliged to pursue lines of inquiry proposed by the applicant by contacting and speaking to people  There is no substance  in my opinion  in the contention that the extradition request was made in bad faith  In addition  there is no substance  in my opinion  to the contention that the Minister was biased in any sense  As to the ongoing litigation of the applicant  it is not apparent to me that this was a matter the Minister had to take into account  Indeed it appears to me to be irrelevant  It is not for this Court to determine whether the applicant might be tortured  an issue not raised by a mere allegation of mistreatment or abuse in prison  see de Bruyn at   or whether the applicant could mount a successful extradition objection based on his race or religion  They were matters to be considered by the Minister  They were  No reviewable error on the part of the Minister has been demonstrated   The application should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the

Customs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the result  there was material before the Minister which indicated that by reference to the applicable laws of the United States  the undertaking given by the United States   had the character of an undertaking by virtue of which the penalty of death would not be carried out  if indeed an undertaking was required  In the absence of evidence to the contrary  it can be assumed that the Minister read this material and considered the issues raised by it  see Chan v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA   at    appliedMcCrea v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The applicant submitted that a death penalty undertaking had not been given which conformed with s  c  of the Act  He further submitted that such an undertaking was required in his case because the extradition offence could attract the death penalty  For those reasons  he contended that the Minister should not have determined to surrender him and should have exercised his discretion under s  f  not to surrender him  The applicant submitted that he was not asking the Court to inquire whether the United States would in fact honour its undertaking not to seek or apply the death penalty  see McCrea v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC         FCR    Rather his complaint was that the undertaking given did not comply with the requirements of s  c  of the Act as established in McCrea    The initial undertaking was provided by Mr Fermin  in his earlier affidavit  In his supplementary affidavit  Mr Fermin said that none of the special circumstances listed in s     of the Code applied to the extradition offence for which the applicant s extradition was sought and that no special circumstances had been alleged in the charging document  In the result  the death penalty was not an available punishment for the charge against the applicant  The Embassy of the United States of America in Canberra provided a diplomatic assurance  dated   February   in the following terms     Based on the information provided by the Deputy District Attorney for San Bernardino County  California  and in accordance with Article VIII of the   U S  Australia Extradition Treaty  as amended by Article   of the   Protocol Amending the Extradition Treaty  the United States Government assures the Government of Australia that the death penalty will not be sought or imposed against Lawrence Rivera   A further assurance was given by Mr Michael Ramos  the then recently elected District Attorney  on   September   stating that  T he San Bernardino County District Attorney s Office will not seek to impose the death penalty on Lawrence Rivera on the instant matter    The only issue potentially of substance  in my opinion  raised by the applicant concerned whether the Minister could have been satisfied about the matter addressed by s  c    namely that an appropriate undertaking concerning the death penalty had been given  The Minister had an undertaking from the United States and information derived from affidavits concerning Californian law and the charge that had been laid  In McCrea   the Full Court said  at      It does not follow from the conclusion that a legally enforceable undertaking is not needed that the requirements of s  c  will be satisfied merely by the giving of an undertaking that follows the language of the provision and which has been made by a person with appropriate authority  An evident object of s  c  is to provide a safeguard against the carrying out of the death penalty upon a person extradited from Australia under the Act  Whilst the object of the provision can be variously stated  the seriousness of the subject matter suggests that it is very unlikely that nothing more than compliance with a verbal formula was intended  Consistently with the object of the provision  there is much to be said for the view that the expression  by virtue of an undertaking  requires that the decision maker consider whether the undertaking is one that  in the context of the system of law and government of the country seeking surrender  has the character of an undertaking by virtue of which the penalty of death would not be carried out  It would seem unlikely that the object of the provision was intended to be achieved only by the favourable  to the person accused  exercise of the discretion conferred by s  f     emphasis added  While the observations in the latter part of this passage are only tentative  I think it is appropriate that  as a single judge  I proceed on the basis that those tentative views correctly state the law  Perhaps my approach might be different if I held a strong view to the contrary  but I do not  Accordingly  in view of the submissions made by the applicant  it is necessary to ascertain whether the Minister  in the face of an undertaking that the death penalty would not be sought or imposed  considered whether it was an undertaking which  in the context of the system of law and government of the United States  had the character of an undertaking by virtue of which the penalty of death would not be carried out   The essence of the case of the applicant was that the question of whether facts existed which fell within the concept of  special circumstances  for the purposes of ss     and     of the Code was a matter to be determined by the jury and  at least impliedly  were not matters the determination of which was within the control of the prosecuting authorities or the trial judge  The authorities referred to by the applicant  namely the judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States in Ring and the earlier case of Apprendi   represent a line of authority that facts which establish legislative special circumstances  and which enable or require the imposition of the death penalty  must be found by the jury and not by a trial judge in the course of a sentencing hearing  However  having regard to the affidavits of Mr Fermin  the relevant parts of which were before the Minister in a summary way  who was the Deputy District Attorney responsible for prosecuting the applicant  a statutory condition precedent to  special circumstances  being considered was that  special circumstances  are charged  Mr Fermin deposed that they had not been charged appliedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Palme   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for the Minister submitted that the Minister was not obliged to provide the applicant with a copy of the Departmental submissions as a matter of natural justice  Where the Department evaluated material  and that material had been made available to someone in the applicant s position as it had here to the applicant  it was not correct to say that natural justice also required the comments or submissions themselves to be provided  see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Palme   HCA         CLR   at   to     I turn to consider other issues  It appears from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow and Heydon JJ in Ex parte Palme  at   to   that  in a case such as the present  the applicant is not entitled to see and comment on the Departmental submissions and that the mere failure to make them available does not constitute a denial of procedural fairness without more  In certain circumstances a person affected by a decision may be entitled to see submissions made to a decision maker  But that could well depend on the contents of the submissions and the extent to which the person was otherwise aware of material that would be provided to the decision maker  However there is no requirement  as a matter of general principle that submissions be made available irrespective of their contents and the circumstances in which they come to be considered by the decision maker  None arose in this case
