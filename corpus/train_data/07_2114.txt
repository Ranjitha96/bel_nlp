Nudd v Australian Federal Police   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedNudd v R   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A convenient recitation of the events that are a background to this proceeding is to be found in the head note of the decision of the High Court in Nudd v R   HCA         ALR    What is there stated is as follows     Police and customs officers intercepted a yacht in Moreton Bay on   May    On board they found   kilograms of cocaine  There were two men on the yacht when it was boarded  a citizen of the United States  Peter Jackson and his son  Gareth Jackson  They left Mexico in May   on the yacht and sailed to Noumea  From there they flew to Australia on   December   where they remained until their visas expired in March    On   March   Peter Jackson fled to the United States where he obtained a false United States passport  On   March   he flew from the United States to Noumea on the false passport  He then sailed the yacht from Noumea to Moreton Bay where the boat was intercepted  The part of the period of three months  in which the two men were in Australia  they lived in a motel in Sydney  A listening device had been installed in their room to intercept telephone conversations  Eleven of those conversations were between Peter Jackson and the appellant     whom I interpolate is the applicant presently before me      who was an Australian citizen and then living in Los Angeles  The appellant was charged  in other words  the present applicant was charged  with being  knowingly concerned  in the importation of cocaine into Australia contrary to section  B of the Customs Act     The intercepted conversations between the appellant and Jackson  the prosecution contended  showed clearly that the former was assisting  or attempting to assist in the resolution of the problems of making arrangements for the importation  The appellant was convicted by the Supreme Court of Queensland of the offence  charged and sentenced to   years imprisonment  An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed  The appellant appealed to the High Court contending there was a miscarriage of justice because of the incompetence of counsel who  failed to understand and properly advise on the elements of the offence charge  failed to take appropriate instructions  failed to appreciate or advance two lines of defence reasonably open  made submissions of fact in error and or without instructions to do so  failed to object to inadmissible and highly prejudicial material contained in the telephone intercepted tapes  being admitted   The conclusions reached by the High Court in that case were that Mr Nudd s counsel was incompetent to a serious degree  Notwithstanding that  the Court further concluded that he had not been deprived of a chance of an acquittal because the case against him was a strong one and effectively unanswerable   It is necessary to say something further about the chronology of events that led up to that High Court appeal  As I have mentioned  on   May   an arrest warrant sought to be impeached in these proceedings was issued  On   February   an extradition occurred with the result that Mr Nudd was returned to Australia and then remanded in custody  He was convicted on   July   before a Supreme Court Judge and a jury  It was then that the sentence of   years imprisonment was imposed with a non parole period of   years  On   May   his appeal against conviction  a sentence appeal having been abandoned  was dismissed  The High Court proceeding that I have mentioned concluded with the dismissal of the appeal  following an earlier grant of special leave on   March     Since then  in a number of ways  in the Courts of the State of Queensland  Mr Nudd has sought to ventilate whether the original arrest warrant was valid  It suffices to note that none of those proceedings has been successful  The Respondents to the application have today sought its dismissal on the basis that it is an abuse of process  They particularly point to s  A of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act and its deprivation where it applies on this Court s jurisdiction   One may note that the position ought not be any different were it the case that  in some way  it was the Judiciary Act   that was called in aid in respect of the application  That is because there is in both the Judiciary Act   in s  B   and in the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act   s  A   a coincidence of reference and definition  That coincidence is in the term  Related criminal justice process decision   For that reason I consider only s  A of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act   That section provides that relevantly in para  a    At any time when the prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth  a State or a Territory is before any court      Or   b      An appeal arising out of such prosecution is before any court      No court has jurisdiction to hear  continue to hear or determine an application under this Act by the person who is or was the defendant in the prosecution in relation to a related criminal justice process decision
