www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  No question arises in the present proceedings of the Tribunal ascribing to particular information provided by an applicant a significance or relevance of which an applicant may have been unaware  VAF v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       ALR   at     per Finn and Stone JJ  And no question arises as to a particular significance or relevance being attached to   information   provided to the Tribunal  as opposed to   information   provided for the purposes of the visa application  Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry   FCA       FCR    The   reason   for the Tribunal s decision was simply the inadequacy of any of the materials provided by the now Appellant  The Tribunal thus concluded      The mere fact that a person claims a fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is  well founded  or is for the reason claimed  It remains for the first named applicant to satisfy the Tribunal that all of the statutory elements are made out  Although the concept of onus of proof is not appropriate to administrative inquiries and decision making the relevant facts of the individual case will have to be supplied by the applicants themselves in as much detail as is necessary to enable the decision maker to establish the relevant facts  The Tribunal is not required to make the applicants  case for them  Nor is the Tribunal required to accept uncritically any and all of the allegations made by applicants    MIEA v Guo   Anor   HCA         CLR   at   Nagalingam v MILGEA   FCA         FCR     Prasad v MIEA   FCA         FCR   at       The first named applicant did not attend the hearing and this leaves the Tribunal with claims which are untested and stated in the most general terms  The Tribunal was unable to explore with the first named applicant who the  antisocial elements  were that threatened him  when he was threatened  how he was threatened  whether he reported the threats to the police and  if so  what action the police took  who the people were he suspects attacked him  when he was attacked  how he was attacked  whether there were any witnesses present  whether he reported the attack to the police and  if so  what action the police took  whether he had considered relocation within India and what is likely to happen to him if he were to return to India in the foreseeable future   The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution   Further the Tribunal has not been able to discuss with the first named applicant independent country information which may be relevant to his particular claims  In these circumstances the Tribunal is unable to be satisfied that the first named applicant has a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of his political opinion or any other Convention based reason followedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA       CLR   First  the   certain adverse information used by the Tribunal   has not been identified  The proceedings before the Tribunal did not involve  as do many applications for review  an assessment of competing accounts of factual events  The Tribunal in the present proceedings had limited information available to it and  recognising that there was no onus of proof upon the now Appellants  simply concluded that       The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution    Section  A   it may be accepted  imposes a mandatory requirement  SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA   at   per McHugh J  at   per Kirby J  at   per Hayne J    HCA       CLR    But no breach can be established unless the particular   information   which it is claimed needs to be the subject of an invitation to comment upon or respond to can be first identified   The First Appellant appeared unrepresented before this Court this morning but did have the benefit of an interpreter  Other than expressing a desire to stay longer in Australia  he provided no assistance as to the   certain adverse information   to which his Notice of Appeal refers  Indeed  it was unclear whether the complaint was directed to the use of information already provided or whether the complaint was more directed to the lack of an opportunity to provide further information  If the latter  it is considered that adequate opportunity has already been extended in which to provide information   Second  the   information   considered by the Tribunal and the   information   which it ultimately considered did not make out the Applicant s case was that in fact supplied by the Applicant  Such   information   is not   information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision that is under review   within the meaning of s  A a  followedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA       ALR   The contents of such   information   as was observed in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       FCA       ALR   at   by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ    if     believed     would  one might have thought  have been a relevant step towards rejecting  not affirming  the decision under review    Moreover  it was the inadequacy of the materials provided by the now Appellants that was the   reason   for the Tribunal s decision  Where it is the Tribunal s   disbelief of the appellant s evidence arising from inconsistencies therein  it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting  information  within the meaning of para  a  of s  A    SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       FCA       ALR   at   followedSZEFM v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous

In the present case  as in SZEFM v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA            the Tribunal was identifying the deficiencies or inadequacies in the appellant s case  It was not relying on information communicated to or received by the Tribunal but setting out its thought processes  There was no information that the Tribunal was obliged to give to the appellant by reason of s  A     followedSZEZI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  As in SZEZI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   the applicant for the visa did not attend before the Tribunal  despite an invitation to do so  Allsop J there concluded         The reason for the decision was simply  and no more than  the evaluative conclusion founded on the perceived inadequacy of the information  in the sense of an absence of detail and extrinsic explanation which had been invited  It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision  It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason   The same comment may be made in the present appeal   The appeal should thus be dismissed   The orders of the Court are     Appeal dismissed      The Appellants to pay
