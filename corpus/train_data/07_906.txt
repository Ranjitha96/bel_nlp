Corp Pty Ltd   FCA   at     and accepting for the purposes of argument the respondents  estimate of   I am positively satisfied the threshold has not been met   On   August   following applications to the Federal Court and creditors  meetings  the assets of the Ansett Group were pooled  In the course of his reasons granting approval of the proposed pooling Goldberg J said         the pooling proposal by the Administrators is sensible and advantageous to most of the creditors from a practical point of view    Administrators  Seventh Report to Creditors    March   p   The significance of pooling for present purposes is that an award of costs against the applicant would be recoverable from all the assets of the Ansett Group  and not just the assets of the applicant  I turn therefore to the evidence as to the current assets of the Group distinguishedCresvale Far East Ltd  in liq  v Cresvale Securities Ltd  No       ACSR   Mr Campbell also referred to the decision of Austin J in Cresvale Far East Ltd  in liq  v Cresvale Securities Ltd  No       ACSR    His Honour was there concerned with an application for costs against an administrator under a deed of company arrangement  The administrator was a party and in the substantive proceeding had been removed by order of his Honour on the basis of findings of impropriety and negligence in the conduct of the administration  Because the office of company administrator was comparatively new  and not the subject of any costs jurisprudence  his Honour reviewed a number of analogous situations   Under the heading  Personal costs orders against administrators  Austin J discussed a number of scenarios commencing with that identified by the sub heading  Where the company under a deed of company arrangement is a party to the proceedings  but the administrator is not  and the company is unsuccessful       That of course is the hypothesis on which the present application is brought   C resvale does not assist in the present case  The applicant company has not been shown to have insufficient funds to meet the costs of a successful opposing party citedWentworth v Wentworth   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  His Honour said at          Clearly costs may be awarded against the company under administration  but the company may have insufficient funds to meet the costs of the successful party  In the normal case  the litigation will have been conducted on behalf of the company by the administrator  The question arises whether the court may order the administrator personally to pay the successful party s costs  although the administrator is not a party to the proceedings           His Honour then goes on to discuss Knight and points out that subsequent amendments to the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules have abolished some of the traditional categories of grounds for an order costs against non parties referred to in that case  at   citing Wentworth v Wentworth   NSWCA   at      There are no equivalent provisions in Order   of the Federal Court Rules    He concludes at   that the New South Wales Rules would prevent a court in that State from awarding costs against an administrator who is not a party to the proceedings citedRagat Developments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     ALR   In the event of the respondents  application being dismissed  the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis  One established ground for such an order is that an application has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the losing party  in the present case the

Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Ragat Developments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     ALR   at   citedBeach Petroleum NL v Johnson     ACSR   Thus the threshold requirement  which the respondents must establish  is that there is reason to believe that the applicant will be unable to pay the respondents  costs if they are successful  In the words of von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson     ACSR   at         the power of the court under s   arises if credible evidence establishes that there is reason to believe there is a real chance that in events which can fairly be described as reasonably possible the plaintiff corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant on service of the allocatur  if judgment goes against it  This will be so even if in other events which can also be fairly described as reasonably possible the plaintiff corporation would be able to pay the costs  distinguishedKnight v F P Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Campbell SC for the respondents referred to Knight v F P Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR    The High Court there held that the Supreme Court of Queensland had jurisdiction to award costs against non parties  in that instance receivers and managers of insolvent companies which had brought unsuccessful proceedings  Mason CJ and Deane J at   pointed out that the availability of an order for security for costs at an early stage of litigation would be a  strong argument for refusing to exercise a discretion to order costs against a non party   However  as their Honours went on to point out  that did not deny the existence of a jurisdiction to award costs against non parties  as distinct from the possible exercise of discretion to refuse such an order   His Honour said at          Clearly costs may be awarded against the company under administration  but the company may have insufficient funds to meet the costs of the successful party  In the normal case  the litigation will have been conducted on behalf of the company by the administrator  The question arises whether the court may order the administrator personally to pay the successful party s costs

postulating the availability of an order for security for costs  their Honours were alluding to the situation where an impecunious plaintiff is backed by a non party which has an interest in the plaintiff succeeding in the litigation  cf Federal Court Rules O   r  b  White v Butt     KB   at      In such a case  an order for security for costs against the plaintiff will  as a matter of practicality  require the non party to provide the security  Failure to make such an application for security for costs at an early stage may  as a matter of discretion  tell against the later making of such an order against the non party  In the present case there is no question this Court has jurisdiction to make an order for security for costs against the applicant  which of course is a party  the problem for the respondents is that the statutory pre condition for such an order has not been established
