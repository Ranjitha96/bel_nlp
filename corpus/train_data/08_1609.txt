constraint imposed by s  A  cannot be disregarded  it did not appear that anything would have been gained had the Applicant been directed to file an application seeking judicial review as opposed to treating the Notice of Appeal as though it were such an application  The Minister did not oppose this course  It is not considered that such a direction would have facilitated the expeditious hearing and resolution of the proceeding  The matter first came before the Court on   October    The Applicant was then in detention at Villawood Detention Centre and it was desirable to have his grievances resolved as quickly as was consistent with a proper resolution of the issues raised in his Notice of Appeal   It is the practice of this Court to hear such cases as quickly as possible  eg  Awan v

au au cases cth HCA  html  Construing the Notice of Appeal as an application for judicial review  however  only confronted the Applicant with two further difficulties  namely   a  whether or not the Tribunal did in fact fail to consider the impact of the decision upon the Applicant and the hardship which would be occasioned to him if the delegate s decision was affirmed  and    b  whether or not the Tribunal was  in any event    bound   to take such a consideration into account     A failure to take a consideration into account only gives rise to a reviewable error if the consideration was one which a decision maker was   bound   to take into account  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason J   The simple fact is that the Tribunal did consider the hardship which would be occasioned to the Applicant if the decision cancelling his visa was to be affirmed and it did make findings which referred to the evidence  The Applicant was given an opportunity for the merits of his position to be considered  Regrettably for the Applicant  the Administrative Appeals Tribunal resolved the merits of his claims adversely to him   Even if there had been a failure to consider the impact upon the Applicant of a decision affirming the cancellation of his visa  it is not considered that any jurisdictional error would in any event have been committed by the Tribunal   Similarly  in Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC       ALD   Tamberlin J concluded    The second submission involved the assumption  as his Honour pointed out  that it was a relevant fact for the minister to consider whether Mr Vu could receive medical treatment  in particular methadone treatment  for his heroin addiction if he goes back to Vietnam  His Honour found that the minister was aware of that fact and took it into account when making her decision  We have grave doubts that any of the particular matters of hardship identified by Mr Vu  even if not taken into account by the minister  would show jurisdictional error in her decision  The minister clearly addressed both the issue of hardship generally and each of the topics to which the direction issued under s   of the Act required the decision maker to consider when exercising discretion  The particular matters of hardship raised by Mr Vu are not matters which  either expressly or by necessary implication from s   of the Act  required the minister to have regard to each of them  see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR       ALR     Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf     CLR       ALR       ALD       HCA     North and Mansfield JJ agreed followedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Also relevant to the making of that determination is a proper understanding as to the role played by a statutory requirement to provide reasons  A primary purpose in imposing such a requirement is to inform the parties as to why their evidence or arguments have prevailed or been rejected  Reasons provided by an administrative tribunal  it is well accepted  are not to be read with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang   HCA         CLR    In a passage which is now oft cited  Brennan CJ  Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ there made the following observations as to the proper role of a reviewing court when considering a statement of reasons provided by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal    When the Full Court referred to  beneficial construction  it sought to adopt an approach mandated by a long series of cases  the best exemplar of which is Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic   FCA         FCR    In that case  a Full Court of the Federal Court  Neaves  French and Cooper JJ  collected authorities for various propositions as to the practical restraints on judicial review  It was said that a court should not be  concerned with looseness in the language     nor with unhappy phrasing  of the reasons of an administrative decision maker  The Court continued   The reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error   These propositions are well settled  They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed  In the present context  any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision  This has been made clear many times in this Court       citations omitted   So construed  the reasons of the Tribunal in the present proceeding reveal a careful consideration of the evidence that was presented and a careful consideration of the case being advanced by the Applicant  No doubt because the Applicant was unrepresented  no clear submission was advanced that any particular aspect of hardship to the Applicant was a discrete matter which had to be separately addressed and resolved in any manner different to that set forth in the Tribunal s reasons    Hardship   it must be recognised  is a matter which may manifest itself in any one of a number of different ways  To that extent  it is a state of indeterminate content  But no particular piece of evidence could be identified which gave rise to any particular aspect of   hardship   which was not addressed by the Tribunal in its reasons   Not surprisingly  the reasons of the Tribunal address the terms of Direction No    And  even though that Direction does not mention hardship to the Applicant as a matter specifically to be addressed  it was inevitable that a decision affirming the delegate s decision would operate to deny to him an ability to remain in Australia  His desire to remain was presumably the reason why he sought review by the Tribunal  Even though such reference as was made to the effect of the decision upon the Applicant may have been dealt with within the context of the Direction itself  hardship to the Applicant remained a matter taken into account by the Tribunal and adequately addressed by it in the reasons provided   The manner in which the Tribunal has resolved the evidence and submissions advanced before it  it is considered  does not expose the Tribunal to any sustainable contention that it failed to consider the hardship that affirming the decision under review would occasion the Applicant  nor to any sustainable contention that it failed to make those findings of fact material to the decision it made followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA       CLR   Having considered the evidence and the submissions advanced  and extended to the Applicant a   reasonable opportunity   to present his case  the remaining task of the Tribunal was that set forth in s  B  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   namely to make its findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence upon which those findings were based  That sub section provides as follows  Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision  those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based   This provision does not require the Tribunal to set forth all findings of fact  but only those findings on   material questions of fact   cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at      A more focussed submission in respect to hardship may have led the Tribunal to make a further finding  But the failure to make such a possible further finding does not expose reviewable error on the part of the Tribunal   When determining whether the reasons for decision of the Tribunal have adequately dealt with the particular legal and factual issues which were advanced before it  the Court must take into account a variety of factors  These include the comparative importance  or lack of importance  of any particular submission being advanced for determination and whether the evidence being presented raises any issue in need of resolution  even if not expressly the subject of a submission  especially in the case of an unrepresented party   In the present proceeding  and in accordance with Direction No   the Tribunal gave consideration to those matters which the Minister and the Government   directed   should be given   particular importance   and those matters which it directed should be given   less individual weight    Relevantly    hardship   to a party whose visa was cancelled was not a matter specifically addressed by the Direction   Similarly  in Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC       ALD   Tamberlin J concluded    The second submission involved the assumption  as his Honour pointed out  that it was a relevant fact for the minister to consider whether Mr Vu could receive medical treatment  in particular methadone treatment  for his heroin addiction if he goes back to Vietnam  His Honour found that the minister was aware of that fact and took it into account when making her decision  We have grave doubts that any of the particular matters of hardship identified by Mr Vu  even if not taken into account by the minister  would show jurisdictional error in her decision  The minister clearly addressed both the issue of hardship generally and each of the topics to which the direction issued under s   of the Act required the decision maker to consider when exercising discretion  The particular matters of hardship raised by Mr Vu are not matters which  either expressly or by necessary implication from s   of the Act  required the minister to have regard to each of them  see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR       ALR     Minister for Immigration

Kasupene and Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  He first entered Australia in October   and left within two weeks  He again entered Australia in August    On the latter occasion he was granted a special category visa  Both before and after entering Australia the Applicant committed a number of criminal offences  His visa was cancelled by a delegate of the Minister on   June   pursuant to s   of the Migration Act    Cth   He appealed that decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and on   August   the Tribunal affirmed the decision  Re Kasupene and Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   AATA     On   September   the Applicant filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court and an Affidavit   The Notice of Appeal    read together with the Affidavit    identified the two grounds of appeal sought to be relied upon as being   i  a failure to have regard to a relevant consideration  namely the hardship that the decision would occasion to the Applicant  and   ii  a failure on the part of the Tribunal to set out its findings on the question as to hardship and a failure to refer to the evidence upon which the findings were based    as was required by s  B  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth    An initial difficulty confronting the Applicant was the fact that the decision of the Tribunal is a   privative clause decision   and hence is not susceptible of appeal  The inability to appeal arises by reason of s  A b  and  d  of the   Act which relevantly provides as follows  Limited jurisdiction of the Federal Court   Despite any other law  including section  B of the Judiciary Act   and section   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act     the Federal Court has

FCA   this Direction was described as   a comprehensive and careful document    Allsop J there observed    The direction is a comprehensive and careful document of   pages  It makes clear in the preamble that the exercise of the discretion whether or not to cancel the visas will take into account a wide range of factors including the protection and the expectations of the Australian community  the nature of the crimes committed  the non citizen s links to Australia and any relevant international law obligations of Australia  The preamble went on to say that the purpose of refusing or cancelling a visa under s   is to protect the safety and welfare of the Australian community and to exercise a choice on behalf of the Australian community as a whole as to who should be allowed to enter or remain in the community  The task to prepare material for a consideration of such matters  objectively understood  is wide reaching and significant   Given the terms of s  A    it was Direction No   which properly provided the structure for the Tribunal s reasons and its consideration of the evidence   Relevantly  Direction No   provides as follows      If a non citizen does not pass the Character Test  decision makers must have regard to the following considerations when exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia          In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa  there are three primary considerations   a  the protection of the Australian community  and members of the community   b  the expectations of the Australian community  and  c  in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration  the best interests of the child or children          The factors relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community of the entry or continued stay of a non citizen include       c  whether visa refusal or cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct  general deterrence           It is the Government s view that the following are examples of offences which are considered by the Government to be very serious       f      assault or any other form of violence against persons       l  serious theft  including  white collar  crimes    such crimes are of concern because of the amounts of money involved and or the disruption caused to individuals  business and Government             General deterrence aims to deter other people from committing the same or a similar offence  While not a conclusive factor in itself  general deterrence is an important factor in determining whether to refuse or cancel a visa  The general deterrence factor may be relevant in a number of ways   a  the nature of the offence may be such that visa refusal or cancellation may deter others from committing similar offences          The Tribunal in the present proceeding addressed  as it was required to do  those matters set forth in Direction No      Consistent with the Direction   the Tribunal addressed the three   primary   considerations set out in Direction No     being    the protection of the
