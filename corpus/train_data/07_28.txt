Manatiy v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedPotter v Minahan   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mrs Manatiy  a British subject  was six years of age when she first came to Australia  in    She travelled on her father s passport  the stamped  though long since cancelled  original having been provided to the Tribunal  The relevant legislation governing entry into Australia at that time was the Immigration Act      Cth   the Immigration Act   As British subjects  Mrs Manatiy s parents and family then had the right to enter and reside in  any part of the King s Dominions except in so far as that right has been modified or abolished by positive law  Potter v Minahan   HCA         CLR   at    Though the Immigration Act  s   imposed some number of prohibitions upon immigration into Australia  none were applied to Mrs Manatiy or to her parents citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Finally  it was recognised at the time of the   legislation that there was a small number of  absorbed persons  who were lawfully in Australia as permanent residents despite not holding entry permits  In the Migration Legislation Amendment Act   provision was made for a special class of permanent visa for such persons to be known as  absorbed person visas  see Migration Legislation Amendment Bill   Explanatory Memorandum  paras      I would note in passing that  because of her departure from Australia in   Mrs Manatiy rendered herself ineligible for such a visa  see the Migration Act     s    now     although British subjects who entered Australia prior to   and who remained here thereafter could qualify for that visa  Apparently Mrs Manatiy s mother holds such a visa  The point of present emphasis  though  is that the   and   legislation made possession of a valid visa the sole criterion for determining the lawful status of a non citizen within Australia  see Crock  Immigration and Refugee Law in Australia   Federation Press     on absorbed persons visas see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         ALR   at          The respondent Minister has objected to the applicant seeking relief in this Court in respect of a claim which was not made to the Tribunal and which was disavowed by her solicitor  It is further contended that even if the case now sought to be put had been presented to the Tribunal it could not have succeeded  Mrs Manatiy did not meet the requirements of subpara    e  in any event  In these circumstances it is said  even accepting that a common mistake was made by the Tribunal and Mrs Manatiy in relation to the applicable definition of  entry permit  it would nonetheless be futile to remit the matter to the Tribunal   Mr Ower for Mrs Manatiy in contrast has submitted that the case he now seeks to put concerning an entry permit clearly arose from the materials before the Tribunal and the mistake it shared with Mrs Manatiy s solicitor was the cause of its not dealing with it   The simple and direct answer to the present application is that when Mrs Manatiy entered Australia in   and while she remained in Australia until   she did so in virtue of a legal regime which did not require her to have permission so to enter or to reside in Australia  As a British subject  proof of which was provided in her father s passport  she had a right to enter Australia  While British subjects seeking to enter Australia after the coming into force of the Migration Act were required to obtain an entry permit permitting them to enter and remain in Australia  Mrs Manatiy s continued presence in Australia from that time was unaffected by this legislative change  Her right to remain in Australia existed in virtue of the lawful rights she had when she entered Australia in    It was not abrogated by the Act  Nor did the Act abrogate any permission she had to enter Australia  Her original entry was as of right  none of the prohibitions of s   of the Immigration Act having application to her  Until her departure in   she belonged to a class of persons lawfully in Australia who stood outside the entry permit regime for so long as they continued to remain in Australia  It was only when the universal system of visas for non citizens was instituted in the     reforms that the existence of this class itself required address  see Nystrom at      The principal response  as I have noted  was to be found in the deeming provision of s    now s   of the Migration Act which effected the grant  subject to limitations  of absorbed person visas  One of its applications was to members of the class I have noted above who satisfied the requirements of s   on s   see Nystrom at       Mrs Manatiy s entry into Australia in   and her remaining in Australia until   were not in virtue of any permission given by the Commonwealth under either the Immigration Act or the Migration Act   In consequence  she could never  cease to hold an entry permit     before turning   for the purposes of subpara    e   I accept the Minister s submission in this respect as also the submission that it would be futile to remit the matter to the Tribunal because of the Tribunal s mistake as to the proper meaning to be ascribed  entry permit  in that subpara  The actual result would remain the same   In reaching this conclusion I have implicitly rejected the case put by the applicant  Though it has shifted somewhat in the course of written and oral submissions  it is premised on the agreed proposition that the preposition  or  in the operative   definition of  entry permit  i e   permission to enter or remain in Australia  is to be read disjunctively  While I agree with this premise as far as it goes  it does not in my view capture the full scope and burden of the   definition  Considered in the context of the entry permit system instituted in the   Act  the definition had to accommodate itself to multiple possibilities  I simply instance  a  permissions to enter for a purpose but not to remain   b  permissions to enter and to remain  and  c  permissions to remain  the non citizen being already in Australia  To be added to these were those permissions which facilitated  as well  re entry into Australia  A consequence of this  in my view  is that the preposition  or  in the   definition on its proper construction is to be read as  and or  i e  conjunctively and disjunctively to accommodate the above possibilities  Thus a person who has permission to enter and to remain in Australia has an entry permit  not two such permits  I would note that such was made explicit in the original s   of the   Act  as it is currently  in relation to visas  in the present s   of the Migration Act  citedRe Patterson  Ex parte Taylor   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On   June   the Immigration Act was repealed and the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   came into force  The new Act abolished the common law right of British subjects to enter Australia  It imposed the requirement that any constitutional immigrant wishing to enter Australia had to possess an instrument described as an  entry permit  see s    as enacted in   see also Re Patterson  Ex parte Taylor   HCA         CLR   at          Mrs Manatiy remained in Australia until   when she left Australia  She was then aged    She returned to Australia in   to visit her parents and she revisited Australia on several subsequent occasions before her entry in December   on a visitor visa  She held a succession of such visas until she was granted a Bridging Visa on   March   on account of the visa application which is the subject of these proceedings   The class of visa Mrs Manatiy applied for is described in Sch   of the Migration Regulations   as a  Subclass   Close Ties  visa  For present purposes the particular requirements of cl   she claims she met were those of subcl      It provided        An applicant meets the
