Doelle v Department of Families  Housing  Community Services and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBeadle v Director General of Social Security   AATA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  htmlEarlier in time  a Full Court had observed in Beadle v Director General of Social Security   AATA         ALR   at   that    We do not think it is possible to lay down precise limits or precise rules     The phrase  although lacking precision  is sufficiently understood not to require judicial gloss  I refrain  in this case  from adding any judicial gloss in respect of the term  special circumstances   It seems to me that that which has earlier fallen from courts as to what those words carry with them is more than sufficient  When one reads the reasons of the learned Federal Magistrate insofar as they address the subject of the special circumstances aspect of the controversy which fell to the AAT to resolve one is left  in my opinion  with two impressions  Firstly  that the learned Federal Magistrate correctly apprehended the nature of the special circumstances test which fell for the AAT to apply  and secondly  that the learned Federal Magistrate did appreciate that that test fell for application in the circumstances of Mr Doelle s particular case  In particular  at para   of the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court  one finds the following  The facts were considered against the established test with the tribunal concluding  at para        there is no or insufficient probative evidence that the applicant s circumstance are somehow unusual or exceptional such that there are  special circumstances  enough to warrant the debt being waived  One then finds the following observation made by the learned Federal Magistrate    Despite the contention in his notice of appeal that the AAT incorrectly interpreted and or applied the meaning of the expression  special circumstances  in section  K of the SS Act no particulars were advanced in support of that contention  The Tribunal correctly informed itself of the relevant test and its determination was open to it on the facts of the case  Ultimately the conclusion drawn by the AAT was one of fact citedBoscolo v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlGiven the nature of that challenge  it is helpful to reflect upon observations which have been made in earlier judgments as to the nature of a special circumstances test  In Boscolo v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         FCR   at   French J  as his Honour then was  observed    It is generally futile to search for its meaning in terms of other words  It is in essence instrumental  a direction to the decision maker that the discretion it is not likely to be enlivened    If helpful to speak in terms of its meaning almost all of it comes from context  I note that the learned Federal Magistrate made particular reference  at para   of his reasons for judgment  to Boscolo s case citedCommonwealth Banking Corporation v Percival   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn this regard  it is helpful to recall observations made  now long ago  by Brennan J  as his Honour then was  in Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at   which statement was referred to with approval in this Court in Commonwealth Banking Corporation v Percival   FCA         FCR     The error of law which an appellant must rely on to succeed must arise in the facts as the AAT has found them to be  or it must vitiate the findings made  or it must have led the AAT to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make  There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact  Therefore  an appellant cannot supplement the record by adducing fresh evidence merely in order to demonstrate an error of fact citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Elton   ATC  Later  in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Elton   ATC   Davies J observed that although he might have come to a different view on the facts had he been called upon to make the decision  no error of law was demonstrated  His Honour there  as others have frequently done since in respect of appeals under s     was demonstrating a principle of restraint in terms of the jurisdiction that is consigned to the court in appeals from the AAT  It seems to me that the learned Federal Magistrate did just that in disposing with this aspect of the challenge which Mr Doelle made to the AAT s decision  Thus  those grounds of appeal which seek to challenge the way in which the Federal Magistrates Court dealt with the findings of fact made by the AAT must fail  It is convenient  having regard to the reference to Waterford s case  to make brief reference to an endeavour which Mr Doelle made to supplement the record of the proceedings by proffering a document which I marked for identification as exhibit A  Mr Doelle did not give sworn evidence that this document comprised part of the record before the AAT  and  in a statement which he made from the bar table  was unable to confirm one way or the other whether it was  indeed  part of the material before the AAT  The Commonwealth s position was that it did not comprise part of the material before the AAT  It certainly did not form part of the material which was transmitted to the Court by the AAT  as required  in respect of an appeal under s   citedGroth v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Groth v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         ALD   at   Kiefel J observed that    The words require something which distinguishes  a person s  case from others  to take it out of the usual or ordinary case citedJess v Scott     FCR  In Jess v Scott     FCR   at   albeit in a different context but  nonetheless  by reference to the term  special circumstances  a Full Court observed of that term that     It is  an elastic test  suitable for application across a range of situations     It is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power  but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify departure in the particular circumstances from the ordinary rule citedMinister for Community Services and Health v Chi Keong Thoo     ALR  A similar view of the meaning of a term such as  special circumstances  is to be found in the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Community Services and Health v Chi Keong Thoo     ALR   at   followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlHaving regard to the decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR     and subsequent decisions of Full Courts of this Court  there can be no doubt that an appeal to this Court from the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of rehearing  not an appeal stricto sensu   That said  the nature of the appellate jurisdiction is necessarily influenced by the nature of the proceeding which is the subject of appeal  In this instance  that proceeding was an appeal on a question of law  It seems to me to follow  having regard to the observation made by Brennan J in Waterford s case  that it would be impermissible  on an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court which had entertained an appeal under s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   to receive  by way of an endeavour to supplement the record  material which could only go to a challenge to the factual conclusion reached by the AAT  For those reasons  I have not had regard to exhibit A in the disposition of the appeal  I turn  then  to the question which necessarily confronted the learned Federal Magistrate  in light of the conclusion which he had reached concerning the ability  reasonably  of the AAT to make the finding of fact that it did in relation to the composition of the settlement moneys  His Honour correctly apprehended that s  K of the Social Security Act makes provision for the exercise of discretion in relation to the imposition of the lump sum preclusion period refund obligations  where  special circumstances  exist  It seems to me  also  that his Honour correctly apprehended the case law  such as it is  as to the meaning of that term  special circumstances  One finds in para   and para   of the learned Federal Magistrate s reasons reference to pertinent authorities  His Honour recites  at para   of his reasons for judgment  that no issue was taken with the AAT s identification of the appropriate test  Before me  Mr Doelle was concerned that the learned Federal Magistrate had not dealt with the special circumstances test correctly  in that  so he submitted  the court below had failed to appreciate that the ramification of the special circumstances test was that each case is different  In other words  the nature of the challenge seemed to be that the court below and  for that matter  the AAT  had failed to appreciate that it was at the very essence of the special circumstances test that it required the consideration of its application in the circumstances of a particular case citedSecretary Department of Social Security v Hodgson   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlA cautionary note was sounded by Hill J in Secretary Department of Social Security v Hodgson   FCA         FCR   at   in his Honour s observation that the term carried with it       no requirement that the case be extremely unusual  uncommon or exceptional   emphasis added appliedWaterford v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii
