SZMKU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAppellant P  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlAlthough it was apparently not raised as a ground of review in her application in the Federal Magistrates Court  Scarlett FM observed  at   that the appellant complained about the standard of interpretation in the Refugee Review Tribunal  His Honour rejected that complaint  referring to an authority of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Appellant P  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    The appellant appeared in person this morning  She was assisted by a Mandarin interpreter  She addressed me orally on the grounds of appeal  which essentially amount to a re argument of the grounds of review which were rejected by Scarlett FM  As I have already said  the first ground falls into two parts  The appellant expanded very slightly on the first part of this ground this morning  She said that she had been nervous and under what she called  spiritual pressure   In my view  this ground must be rejected for the reasons given by Scarlett FM in   of his reasons appliedMinister For Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere was nothing in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal or in the evidence which revealed the slightest suggestion that the Presiding Member approached the review with a closed mind  see Minister For Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng   HCA         CLR    The appellant argued the second ground upon the basis of a breach of section  A of the Act  She was unable to identify precisely what information the Tribunal was required to disclose to her  but the effect of what she said was that the Tribunal ought to have provided her with information about the inconsistencies in her evidence  so as to give her an opportunity to address those inconsistencies appliedRe Refugee Review Tribunal  ex parte H   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe second part of this claim was the claim of a reasonable apprehension of bias  Scarlett FM set out the test stated by the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal  ex parte H   HCA         ALR    His Honour was of the view that there was nothing in the Tribunal s reasons or in the evidence which disclosed a reasonable apprehension of bias within the test stated by the High Court  The second ground of review was that the Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under section  AA of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act   His Honour approached the matter upon the basis that the word  information  in section  AA has the same meaning as it has in section  A   The answer to this submission is to be found in the observations of the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal  ex parte H at    Gleeson CJ  Gaudron and Gummow JJ there said that    Where  as in the present case  credibility is in issue  the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented often vigorously  Their Honours also said at   that     T he need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question appliedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR  Scarlett FM was of the view that there was no information that would come under the purview of section  A  of the Act and he observed  at   that the decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   at   is authority for the proposition that inconsistencies in an applicant s evidence do not amount to information for the purposes of section  A  The third ground of review was that the Tribunal made its finding without any substantial ground apart from its assumption  Scarlett FM  at   was of the view that this ground could not be maintained because it was an attempt to seek merits review which  of course  is not available in the Federal Magistrates Court  It is well established that the Tribunal s disbelief of an applicant s evidence arising from inconsistencies in it cannot be characterised as constituting  information  within section  A  see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   at    Accordingly  this ground of appeal must also be rejected  The third ground of appeal was said to be unfairness  The appellant claimed that she had been treated unfairly  because the Tribunal described her evidence as  vague   This is not an accurate description of the Tribunal s reasons  As I said earlier  it rejected the appellant as a witness of truth  It said  at   that its       overall impression is that the Applicant has taken a couple of true facts from her past and  possibly with external assistance      heavily interlaced them with false information followedSZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhether this issue is approached upon the basis of a claimed contravention of section  A  or section  AA   the result is the same  There is authority for the proposition that  information  in section  AA has the same meaning as  information  under section  A  SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per
