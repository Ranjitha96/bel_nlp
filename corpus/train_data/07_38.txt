at         Merck   Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals   FCAFC         IPR   at            referred toHill v Evans     LJ Ch   With a prior paper anticipation as alleged here  and applying the reverse infringement test  with assistance from the words of Lord Westbury LC in Hill v Evans     LJ Ch   at   the following can be stated        The antecedent statement  here the Euro patent  must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive  understand and be able practically to apply the discovery  the disclosure in the Euro patent  without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention can be made useful  If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the careful application of the discovery  that affords sufficient room for another valid patent   Mr Ben Meir propounded a disclosure analysis of the Euro patent which saw all the integers of the patent in suit disclosed  Dr Clarke agreed with the  technical substance  of Mr Ben Meir s disclosure analysis  but he expressed the view that the disclosure was not such as to amount to instruction in that he did not think that the Euro patent provided a person skilled in the art with sufficient information to implement a system contemplated by the patent in suit   Thus the parties were apart on the degree or quality of the exemplification or disclosure in the Euro patent  Before turning to that question  it is important to appreciate the significance to this aspect of the case of my view of integer  d v  for claim   and integer  g  for claim    My disagreement with the applicants  construction of the aspect of claims   and   about the means for processing data operating to apply the promotional program rules to user personal data  means that it is necessary for the Euro patent to reveal in the relevant sense a system and a method whereby that element is disclosed not merely a system of a card  belonging to  or  identified with  one person or a unique number which has points updated after purchasing pursuant to some algorithm  as in the Sushi Train system  My views on the construction of integer  d v  of claim   and integer  g  of claim   make it possible for me to express my views about the question of anticipation fairly shortly citedImperial Chemical Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents
