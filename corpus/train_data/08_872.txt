Hill JJ followedClark v ING Life Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Where leave is sought to discontinue proceedings pursuant to O   r  d  the question as to who should bear the costs falls to be determined under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act   Clark v ING Life Ltd   FCA   at     per Rares J  Where such leave is sought  it is not the function of the Court to make a prediction as to the outcome   Even though there has been no hearing in respect of the Amended Application seeking review of the s   notice issued in November   the hearing of the Applicant s Motion seeking discovery had proceeded virtually to the conclusion of submissions on behalf of the Applicant  Agreement as to the manner in which the proceedings were to be resolved also necessarily carried with it the conclusion that a decision with respect to the Motion became unnecessary  A view had been formed  however  that had it been necessary to resolve the Motion   the Applicant would in all likelihood have been unsuccessful citedDutton v Republic of South Africa   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Counsel for the Applicant contended that the purported revocation of the November   notice was beyond power  Counsel contended that there was simply no power to revoke or withdraw a notice issued under s   Dutton v Republic of South Africa   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   per Wilcox  Whitlam and Moore JJ  However that contention may have been resolved  Counsel accepted that there would be no utility in pursuing the present proceedings if no reliance was to be placed by the Minister upon that November   notice   Finland  it may be noted  also has not placed reliance upon that notice in the Local Court and the Local Court file has been marked   no jurisdiction     Given the revocation  or at least the purported revocation  in April   it was not surprising that Counsel for the Respondent Minister gave the assurance which was sought  namely that no reliance was to be placed upon the November   notice  There then emerged some common ground  namely that there was no utility in further pursuing the proceedings and that the assurance was to be noted by the Court   One consideration relied upon in concluding that there should be no order for costs is the fact that there was an agreement reached in advance of any final hearing that the proceedings should not further be pursued  From the Applicant s perspective  the assurance offered by the Respondent Minister that there would be no reliance placed upon the November   notice was   as good as a win   from the Minister s perspective  he maintained that the notice had been validly issued and also validly revoked  but that there was little point in ultimately resolving either contention  How the decision of the Full Court in Dutton was to be addressed remained unexplained  From whichever perspective the proceedings were approached  the result was the same    there was agreement that there was no utility in further pursuing the litigation followedGribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission     FCR   In the absence of a hearing on the merits  Finkelstein

special circumstances   Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd   VSC   at   per Gillard J  Concurrence is  however  expressed with respect to the general approach as set forth by both Finkelstein and Hill JJ   The approach set forth by Finkelstein J in Gribbles Pathology does not preclude consideration being given to such an assessment as to prospects of success of an application or a motion filed in proceedings  It may well be inappropriate to entertain submissions for the purpose of forming an assessment as to prospects of success solely to inform the discretion as to costs  but where agreement as to the manner in which proceedings may be resolved has been reached only at a point of time when the Court has in fact entertained submissions and been informed as to the competing submissions of the parties  any preliminary view that a Court has reached at that point of time may be taken into account when making an order as to costs   Such practical success as the Applicant may have achieved in securing the assurance from the Minister that there was to be no reliance placed upon the November   notice    and perhaps thereby entitling him to an order for costs in his favour    has been very much tempered by the lack of success that he would in all likelihood have suffered had the Motion proceeded to decision  Moreover  the discontinuance of the proceedings has denied the Respondent Minister the opportunity of vindicating his position   This assessment of the competing positions of the parties has also been a consideration upon which considerable reliance has been placed in concluding that there should be no order for costs citedMinister for Home Affairs v Tervonen   FCAFC       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC
