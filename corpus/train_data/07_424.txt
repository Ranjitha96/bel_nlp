cases cth HCA  html  The reliance by the appellant s Counsel s on Azzi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   to support this ground was  in the Federal Magistrate s opinion  inappropriate because it was a case where the weight of authority was clearly against the appellant  His Honour noted that this case indicated the need for exceptional circumstances to arise before a duty to investigate arose  The Federal Magistrate found that the appellant s circumstances were completely lacking in features which might support the exceptional duty referred to in Azzi   The Tribunal specifically informed the appellant that it did not intend to initiate any post hearing approaches and the appellant did not suggest what evidence the particular witness could provide to answer his case  Further  there would have been obvious difficulties in relation to obtaining and giving weight to any evidence obtained from such a witness   Accordingly the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application   The appellant appealed to this Court by notice of appeal filed on   October    Six grounds were raised  namely that the Federal Magistrate erred by not finding error in the Tribunal s decision as follows         Jurisdictional error by affirming the decision of the Tribunal that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution      Lack of procedural fairness in the proceedings of the Tribunal in that it did not give the appellant a reasonable opportunity to respond to independent evidence that Awami League activists were able to live in Bangladesh without being persecuted for involvement in political activities and membership of that party without becoming a victim of violence      The Tribunal and the delegate had not dealt with a key component of the appellant s claims  namely the harassment for his political views      The Tribunal failed to consider  the risk of persecution that forced the appellant to leave Bangladesh  the appellant was a credible witness  failing to judge whether persecution of Awami League members occurs under the existing regime  that the opponent political activists are specific targets of the fundamentalist political party Jamat e Islam and the BNP who have formed a coalition      Legal error by asserting the appellant did not have a genuine fear of persecution for a Convention reason and did not take into consideration the threat to the appellant s life or liberty that he would experience on return to Bangladesh      The Tribunal fell into error by asserting that the appellant need not maintain his membership of the Awami League   In relation to the balance of the submissions of the appellant  to the extent that they were not subsumed by the grounds of appeal I note        to the extent that the Tribunal made findings that the appellant s oral evidence and the advice in his letter of   February   provided incomplete and vague information with respect to charges against him  such findings were findings of fact and not open for review  and    the appellant s claim that the decision of the Tribunal was not a bona fide attempt to act in the course of the Tribunal s authority is general and vague  however to the extent that the appellant claims that the Tribunal was obliged to make further inquiries with respect to the appellant s claims  the claim cannot be sustained as the Tribunal is under no duty to inquire  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA         ALR   at       In light of these issues  in my view it is not expedient and in the interests of justice to allow the grounds raised on appeal by the appellant  and not previously raised in the Court below  to be argued and determined by this Court   Accordingly  the appeal should be dismissed with costs   ORDERS        The name of the first respondent be amended to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship      The Refugee Review Tribunal be added as a second respondent to these proceedings      The appeal be dismissed      The appellant pay the costs of the first respondent    I certify that the preceding forty   numbered
