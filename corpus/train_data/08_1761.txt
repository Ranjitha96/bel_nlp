in Court is enforceable by order of the Court pursuant to O   r   Federal Court Rules   The submission of the first respondent that it anticipates the applicant submitting that the first respondent  giving the undertaking is not enough  is    curious in light of the power of the Court to enforce the undertaking  and    indicative of the fact that the respondents  in seeking to introduce this

   McCarthy v McIntyre   FCA     Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA     Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd  No     FCA   citedMID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   In my view    This is not a case where the first respondent has made a deliberate tactical decision not to adduce  during the proceedings  evidence which was already available  However the occurrence of the events the subject of the   April affidavit flow from a deliberate tactical decision of the first respondent during the trial to give an undertaking  the purpose of which as the respondents admit was to bring themselves within the principles articulated in MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR    I consider that  in principle  the distinction between    o making a deliberate tactical decision during the proceedings not to adduce evidence then available  and    o making a deliberate tactical decision during the proceedings to give an undertaking from which evidence follows after the trial   is minimal in the sense that both decisions relate to the manner in which the first respondent has decided to conduct its case and the evidence to be put before the Court  In summary  it is as a result of decisions taken by the respondents  during the proceedings as to the manner in which their case was to be conducted  that the respondents now seek to put additional evidence before the Court     I consider that allowing the respondents to supplement their case after the conclusion of the applicant s case at trial would offend the principle of finality of litigation  It is not in the interests of justice that a litigant should be entitled to adduce additional evidence after the conclusion of proceedings simply to bolster its own position  which I consider is the intention of the respondents here     As the respondents concede  the evidence in the   April affidavit simply provides additional evidence that there has been compliance with the undertaking given by the first respondent in Court  I do not consider this evidence so material that the interests of justice require its admission  Further  while the evidence in the   April affidavit is of relevance to the primary proceedings  I consider that it would be of particular relevance in the event that the applicant subsequently claimed that the first respondent had failed to comply with that undertaking  I make this observation because I consider that the evidence goes primarily to compliance with the undertaking     I do not consider that the additional evidence in the   April affidavit is evidence which  if believed  would most probably affect the result of the primary proceedings  The undertaking given by the first respondent in Court on   March   and supported by an affidavit of Mr Cranitch  is enforceable on its own terms     While  as I have already indicated  I consider the applicant has demonstrated little potential prejudice should I exercise my discretion to permit the respondents to adduce this additional evidence  that is not in itself a reason to exercise my discretion in the respondents  favour in light of the other factors I have taken into account   Accordingly the notice of motion should be dismissed  I shall hear submissions as to costs   I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
