Doulton   UKHL       AC   referred toCPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The word  beneficiary  reaches beyond a person who has a beneficial interest in the trust property  It is possible for the legal estate in land to be vested in  trustees  without equitable ownership being vested in someone else  The trustees must  however  owe fiduciary obligations in respect of the trust property to persons who  although they may have no interest in the trust property and may never have an interest in the trust property  are called  beneficiaries   In CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue of the State of Victoria   HCA         CLR     the High Court rejected  at   a  dogma  that  where ownership is vested in a trustee  equitable ownership must necessarily be vested in someone else because it is an essential attribute of a trust that it confers upon individuals a complex of beneficial legal relations which may be called ownership   That is to say  there can be a trustee who owes fiduciary obligations in respect of trust property to  beneficiaries  without any of the latter having a beneficial interest in the property citedGartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners   UKHL       AC   Although the discretionary objects do not have a beneficial interest in any property

as they did only six days after the Trusts were established  Even if Helen had an interest in the half interest the subject of Helen s Trust as at   June   the Trustees  power of sale would have made it a defeasible interest  see Kent v SS  Maria Luisa   No     FCAFC         FCR   at     It would cease to be defeasible only when the half interest ceased to be part of Helen s Fund and subject to

her entitlement were satisfied   Clause     of the Deed provided relevantly  as follows  Fund Subject to Relevant Requirements This Deed shall be read and construed on the basis that the provisions of

Deed   Holman v HH Martyn   Co Ltd     All ER   According to the ordinary meaning of the word  a beneficiary is any person for whose benefit a trust is to be administered and who is entitled to

discussedSaunders v Vautier     Beav   The concept of absolute entitlement against the Trustee is related to the well known case of Saunders v Vautier     Beav    In substance  it was held in that case that where a beneficiary is absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a trust asset as against the trustee  the beneficiary is entitled to terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the asset to him or her or at his or her direction  In order to invoke the rule  multiple beneficiaries can come together so that their beneficial interests exhaust the beneficial entitlement to the asset  For example  the rule could be invoked by a life tenant and the remainder man  since their interests in combination exhaust the beneficial interest in the subject property  in combination they are entitled to direct the trustee to transfer the property as they will   In Public Curator of Queensland v Union Trustee Company of Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Higgins J noted  Those who

noted that unlike the position under the rule in Saunders v Vautier   subs   of s     and of s     applies only to trusts of which there is a  sole beneficiary   Moreover  the provision requires the sole beneficiary to be absolutely entitled  to the asset  over which the trust was created  In the present case  the asset over which the trust was created was Helen s half interest in the Property   It is sufficient to say in relation to the absolute entitlement aspect that cll    b  and  c  are fatal to the applicants  cases  Those provisions were set out at   above  As mentioned  I do not agree with counsel for the applicants that the word  may  in cl    b  means  must    There is no ground for saying that once Helen s Fund was established  Helen was absolutely entitled as against the
