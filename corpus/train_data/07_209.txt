NBLH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedD cor Corp v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   The test for whether leave to appeal is granted or refused is well established  D cor Corp v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at     The applicant s grounds contained in his notice of appeal do not identify any error in the Federal Magistrate s decision  Rather  the grounds are directed to the decision of the Tribunal   The applicant alleges that the Tribunal failed to comply with sections  A and  A of the Act   This ground is unparticularised  The Tribunal as first constituted wrote to the applicant inviting his comment on two occasions  The Tribunal was not required to write to the applicant  as reconstituted  in respect of any information upon which it relied as its findings relied on the applicant s evidence given to the Tribunal  both as originally constituted and as reconstituted and the documents provided by the applicant to the Tribunal  Accordingly  there is no merit to this ground referred toMinister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Jia Le Geng   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The fourth ground alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence in favour of the applicant and that it only considered evidence which was not in favour of the applicant  To the extent that this is an allegation of bias the applicant has not met the requirement that such an allegation be firmly and distinctly made and clearly proved  Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Jia Le Geng   HCA         CLR   at      To the extent that the Tribunal  upon considering the evidence as a whole  which it expressly stated it had done  gave no weight to evidence on its face favourable to the applicant it did so because it found the applicant not to be a credible witness  No error and in particular no jurisdictional error arises by reason of that approach which was clearly open to it   Accordingly I am of the opinion that the Federal Magistrate s decision is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Federal Court  Whilst the applicant disagrees with the decision below he has been unable to point to any relevant error  It is evident that no substantial injustice would result from my refusal of leave
