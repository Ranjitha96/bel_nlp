have a retrospective operation  The amendment has a future action on past events and not a prior effect on past events  Pearce DC and Geddes RS  Statutory Interpretation in Australia at     Coleman v Shell Co of Australia Ltd      SR       It takes account of antecedent facts and circumstances as a basis for what it prescribes for the future  and it does no more     Robertson v City of Nunawading   VR   at   citedDoro v Victorian Railways Commissioners   VR   Mr Perry relies on s   of the Acts Interpretation Act which provides that  unless the contrary intention appears  the repeal of s   cannot affect his rights acquired under the SRC Act  He submits that the language of the Amending Act and s  B  in particular  does not include clear indicia of retrospectivity nor clear indication that the  unjust result  or  palpable injustice  of an effect on his right to compensation were intended   Doro v Victorian Railways Commissioners   VR   at   per Adam J    The words of s  B  make it clear that the subsection is intended to apply to former employees and also to a person who subsequently ceases to be an employee  This is also apparent from the extrinsic material  The Second Reading Speech refers to  former employee  and the Explanatory Memorandum to   people who are no longer employed by the Commonwealth   as well as to   former employees     The right to this compensation under s  B  is not a right unlimited as to time or entitlement  It is activated when the employee ceases employment  It ceases if the employee ceases to be incapacitated  Weekly payments of compensation under the Act with respect to future weeks are contingent upon the employee being incapacitated for work as a result of his or her injury during those future weeks citedEsber v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Perry s situation is different to those in Kraljevich and Esber v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR    In Kraljevich it was held that the injured employee had an entitlement to be compensated   for a sum of money calculated in a particular way    at   per Latham CJ   This was  however  in the context of a right of redemption  which accrued on injury  Similarly  in Esber   there was a substantive right in existence at the time of the relevant repeal and amendment citedFisher v Hebburn Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu

as to confer or impose or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law had defined by reference to the past events   Maxwell v Murphy   HCA         CLR   at   per Dixon CJ   Prima facie  it is construed as having a prospective operation only and as not attaching new legal consequences to facts or events which occurred before its commencement   Fisher v Hebburn Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Fullager J  citedKingston v Keprose Pty Ltd     NSWLR  appliedKraljevich v Lake View and Star Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Perry contends that his rights to compensation by way of payments calculated under s   before amendment accrue as at the date of injury  or impairment  He says that those rights to payment continue in perpetuity until certain events prescribed in the statute take place  which are not relevant  or Parliament legislates to alter or remove those rights  That must be done clearly and the intent made clear before such an amendment would have retrospective effect to take away his rights   Kraljevich v Lake View and Star Ltd   HCA         CLR    The right to payment or compensation extends to the manner of calculation   Kraljevich at   per Latham CJ   If s  B  affects those rights to compensation  he submits that it operates retrospectively  Accordingly  he submits  the subsection does not apply to an injury which occurred before the commencement date   Mr Perry s situation is different to those in Kraljevich and Esber v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR    In Kraljevich it was held that the injured employee had an entitlement to be compensated   for a sum of money calculated in a particular way    at   per Latham CJ   This was  however  in the context of a right of redemption  which accrued on injury  Similarly  in Esber   there was a substantive right in existence at the time of the relevant repeal and amendment   The Amending Act does not differentiate between injuries that occurred before and after it came into force  It does not affect employees  rights to payments due on cessation of employment but only the calculation of those payments as made from week to week  the procedure or mode of calculation  cf Kraljevich    The rights of the employee are fixed by reference to the injury and the continuation in or cessation of employment  The changes brought about by amendment were not to those rights but to the practice and procedure applied to enforce or calculate them   Maxwell at   per Dixon CJ   Those changes do not have a retrospective operation on Mr Perry s rights

HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second construction satisfies the direction in s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act   I am of the view that the second construction applies to subs  B  and that it is neither an unreasonable nor unnatural construction   Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh J   Section  B  does not apply to deprive Mr Perry of the increment  It follows that the decision of the Delegate was correct and the Decision incorrect  That is  Mr Perry is entitled to continue to receive the increment as part of the calculation of his normal weekly earnings   As I have determined that s  B  does not deprive Mr Perry of his entitlements under s   it is not necessary to decide the question whether s  B  has a retrospective effect  However  as that was the basis of the Tribunal decision  I shall consider it briefly citedProject Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Both before and after amendment  s   applied to persons who had been injured  Section  B  refers to the circumstance   if the employee has ceased  or ceases  to be employed       These are words which should be given a meaning   Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ   Section  B  specifies application both to a person who has been injured and has already ceased to be employed and to a person who has been injured and who ceases to be employed  Contrary to the Tribunal s conclusion and Mr Perry s submission  the subsection does apply to persons injured before the commencement date  It applies to periods of incapacity after its commencement and changes the method of calculation of normal weekly earnings   As s  B  is drafted  it is not the injury but the cessation of employment that is the condition that imports the application of the subsection  with effect from each future indexation date in relation to that cessation  by reference to the Wage Cost Index  There is no dispute that Mr Perry suffered an injury prior to the commencement of the Amending Act and the operation of s  B  and ceased to be employed after that date  Mr Perry contends that  if s  B  applies to preclude him from payment of the increments to which he would have been entitled under s   but for the amendment  it will visit new legal consequences on facts or events occurring before its commencement citedRobertson v City of Nunawading   VR   Section  B  does not have a retrospective
