Equally well accepted are the principles informing the proper exercise of the s   discretion  These are       i  ordinarily costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order           ii  where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim  the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed  and          iii  a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other parties  costs of them  In this sense  issue  does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or law
