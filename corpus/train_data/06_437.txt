SZGMB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The question of whether or not leave to appeal should be given is  of course  governed by well established principles  namely that an applicant for leave must establish that the decision in question is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave and also must show that substantial injustice would result from a refusal of leave to appeal   Bienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR   at     per McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ    Before proceeding to consider the issue of whether the application was filed in time  it is also necessary to consider the other bases upon which  if an appeal were initiated  the applicant would seek to argue that the trial judge erred in failing to set aside the decision of the Tribunal  The draft notice of appeal submitted by the applicant with his affidavit on   February   asserts that   a  the Tribunal failed  in effect  properly to consider his case  and     b  the Tribunal refused to accept that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution   His Honour recorded in his judgment that the applicant was a citizen of China and he had arrived in Australia on   October    The applicant had given evidence before the Tribunal on   February   as to his assertions of persecution  In essence  the applicant claimed to have been a practicing Catholic for over twenty years and that he feared persecution were he to return to China  He claimed to have been part of an underground church in his town in    He also claimed in his written application to the Tribunal to have studied the Bible  The Tribunal did not accept his claims for reasons which do not reveal any jurisdictional or other error   The Tribunal  in its detailed reasons  set out an exchange with the applicant in which it questioned him about fundamental and well known aspects of Catholicism and the Christian faith  For example  the Tribunal recorded the following questions and answers in its reasons         Tribunal  In the Catholic faith what books in the Bible tell us about Jesus            Applicant  I can t remember     Tribunal  What are the Ten Commandments    Applicant  I don t know      Tribunal  Can you name any of the Ten Commandments      Applicant  Can t remember  is it when you cannot eat meat  The Tribunal found that it was not satisfied with the applicant s credibility and that there were a number of inconsistencies in his evidence about various matters including his inability to answer basic questions about the Bible  the Catholic Church  Catholic teaching and Catholic practices  It gave the applicant until   March   to address in writing those inconsistencies that had been referred to during the hearing  The Tribunal found that at the hearing the applicant was unable to give any explanation for a number of the inconsistencies and his explanations for the rest were not reasonable  It found  in his written submission to the Tribunal the applicant has not addressed these inconsistencies  followedCoal   Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Ordinarily  if no additional evidence is admitted under section   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  or Federal Court Rules Order   r   an appeal and there has been no relevant change in the law  a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was an error on the part of the primary decision maker  As Gleeson CJ  Gaudron and Hayne JJ noted in Coal   Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission   HCA         CLR   at            That is because statutory provisions  conferring appellate powers  even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing  are construed on the basis that  unless there is something to indicate otherwise  the power is to be exercised for the correction of error  see CDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR   at       per McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ   consideredChan Ta Srey v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Subsequently  in Chan Ta Srey v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     Gray J held that s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  and s   of the Evidence Act   provided that the calculation of any relevant period by reference to which a document may be presumed to have been served under either of those enactments was to be addressed by reference to the date of posting  and not the date borne by the document  Thus s   of the Acts Interpretation Act   provides that there is a presumption  unless the contrary is proved  that a letter addressed to a person for which the postage was prepaid and which is posted  is deemed to have been effected at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of the post  Moreover  s   preserves the operation of s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   The latter provision creates a presumption  unless evidence sufficient to raise a doubt about the presumption is adduced  that a postal article  sent by pre paid post addressed to a person at a specified address in Australia  was received at that address on the fourth working day after it having been posted   Gray J did not refer to  nor was I referred to  s   of the Evidence Act   which makes special provision for the proof of letters sent by Commonwealth agencies  It provided as to a letter from a Commonwealth agency  until the definition of  Commonwealth agency  was removed from the section and a substituted definition placed in the Dictionary of the Act by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  as from   October   when it received the royal assent  see ss   as follows      A letter from a Commonwealth agency addressed to a person at a specified address is presumed  unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced  to have been sent by prepaid post to that address on the fifth business day after the date  if any  that  because of its placement on the letter or otherwise  purports to be the date on which the letter was prepared            In this section           business day  means a day that is not       a  a Saturday or a Sunday  or        b  a public holiday or bank holiday in the place in which the letter was prepared           Commonwealth agency  means       a  a Department within the meaning of the Public Service Act   or    b  a House of the Parliament  or          c  a person or body holding office  or exercising power  under or because of the Constitution or a law of the Commonwealth  or        d  a body or organisation  whether incorporated or unincorporated    established for a public purpose             i  by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory  other than the Australian Capital Territory  the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island  or          ii  by the Governor General  or              ii  by a Minister               letter  means any form of written communication that is directed to a particular person or address  and includes           a  any standard postal article within the meaning of the Australian Postal Corporation Act     and    b  any envelope  packet  parcel  container or wrapper containing such a communication  and    c  any unenclosed written communication that is directed to a particular person or address          Note   The NSW Act has no equivalent provision for section        Note   Section   extends the operation of this section to proceedings in all Australian courts   The Tribunal is a Commonwealth agency  being a body exercising power under a law of the Commonwealth  namely  the Act  The effect of s   is that the letter is presumed to have been received on the fifth business day after the date it bears  which  in practical terms  is likely to be seven days after the date   As Gray J pointed out   FCR   at       the letter of notification in that case did not comply with s  d ii  of the Act because it failed to state accurately the time within which the application for review might be made  Accordingly  the Tribunal s obligation to notify the applicant  in that case  of the decision not to grant the substantive visa he sought  which was imposed by s   had never been discharged   As s  d  of the Act says  if an applicant has a right to have a decision reviewed under  relevantly  Pt   the letter or document of notification must         state       ii  the time in which the application for review may be made  By s   a failure to give notification of a decision does not affect the validity of the decision   Although there may be some arguable issue  based on what Gray J said in Chan Ta Srey v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   I am satisfied that no sufficient doubt has been raised to warrant a grant of leave from his Honour s finding set out at   above that the lengthy and poorly explained delay justified his Honour s exercise of discretion in refusing to grant prerogative relief  I am of opinion that there has been no substantial injustice shown consideredMinister for Immigration v Singh   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court was that on   March   the Tribunal sent a letter to the applicant at his address notifying him of the Tribunal s decision to affirm the decision of the delegate which enclosed a copy of the Tribunal s decisions and reasons  The letter informed the applicant that he had   days within which to appeal to the Federal Court  It noted that if the letter were posted he would be taken to have received it seven days after the date of the letter   Presumably this was in reliance upon reg     of the Migration Regulations which so provided  However  in Minister for Immigration v Singh   FCA         FCR   at     O Connor and Mansfield JJ held that regulation to be invalid to the extent it sought to impose such time constraints   Regulation     made provision for deeming a document to be served   days after its date  It also permitted the document to be sent on the seventh day so that  in fact  it could not have been received until after the seventh day  A Full Court of this Court held that Regulation     was ultra vires the regulation making power   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Singh   FCA

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at      Kirby J agreeing at     and see also McHugh J to the same effect at      Hayne J in considering whether prerogative relief could be

There has been no suggestion of delay  waiver  acquiescence or other conduct of the appellants said to stand in their way   Here  an unexplained delay of over six years between the handing down of the decision and the commencement of the proceedings seeking judicial review appears to me to dictate that the interests of justice would not be served by a grant of leave to appeal  The applicant did not put evidence before his Honour or this Court  to support the fact that he had not been notified of the decision of the Tribunal  contrary to the statement in his application to the Court below  until he learnt of it in    That explanation  had it been made on oath could have been tested and his Honour could have made findings about it affirmedSZGMB v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court given on   February     SZGMB v Minister for Immigration   FMCA     The applicant lodged an application for a protection visa on   November    A delegate of the respondent refused to grant the protection visa on   April    The applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  for a review of that decision on   May    On   March   the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the applicant a protection visa   Before the trial judge    FMCA   at   and also before me  the applicant asserted  without giving evidence  that he had never received any notification of the Tribunal s decision until after he had been detained in   by officers of the respondent s department   It does not appear that his Honour invited the applicant to give evidence to support his assertion of non receipt of the letter of   March    Instead  his Honour proceeded to consider the matter but did not determine whether the applicant had been notified in accordance with the Migration Act    Cth  under regulations in force on   March    Rather  his Honour said that even if the Tribunal had made a jurisdictional error  the lengthy and poorly explained delay would be sufficient to persuade the court to exercise its discretion not to grant relief by way of a constitutional writ    FMCA   at     If there were evidence that the applicant had not in fact received the letter of   March   then he had a reasonable explanation for his delay   When the matter came before me for hearing  I inquired of Ms Radich  who appeared for the respondent  as to what the relevant law was regarding notification by the Tribunal of its decision to an applicant for review on   March    Ms Radich was not in a position at that time to assist with that material and asked for time to put in a written submission  I granted her leave to do so and gave directions for the applicant to provide written submissions in response  On   March   written submissions were received from counsel for the respondent  Ms McNaughton  On   March   I received written submissions from the applicant   The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had been involved in religious activities as he had claimed  It was also not satisfied as to the credibility of his claim to have been arrested because of activities involving his Catholic faith in which he claimed to have been involved  The Tribunal also made other credibility based findings concluding  as noted by the trial judge   FMCA   at      At the Tribunal hearing  the overall implausibility and lack of credibility of the applicant s claims was pointed out to him  The applicant was given the opportunity to clarify the contradictions regarding the various claims that he has made  but was unable to do so in any meaningful way either at his hearing or in the subsequent written submission  Given the significant adverse findings on credibility in relation to the applicant  the Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the applicant has a real chance of being persecuted for a convention reason in China in the foreseeable future  and is therefore not satisfied that the applicant s fear of persecution for a convention reason is well founded   The applicant told his Honour and also me that he suffers from motion sickness induced by travelling  He claimed to have been affected by that in the hearing before me even though he had been present in court for about one and a half hours before his matter was called on for hearing  He said that the motion sickness affected his ability to think and to respond  He said that a similar affliction had occurred when he gave his evidence to the Tribunal  and that had affected the fairness of the process both before the Tribunal  the Federal Magistrates Court  and presumably before me  I put to the applicant that he would always be affected by this at any hearing to which he had been brought  such as to the Court  and he appeared to agree with that proposition  In his written submissions  the applicant said that this condition          is now much better than before  So that there is no problem of carsick ness  for attending  the  Magistrate Court hearing this time   I observed the applicant to respond intelligently to questions which I put and I did not observe him to have any apparent difficulty in doing so during the hearing  He was able to read from and refer to notes which he had prepared in his own language  Moreover  for example  when I asked him about whether he had received notification from the Tribunal by reference to the letter of   March   contained in what had been the Green Book before his Honour  he was able immediately to pull the Green Book out of his bag and look up the relevant document  without any apparent problem at all   And  his Honour noted that the applicant had at no time informed the Tribunal member that he had had any difficulty relating to his car or motion sickness   FMCA   at    In his written submission the applicant said that he had not understood the Tribunal s procedures and that the Tribunal had not mentioned that if he were very sick another hearing date could be arranged  This was  he submitted  why he did not tell the Tribunal that he was sick and  so he argued  this is why the Tribunal made an error   On the applicant s argument  he did not tell the Tribunal of the sickness he claims to have been suffering  That being so  there is no basis for an argument that the Tribunal committed any jurisdictional error in failing to deal with the carsickness claim  I am satisfied that this ground does not raise any sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the decision of the trial judge on it  It was open to his Honour to reject it  inter alia   because there was no evidence to support it   Moreover  the applicant s complaints as to his motion sickness and any effect that may have had upon him at the hearing before the Tribunal have not been verified  The assertions which the applicant made about this matter both before his Honour and myself  were made as a submission not on oath  They were unsupported by any medical evidence  There is no suggestion in the reasons of the Tribunal  the trial judge or in the observations which I made of the applicant in court  which would enable a conclusion to be drawn that reliance upon this ground in an appeal would enjoy any prospect of success   The applicant also complained that the assistance provided to him from a legal practitioner  apparently appointed under the Refugee Tribunal Legal Advice Scheme  was inadequate  In the judgment below  his Honour makes reference to the fact that there had been some tardiness on the part of counsel who had been appointed to give advice the applicant   FMCA   at      As his Honour there noted  he had been informed by the counsel that had he provided advice to the applicant which was required under the scheme and that he  counsel  would not be appearing at the hearing   The applicant complained that the relevant counsel had not obtained the tapes of the hearing before the Tribunal or had not listened to the tapes and that his case had been decided by his Honour without the applicant having been able properly to prepare it  Again  those complaints appear to be ones which would have no prospects of success  First  they are  again  new assertions which are not the subject of evidence on oath  In his written submission the applicant acknowledged that he had received legal advice  albeit late  His Honour made the finding that he was satisfied that the applicant had received the advice to which he was entitled under the scheme   FMCA   at    Secondly  when I pressed the applicant to identify what was wrong with his Honour s decision  he said he was not able to identify any legal error because  understandably  he was not a lawyer  He said that he wanted a lawyer who would not charge and who could help him  Again  none of these complaints by the applicant raise any matter which would enjoy any prospect of success were leave to appeal granted   As at   March   s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act  provided        Refugee Review Tribunal to record its decisions etc  and to notify parties           Where the Tribunal makes its decision on a review  the Tribunal must prepare a written statement that               a  sets out the decision of the Tribunal on the review  and    b  sets out the reasons for the decision  and    c  sets out the findings on any material questions of fact  and            d  refers to the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based                  The Tribunal must give the applicant and the Secretary a copy of the statement prepared under subsection   within   days after the decision concerned is made                Where the Tribunal has prepared the written statement  the Tribunal must                 a  return to the Secretary any document that the Secretary has provided in relation to the review  and    b  give the Secretary a copy of any other document that contains evidence or material on which the findings of fact were based          Subsequently s   was amended by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act  No      Cth  Schedule   Items   and    Item   repealed the former s   and Item   inserted ss  A  D  All these amendments commenced on   June     In the Migration Regulations    consolidated as in force on   December   n b  regulations         or     were not relevantly amended until   July    the Regulations  reg     provided that a notice or statement to be given to an applicant in relation to a decision of the Tribunal was to be taken to be duly given if it was posted to his or her last address for service which he or she provided in connection with the application  Regulation     provided that if a document was to be given to or served on a person for the purposes of a review by the Tribunal and no other provision in regulations allowed for service  then the document could be given or served on the address for service provided by the applicant by posting it to him or her at his or her last known place of residence
