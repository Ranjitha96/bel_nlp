Piotto v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toPiotto v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA  This proceeding was heard concurrently with proceeding VID   of   see Piotto v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA    Each proceeding arises out of  Newstart participation failures  imposed on Mr Piotto by the respondent and subsequent decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal  to affirm those decisions  The applicant  Mr Piotto  is a long term recipient of a Newstart allowance  In   Mr Piotto received job search and other assistance from MatchWorks  on behalf of Centrelink  Centrelink administers the Social Security Act    Cth   the Act  on behalf of the respondent and other Commonwealth Government departments  Centrelink imposed a Newstart participation failure on Mr Piotto in    The Newstart participation failure arose from Mr Piotto s failure to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement on   September    the Participation Failure   As a result of the Participation Failure  Mr Piotto s Newstart allowance was cancelled with effect from   September    These reasons should be read in conjunction with the reasons in Piotto and especially in respect of the relevant legislative background which is set out in Piotto at      Mr Piotto seeks an order from this Court overturning the Participation Failure and reinstating his Newstart allowance  Mr Piotto also seeks other orders which are not necessary to traverse  On   May   Mr Piotto filed a notice of motion seeking an order that  The respondent resume Newstart appeal payments for the applicant  from the date they were terminated   September   and order that no reporting is required   In submissions before the Tribunal  the respondent argues that a valid delegation existed by virtue of an instrument executed by the respondent on   June   Instrument DEEWR SSL   of    That instrument  with effect from   June   delegates the respondent s power      to each person engaged by an Employment Services Provider to perform functions or to perform services under a relevant arrangement  each of my powers under or referred to in a provision of the Social Security Act   or the Social Security  Administration  Act   contained in Schedule   of this instrument  subject to the limitations in Schedule       The powers listed in Sch   to the delegation include the powers conferred on the respondent by ss   and   of the Act  Employment Services Providers include an  organisation that performs functions or provides services for the purposes of the social security law  pursuant to the Employment Services Contract       see cl  b   The instrument of delegation is in the same terms as that discussed in Piotto at      The respondent in its submissions to the Tribunal identified MatchWorks as falling within cl  b  of the instrument of delegation  namely that MatchWorks was an organisation which provides services to the respondent pursuant to the Employment Services Contract       The ability of Mr Piotto to engage in negotiation of a Newstart Activity Agreement is discussed in Piotto at      Additionally  as noted in Piotto at     a failure to negotiate a Newstart Activity Agreement is not a reasonable excuse for refusing to enter into an agreement for the purposes of s    B  of the Act  Additionally  Mr Piotto has not demonstrated he had a reasonable excuse for refusing to enter into the Newstart Activity Agreement  As noted in Piotto at   the matters which will constitute a reasonable excuse for the purposes of s   of the Act are serious matters which have a significant impact on that person s ability to comply with the requirement to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement  see also cl   of the Social Security  Reasonable Excuse   DEWR  Determination    Cth   I do not consider that Mr Piotto s disagreement over which terms were suitable for inclusion in the Newstart Activity Agreement constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purposes of the Act  In this respect  the Tribunal s decision to uphold the Participation Failure imposed on Mr Piotto was correct  The fourth ground of appeal fails  The notice of motion filed on   May   was not agitated by Mr Piotto at the hearing of this proceeding  The relief sought by Mr Piotto in that notice of motion is not relief which it is within this Court s powers to grant  In any event  in light of the issues discussed above  I see no basis for dealing with Mr Piotto s notice of motion further referred toLim v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Lim v Secretary  Department of Education  Employment and Workplace Relations  No     FCA   at     Bennett J observed that there is no requirement for the employees of Employment Service Providers to identify the basis of their delegated power before signing a Newstart Activity Agreement with a job seeker  Justice Bennett considered the crucial issue to be whether a valid delegation had been made  At   Bennett J found that the respondent in Lim had proven that In contrast to the circumstances described in Lim   the respondent did not produce evidence before the Tribunal to show that MatchWorks provided services to the respondent pursuant to an arrangement described in cl   of the delegation  or that the relevant employees of MatchWorks were employed to perform functions and provide services pursuant to that arrangement  In particular  no document was before the Tribunal to show that MatchWorks was an Employment Service Provider within the meaning of cl  b  of the delegation  The mere assertion in submissions that such was the case is not tantamount to evidence before the Tribunal  Accordingly  I am not satisfied that there was any material on which the Tribunal could conclude that a valid delegation from the respondent to MatchWorks was in place at the time of the Participation Failure  The application must be remitted to the Tribunal  Although it is not strictly necessary to do so the Court will deal now with the other issues raised in argument  No negotiation of the Newstart Activity Agreement Mr Piotto also alleges that the Tribunal erred in not finding that there was no negotiation of the Newstart Activity Agreement for the purposes of s   of the Act referred toDespot v Department of Family and Community Services   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn any event  as French J observed in Despot v Department of Family and Community Services   FCA   at   in relation to the alleged denial of a right to negotiate a Newstart Activity Agreement   This is not a ground which raises any question of law upon which a review of the AAT decision could be based   The second ground of Mr Piotto s application fails  The respondent s ability to require Mr Piotto to sign a Newstart Activity AgreementdistinguishedRe Hewitson and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services     ALD  Mr Piotto also contends that the Tribunal erred in finding that the respondent was able to require him to sign the Newstart Activity Agreement  To support this proposition  Mr Piotto relies on Re Hewitson and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services     ALD    Hewitson is a decision of the Tribunal and is not binding on this Court  The Tribunal  in Hewitson   found that the relevant question under s  b ii  of the Act  as it then was  was whether the Newstart recipient has  agree d  to terms of the agreement proposed by the Secretary   The section of the Act in place at the time of Hewitson dealt with a failure to negotiate an agreement and delaying unreasonably entering into an agreement  The Tribunal found that as Mr Hewitson had evinced an intention to be bound by the terms of the agreement  his signature was not required  At the time of Mr Piotto s Participation Failure  s  b ii  of the Act considered by the Tribunal in Hewitson was no longer in force  Rather the Act at the time of the Participation Failure  provided that a Newstart allowance recipient commits a participation failure if the person  fails to comply with a requirement to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement  see s  d  of the Act  Its language differs markedly from that employed in the previous s    Indeed  a Newstart Activity Agreement must be a written agreement between the Newstart recipient and the respondent  see s   of the Act  It follows from this requirement that there must be some written indication of Mr Piotto s consent to its terms  There is no material to suggest that Mr Piotto complied with the requirement in s  d  of the Act to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement  The third ground of Mr Piotto s application fails  The Newstart Activity Agreement was  inherently faulty Mr Piotto also alleges that the Newstart Activity Agreement offered by MatchWorks was unreasonable and  inherently faulty  as it did not comply with s   of the Act  In doing so  Mr Piotto points to what he says is the intention of MatchWorks to unilaterally change the terms of the Newstart Activity Agreement  the requirement to complete ten job searches each fortnight and the requirement that Mr Piotto perform  work for the dole
