P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlI must take into account  follow and apply the relevant and binding reasoning and ratio of the Full Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    I consider that I should apply the following principles and propositions contained in the reasoning of the Full Court whether they be the ratio  or one of the rationes  of the decision or persuasive and considered obiter dicta   a  In determining a claim for protection of documents from disclosure and inspection on the ground of public interest immunity a Court must undertake a balancing exercise and determine whether the public interest in protecting from disclosure the identity of an informer outweighs the public interest that in a civil proceeding a party should not be denied access to relevant evidence       b  The partial or limited disclosure of the identity of an informer is not conclusive in determining whether the identity of the informer should be protected from being disclosed in documents sought to be the subject of inspection on the ground of public interest immunity  Immunity from further disclosure is not necessarily lost where there has been a partial limited disclosure of the identity of an informer     c  The transcripts of the examination of the informer or informers would  both directly and circumstantially  identify the informer or the informers       d  The appropriate test to apply in determining whether inspection of the relevant documents and transcripts might disclose the identity of an informer or informers is to ask whether there is in the documents any material by which  a shrewd idea  might be conveyed as to the identity of the informer or informers  noting that documents taken together may convey information which each  by itself  could not convey  Further  the benefit of the doubt should be in favour of non disclosure  The observations I made in pars     in my reasons for judgment published on   July   apply in relation to ASIC s claim for public interest immunity in respect of the documents produced by KPMG  I have considered the submissions made by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents and audio tapes and the redaction or masking proposed by ASIC in relation to a number of those documents  I have reached the conclusion that the redaction and masking undertaken by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents goes beyond the redaction and masking which is necessary in order to ensure that the documents do not have a tendency to disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC  I set out in Confidential Appendix A to these reasons my conclusion whether ASIC s claims for public interest immunity in respect of the documents should be upheld or rejected and my conclusion as to the redaction and masking of the documents which I consider should be undertaken  This Appendix will only be made available to ASIC s legal advisors and the deponents of its affidavits for the purpose of determining the form of any public non confidential order which I should make
