Westbourne Galleries Ltd   AC   In his seminal speech in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd   AC   at  B Lord Wilberforce pointed out that a company however small and however domestic is a company and not a partnership or even a quasi partnership  He said  however  that it was through the just and equitable clause  now s  k  that obligations  common to partnership relations  may come in  He continued by pointing out that the just and equitable ground is available if the member can point to and prove some special underlying obligation of his fellow member or members in good faith  or confidence  that so long as the business continues he shall be entitled to management participation  an obligation so basic that  if broken  the conclusion must be that the association must be dissolved   Ebrahimi   AC at  E    Lord Wilberforce said that the principles on which the member may do this had been worked out by the Courts in partnership situations  Earlier in his speech  he pointed out that the just and equitable ground enables the Court to subject the exercise of legal rights to equitable considerations  He said that these considerations were of a personal character between one individual and another which may make it unjust or inequitable  to insist on legal rights or to exercise them in a particular way  Lord Wilberforce said that it would be impossible and wholly undesirable to define the circumstances in which those considerations may arise and pointed to the fact that merely because a company was a small one or a private company was not enough to bring those into play   If the association were purely a commercial one in which it could safely be said that the basis of the association was adequately and exhaustively laid down in the company s constitution  equitable considerations need have no part   Ebrahimi   AC at   C E   But  his Lordship pointed out that    Ebrahimi   AC at   E H     The superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more  which typically may include one  or probably more  of the following elements   i  an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship  involving mutual confidence   this element will often be found where a pre existing partnership has been converted into a limited company   ii  an agreement  or understanding  that all  or some  for there may be  sleeping  members  of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business   iii  restriction upon the transfer of the members  interest in the company   so that if confidence is lost  or one member is removed from management  he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere    It is these  and analogous  factors which may bring into play the just and equitable clause  and they do so directly  through the force of the words themselves  appliedFexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd     ACSR   However  it is necessary to consider whether some other remedy might be available of a less drastic kind under s    see s    In Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd     ACSR   at       per Spigelman CJ        per Priestley JA and     per Fitzgerald JA  the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that the existence of irreconcilable differences among persons involved in what is  in effect  a partnership  conducted through a company  applies both to applications for winding up on the just and equitable ground and also to oppression suits  Spigelman CJ pointed out   Fexuto   ACSR at       if the court decided the person excluded was the one responsible for the breakdown in the relationship  he or she would not be entitled to claim to have suffered oppression under s    That is not this case  Mr Bax s conduct was understandable and reactive to Mr Gulson s  If fault is to be attributed in the breakdown of the relationship  it is to Mr Gulson for the way he behaved in the Heathrow Hotel and afterwards  That conduct was destructive of and confirmatory of the destruction of the previous relationship of mutual trust and confidence  Mr Cordato later came to participate in association with Mr Gulson in that destructiveness   As Priestley JA said in Fexuto   ACSR at     putting in quasi partnership terms what happened from   May   the majority shareholder and director changed the previous management regime against the opposition of the minority director and shareholder  He held that this entitled the minority to a remedy and that in ordinary partnership situations the remedy was dissolution of the partnership  Priestley JA pointed out that the remedy available under the analogue of ss   and   was broader than simply a winding up  He had found that oppression in that case had occurred by a change in the previous way in which the business had been conducted  where all the partners or directors jointly engaged in direct management of the company   Fexuto   ACSR at       Even if oppression of  or unfair prejudice or unfair discrimination against Food Improvers  either as a member of BGR or the partnership or as the provider of Mr Bax s services under the consultancy agreement  were not established solely by what occurred on the evening of   May   Mr Gulson s later determination to use his voting power to exclude  first  Mr Bax as a director of BGR and  secondly  Food Improvers from the benefits of both his directorship and the consultancy agreement on the knowingly false basis upon which it was asserted that Mr Gobert s contact should be terminated or its termination affirmed  was oppressive of  unfairly prejudicial and unfairly discriminatory against Mr Bax and Food Improvers  When Mr Cordato sided with Mr Gulson and they both voted in favour of the resolutions on   July   the oppression of Food Improvers was manifest   Mr Bax was excluded from any management role in BGR  Mr Gulson commenced to pay Triad an increased consultancy fee  He and Mr Cordato initially consulted with Mr Bax about the sale of Main Camp plantation  but later negotiated the sale without Mr Bax s involvement and refused to inform him of the details of its terms apart from the price consideredIn re A Company   UKHL         WLR   In In re A Company   UKHL         WLR   at  D  B Lord Hoffmann discussed the interplay of the just and equitable concept in the analogue of s  k  and  unfair  in the analogue of s  e   He pointed out that although fairness was a notion that could be applied to all kinds of activities  its content would depend upon the context in which it was being used   In re A Company     WLR at  F   Of course  there will be decisions in any association  such as a partnership or company  which one or more members find to be prejudicial or discriminatory against them  But the emphasis in establishing a ground for an order under s  e  is that the conduct be unfairly prejudicial or discriminatory or be oppressive   Wayde v New South Wales Rugby League Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason ACJ  Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ   Thus  the bona fide and proper exercise of a power under a company s constitution for the purpose for which it was conferred is unlikely to be found to establish unfair prejudice or unfair discrimination against a member under s  e    Wayde   CLR at   consideredKallinicos v Hunt   NSWSC         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Moreover  Mr Cordato acted in these proceedings as solicitor for all the defendants in circumstances where no reasonable solicitor in his position could possibly have acted  He was precluded by the application of r   of the Solicitors Rules from acting  certainly by no later than   May   but probably considerably earlier  But in any event  Mr Cordato s financial interest in the success of the defendants  case meant that he was unable to act with the independence which a solicitor on the record must have as part of the relationship between an officer of the court and the court in the presentation and conduct of litigation  Kallinicos v Hunt   NSWSC         NSWLR   at                 per Brereton J  As Brereton J said  a solicitor should not act where a fair minded and reasonable observer would think that his or her independence and objectivity as a solicitor would be compromised  The scrutiny which the solicitor s conduct would attract in litigation  his or her knowledge of the instructions in relation to the subject matter in which he or she might be a material witness are relevant factors in this regard    Kallinicos   NSWLR at      Mr Cordato was a material witness on important conversations  he charged BGR for the personal costs for which Triad and Cordato Partners Services were liable and he continued to act oblivious of the motion to enjoin him from doing so  He prepared Mr Gulson s affidavits including those parts dealing with disputed conversations  such as with Mr Lombardo  to which both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson were party  That conduct put him in an impossible position  However much  by his own lights  he may have tried to put Mr Gulson s account objectively and uninfluenced by Mr Cordato s own recollection he could not do so in the way a person who was independent could have  And  of course  Mr Cordato s account is likely  even if only subconsciously  to have been influenced by what he had learned in taking Mr Gulson s affidavits   The distribution in February   did not recognise the need to make any payment to Mr Bax and Food Improvers for the work that he had been done during the periods in which consultancy fees had been refunded and later when they were either left unpaid or paid at a reduced rate  This was unfair prejudice to Food Improvers  Mr Cordato s legal firm was permitted by Mr Gulson to bill and be paid in January   for all its unbilled work in progress throughout BGR s existence  Yet  Mr Cordato was not even working in the business of BGR to generate the asset that was ultimately realised on the sale of the Main Camp plantation business   The affairs of BGR have been taken over by Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson and run in a way which favours their companies  interests and disadvantages Mr Bax s  Mr Cordato made no attempt to dissect from the fees he rendered to BGR those which were referable wholly to his own personal and his company s interests  Nor did he attempt to do so in respect of the personal interests of Mr Gulson and Triad  Instead  both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson  deliberately  decided to use BGR s money to pay for the whole of the defence costs  I do not believe their evidence to the effect that the expenditure for the personal purposes of Mr Cordato or Cordato Partners Services was unintended  Mr Cordato kept no records to enable separate fees to be rendered because he did not need to do so  He considered he was entitled to use BGR s money to defend his own personal and his company s interests including his reputation  so far as it was attacked in the case  Mr Gulson had no reason to disapprove of Mr Cordato s fees being paid by BGR because Triad s fees were too  Likewise  Mr Gulson saw his interests as being those of BGR  which is why he caused the fees that Kemp Strang had rendered to Triad to be paid by BGR  Mr Cordato s lack of independence was one contributing factor which permitted that to occur   After the hearing had concluded both sides and Mr Cordato made written submissions on the question of Mr Cordato s continuing to act  The plaintiffs apparently had insisted that counsel who appeared at the trial for the defendants be not permitted to make those submissions  Senior counsel was retained to make submissions on behalf of Mr Cordato and his firm  Senior counsel submitted that the attempt to remove Mr Cordato as solicitor for the defendants was made too late  was without substance and was inconsistent with the position taken by Haywards in their letter of   May   that Mr Cordato s continuing to act was further evidence of oppression  Senior counsel pointed to Brereton J s statement in Kallinicos   NSWLR at     that the jurisdiction is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution   The fact that the plaintiffs only then insisted on someone other than those who had appeared hitherto in making these submissions  although the basis of such insistence is not clear to me  demonstrated a belated realisation on the plaintiffs  part of the inappropriateness of their motion  It was directed to restraining Cordato Partners  as opposed to restraining the defendants  Cordato Partners was not a party to the proceedings or to the motion  That firm had not been served formally and it was not separately represented at the hearing or on any other occasion save for the submissions made by senior counsel  Mr Cordato gave evidence as a witness  and as the controlling mind of Cordato Partners Services  the third defendant  but not as a party to the proceedings personally  nor did he appear for Cordato Partners  Had the motion sought to restrain the relevant defendants from engaging Cordato Partners  it may have been possible to hear and determine it  although  as a person affected by the order  Cordato Partners should have been joined and they could have applied to be joined   I am not satisfied that the proceedings have been conducted appropriately as a vehicle for determining in the inherent jurisdiction of the court the disqualification of Cordato Partners from acting  I have expressed views about the inappropriateness of Mr Cordato s conduct  but having regard to the way in which the matter developed and the very late realisation by both sides as to the need for independent representation of Cordato Partners  I do not think it appropriate at this stage to make any orders against the firm or its principal Mr Cordato  For the reasons I have given it is inappropriate for Mr Cordato and his firm to continue to act for the defendants  That being so  I do not think it necessary for me to do anything further citedRe DG Brims   Sons Pty Ltd     ACSR   In Re DG Brims   Sons Pty Limited     ACSR   at     Byrne J in the Supreme Court of Queensland said the use of company funds in defending the proceedings on behalf of the majority shareholders was unfair and infringed the basal principle that the powers and the funds of a company may be used only for the purposes of the company  He said that where the essential dispute was between the shareholders  company funds should not have been used to defend the majority  Here  the essential dispute was between the shareholders and the funds of BGR should not have been employed to pay for a defence of the majority   For all these reasons  I am of opinion that the conduct of BGR s affairs is contrary to the interests of its members as a whole and is oppressive to  unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against Food Improvers   The plaintiffs filed a motion on   March   which sought  among other things  an order restraining Cordato Partners from acting for any of BGR and its subsidiaries  It was not sought to restrain Cordato Partners from acting on behalf of Triad or Cordato Partners Services  The hearing of that motion was concurrent with the trial  Cordato Partners is not a party to the proceedings  and was not made a party to the motion  No relief is sought in the third further amended application or the further amended statement of claim against Cordato Partners citedScottish Meyer Cooperative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer   AC   Conduct which is burdensome  harsh and

Tahansan Sdn Bhd     WLR   at  H  A the Privy Council held that where a person has been led to believe  even in the absence of any express assurance  that he or she would participate in the management of a company  he or she would in any event be entitled to a seat on the board so long as he or she continued to hold his shares  Their Lordships said that although no specific undertakings may have been given  an obligation could be implied or inferred from the conduct of the parties to allow the person to participate in the management and to be a director     unless by withdrawal of his support
