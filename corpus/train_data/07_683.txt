SZGWG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toApplicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  By letter dated   April   the Tribunal invited the appellant to a hearing  He did not attend  The Tribunal was advised by the Department that the Department had lost its file and  on   May   it wrote to the appellant inviting him to provide a copy of his application for a protection visa and any documents or information in support of his application  He did not respond to the letter  It is hard to see what more the Tribunal could have done to afford the appellant an opportunity to present his case  The Magistrate found that  in essence  the appellant s claims in his statement  which was not before the Tribunal  were fairly reproduced in the record of decision  which was before the Tribunal   This is not a case like that which was before the High Court in Applicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR     Applicant NAFF    This is not a case in which the Tribunal s letter dated   May   indicated that the Tribunal member considered that the review was not complete until certain steps were carried out and those steps were not carried out  see Applicant NAFF at      The Tribunal s letter dated   May   did not refer to a further invitation to attend a hearing  but simply invited the appellant to provide documents or information  The appellant chose not to do that   I raised with the parties one further matter  I raised with the parties whether  in the circumstances  the Tribunal was entitled to proceed to make a decision on the review without  after   May   extending another invitation to the appellant to attend a hearing  The Tribunal said     The applicant did not appear before the Tribunal on the day and at the time and place at which he was scheduled to appear and did not respond to any correspondence correctly addressed to him  In these circumstances  and pursuant to s  A of the Act   the Tribunal has decided to make its decision on the review without taking any further action to enable the applicant to appear before it   I am satisfied that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed in the manner in which it did  Under s  A of the Act   the Tribunal could proceed to make a decision on the review  or it could take further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it  By writing the letter dated   May   the Tribunal did not take further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it but  rather  gave the appellant the opportunity to provide documents or information  The appellant did not take up that opportunity  and the power to proceed to make a decision on the review on the basis that the appellant did not appear at a proposed hearing on   May   remained available to the Tribunal  Alternatively  the letter from the Tribunal dated   May   was a request by the Tribunal for additional information under s   of the Act and  on the appellant s failure to provide it  the Tribunal was entitled to proceed in the manner in which it did  s  C and s   referred toMuin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In WAGP   the Full Court of this Court discussed the decision of the High Court in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA         ALR     Muin    It is not necessary for me to repeat the Court s analysis of that decision  At the time Muin was decided  the provisions of the Act  other than s   were in quite different terms from the provisions of the Act as they stand today  It is sufficient for me to say that a mere breach of s   of the Act by the Secretary will not vitiate the Tribunal s decision  That is not to say that a breach of the section may not in some other way result in the Tribunal committing jurisdictional error  In this case  the Tribunal gave the appellant the opportunity to remedy any deficiency  assuming for the moment that there was a deficiency  in the information before it  and it was within the appellant s power to do that  He did not take that opportunity  In any event  the important document in the Department s file which was not before the Tribunal was the appellant s statement  and the essence of the information in that statement was fairly reproduced in the record of decision which was before the Tribunal  That was the finding of the Magistrate and I see no reason to interfere with that finding  In the circumstances of this case  if there was a breach of s   of the Act   it did not lead to jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal referred toWAGP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There is no suggestion of non compliance with subsections   and   of s     so it is subsection   which must be considered  The Magistrate made no finding as to whether there had been a breach of the subsection  In Part B of the delegate s decision  the Department s file is referred to as evidence used in making the decision and I think that it is fair to assume that it would have been relevant to the review of the decision within the terms of subsection   of s    The circumstances under which the file was  lost  and then  found  appear not to have been the subject of evidence  and certainly the Magistrate did not make findings in relation to the issue  The Magistrate proceeded on the basis that even if the Secretary was in breach of s   that did not vitiate the Tribunal s decision and he referred to WAGP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at
