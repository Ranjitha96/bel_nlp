FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The Tribunal affirmed the delegate s decision by way of a decision signed on   January    On   June   the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking to review the decision of the Tribunal  SZLZM v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA     The Appellant now appeals to this Court  He appeared today unrepresented  albeit with the benefit of an interpreter  He read to the Court  via his interpreter  a detailed statement in support of his appeal  That statement fully addressed the issues sought to be canvassed  Although he maintained that a copy of the Respondent Minister s submissions had only been received by him on   August   he accepted that his statement made orally today fully set forth his case  Any further opportunity to respond would be for the purpose of reducing to writing the statement made orally  Such a further opportunity was not considered necessary  The interpreter experienced no difficulty in translating the Appellant s oral contentions   Although the present proceeding is an appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  the Grounds of Appeal as filed in this Court do not attempt to identify any error made by the learned Federal Magistrate  Those Grounds merely set forth the errors alleged to have been committed by the Tribunal followedSZIBR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  This Ground should be rejected  It was  most probably  not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and no reason has been exposed as to why it should now be entertained  In those circumstances where this Court has a discretion to permit a new ground to be raised on appeal  there should generally be an adequate explanation for not raising the ground before the Federal Magistrates Court   SZIBR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   at     and leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so   VUAX v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     consideredThang Gia Uy Vo v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Notwithstanding the deficiency in the content of the Notice of Appeal   it nevertheless remains clear that the Appellant sought to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court and not its original jurisdiction  Whatever other deficiencies there may be in his Notice of Appeal   that Notice does state  without alteration  that   the appellant appeals from the whole of the judgment of the Federal Magistrate Court given on       at Sydney    In some circumstances  it may be accepted  it is not appropriate for this Court to deal with an application before it solely upon the basis of   procedural errors committed by an unrepresented applicant   eg  Thang Gia Uy Vo v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   at       FCA       ALD   at     In the present appeal no submission was advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister that the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the failure of the Appellant to identify any error alleged to have been committed by the learned Federal Magistrate  indeed  the Minister s written submissions addressed the substance of each of the three purported Grounds of Appeal    But  even if the Grounds of Appeal be construed as an identification of the errors which were said to have been committed by the Tribunal  and an implicit contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in not concluding that there were such errors  no different conclusion    it should be noted    would have been reached and the appeal would have been dismissed followedVUAX v Minister for Immigration
