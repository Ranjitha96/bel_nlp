au au cases cth FMCA  html  An application to review that third decision of the Tribunal was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court  SZHCK v Minister for Immigration   FMCA    The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court sets forth the following three Grounds of Appeal  without alteration     The Federal Magistrates Court erred in not considering that the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  wrongly observed that the applicant would not involve in the politics in future because of his personal circumstances  the applicant said this because he wanted to avoid harm for himself and for his family and for his child  The applicant still believe that he would not be able to decide freely if he goes back to India     The Federal Magistrates Court also did not consider that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when the Tribunal found that the threat to the applicant were made for reason arising from their friendship with the applicant s father in law s associates but the Tribunal did not consider that the applicant were threatened two occasions by the associates of his father in law     The Federal Magistrates Court erred in not considering that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by observing that the applicant would not have threat given the effluxion of time but the Tribunal failed to show that the applicant will not face persecution in future if he returns to India   The Appellant husband appeared before this Court this morning unrepresented  although he did have the benefit of an interpreter  His wife did not appear   None of the Grounds of Appeal have been made out and the appeal should be dismissed with costs
