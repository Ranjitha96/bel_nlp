Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedDunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   February   I ordered that       The amended notice of appeal be struck out            The proceedings be dismissed             The appellant pay the costs of and associated with this appeal  including costs of all motions           Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA     Those orders were entered on   February   and served on Mr Dunstan under cover of a letter dated   February     On   March   Mr Dunstan filed a notice of motion seeking the following orders       The decision on   of Justice Gyles is set aside           Leave is granted for the filing of a Notice of Appeal in ACD   of      Other orders as the Courts deems fit      A further draft amended notice of appeal was provided with an affidavit affirmed on   March       That motion came on for hearing on   April last  It was submitted for all respondents  apart from the first respondent  which submitted  that the motion was incompetent as there is no power to recall the entered order  Having heard from the solicitors for the respondents  I adjourned the matter until   May   in order that the respondents could file any supplementary submissions and that Mr Dunstan could give consideration to the points that had been raised  He was to file an outline of submissions in answer  That occurred  together with the filing of yet another affidavit  Mr Dunstan seeks to raise matters in relation to discovery in preparation for the hearing at first instance  The affidavit also enlarges upon the difficulties that he has had in prison connected with the preparation of his case  a topic which was dealt with at some length in his first affidavit filed in support of this motion relatedDunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Even if there were power to set aside the orders of   February   I would not do so  The original notice of appeal was filed on   January   from a judgment delivered on   December     Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  No     FCA    The case had commenced in   concerning events occurring between   and    The hearing had taken place over six days and involved a large volume of documents  The judgment ran to some   paragraphs  Mr Dunstan had appeared for himself  Mr Dunstan was in custody at the time of the hearing and has remained in custody until the hearing of this motion  The original notice of appeal was plainly not in accordance with the Federal Court Rules and was quite inappropriate for the orderly preparation for appeal  That was pointed out to Mr Dunstan at the hearing of a motion to strike it out on   November    During the course of that hearing Mr Dunstan spelled out the difficulties that he had by reason of his being in custody as well as being a litigant in person  The respondents had filed an application for security of costs  It was pointed out that there could be no progress in relation to the appeal or in relation to the question of security for costs until a proper notice of appeal was filed  It was also pointed out that individuals were named as respondents and suffered from the delay  The matter was then approaching an anniversary of the date of judgment  The notice of appeal was struck out and the appellant was granted leave to file an amended notice of appeal on or before   February    By   February   an amended notice of appeal had been filed but still was nowhere near being in proper form  That led to the orders in question   The bases put for reopening fall into three categories  The first is that Mr Dunstan wishes to pursue an application for a retrial based upon fresh evidence as to documents which were not properly disclosed to him on discovery or otherwise in the course of the case  This is based upon what are effectively no more than assertions by Mr Dunstan  supported by a process of reasoning which is not self explanatory  The support for such an application falls very far short of that which would be required to persuade a court to permit such an issue to be raised at this stage of a case on appeal  To the extent that the issues can be grappled with  counsel for the respondents has pointed to gaps in relation to each of the conclusions sought to be drawn by Mr Dunstan  In any event  there is no proper explanation for delay   The second is to flesh out to a greater extent than hitherto some of the practical difficulties that Mr Dunstan has suffered in preparing matters in custody  However  the general nature of the problems he would suffer has been obvious at all times distinguishedAustralian Fisheries Management Authority v PW Adams Pty Ltd  No       FCR   In Australian Fisheries Management Authority v PW Adams
