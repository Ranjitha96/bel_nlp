federal ct  html   Various affidavits including an affidavit by Lucinda Hughes Turnbull  a director of WCG  to the effect that she is willing to act as chairperson at the proposed Scheme meeting  and an affidavit of Sean Martin Howard to the effect that he is willing to act as alternate chairperson  Ms Turnbull and Mr Howard disclose the holdings of shares in WCG by companies associated with themselves respectively          Senior counsel for WCG has properly drawn my attention to two matters  which may be described as the  performance risk issue  and the  no encumbrances  clause    The performance risk issue       The  performance risk issue  refers to the risk that MLB will not perform its obligations under the Scheme  by providing the promised consideration after the Scheme Shares have vested in it  Gyles J has referred to this issue in several cases  including Re Kaz Group Ltd   FCA     in which his Honour observed that it was  not entirely adequate  that scheme shares vest in the transferee corporation  leaving the former members with only the transferee corporation s covenant to pay      The issue was again referred to by his Honour in Re Tempo Services Ltd     ACSR     Tempo   another cash acquisition scheme by share transfer  His Honour said  at    The one matter to which I have drawn to attention of counsel is that  as a matter of principle  my view is that the security holders whose securities are divested by virtue of a scheme such as this should not have to bear any credit risk occasioned by the mechanism chosen so far as payment is concerned      In Tempo   the point was met by a provision for payment of the consideration into a Quistclose trust  cf Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd   UKHL       AC         His Honour most recently considered the issue in SFE Corporation Limited   FCA     SFE   at    Indeed  counsel has provided me with a copy of the scheme in SFE   which was  like the present Scheme  an acquisition for cash and shares  More accurately  it provided for an election between a Share Alternative and a Cash and Share Alternative     In the present case  cl    a  of the Scheme provides that after the Court s approving order is made but before the  Implementation Date   which is eight business days thereafter  MLB must deposit the aggregate amount of cash consideration payable to all Scheme Shareholders  in cleared funds in the trust account operated by WCG  to be held on trust for the Scheme Shareholders   except that any interest on the amount deposited shall be to MLB s account   my emphasis   Clause     of the Scheme provides that MLB s obligation to issue shares to the Scheme Shareholders is to be performed by its entering their names in the Share Register on the Implementation Date  and within five business days thereafter  dispatching to them an  uncertificated holding statement  relating to the number of MLB Shares issued to the addressee   This provision is generally similar to that found in cl     of the scheme that was approved in SFE    Senior counsel for WCG  who is very experienced in this area  states that some schemes he has encountered have contained this provision and some have not  Senior counsel has referred to four cases in the last   months in which a provision similar to cl    b  has appeared  He has also remarked that in recent times  two Judges  Gyles J in this Court and Barrett J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales  have expressed a preference for such a provision not to appear in a scheme  Senior counsel has submitted as follows           Possible bases for the Gyles J Barrett J  approach  would seem to be             a  Requiring omission of the clause as a matter of exercise of the discretion to convene the scheme meeting under s   or approve the scheme under s  b      b  The clause is outside the s   power which can only bind shareholders and the company     c  If the clause is within the s   power then it purports to affect third party rights  in particular those with a security interest  and such persons are neither party to the application nor have they been notified                   On the issue of discretion  there are examples of inclusion of the clause                 On the issue of whether it is within the s   power  WebCentral submits that it is within the s   power to cause a person to become the registered holder of shares  This proposition is best adumbrated in the recent Navigator decision in the Privy Council   a reference to Cambridge Gas Transport Corporation v The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors  of Navigator Holdings PLC and others    Privy Council Appeal No   of   delivered   May   in particular in paragraph    That paragraph succinctly summarises the broad nature of the scheme of arrangement power including that a scheme  may   provide that someone else is to be registered as holder of the shares  which is not a novel proposition                 On the issue of affecting third party rights  the Corporations Act provides for more than one method of compulsory acquisition of shares  which provides for the passing of title to the acquirer  Examples include s  A   s  A and in a slightly different context a reduction of capital under s  C  The concept does not embrace those with security interests having the capacity to prevent the acquisition process because of their security interest  The security interest in the scheme consideration presumably remains unaffected by a clause such a  s  cl    b   The approach of the Court should be that persons lending against shares bear the risk of compulsory acquisition using any one of the means in the Corporations Act   and therefore the Court need have no special concern for them as part of the scheme process                 For these reasons  WebCentral submits that cl    b  is proper and should remain in the scheme   There was discussion of cl    b  on the hearing  including reference to s  E  of the Act which relates to notice of trusts on which shares are held  Reference may also be made to cll     and     of WCG s constitution  Clause     provides   Except as permitted or required by the Corporations Law  the Company shall not recognise a person as holding a Share or Share Option upon any trust   Clause     provides that WCG is  not bound by or compelled in any way to recognise any equitable  contingent  future or partial right or interest in any Share or Share Option  whether or not it has notice of the interest or right concerned  unless otherwise provided by  the  Constitution or by law  except an absolute right of ownership in the registered holder of the Share or Share Option   These various provisions relate to the position of WCG  not MLB   Senior counsel has undertaken to provide a further submission on the  no encumbrances  issue  As presently advised  I think it appropriate to follow a course that he suggested  namely  to allow cl    b  to remain in the Scheme for consideration at the meeting of members  while noting that further reflection may lead to my granting approval to the Scheme subject to deletion of the provision  Subsection   permits the Court to grant its approval subject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks just citedRe Tempo Services Ltd     ACSR    Various affidavits including an affidavit by Lucinda Hughes Turnbull
