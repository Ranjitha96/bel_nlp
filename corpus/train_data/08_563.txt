Ex parte McGrath  in the matter of Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited  in Liq    FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAdultshop com Ltd v Members of the Classification Review Board  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Adultshop com Ltd v Members of the Classification Review Board  No       FCA   at         I referred briefly to the principles which apply in the exercise of the Court s discretion to make an order under s    I observed at   of my reasons in that case that the Court will respect legitimate claims for confidentiality which should not be unduly discounted in the weighing process when balancing the claim for confidentiality against the countervailing public interest in open justice   In the present case it is sufficient to say that an order under s   is warranted for the time being because of the conditions subsequent referred to in the Deed of Settlement  As I have said previously  I do not think it is necessary for me to refer to them in my reasons for judgment  but I have considered them carefully and I do think that the weighing process in the present case points in favour of upholding the claim for confidentiality  The Deed of Settlement itself contains a confidentiality clause in cl     In summary  I think it is sufficient to say that disclosure of the pertinent provisions of Mr McGrath s affidavit which exposed his reasoning process would seriously prejudice the liquidators in the event that Mr Selim and the Commonwealth have access to the views which Mr McGrath has expressed in his affidavit   For these reasons  I propose to make the direction set out in   of the draft order handed to me this morning by Senior Counsel for the liquidators  I also propose to make orders in terms of     and    Order   reserves liberty to apply  It may be appropriate in due course for the orders under s   to be reviewed in light of subsequent developments in the litigation   I have given this judgment in closed court pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act   However  having now heard from Mr Nixon who has fairly conceded that the order under s   need not be continued  I will dissolve that order and direct that my reasons for judgment may be published   I will leave in force the order under s   insofar as it applies to the transcript of the application that was made before me this morning   I certify that the preceding sixty   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson    Associate Dated

the Court might exercise if Pan were being wound up by the Court is the power to apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding up  This Court has previously heard and granted similar applications under both ss   and    A useful example of this is the decision of Lee J in Bank of Melbourne Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd  in liq      ACSR    See also the decision of Hansen J in UTSA Pty Ltd  in liq  v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd     ACSR     affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal in     ACSR    per Hayne JA  Brooking and Phillips JJA concurring    A number of decisions have confirmed that the power under s  c  includes the power to cause the company to assign a cause of action to a third party  The leading authorities were referred to by Lee J in Bank of Melbourne at     His Honour observed at   that the power of sale under s  c  is similar to that conferred on a trustee in bankruptcy by ss  a  and  a  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  to dispose of the property of a bankrupt  His Honour observed that it entitles the liquidator to sell a bare right of action to a stranger  whether for a cash payment or on terms that the stranger will pay to the company part of the proceeds of the litigation provided only that the right of action is property  His Honour also observed at   that s   of the Corporations Law  which was then in force  defined  property  to include a chose in action   Unlike the Bankruptcy Act   the Corporations Law did not vest the property of the company in liquidation in the liquidator unless an order to this effect was made by the Court  However  as Lee J pointed out  the lack of such an order will not limit the liquidator s power to assign a company s right of action provided that in such a case the company remains the assignor for the purposes of the transaction   In the present case the agreement in cl     of the Deed is that the liquidators will cause Pan to assign the causes of action against the Commonwealth  The assignment is an absolute one   It seems to me to follow from what was said by Lee J and from the various authorities to which his Honour referred that in the present case the proposed assignment of the causes of action is within the power of the liquidator  See also the comparatively recent decision of the High Court in Campbells Cash   Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     The second question is whether the liquidators are justified in entering into the assignment  Lee J pointed out in Bank of Melbourne that in determining whether a liquidator should be directed to make an assignment  a Court should consider whether the assignment would lead to vexatious or improper litigation  His Honour observed that there is no obligation on either the Court or the liquidator to conduct an investigation of the likelihood of success of the proceeding and that it will be quite impractical to do so in an application of this nature   I should mention that the application before me has been made ex parte   In Bank of Melbourne   Lee J observed at   to   that this is an appropriate course  His Honour referred to a number of leading authorities including decisions of McClelland CJ in Re BPTC Limited     ACLC   at   and Re G B Nathan v Co Pty Ltd     NSWLR   referred toCampbells Cash   Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii

appliedCiticorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy     ALR   In Citicorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy     ALR   a Full Court dealt with a similar question arising under the Bankruptcy Act   The Court observed at   upon the basis of English and Australian authorities  that it is only in a clear case that the Court should come to the view that the proposed assignment is frivolous or vexatious or that the Court should not allow the assignment to occur   Their Honours pointed to the observations of Lord Hoffman in the English decision in Stein v Blake     AC   at    The relevant passage was set out by the Full Court in Citicorp at    It is unnecessary to repeat what Lord Hoffman said in that passage   The observations of the Full Court in Citicorp at   are also pertinent  Their Honours observed that there will be few cases where some decisive point exists on which the trustee or the Court can be satisfied that the claim which is proposed to be assigned has no reasonable prospects of success   In the present case it is relevant to note  as I have already  that the cross claims brought by Mr Selim against the Commonwealth and the TGA offices were the subject of a strikeout application but that the Commonwealth ultimately determined not to pursue that application after amendments were made to the pleadings   In those circumstances  it seems to me to be the position that it is not clear and obvious that any proceeding in respect of the cause of action against the Commonwealth would have no reasonable prospects of success  Accordingly  there is no basis for me to conclude that the assignment of the causes of action to Mr Selim would result in vexatious or improper litigation  so the assignment cannot be said to be an inappropriate exercise of the liquidator s powers   There are a number of other reasons why it seems to me that the liquidators are justified in assigning the causes of action to Mr Selim  It is not necessary to state them in any detail  I have referred to some of them above but in summary there are three principal reasons   First  the proceedings would be lengthy and expensive and if they proceed to a final hearing there is always the risk of the insolvent estate of Pan being exposed to a substantial costs order in the event that the claims against Mr Selim fail referred toDean Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd     ACSR   The Court s power to give directions pursuant to s   is subject to the provisions of s    The Court must be satisfied that the determination of the question or the

decision of Young J in Dean Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd     ACSR    Mansfield J quoted a passage from the judgment of Young J in which his Honour observed that the meaning of the words  just and beneficial  are that the Court has a discretion as to whether making any order under the section will be of advantage to the liquidation referred toUTSA Pty Ltd  in liq  v Ultra Tune

about s   and the requirement that the exercise of the power be just and beneficial  The reasons  which I have referred to above  point in favour of that condition being satisfied appliedRe Addstone Pty Limited  in liq      FCR   Second  the liquidators also sought an order under s   of the Federal Court Act that access to the affidavit of Mr McGrath and to the exhibit to the affidavit be restricted to the Court and the liquidators  That course is consistent with the course adopted by Mansfield J in Re Addstone Pty Limited  in liq      FCR   at    The position in Re Addstone was slightly different from that which occurs in the present case  However  there are a number of aspects of the Deed of Settlement which seem to me to point in favour of the confidentiality orders at
