impugned act  see Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc v South Australia and Another  No       SASR   at   where Doyle CJ  with whom Bollen J agreed  said     The inquiry is into whether the racial

explained the operation of s   as pertaining to the situation where a person who is in a position to prevent allegedly unlawful conduct fails to do so  His Honour said     Section   provides a means of bringing about lawful conduct by rendering liable a person who could prevent unlawful conduct from occurring or continuing or who assists  directly or indirectly  in its performance  A person can prevent unlawful conduct by not creating a situation where it will or may take place or altering a situation so it will not continue   Since the President could not have been in a position to prevent any alleged unlawful conduct from occurring  it is apparent that s   can have no application in relation to him in resect of his decision to terminate the complaints of Ms Obieta for the reason that they were lacking in substance  Further  the President is not a party to the present proceedings and was not named as a respondent to Ms Obieta s complaint terminated on   March    As such a claim made by Ms Obieta against the President cannot be maintained in these proceedings   For the above reasons the Court will order that the proceedings be dismissed and that Ms Obieta pay the costs of the

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  An infringement of an Article in an International Convention referred to in Schedules to the RDA  SDA and HREOC Act does not give rise to a breach of the Act  see Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh   HCA         CLR    Accordingly the Court will not refer to the Articles of the International Conventions which were allegedly breached since no enforceable rights are created by them  Similarly  no cause of action arises in respect of alleged breaches of sections which are purely definitional or explanatory relied upon by Ms Obieta  Accordingly the Court will not refer to such sections   Ms Obieta claims that Ms Aylett and Ms Toohey rejected her complaint against Ms Fogarty without reviewing and assessing her submission dated   September    As such Ms Obieta claims that Ms Aylett and Ms Toohey denied her  natural justice  in handling her complaint  violated her human right to be heard on an equal footing with other parties or Australian respondents  and that she was treated unfairly  She alleges a breach of s   and s   of the RDA   Ms Obieta submits that the letter of the Commission to her dated   January   which addresses her concerns relating to Ms Fogarty  refers to the original complaint relating to Ms Fogarty and submission of   July   but does not refer to her letter of   September    She submits this further demonstrates that the Commission failed to take into account such letter citedSCAS v Minister for Immigration ad Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Full Court observed in SCAS v Minister for Immigration ad Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at        Bad faith in this context implies a lack of an honest or genuine attempt to undertake the task and involves a personal attack on the honesty of the decision maker    No evidence has been provided in support of Ms Obieta s allegation of bad faith and the Court is not satisfied that the President handled Ms Obieta s complaint other than in a genuine and appropriate manner  Additionally  no complaint has been accepted by the Commission concerning the President s conduct   It follows that this Court has no jurisdiction under Part IIB of the HREOC Act and accordingly the Court upholds the submission that the complaint of race discrimination cannot be substantiated and must be dismissed   Ms Obieta claims that the exercise of the President s powers under s  PH of the HREOC Act included victimisation within the meaning of s   of the SDA  and conduct that   causes  instructs  induces  aids or permits  the respondents in the TAFE proceedings to discriminate against Ms Obieta on the ground of sex within the meaning of s   of the SDA citedSpalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Commission refers to the decision of Kenny J in Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA   at   which recently considered the general principles for determining whether an action may be done other than in good faith  Kenny J emphasised that an allegation of bad faith is a   serious allegation involving the imputation of moral turpitude    At   Her Honour said        The focus of an inquiry concerning an allegation of bad faith is the state of mind of the decision maker  The Court is not simply evaluating the wisdom of an impugned decision     mere error or irrationality does not of itself demonstrate lack of good faith    b ad faith is not to be found simply because of poor decision making  SBBS at       Rather the circumstances must show dishonesty  or capriciousness  on the part of the decision maker    Something is done in  good faith  when done honestly  Something is done in  bad faith  when done dishonestly   The Commission submits that Ms Obieta s application to the Court under s  PO of the HREOC Act constitutes  an action or proceeding  that all of the alleged acts were done in the performance of functions conferred on the Commission by the HREOC Act in relation to accepting  investigating and terminating complaints  that Ms Obieta seeks damages with respect to the alleged acts of discrimination  that there is no evidence to show that the actions of the Commission  the President or the officers were anything other than honest  and that Ms Obieta has adduced no evidence to demonstrate bad faith on the part of an employee of the Commission or the President   In cross examination Ms Obieta said that she relied on the terms of the letter dated   March   from the President of the Commission advising her that the complaints had been terminated  as evidence of bad faith referred toVictoria v Macedonian Teachers  Association of Victoria
