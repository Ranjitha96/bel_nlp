MZXKQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedJess v Scott     FCR   An application for an extension of time was filed on   May    Pursuant to O   r   the time limit may be extended for  special reasons   In Jess v Scott     FCR   a Full Court of this Court said at         the expression  special reasons  is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty one days  But it may be so distinguished  not necessarily will  for the rule gives a discretion  wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case  Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary  We do not think the use of the expression  for special reasons  implies something narrower than this   The first applicant has sought to explain the minor delay in filing the notice of appeal  If this were all  I should be disposed to grant the extension that he seeks  Indeed  the first respondent does not object to the extension of the time for filing a notice of appeal  This is not  however  all  This is a case where the prospects of success on the appeal are insufficient to warrant the grant of an extension of time   The applicants  purported notice of appeal filed on   April   records the following grounds       His Honour erred in finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal considered whether the applicant was at risk of persecution because of his political associations         His Honour erred in finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal s decision was not affected by jurisdictional error         Further grounds and particulars to be provided upon provision of legal advice which is pending    As will be seen  the notice was vague and did not specify any grounds with particularity   In written submissions filed on   July   counsel for the applicants sought to make good this defect by raising the following grounds of appeal       The Tribunal erred in failing to take into account relevant considerations     The Tribunal breached s  A of the Act     The Tribunal breached common law natural justice obligations  and     The Tribunal failed to consider one of the integers of the applicants  case   In the following consideration  I address each of these matters and others mentioned at the hearing referred toCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I have also found it unnecessary to consider an affidavit sworn by Pamela Anne Summers on   July    The first respondent faced difficulties in seeking to rely on it  The affidavit was not in evidence in the Federal Magistrates Court  although  according to the first respondent  this point was not taken below  I doubt that the first respondent s reliance on s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  was sustainable  I doubt that Ms Summers  familiarity with the practice and procedures of the Tribunal would constitute  specialised knowledge  upon which the opinion she gives can be said to be wholly or substantially based for the purposes of this provision  compare Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd   FCA   at       per Black CJ  Emmett and Middleton JJ  The affidavit was not formally filed until the hearing  although  according to the first respondent  this was the result of the applicants  tardiness in filing their submissions  Ultimately  the first respondent did not press the tender of the affidavit  although counsel outlined a case for its admissibility  in the terms indicated referred toNAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  At bottom  the gravamen of the applicants  complaint at the hearing was that the country information before the Tribunal should have led the Tribunal to conclude that the first applicant had a political profile that would have attracted the Chinese authorities  adverse attention if he returned to China  This is in essence to challenge the merits of the Tribunal s determination that the country information supported the contrary findings  This challenge  even if made out  would not support a finding of jurisdictional error  It is the Tribunal s responsibility to identify the country information upon which it rests its decision and to determine the weight to be given the various items of country information  This is not a concern of a Court on judicial review  compare NAHI

without specifically explaining why it preferred some information to other  that the Tribunal failed to consider the matters on which the first applicant relied  The law does not require the Tribunal to refute all items of evidence that are contrary to its findings of material fact  see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA

for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo   HCA         CLR   at   per Kirby J referred toVAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   This evidence clearly comes within s  A b  of the Act  By virtue of this provision  s  A does not apply to information that the review applicant gave for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal  Further  in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   Finn and Stone JJ made it plain at   that the word  information   does not encompass the Tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes or determinations   nor does it extend to identified gaps  defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps    The Tribunal also noted that the first applicant s evidence in his post hearing submissions did not  correspond to the profile that  he  presented at the hearing or to the period that  he  has been in Australia   This evidence too comes within the exception in s  A b   Finally  the Tribunal noted that        the applicant gave contradictory information at the hearing about his employment since his arrival in Australia  The Tribunal also notes the applicant s evidence that he did not lodge a protection visa application until eight years after his arrival because the Australian authorities do not publicise the success of applications  However  having regard to the above findings  the Tribunal need not reach a concluded view on this evidence    Again  it is plain enough that the exception in s  A b  would apply and  in any event  this contradictory information did not play a part in the Tribunal s decision   It seems  therefore  that to the extent that the Tribunal relied on inconsistencies in the first applicant s evidence  these inconsistencies arose from the applicant s evidence at the hearing and his submissions to the Tribunal  This material was plainly given by him to the Tribunal for the purpose of its review  Accordingly  s  A was not engaged
