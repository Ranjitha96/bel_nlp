La Bara v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAl Kateb v Godwin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The claim that there is a serious question to be tried as to the  sterilisation  of the applicant s common law rights to instruct legal advisers and obtain legal advice can be rejected on any one of a number of grounds  The respondent s submission was that  assuming such a common law right to exist  it could not prevail over the statutory obligation in the Act to remove the applicant  It is clear  in my opinion  that such common law right to instruct legal advisers as may exist and the applicant never articulated the precise basis or scope of this alleged right cannot entail a right in the applicant to remain in Australia  It is true  as the respondent submitted  that the statutory obligation to remove the applicant could displace the applicant s common law rights  Although I would not readily impute to the legislature an intention to displace those rights absent a clear statement of that intention  in my opinion the mandatory command of s   is expressed in clear and unambiguous language  In this regard  I refer to the decision of the High Court on the interpretation  in a different factual context  of ss       and   of the Act in Al Kateb v Godwin   HCA         CLR   and  in particular  at   per McHugh J and at   per Hayne J  Heydon J agreeing at      Their Honours held that the provisions  being sufficiently clear  could not be read as subject to any intention not to affect fundamental rights  The shorter answer  however  is that neither the power to remove the applicant  nor the actual removal of the applicant  displaces any cause of action he may have against the Commonwealth or his right to instruct legal advisers in connection with such cause of action  I was told that his personal circumstances in Indonesia are such that it will be practically difficult for him to instruct legal advisers in Australia  That may be so  but does not constitute sufficient reason to restrain his proposed removal   The claim that there is a serious question to be tried in relation to a right said to arise from the Convention was put on a somewhat shifting basis  It is plain that the Convention itself cannot be the source of rights under Australian law  Some provisions of the Convention have been incorporated into Australian law in the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act    Cth  but the applicant did not seek to rely upon this Act  The applicant cited Article   of the Convention  which deals with communication between consular officials and nationals of the officials  sending state  but that article is not incorporated into the domestic law  The applicant expressly did not contend that the rights expressed in the article had attained the status of customary international law and  even if they had  it by no means follows that they are for that reason enforceable by this Court  The applicant submitted primarily that the Convention  ratified by the Commonwealth  would be  a relevant consideration in relation to the ability of the Minister to remove  a foreign national from Australia  It was not made clear whether the applicant used the phrase  relevant consideration  in the administrative law sense  namely  a condition of the lawful exercise of the statutory power to deport  or whether the submission was as to the interpretation of the scope of the power  Counsel for the respondents evidently understood the submission against them to be of the latter form and submitted that although unincorporated treaties can be used as an extrinsic aid to interpretation  this was not an appropriate case  It matters little  for the applicant cannot succeed on either basis  as I will explain   The proper use of unincorporated treaties in the interpretation of statutes is limited  The Act is not one which gives effect to the Convention  Nevertheless  Parliament is presumed to have intended to legislate in conformity with Australia s international obligations  Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ  That presumption is  however  rebutted by unambiguous language  Polites v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR    Although ambiguity in a statute may be resolved in favour of the interpretation consistent with those obligations  no relevant ambiguity was identified by the applicant in the present case  Nor is any ambiguity discernible  I refer again to the decision of the High Court in Al Kateb   HCA       CLR   and especially at   per Hayne J and at   per Callinan J  It is not open on the language of the Act
