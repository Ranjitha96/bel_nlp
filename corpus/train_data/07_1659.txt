P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd  ACN       v Multiplex Limited  ACN         FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedApplicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The power given to the Court under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act to forbid or restrict the publication of evidence should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances  Section   makes it clear that the power should only be exercised in order to prevent  prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth   In the present case ASIC s concerns relate to prejudice to the administration of justice  It is a fundamental principle of the administration of justice in Australia that the administration of justice be open justice  When considering whether to exercise the power given by s   a Court must bear in mind the need to do justice between all relevant parties  taking as its initial position the principle of open justice  The manner in which a Court should approach an application under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act to restrict the publication of evidence was considered by a Full Court of the Federal Court in Applicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC    The Full Court said at pars   and      The public interest  that the Court should effectively endeavour to achieve in considering the exercise of power under s   is the object of doing justice between the parties  That is the function that the Court is appointed to discharge  Where refusal to make an order might well undermine or defeat the purpose of achieving justice between the parties  and disappoint the public interest in having the Court deal responsibly with the affairs of citizens  it may be appropriate to make an order pursuant to s           The Court must  however  take into account what s   does not explicitly state  but is the underlying assumption upon which it is based  namely  the principle of open justice  The importance of the principle of open justice is not in doubt  On the other hand  the possibility of prejudice to the administration of justice must be weighed against the public interest in maintaining open justice  Although the principle of open justice is of great importance in exercising the discretion under s   it is not necessarily the whole weight of that principle that must be placed on the scales  The derogation from the principle that might be involved in making an order under s   may be very great  or it might be very small  The degree of derogation from the principle involved in the proposed order is an important matter to be considered in balancing the principle against possible prejudice to the administration of justice       citation omitted citedScott v Scott   AC   The basis upon which the Court should approach an application under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act is similar to the approach it should take in relation to an application under s    The power to order the exclusion of persons from a hearing should only be exercised in exceptional cases  It is clear from s   that that power should only be exercised in circumstances where not to exercise it would be  contrary to the interests of justice   The primary principle is that the principle of open justice is to be observed in that Court hearings should be open to the public and only closed where the interests of justice require that closure  As Earl Loreburn said in Scott v Scott   AC   at    The inveterate rule is that justice shall be administered in open Court   His Lordship accepted that it was appropriate in the interests of justice that the doors of the Court be closed when the subject matter of the action would be destroyed by a hearing in open court citedRaybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones     NSWLR   In Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones     NSWLR   Kirby P  as he then was  said at      Many cases report the scrutiny by courts of statutory provisions designed to derogate from the open administration of justice  Running through these decisions is a common theme  It is that  by our tradition  the open administration of justice is the rule  Statutory derogation from openness is the exception  In the defence of the rule  such statutes will usually be strictly and narrowly construed  Unless the derogation is specifically provided for  courts are loathe to expand the field of secret justice       Samuels JA  in the course of analysing whether the publication of the names in suit would defeat the ends of justice  said at        The inquiry must start with the proposition  central to our notions of forensic procedure  that the courts customarily conduct their business in public in order that the integrity  fairness and efficiency of the system  and its administrators  may be maintained by its exposure to public scrutiny   The applicant submitted that ASIC should disclose in open hearing what was the reasoning process to support the protection of the information sought by ASIC without disclosing what that information was  It submitted that it should  to the extent possible  identify the reasons why the information was being withheld without disclosing the information  The difficulty with acceding to that submission is that exposing the reasoning process would inevitably disclose the information sought to be protected  There were also a number of matters in respect of the claim for public interest immunity privilege raised in the confidential material which I wanted to discuss with counsel for ASIC but it was not possible to do this in open session without exposing the information that ASIC sought to protect   The difficulty with which I was faced in this application by ASIC was that in order to determine whether orders should be made under ss   and   of the Federal Court of Australia Act I must have regard to the confidential affidavits  not served on the parties  filed by ASIC and its confidential submissions  not served on the parties  in order to understand the basis for the application  I reached the conclusion that in order to preserve the subject matter of ASIC s claim for public interest immunity privilege I was compelled to make orders under ss   and   of the Federal Court Act in order to avoid prejudice to the administration of justice  If I had not made such orders I would have destroyed the basis for ASIC s claim  The hearing of ASIC s claim in the presence of the parties to the proceeding would have disclosed the very subject matter and issues which ASIC claimed were protected from disclosure by the public interest immunity privilege  I therefore heard ASIC s application in camera in the absence of the parties to the proceeding
