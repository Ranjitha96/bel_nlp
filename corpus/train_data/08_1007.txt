be listed for hearing on   June   at    am       Insofar as the orders required the plaintiff to do an act  I am satisfied that the orders have been complied with  No creditor has filed an appearance or sought to be heard on this application     The purpose of providing administrators and liquidators with the right to apply for directions from the Court is to protect those officers from incurring personal liability in relation to acts done on behalf of the company  Provided that an administrator or a liquidator makes a full and fair disclosure to the Court of any material facts which are relevant to the application  those officers are entitled to obtain directions from the Court as to the manner in which they should act in carrying out their functions  The purpose is not to enable an administrator or liquidator to apply to the Court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments which would impact upon creditors or other parties not parties to the proceeding but to give the administrator or liquidator advice  Re G B Nathan and Co Pty Ltd  In Liq      NSWLR    However  there may be instances where a court will go further without simply giving directions and make

opinion that the company was insolvent  On   December   the plaintiff in his capacity as administrator of the company convened a meeting of the company s creditors pursuant to s  E of the Act  On   December   Emmett J dismissed the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation s application on the ground that a DOCA was likely to be executed  On   December   the plaintiff convened a further meeting of creditors pursuant to s  A at which the creditors resolved that the company execute a DOCA  That deed was executed on   December     The DOCA provides that a moratorium applies for all liabilities of the company to creditors until the company is released from the DOCA or the DOCA is terminated  clause     Clause     of the DOCA provides that the director  Mr Kerry Rogers  pay to the administrator the sum of   for the purchase of the plant  equipment and vehicles of the company  The DOCA provided for that sum to be held by the administrator  together with other monies as provided for in clause

NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  There is a conflict in the authorities as to the effect of a deed of company arrangement on the assets of the company  In Dean Willcocks v ACG Engineering Pty Ltd  in liq    NSWSC         ACSR     the plaintiff liquidator had previously been the voluntary administrator of the company  After his appointment as administrator  the company entered into a deed of company arrangement which provided for the plaintiff to be the deed administrator  The deed provided for the creation of an administration fund on account of the creditors and provided that the administrator was to hold the administration fund in accordance with the terms of the deed of company arrangement  The deed recorded that the company and its directors had agreed that any monies paid to the administrator towards the fund were not refundable to the company or a third party  The deed of company arrangement required a distribution among the participating creditors   The question for determination for Austin J was whether the administration fund was an asset of the company so as to be available for distribution in the liquidation of the company  or an asset held by the deed administrator for the benefit of the deed creditors and not for the benefit of the company   Justice Austin examined the provisions of the deed of company arrangement and concluded that the plain and natural meaning of the words in the deed created a trust of the amount of the administration fund for the benefit of the participating creditors  The trust arose by reason of the provisions of the deed which created an obligation on the administrator to hold the administration fund in accordance with the terms of the deed  He said that s  G had the effect of binding the company and the deed s administrators  as well as officers and members  which meant that the administrator was bound to hold the administration fund in accordance with the terms of the deed of company arrangement  which was also binding on all relevant parties  He said the provisions of the deed gave rise to an express trust of the administration fund for the benefit of the participating creditors as beneficiaries   That decision was followed by Gyles J in Purchas v Estore Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA         FCR    His Honour said at   and   Counsel for the plaintiffs has pointed out that there is an apparent division of opinion in the authorities upon the critical question  The decisions of Austin J in Dean Willcocks v ACG Engineering Pty Ltd  in liq    NSWSC         ACSR   and Campbell J in Sports Mondial favour the conclusion that the fund is held on trust for the deed creditors  After those decisions  Finkelstein J  in Commonwealth v Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     drew attention to the possibility of an inconsistency between them and the earlier decision of Davies J in Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd     ATR    Davies J held that payments to the administrator were payments to him in his capacity as the agent of the company and consequently the sums received were the property of that company  Barrett J needed to consider the differences in the reasoning in those authorities in Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR   at         In circumstances which I cannot distinguish in substance from the present facts  Barrett J in a careful and reasoned decision applied the reasoning of Davies J  It is appropriate to follow the decision of Barrett J unless I am satisfied that it is clearly wrong  Consistency of decision in relation to the Act is desirable  As I am not satisfied that the decision of Barrett J is clearly wrong  I propose to follow it and give directions accordingly   In my opinion  the decision of Barrett J is to be preferred to the decisions of Austin J and Campbell J for the reasons given by Barrett J   The Act provides a statutory scheme for the administration of a company under a deed of company arrangement  There is no reason  in principle  to treat an administrator any differently from a liquidator  The administrator  like a liquidator  is an officer of the company  He or she is obliged to act in accordance with the functions and powers given him or her under the deed of company arrangement which he or she is appointed to administer   Clause   of the DOCA simply makes the fund available for distribution amongst creditors in accordance with clause   of the DOCA  In my opinion  clause   instructs the administrator as to the order in which the administrator shall distribute and apply the fund  Neither clause   nor   nor clauses   and   considered together  creates a trust whereby the monies are held by the administrator for the benefit of the deed creditors  For those reasons  this case can be distinguished from the facts in Dean Willcocks v ACG Engineering Pty Ltd  in liq    NSWSC       ACSR   and in Shepard v Sports Mondial of Australia Pty Ltd   NSWSC       ACSR    It follows therefore that the fund created by the DOCA is still the property of the company distinguishedShepard v Sports Mondial of Australia Pty Ltd  in liq

who said at   that  the manner of application of the available funds depends upon the terms of the deed of company arrangement   Clause   of the DOCA simply makes the fund available for distribution amongst creditors in accordance with clause   of the DOCA  In my opinion  clause   instructs the administrator as to the order in which the administrator shall distribute and apply the fund  Neither clause   nor   nor clauses   and   considered together  creates a trust whereby the monies are held by the administrator for the benefit of the deed creditors  For those reasons  this case can be

view was taken by Barrett J in Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR    In that case  a clause of the deed provided that the deed fund was to be held on trust for the benefit of the administrators  deed administrators and for those creditors who became participating creditors  In other words  there was specific reference to the deed fund being held on trust  His Honour held  however  that no trust of the kind suggested by Austin J was created by the deed  Instead  the administrator was like a liquidator who was bound by statute to deal with the Club s assets in a particular way in accordance with the deed of company arrangement  In his reasons  Barrett J relied upon a decision of Davies J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd     ACSR    In that case  Davies J concluded that when an administrator was acting in accordance with the powers conferred by the deed and carrying out the duties arising under the deed  the administrator was acting in his capacity as agent for the company  After discussing that case  Barrett J said at   But that  in my opinion  is not what happened here  The segregation of part of the company s property  whether or not including property to be contributed by someone else  so that it becomes a fund to be applied by the deed administrator as the company s agent in accordance with the deed of company arrangement does not  of itself  give rise to a trust  And where  as in the present case  the segregation is made in a context referring to a  trust  administered by the deed administrator  there is again no trust unless it can clearly be seen that the company has divested itself of the legal and beneficial interests in its property  The fact that the fund is to be applied by reference to creditors  claims is not sufficient to give them such beneficial interests in the property concerned  nor is it sufficient to justify a conclusion that the deed administrators became the legal owners of the property so as to be capable of holding it on trust   That decision was followed by Gyles J in Purchas v Estore Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA         FCR    His Honour said at   and
