analysing the circumstances revealed in this matter in light of the considerations and principles referred to in s   and in the above extract  it is appropriate to note the observations of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods   Having referred to the  unity  in the case law affirming the public interest in the promotion of settlements  especially in this area where litigation is likely to be very lengthy  their Honours observed  at        We agree with the statement made in several of the cases cited that it is not actually useful to investigate whether  unaided by the agreement of the parties  we would have arrived at the very figure they propose  The question is not that  it is simply whether  in the performance of the Court s duty under s     this particular penalty  proposed with the consent of the corporation involved and of the Commission  is one that the Court should determine to be appropriate  In considering the appropriateness of the proposed quantum of pecuniary penalty it is necessary to have regard to the various considerations to which I have referred above and to which I now turn   i  The nature and extent of the contravening conduct and the circumstances in which it took place  s  The contravening conduct was born of Mr Fields  decision in August   and was thereafter implemented in all of its dealership agreements until revoked at the end of    It was directed at all of Hobie s sail boat and kayak dealers across Australia  It was the product of the unilateral action of Mr Fields which was taken without legal advice  Its documentary expression was clear and unequivocal in its purport  Hobie did not want its dealers to discount Hobie products   ii  The amount of loss or damage occasioned  s  While the parties have provided me with a list of the pecuniary penalties imposed in cases dealing solely with s   contraventions for the period   to   I would have to say that  the parity principle  has yielded little by way of direct assistance  Such is not uncommon in cases concerned with TP Act contraventions  cf the observations of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods at   citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd     ALR  It is unnecessary for me to rehearse the principles governing the award of declaratory relief particularly in cases of public interest such as the present  see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd     ALR    I am satisfied that there is utility in making the declarations both to publicise the types of conduct that can give rise to contravention of s   and also to provide the basis for the orders by way of injunction and pecuniary penalty  I equally am satisfied with the form in which the declaratory orders have been cast  Injunctive ReliefcitedICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe injunctions sought clearly fall within the requirements of s   of the Act  They relate directly to the contraventions found to have occurred and against which injunctive relief can be granted  cf ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR   at    Further they have been formulated with sufficient precision so as to be capable of being complied with without the continual supervision of the Court  I am satisfied they are consistent with the public interest in the matter  Notwithstanding that Hobie has ceased to engage in contravening conduct  it nonetheless continues to wholesale Hobie products within Australia  The three year duration of the injunction parallels the proposed order relating to the compliance programme and will assist in preventing a recurrence of contravening conduct notwithstanding that such a recurrence is not now reasonably to be anticipated  cf s  a   The Proposed s  C Orders Two distinct species of order are sought under this section  The first  which embodies a number of interlocking orders  requires the establishment and implementation of a trade practices compliance programme which is to be maintained for three years and relatedly imposes periodic reporting obligations to the ACCC  The second would require Hobie to provide information to all of its dealers in letter format concerning this proceeding and its outcome in terms annexed to the proposed consent order citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Danoz Direct Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs to the first of the above  I am

Practices Commission v ICI Operations Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlNo attempt has been made to quantify loss or damage caused by Hobie s conduct either to consumers or to its dealers  This said  I do not consider the absence of such evidence in the circumstances to be either a mitigating or an aggravating factor  cf Trade Practices Commission v ICI

powercitedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThough Hobie is a significant participant in the recreational watercraft market I am prepared to assume for present purposes that such was the market and has a well recognised brand and high quality products  it is only a small to medium enterprise  Nonetheless  the evidence indicates it has substantial and growing revenue and net profits  There is no evidence of its market power or of the commercial impact of its conduct on the market  Even if that impact  if measurable with any precision at all  was slight  it would be no less blameworthy for that reason  cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at      v  Was the conduct systematic  deliberate or covert The decision taken by Mr Fields and its implementation was intentional and purposive but it involved no knowing  or deliberate  contravention of the Act  It was systematic in the sense that there was no differentiation between dealers  but it was not covert in that on the evidence before me it simply cannot be said that it did other than represent Hobie s terms of trade with any prospective dealer   vi  The period over which the conduct occurred In the case of Glascraft  the conduct commenced in August   and ceased on the termination of Glascraft s relationship with Hobie on   August   for reasons unrelated to Hobie s price advertising requirements  In relation to all other dealers  the only conduct relied upon occurred between September   and September     vii  The involvement of senior managementcitedTrade Practices Commission v Milreis Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

Practices Commission v Milreis Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FLR   at    However  it is also important to acknowledge the deterrent function  specific and general  of such a penalty  As Goldberg J observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd  No     FCA         ALR   at        The penalty imposed must be substantial enough that the party realises the seriousness of its conduct and is not inclined to repeat such conduct  Obviously the sum required to achieve this object will be larger where the Court is setting a penalty for a company with vast resources  However  as specific deterrence is only one element and general deterrence must also be achieved  consideration of the party s capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention  consideredAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty
