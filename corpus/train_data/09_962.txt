cth FCA  htmlEarlier today I urgently granted the applicant leave to appeal from two decisions of a Federal Magistrate in respect of related proceedings  In those decisions his Honour had refused applications  supported by both parties  to adjourn the trial of the substantive proceedings in both cases  The background to the applications before me is set out in detail in Lennox v Amcor Limited trading as Amcor Cartonboard   FCA    Pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal from a judgment  other than a migration judgment  of the Federal Magistrates Court is to be exercised by a Full Court unless the Chief Justice considers that it is appropriate for the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the appeal to be exercised by a single Judge  The Chief Justice has so directed in this case  In Court this afternoon the applicant filed the notices of appeal in respect of which leave had previously been granted  citing the following grounds of appeal  The learned Federal Magistrate erred in law by not according natural justice to the Applicant  In refusing the application made by the Applicant to vacate prior orders and adjourn the trial  the learned Federal Magistrate erred as a matter of law by failing to take into account  that the Court had been appraised of the parties  non compliance with the pre trial directions orders on or by   August   the severe and prejudicial consequences of the refusal for the Applicant and for the Respondent  the effect of the refusal on the likely length and cost of the trial  The applicant has sought the following orders  That the decision to refuse the application be set aside  That the orders sought in the application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on   August   be made  That the decision to refuse the stay the trial pending the outcome of this appeal be set aside  That the costs of this appeal be costs in the Federal Magistrates Court proceeding BRG   Such further or other orders as the court sees fit  The orders sought in the application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on   August   were as follows  By   September   each party make discovery on oath in accordance with the categories described in Schedule hereto  Each party shall produce disclosed documents for inspection in accordance with Federal Court Rules by     pm on   September    The trial of this proceeding will be conducted on the basis that the evidence in chief of each witness to be called by the parties will be given by affidavit  That the witnesses  affidavit be exchanged as follows  the Applicant file and serve the affidavit of any proposed witness by   October   the Respondent file and serve the affidavit of any proposed witness by   November   and the Applicant file and serve any affidavits in reply to the Respondent s affidavits by   November    The parties are to exchange outlines of argument   days prior to the
