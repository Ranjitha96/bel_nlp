Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedquotedTNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   The respondent contends that the applicant may only appeal on a question of law and the subject matter of the appeal can only be the question of law so raised   TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at     per Gummow J  Comcare v Etheridge   FCAFC       FCR   at   per Branson J  with Spender and Nicholson JJ agreeing  a mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within the meaning of s   of the AAT Act  and a broad inquiry as to the construction and operation of a statutory provision is not a question of law within the meaning of s   of the AAT Act   Comcare v Etheridge  supra  at p      The respondent notes that in Comcare v Etheridge   Branson J at p   observed that  by inviting the Court to engage in such a broad and hypothetical inquiry the purported question of law extends beyond any controversy between the parties  and is thus incapable of constituting  a matter  within the competence of the Court s jurisdiction  The respondent says that each of the questions raised by the applicant and the contended errors identified are not errors of law and simply invite the Court to consider factual questions and engage in a broad inquiry as to the construction of particular statutory provisions   However  the injury resulted in impairment that was  likely to continue indefinitely   see the definition of permanent in s   of the SRC Act   That state of  likelihood  was satisfied because Mr Parker s right eye was found to be dead  shrunken and potentially in need of removal    However  for the purpose of determining whether an impairment is permanent  s   requires these matters to be considered     a  the duration of the impairment       b  the likelihood of improvement in the employee s condition           c  whether the employee has undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment  and          d  any other relevant matters   Accordingly  having regard to the findings of the Tribunal  Mr Parker suffered impairment  namely  the loss of use of his right eye  that loss will endure for the rest of his life  it cannot improve as the eye is  in every relevant sense  dead  and the analysis of the problem has been the subject of extensive medical consultation and review  Mr Parker s impairment is thus a permanent impairment   Subject to Part II of the SRC Act  s   which forms part of Division   of Part II  Part II Compensation  Division   Injuries  property loss or damage  medical expenses  provides for a liability in the respondent to pay compensation in respect of an injury resulting in impairment   Section   of the Part II specifically addresses a liability to pay compensation in respect of an injury where that injury results in a permanent impairment   An injury contemplated by s  A b  suffered by a person to which s  A applies  is an injury for the purposes of s   if such an injury results in a permanent impairment  A liability arises in the respondent to pay compensation to Mr Parker in respect of that injury  appliedquotedComcare v Etheridge   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The respondent

as that term is understood for the purposes of s  A  of the SRC Act   Comcare v Houghton   FCA   per Lindgren J   as an unintended consequence of medical treatment paid for by the Commonwealth  s  A a  and  b   Thus  Mr Parker suffered  as a statutory construct  an injury arising out of or in the course of his employment   That injury resulted in impairment as the injury to Mr Parker s right eye resulted in the  loss of the use or the damage or malfunction of  a  part of the body  of Mr Parker  see the definition of impairment in s   of the SRC Act  and thus a liability arose to pay compensation to Mr Parker in respect of that injury  s   of the SRC Act  appliedquotedCanute v Comcare   HCA       ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Canute v Comcare   HCA       ALJR   their Honours  Gummow ACJ  Kirby  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ at p     described the structure of s   of the SRC Act in these terms    Section   is the general provision imposing liability upon Comcare to pay compensation where an injury results in a permanent impairment  However  s   renders s   the central provision  Section   requires Comcare to determine  the degree of permanent impairment of the employee  this is to be expressed as a percentage  s    The compensation payable under s   is the equivalent percentage of the  maximum amount   s       subject to the threshold in s    The content of the phrase the  degree of permanent impairment of the employee  is not specifically stated in the Act  that is left to the  approved Guide   s     Section   directs the respondent to determine the  degree of permanent impairment of the employee  resulting from an injury  under the provisions of the approved Guide  The  key statutory criterion of the occurrence of  an injury  resulting in a permanent impairment has been fulfilled as found by the Tribunal  Section   requires the respondent to approach the  criteria and methodologies set out in the Guide  through the  prism  of an injury and assess the degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker  resulting from that injury     Canute v Comcare  supra     In that sense  the terms of s   are  quite clear     Canute v Comcare  supra      Accordingly  s   requires the respondent to determine the degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker resulting from an injury   under the provisions of the approved Guide   Prima facie   the Guide as a subordinate instrument cannot alter the burden of the clear statutory inquiry and determination required by s   by adding a qualification to the question or matter to be determined  For example  the question is not  what degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker has resulted from the injury suffered by Mr Parker having regard to whether  had the injury not occurred  Mr Parker would have suffered permanent impairment or the same degree of permanent impairment as a result of other causes  including the progression of an underlying pre existing condition    Since the key criterion of an injury resulting in permanent impairment has been fulfilled  the only inquiry required by s   is a determination of the degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker resulting from the injury   That determination requires an acceptance of the  fulfilled  nexus between the injury and permanent impairment and directs reference to the provisions of the approved Guide for the purpose of calculating the degree of permanent impairment of the individual in order to give voice to the percentage and thus the amount of compensation to be paid having regard to s   and s     Section   provides that Comcare may from time to time prepare a written document to be called the Guide under the title previously mentioned    Section   requires the Guide to set out       a  criteria by reference to which the degree of permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury shall be determined               b  criteria by reference to which the degree of non economic loss suffered by an employee as a result of an injury or impairment shall be determined  and      c  methods by which the degree of permanent impairment and the degree of non economic loss  as determined under those criteria  shall be expressed as a percentage
