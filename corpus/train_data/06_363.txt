REGISTRY VID   OF     BETWEEN  CADBURY SCHWEPPES PTY LTD   APPLICANT AND  DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD   RESPONDENT   JUDGE  HEEREY J DATE    MARCH   PLACE  MELBOURNE   RULING       The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd  Cadbury  has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  Darrell Lea  alleging contravention of ss        c  and    d  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea s use in its chocolate confectionary business of  the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple    The prime ground on which senior counsel for Darrell Lea argued against the admissibility of the affidavits was that much of Dr Gibbs  opinions were based on market research reports and the like which had not been proved in evidence and were not likely to be proved  Reliance was placed on the well known passage from the judgment of Heydon JA in Makita Australia Pty Ltd v Sprowles Pty Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR   at   which includes the following        so far as the opinion is based on facts  observed  by the expert  they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert  and so far as the opinion is based on  assumed  or  accepted  facts  they must be identified and proved in some other way   However  I accept the submission of senior counsel for Cadbury that this aspect of Makita has not been followed in the Federal Court  The lack of proof of a substantial part of the factual basis of Dr Gibbs  opinions does not of itself render his evidence inadmissible under s    Such lack of proof merely goes to the weight which may be given to the opinion  Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd     IPR   at

      An expert s opinion is admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury   In other words  the Turner rule  adopted in Murphy  is a separate requirement  Even if a proffered opinion is that of a person suitably qualified within an organized area of knowledge  if that area is not outside the experience of ordinary persons  the opinion will not be admissible  As will be seen  there are good policy reasons for this distinction followedMurphy v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au

MELBOURNE   RULING       The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd  Cadbury  has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  Darrell Lea  alleging contravention of ss        c  and    d  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea s use in its chocolate confectionary business of  the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple    The same conclusion is also reached by another route  In Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review   HCA         CLR   at   Dixon CJ  Kitto and Taylor JJ said        it may be said at once that ordinary human nature  that of people at large  is not a subject of proof by evidence  whether supposedly expert or not   As to this  senior counsel for Cadbury submitted     We are certainly not intending to lead evidence of ordinary human nature but the field of expertise or the area of science which is described as behavioural science is certainly a field of expertise and not a matter of proving ordinary human nature   But with respect  the whole raison d tre of Dr Gibbs  evidence is to attempt to persuade the Court what ordinary human nature will lead people to do when making purchasing decisions about Darrell Lea chocolates  given the respective packaging  advertising etc of that firm and Cadbury  As the very name of Dr Gibbs  discipline conveys  he is concerned with the science of human behaviour  That is without doubt an area of specialized knowledge  But Transport Publishing says that ordinary human behaviour is not a matter to be proved in courts by opinion evidence  whether expert or otherwise   In Transport Publishing  loc cit  their Honours go on to say that  particular descriptions of persons may conceivably form the subject of study and special knowledge   Examples given are persons who are  abnormal in mentality or abnormal in behaviour as a result of circumstances peculiar to their history or situation   Likewise  the manner in which people pursuing a special vocation would reason about a matter of business may be the subject of evidence  An example is that of persons skilled in marine insurance who can give evidence as to the materiality of a non disclosure  Their Honours then say     But before opinion evidence may be given upon the characteristics  responses or behaviour of any special category of persons  it must be shown they form a subject of special study or knowledge and only the opinions of one qualified by special training or experience may be received   The second part of that passage of course is echoed in s    However  it is clear that this second condition of admissibility assumes that the first has been satisfied  that is to say that the evidence concerns a  special category of persons    The present case is concerned with the brand names  colours and get up of rival manufacturers of chocolate  and the likely effect of those features on retail purchasing decisions by consumers  Chocolate is an inexpensive  everyday product sold in hundreds of thousands of retail outlets throughout this country  Virtually the whole of the Australian population over the age of about eight years are purchasers or potential purchasers  In no way can consumers of chocolate be considered as a  special category of persons  within the meaning of the Transport Publishing rule  The questions thrown up by this case are quintessentially questions of fact within the experience and knowledge of a trier of fact

MELBOURNE   RULING       The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd  Cadbury  has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  Darrell Lea  alleging contravention of ss        c  and    d  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea s use in its chocolate confectionary business of  the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple    In Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti Healthcare Pty Ltd   FCA   at   in the context of a s   and passing off case  Branson J  after noting that both sides had called evidence of marketing consultants which was received without objection  said     However  I consider it appropriate to record that in the particular circumstances of this case  which is concerned with the packaging of a product intended to appeal to a wide segment of the general public  I have found the expert evidence of no real assistance  This is not only because there is  as is common in cases of this kind  conflict between the evidence of the two experts  It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court s primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of  and the judgments likely to be made by  ordinary  even if it might be thought  somewhat credulous  members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way  I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd   FCA   at   that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court s impression  expert views which are merely  impressionistic  can be given no more than nominal weight  These observations are not intended in any way to belittle the importance of market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour in other types of cases and for other purposes   Senior counsel for Cadbury referred to the assistance he said I could receive from Dr Gibbs  evidence and how it could be helpful  Without wishing to seem ungrateful  or disrespectful to Dr Gibbs  I think the evidence would not be helpful at all  Rather  it would create many areas of disputation with opposing experts and greatly complicate and lengthen the trial of this proceeding  The observations of Branson J in

CADBURY SCHWEPPES PTY LTD   APPLICANT AND  DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD   RESPONDENT   JUDGE  HEEREY J DATE    MARCH   PLACE  MELBOURNE   RULING       The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd  Cadbury  has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd  Darrell Lea  alleging contravention of ss        c  and    d  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea s use in its chocolate confectionary business of  the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple    In Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v  au Domain Administration Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at     a Full Court of this Court cited the above passage with approval and continued      Consideration of these difficulties shows the practical wisdom of the firm rule that the likelihood of conduct being misleading or deceptive is a question for the tribunal of fact and not for any witness to decide  General Electric Co v General Electric Co Ltd     WLR   at   per Lord Diplock  applied in a s   context by Gummow J  with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed  in Interlego AG v Croner Trader Pty Ltd     FCR   at          Lord Diplock points out  ibid  that a different rule applies in the case of sales not to the general public but in specialised markets concerning persons engaged in a particular trade  In the present case the relevant market is that in which the consumers are business users of domain names  Such users constitute large sections of the public and are not participants in a specialised market in the sense discussed by Lord Diplock   In JD Heydon s Cross on Evidence   th Australian ed    the learned author says at      If the court comes to the conclusion that the subject of investigation does not require a sufficient degree of specialised knowledge to call for the testimony of an expert  evidence of opinion will generally be excluded  especially where the witness is produced merely to present in a cogent and vivid form the case of the party calling that witness  The danger of this evidence is that it dresses up matters which are within the ordinary experience of the tribunal of fact in a beguiling scientific garb which may conceal the blemishes within
