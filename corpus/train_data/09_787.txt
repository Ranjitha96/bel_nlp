nevertheless the conduct is previous relevant conduct  see Williams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No      FCA   per Jessup J at     see also Temple per Dowsett J at    The second respondent has not engaged in any similar previous conduct  In contrast to the circumstances in Stuart Mahoney  Temple and Duffy  No     the respondents  conduct on   October   was of limited duration and impact and penalties at the lower end of the scale are appropriate referred toStuart Mahoney v Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe factors relevant to a penalty for a contravention of the Act have been thoroughly discussed by this Court  see  eg  Stuart Mahoney v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA   per Tracey J at   and citations therein  As Tracey J observed in Stuart Mahoney at   the relevant considerations include The respondents  conduct consisted of a brief stop work meeting and a short lived ban on crane work  Crane work at the Site was only affected for   minutes and during this time the Sergi employees continued to perform other work at the Site  The ban and stop work meeting did not significantly disrupt work at the Site and any loss or damage caused was minimal  Given the brief period of time in which the ban and stop work meeting occurred  and the interrelationship between the two events  it is appropriate to regard the stop work meeting and subsequent ban as a single course of conduct giving rise to a single contravention  see s   of the Act referred toTemple v Powell   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere are three instances of similar previous conduct by the Union involving breaches of s     see Stuart Mahoney  Temple v Powell   FCA

 The second respondent has not engaged in any similar previous conduct  In contrast to the circumstances in Stuart Mahoney  Temple and Duffy  No     the respondents  conduct on   October   was of limited duration and impact and penalties at the lower end of the scale are appropriate appliedMinister for Industry  Tourism   Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC  In light of the parties  agreement as to the appropriate penalties to be imposed  the relevant question for this Court is whether the agreed penalty is  appropriate in all the circumstances  see Minister for Industry  Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   per Branson  Sackville and Gyles JJ at    The penalties are not inappropriate merely because I would have imposed different figures  Rather  the penalties agreed by the parties must be within the permissible range of penalties for such a contravention  see Mobil Oil at   and    The Court must still consider the factors relevant to the contraventions by the respondents to determine the permissible range of penalties for the contraventions  An agreed penalty must adequately give effect to general and specific deterrence  Mobil Oil at    Despite the limited duration and impact of the ban and stop work meeting  the imposition of penalties is appropriate in order to provide general and specific deterrence  Although the respondents may have held legitimate health and safety concerns  other avenues were available to the respondents to address these concerns in a lawful manner  see Duffy  No   at    In light of these factors  I am satisfied that the agreed penalties proposed by the parties are sufficient to provide both general and specific deterrence  In view of considerations discussed  I consider that the appropriate range of penalty is in the lower to medium range for the contravention of the Union and that the penalty agreed by the parties is appropriate in all the circumstances  I do have some concerns about imposing a monetary penalty on the second respondent for performing his job in accordance with the approach to industrial relations taken by his employer  the first respondent  in circumstances where that respondent has had a monetary penalty imposed on it  The penalty on the second respondent is within the permissible range  albeit at the upper end of that range  That is especially so where no prior contravention is alleged against the second respondent  Absent the parties  agreement I would not have imposed a penalty in that amount on the second respondent but as the agreed penalty is within the permissible range  albeit barely  I will order accordingly  The parties have agreed that each should bear his and its own costs of the proceeding   I certify that the
