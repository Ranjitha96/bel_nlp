SBTD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAppellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is also true  as the appellant submitted  that the Tribunal commits an error of law if it imposes a requirement on an applicant to modify his or her behaviour or if it fails to consider the reason s  for modified behaviour and  if fear of persecution is a reason  if it fails to consider if the fear of harm is well founded and whether the threat of harm itself constitutes persecution  Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR     Appellant S      In my opinion  the Tribunal did not fail to consider whether the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution based on his conversion from Islam to Christianity  It must be remembered that the focus of the appellant s claim was that Jihadists were pursuing him at the instigation of his uncle  The Tribunal clearly rejected that claim  It rejected the appellant s assertion that there had been five incidents involving the appellant and Jihadists in Kano in   and it rejected the assertion that Jihadists were searching for him  It rejected his explanation for travelling to Kano in June   in light of his evidence that Jihadists were pursuing him as  far fetched and implausible   Any suggestion that the Tribunal was not entitled to make those findings on the evidence must be rejected   Once the appellant s claim that he was being pursued by Jihadists at the instigation of his uncle is rejected and  as was the case  in the absence of any evidence or material to support a conclusion that the appellant would be identified by Jihadists as a convert  it was appropriate that the Tribunal consider  as it did  the general situation in Nigeria and  in particular  the fact that half of the country s population is Christian  In other words  it was appropriate for the Tribunal at that point to consider whether the appellant would or may face persecution by reason of the fact that he was a Christian   I do not think the Tribunal made the error of treating what has happened as decisive in terms of whether there is a well founded fear of persecution  see the discussion in Appellant S  at        It dealt with the principal case advanced by the appellant and rejected it  There was no evidence that the appellant s conversion would be discovered and the mere fact that he was a Christian would not give rise to a well founded fear of persecution   Furthermore  I do not think the Tribunal erred in its approach to the appellant s modified behaviour  It is not clear to me whether the Tribunal accepted the appellant s evidence that he had modified his behaviour  It appears that the Tribunal may have proceeded on the basis that even if the appellant had modified his behaviour in Lagos and even if that was because he feared persecution  the fear of persecution was not well founded  I do not think there is any error in that approach  Once the Tribunal member made the findings she did and in particular once she rejected the appellant s principal claim it was open to her to conclude that even if the appellant genuinely feared persecution the fear was not well founded referred

Tribunal was required to review the delegate s decision  s   and a failure by the Tribunal to deal with a  substantial  clearly articulated argument relying on established facts  made by an applicant will constitute jurisdictional error because it constitutes a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction  Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALJR   at

persecution in Nigeria it was only if he resided in Kano or perhaps other cities or towns in the northern part of Nigeria  He had not done that for about three years prior to his departure from Nigeria  He had a certificate stating that he is a native of Ibadan in Oyo State and the Tribunal member found that there was no reason for him to return to Kano or any of the other northern Islamic states  It is fairly arguable that Kano is not part of the appellant s home area   Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   Re Minister for Immigration and

relocation in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALJR    The appellant was a journalist in the Ukraine  He had a well founded fear of persecution in the city of Chernovtsy  However  the Tribunal held that he could relocate within the Ukraine if he avoided working as a journalist  The High Court said that the Tribunal s approach involved an error of law  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ said  at         The effect of the Tribunal s stance was that the appellant was expected to move elsewhere in Ukraine  and live  discreetly  so as not to attract the adverse interest of the authorities in his new location  lest he be further persecuted by reason of his political opinions  By this reasoning the Tribunal sidestepped consideration of what might reasonably be expected of the appellant with respect to his  relocation  in Ukraine  It presents an error of law  going to an essential task of the Tribunal  This was determination of whether the appellant s fear of persecution was  well founded  in the Convention sense and thus for the purposes of s   of the Act
