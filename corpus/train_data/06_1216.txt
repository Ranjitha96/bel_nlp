NSI Dental Pty Ltd v University of Melbourne  with Corrigendum dated   November     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedJupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Limited     IPR   The principles of construction of a patent specification are well settled  The general approach is summarised by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Limited     IPR   at   and    It is not necessary to repeat the Full Court s comments here   In the event that I am incorrect and the document does anticipate all the integers of Claims   and   the issue is whether the novelty destroying disclosure was made  publicly available  before the priority date  s   of the Act   NSI bears the onus of establishing that the document was made publicly available  see Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd     IPR   at    If this is established  then  in order to uphold the validity of the patent  the University must establish that it did not consent to the disclosure of the document  s  b  of the Act   In this case  I am satisfied that the document was not made publicly available and also that the University did not consent to it being publicly disclosed followedBaygol

toCatnic Components Ltd v Hiller and Smith Ltd   RPC   It is  however  necessary to guard against an unduly strict literal approach since  in some circumstances  such an approach may be inappropriate  By way of illustration  see Catnic Components Ltd v Hiller and Smith Ltd   RPC   at   per Lord Diplock  That case illustrates circumstances in which the strict literal approach was considered by the House of Lords to be inappropriate   With these principles in mind  I turn now to the construction of the claims in the present case   The construction question in the present case focuses on Claim   of the Complex Patent  As discussed above  Claim   is a claim for a complex and not a product or a method for a product  It claims a monopoly for          A stable soluble alkaline calcium phosphate complex  which has been formed at a pH greater than   including phosphopeptide stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate or a derivative thereof wherein the said phosphopeptide includes the amino acid sequence Ser P  Ser P  Ser P  Glu Glu   Professor Dawes explains Claim   in this way  He points out that a  complex  is a combination of two or more components in which there is an interaction between the components  The calcium phosphate complex in this claim is alkaline  This means that  as it exists  it has a pH of more than    There is an additional integer that the calcium phosphate must be formed at a pH greater than    This goes to the manufacture of the complex  which must retain a pH greater than   after creation and when examined  The phosphopeptide referred to is a chain of amino acids which has phosphorylated amino acids  The phosphopeptides stabilise calcium phosphate in a non crystalline form by inhibiting it from converting into a crystalline form and precipitating out of solution  Amorphous calcium phosphate is usually not stable as it tends to convert to crystalline forms of calcium phosphate  Amorphous calcium phosphate is bio available in that it can dissolve and release calcium and phosphate for depositing on teeth  The calcium and phosphate ions  due to their size  can diffuse through surface enamel over a sub surface caries lesion  The pores on the surface enamel are larger than the charged ions and will not impede the diffusion of calcium or phosphate ions through the enamel  By contrast  crystalline forms of calcium phosphate present in the mouth under normal oral conditions cannot diffuse into the teeth  because the crystals are too large to diffuse through the pores in the enamel  These forms of calcium phosphate are therefore not bio available   The case for NSI is that  as a matter of language  the subject of the claim is the  complex  referred to  which is defined in the claim  NSI says that the complex is required to be  stable   soluble   alkaline  to  include calcium phosphate    which is  formed at a pH greater than     and to  include phosphopeptide which stabilises amorphous calcium phosphate or a derivative thereof    In my view  the last descriptor referred to by NSI does not accurately reflect Claim    The final element of Claim   refers to phosphopeptide stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate or a derivative thereof  It is the stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate or derivative which is included and not merely the phosphopeptide  The expression is a composite   NSI also submits that the phosphopeptide must include the Cluster Sequence  NSI says that it is common general knowledge among relevant addressees that phosphopeptides containing the amino acid Cluster Sequence are derived from proteins and  in particular  caseins followedOlin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The University s case on infringement does not depend on any principles of purposive construction  Instead  the University claims that each of the integers of Claim   are literally present  in combination  in each of the NSI Products  The question of infringement is largely determined by reference to the proper construction of the claim  see Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs J   NSI says that  if the University s construction of Claim   is correct  the NSI Products do not infringe the claim because there is no evidence that they include the relevant form of amorphous calcium phosphate  namely  stable  soluble and alkaline calcium phosphate  On the other hand  NSI says that  if its construction of Claim   is correct  the NSI Products do not infringe the claim because the complexes are not formed by using phosphopeptides deliberately extracted  isolated and purified  Further  to the extent that the phosphopeptides are created after formation of a complex of casein  calcium and phosphate  they are not formed by the phosphopeptide stabilising amorphous calcium phosphate as required by Claim     It is therefore necessary to consider the evidence   This test calls for consideration of whether the prior disclosure incorporates all of the integers of any of the claims  see Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at         That is  the prior disclosure must reveal the totality of the invention and the antecedent information and must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would perceive  understand and be able to practically apply the invention without needing to do experiments or obtain further information before the invention can be made useful  see Hill v Evans     De GF   J   per Lord Westbury LC  Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge   Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Stephen and Mason JJ  In other words  the principal issue is whether the content and effect of the claimed anticipation is sufficient to destroy the element of novelty in the invention  see Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly   Co   FCAFC   at          Section   of the Act requires that a complete specification must be clear  succinct and fairly based on the matter described in the specification  NSI submits that the Complex Patent specification does not comply with these requirements  In Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     the High Court formulated the relevant question as being whether there has been a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed so that the invention is broadly or in a general sense described in the body of the specification  Another way that the question can be posed is to ask whether the claim travels beyond the disclosure in the specification  Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Barwick CJ followedMeyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA

document is on the efficacy of a solution made at pH    In my view  having regard to the above  a skilled reader would be left confused by the document as to the pH at which the complex is manufactured  As stated in General Tyre   Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd   RPC   at     it is not sufficient that the prior disclosure contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner that would infringe the patentee s claim  but is at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not infringe the claim  The references to pH in the document cannot be described as  clear and unmistakable directions  as to how to produce the complex  Professor Reynolds gave evidence that the type of information in the document is not sufficient to enable the manufacture of the product  Mr Quigley  in cross examination  referred to discrepancies between the information in the Information Package and the process actually employed during the production trials by the CSIRO  The evidence of Mr Nunn was that the information in the document would not enable the manufacture of the Calpep product without more information   Accordingly  it cannot be said that the document anticipates the integers of Claims   and   followedMoorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd  No       CLR  I am satisfied that the document was made available to a limited body of persons in circumstances where it appeared  on the face of the document  that it had the quality of confidence about it  It appeared that the document was communicated for limited purposes and

CLR   at       Section   of the Act provides that for the purpose of deciding whether an invention is novel  the Court must disregard information made publicly available without the consent of the patentee through any publication by another person who derived the information from the patentee   NSI contends that the Information Package was made publicly available and that the evidence

Finidori of Synthelabo in France  Dr Nelson of Consumer Health Care in the United States  Mr Markowitz of the Block Drug Company in the United States  Mr Faller of Procter   Gamble in the United

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Aickin J defines  common general knowledge  as     that which is known or used by those in the relevant trade  It forms the background knowledge and experience which is available to all in the trade in considering the making of new products  or the making of improvements in old  and it must be treated as being used by an individual as a general body of knowledge   The University submits that Dr Mackinlay s evidence must be approached with some caution because it is unclear precisely what his knowledge was before March    This is because it is unclear what Dr Mackinlay personally knew before March   and what facts he assumed or additional knowledge he gained by reading articles provided to him by his instructing solicitors  The University also submits that Dr Mackinlay s views could have been influenced by hindsight because he was given a copy of the Complex Patent early in the litigation  Taken in isolation  this is not a decisive objection  However  the authorities show that it is a matter that goes to the weight to be given to Dr Mackinlay s evidence and points to the need to exercise a degree of caution when considering his evidence  see  for example  Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   at     per Aickin J   NSI asserts that the claims lack the necessary inventive step because it was common general knowledge as at March   that the Cluster Sequence was present in casein and that it served to bind calcium phosphate  It is contended that this knowledge  when taken with the   paper by Reeves and Latour entitled  Calcium Phosphate Sequestering Phosphopeptide from Casein   the Reeves and Latour article  would make the invention obvious to the skilled addressee   Subject to my comments above regarding the skilled addressee  the principal relevant skilled addressees include Dr Mackinlay and Dr McKinnon citedAktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At the outset  it is

v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     The test formulated by the majority in Alphapharm at     is whether the addressee would directly be led  as a matter of course  to pursue one avenue in the expectation that it may well produce the claimed result  Their Honours referred to the approach taken by Graham J in Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v Biorex Laboraties Ltd   RPC   at      His Honour framed the question in terms of whether a notional research group  at the relevant date  in all the circumstances  which include a knowledge of all the relevant prior art and of the facts of the nature and success of a chemical  would be led directly as a matter of course to try a particular substitution in the expectation that it might well produce a useful alternative to  or better drug than  the existing drug or a body useful for any other purpose   In approaching the question of obviousness  it is necessary to assess the inventiveness of the invention and not simply to examine each integer in isolation  In Alphapharm   the majority said at      The tracing of a course of action which was complex and detailed  as well as laborious  with a good deal of trial and error  with dead ends and the retracing of steps is not the taking of routine steps to which the hypothetical formulator was taken as a matter of course    This observation is pertinent to the present case  Mere verification or discovery is not an invention  An invention may be made by a brilliant sudden insight or act or by a slow and laborious approach  see In re Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC   at   per Maugham J  Obviousness is not determined by asking whether a particular avenue of research is worth a try   In addition  Professor Reynolds gave evidence of the lengthy research and experimental process and the detailed steps taken by him over   years to arrive at the invention  taking account of different stages and streams of research in relation to the formation of complexes at various pH values to increase the yield  the extensive trial and error involved and the consideration of documents teaching away from the invention  These elements are important considerations in relation to the question of obviousness  see Alphapharm at     Dr Mackinlay was asked by NSI to describe  by way of a hypothetical research project  the HRP  how he would have gone about developing a chemical entity that would take advantage of the interaction between casein and calcium phosphate and have the maximum amount of calcium phosphate bound  This was based on the assumption that it was part of the common general knowledge that calcium phosphate binds to casein   The University levelled several criticisms at the HRP  First  the University submitted that Dr Mackinlay s opinion was affected by hindsight  Secondly  it contended that the HRP assumed part of the inventive process  Thirdly  it was submitted that Dr Mackinlay proceeded on the wrong test of obviousness by having regard to whether  straightforward  or  routine  steps could be taken to make the invention   In relation to the second issue it can be seen from the parameters of the HRP that it assumes part of the inventive process  namely  the recognition of a desirable outcome  The desirable outcome was an advanced treatment for dental caries using calcium phosphate and casein  The University submits that  because of this assumption  the HRP lacked a  context  in the sense that the end goal was a given  The University also refers to the approach outlined by the High Court in Alphapharm at    In this case  the High Court stated that the question is whether the person or group would be led directly as a matter of course to try the claimed invention in the expectation that it might well produce a useful result  This indicates the importance of context in providing a useful result  The research is then evaluated in the light of a given purpose  result or direction  Dr McKinnon said that he would want to know about the purpose or context of a HRP before embarking on it  He said that  without this information  he would not have embarked on the HRP engaged in by Dr Mackinlay because it lacked direction and definition   In relation to the third issue  the University submits that Dr Mackinlay proceeded on the basis that the making of adjustments in relation to pH  temperature  ionisation and concentration were  routine  and that this disclosed an erroneous approach to the question of obviousness  The correct and different test that was accepted in Alphapharm at   is whether a person would be led directly  as a matter of course  to try the claimed invention in the expectation that it may well produce a useful or better alternative to the product that existed previously   Finally  it is submitted by the University that the outcome of the HRP does not correspond with the terms of the invention because it does not refer to the form of the amorphous calcium phosphate and omits an important integer of Claim     In my view  there is cogency in these submissions by the University and I accept them  I do not give any significant weight to the HRP on the question of obviousness

taking of routine steps to which the hypothetical formulator was taken as a matter of course    This observation is pertinent to the present case  Mere verification or discovery is not an invention  An invention may be made by a brilliant sudden insight or act or by a slow and laborious approach  see In re Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC   at   per Maugham J  Obviousness is not determined by asking whether a particular avenue of research is worth a try followedICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp Inc   FCA         IPR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It should be noted that the statement by the University is in the form of a submission as to the legal effect of the amended patent claim and it must be considered in that context  The statement involved a consideration of the state of the prior art  It is settled law that an applicant for a patent can make submissions to the Patent Office as to the proper construction or effect of a claim  and this will not be found to have been a false suggestion or representation simply because such a submission may later be held to have been incorrect  see ICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp Inc   FCA         IPR   at      Insofar as the representation is based on belief  it has not been shown to be a false belief or one which is not reasonably held  On the contrary  the conclusions that I have reached on the issues of novelty and obviousness meet the submissions of NSI   In closing addresses  NSI sought to raise other questions that were not pleaded  I do not consider that these should be entertained  However  in any event  in my view  they do not affect the conclusion that I have reached in any way referred toLockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section   of the Act requires that a complete specification must be clear  succinct and fairly based on the matter described in the specification  NSI submits that the Complex Patent specification does not comply with these requirements  In Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     the High Court formulated the relevant question as being whether there has been a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed so that the invention is broadly or in a general sense described in the body of the specification  Another way that the question can be posed is to ask whether the claim travels beyond the disclosure in the specification  Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Barwick CJ referred toStuart v Alexander     ALR   The University refers to authorities that support the proposition that there must be a basis in fact for comparative advertising and to publish comparative claims to ensure that the comparison is accurate  see Stuart v Alexander     ALR   at   per Lockhart J  Makita

ALR   the Court held that it is misleading conduct to make comparative efficiency claims that imply they were made on a scientific basis when  in fact  there is no proper scientific basis for making those claims  That case related to a claim in respect of an ingredient in a toothpaste  A comparison may be misleading by omission of a material fact that would be necessary to render the comparison fair and it can be misleading for a corporation not to put forward sufficient information to dispel the possibility that a recipient may be misled  In some circumstances  it may be misleading to make a statement implying that there is an adequate foundation in scientific knowledge to justify it when  taken in context  the scientific statement does not provide a proper foundation  for example  see
