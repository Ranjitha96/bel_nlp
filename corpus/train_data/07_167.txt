held in those cases that there was no evidence of that fact  citedKumaraperu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   In any event  as the first respondent submitted  the fourth appellant is a child whose claim was entirely dependent on the claim of the first appellant  Had there been an appearance for her at the hearing to which she was invited  that hearing could have added nothing to her case  It follows that  if there were any jurisdictional error in respect of the fourth appellant s hearing  it could not have made any difference to the outcome of the Tribunal s deliberations  There is ample authority in this Court supporting the proposition that  in such circumstances  matters should not be remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing  see  for example  Kumaraperu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   at   per Weinberg J  Accordingly  I would not set aside the Tribunal s decision on this account   Also at the hearing of the appeal on   February   the appellants asserted that they had handed some documents to the Tribunal relevant to the first appellant s medical condition and that some of these documents had not been referred to by the Tribunal in making its decision  They also made a claim concerning the first appellant s receipt of the letter that the Tribunal sent to them granting an extension of time   The documents that the appellants said they gave the Tribunal and to which the Tribunal did not refer are the contested documents  see   above  Ms White has deposed that she did not find them on the relevant Tribunal file when she searched it recently  There is no mention of them in the Tribunal s very detailed reasons  and they do not appear in this Court s or the Federal Magistrates Court s files  The contested documents were not the subject of any ground for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court  They were also not the subject of any ground of appeal in this Court  The appellants have not sought leave to amend their grounds of appeal or to rely on fresh evidence  and any application to do so would be bound to fail  The appellants advance no explanation as to why this new ground and accompanying evidence was not raised earlier  The Federal Magistrate s reasons for judgment record that   w hen invited to make oral submissions to the Court  the applicant husband indicated that he would rely on his written submissions   Contrary to his Honour s statement  the appellants claimed that they raised the issue before him and he ignored it  There is  however  no ground of appeal challenging his Honour s disregard of the matter  In the absence of any evidence supporting the appellants  I reject their contention   In any event  as the first respondent points out  the contested documents would not take the matter further  They do not provide evidence of an opinion that the first appellant s ability to give evidence was impaired by his medical condition and  relevantly demonstrate any jurisdictional error in the Tribunal s contrary finding  which was based on its own observations   Finally  the first appellant s submission as to his receipt of the letter granting an extension is not supported by admissible evidence and is not within a ground of appeal  Furthermore  ss  C and  A   of the Act   referred to above  provides a sufficient answer to this complaint  The letter was sent to the last residential address provided by the appellants in connection with the review
