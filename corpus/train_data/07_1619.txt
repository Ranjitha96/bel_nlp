Colonial First State Private Capital Limited  in the matter of Colonial First State Private Capital Limited   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAPN News   Media Ltd     ACSR   I discussed provisions of this kind in Re APN News   Media Ltd     ACSR     APN   at     and indicated  at   that it seemed to be desirable that applications under s   be supported by affidavit evidence directed to showing certain matters   In the present case there are limited no talk and no shop provisions in cl   of the MIA and a break fee provision in cl   of the MIA  The  no talk period  and  no shop period  are defined to mean the period from   August   until the earliest to occur of either   December   the termination of the MIA in accordance with its terms  or the coming into effect under s   of the Act of the Court s Order under s  b  approving the Scheme  Thus  the longest the period can be is from   August   to   December    I think I am entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that this period of some four and a half months is not unreasonably long by reference to the periods that one sees in similar provisions in schemes of the present kind   The no talk and no shop provisions are related to the concept of a  Competing Proposal   There is a  fiduciary carve out  from the no talk provision in cl     of the MIA   By cl     CFI undertakes  during the no shop period  to inform Sunsuper of any competing approaches made to CFI   Importantly  Sunsuper has no relevant interest in shares in CFI  in contrast to the position that prevailed in APN   ACSR    Accordingly  there is no scope for an argument that Sunsuper used its position as a CFI shareholder with  representation  on CFI s Board of Directors  somehow to lock the CFI shareholders into the Scheme   I turn now to the break fee for which cl   of the MIA provides  The amount of that fee is   million  As noted in APN   ACSR   at   the Takeovers Panel s Guidance Note   Lock up Devices   nd issue    states  at     that the Panel uses a guideline that a break fee should not exceed   of the  equity value  of the target  and for this purpose the equity value is the aggregate of the value of all classes of equity securities issued by the target  It will be recalled  see   above  that in the present case  the  equity value  of CFI is stated by Deloitte to lie between     million and   million  I note also that the aggregate consideration is       shares x     per share   The break fee of   million dollars is below the   level   By cl    c  of the MIA  CFI s Board of Directors acknowledged that it had received legal advice in connection with cl   and believed that the Scheme would provide benefit to CFI and CFI shareholders and that it was reasonable and appropriate for CFI to agree to the break fee in order to secure Sunsuper s participation in the transaction   By cl    a  of the MIA  the parties acknowledged that the amount of   million represented  a genuine and reasonable pre estimate of the transaction costs it  sic that  will have been incurred by Sunsuper    In the circumstances I think that although affidavit evidence to the effect described by me in APN   ACSR   was not led  I remain of the view that affidavit evidence is desirable  I am entitled to infer  as I do  by reason of the terms of the MIA and the other circumstances referred to above  that the matters to which I referred in that case  at   are established   For the above reasons I made the orders referred to earlier for the convening of the Scheme meeting and approving the draft Scheme Booklet as the registered explanatory statement     I certify that the preceding thirty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren    Associate  Dated    October   Counsel for the Plaintiff    Mr M B Oakes SC       Solicitors for the Plaintiff   Minter Ellison       Counsel for Sunsuper Pty Ltd    Mr F Gleeson SC       Solicitors for Sunsuper Pty Ltd    Jones Day       Date of Hearing      October         Date of Judgment      October         Date of Publication of Reasons      October           AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
