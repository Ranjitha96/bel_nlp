BCII Act covers acts by persons other than employees  In Cahill v Construction  Forestry Mining and Energy Union  No     FCA         FCR   at         Kenny J held that the words  a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of building work  in paras  b  and  c  of the definition of  building industrial action  in the BCII Act covered the imposition of bans  limitations or restrictions by unions  Arguably s   extends to union officers in a case such as this  In any event the interlocutory injunction as against the CFMEU would  practically  be directed also at its employees  officers or agents  Further or alternatively  Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan and the CFMEU  are amenable to interlocutory injunctive orders under s   of the BCII Act by reason of the accessorial liability provisions of s   if a prima facie case is demonstrated that each aided  abetted  counselled or procured the contraventions by employees  or in the case of Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan that they were also directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or a party to those contraventions  It will be sufficient for present purposes in relation to Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan  as respondents  if in due course  I consider only the question of accessorial liability under s   which of course depends on primary liability  upon a prima facie basis  being established against the CFMEU consideredICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSection   is in the same terms as s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR   Lockhart J  with whom French J agreed  said at         Subsections   and   of s   are novel because they empower the court to grant injunctive relief notwithstanding that the defendant has not previously engaged in the prohibited conduct or does not intend to engage in it again or to continue to engage in it or there is no imminent danger of substantial damage  Yet these are the traditional requirements for equitable injunctive relief          In my opinion subss   and   are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied  ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pts IV or V of the Act  the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers  devoid of traditional constraints  though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly           This does not mean that the traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant  For example  it must be relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct or whether it has ever occurred before or whether imminent substantial damage is likely  but the absence of any one or more of these elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction under s    That is the effect of subss   and    subs   in relation to the prevention of conduct and subs   in relation to a mandatory injunction   Their presence is not an indication of a new statutory house  rather an old house with some modern extensions       Gummow J at   came to essentially the same conclusion   Section   BCII Act Section  c  and   of the BCII Act empower the Court to grant injunctions  including interim injunctions  in relation to a person who has contravened a civil penalty provision  Subsection   defines an eligible person to make an application under s   and   to include the ABCC  Thus  s   and s  a  empower this Court on the present application  to make an interim injunction in relation to a person who has contravened s    This Court may grant injunctive relief under s   and its power to do so may  under s  a  be exercised whether or not it appears that the respondents intend to engage again in the relevant conduct  The question of repetition is nonetheless of relevance to the exercise of the discretion  but the relevance is set in the particular context of public interest injunctions  as distinct from those related to private proprietary interests  ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR   at   per Lockhart J    per Gummow J    per French J  The Court is inclined to grant an injunction in cases of statutory injunctions in the public interest where there has been unlawful conduct  in order to add contempt to the disincentives for repetition  per French J at   where his Honour said      There is room     for an injunction that is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence  That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court  In this case  a prima facie case has been established of contraventions which have already occurred twice over a combined period of   days  Danger of damage  to any person On each of the days that industrial action occurred  the evidence is that the following persons suffered damage or were exposed to damage       a      and   June     Diploma  Commercial Tiling Services Pty Ltd  Action Interiors Pty Ltd  Firesafe Systems Pty Ltd  Planet

Council of New South Wales v Axis Metal Roofing     IR     Vice President Justice Walton considered whether  under s   of the Industrial Relations Act    NSW  a strike was based on a reasonable concern for health and safety of employees  There was no requirement for the concern for health and safety to be an imminent risk  Nonetheless his Honour considered the concepts of  imminence   seriousness   proportionality  and  justification  which would be relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion       a  Whether it is a  reasonable  concern involves an objective assessment of the nature of that concern           b  A concern may be reasonable so long as it is not fanciful  illogical or irrational at the time the concern arises  without the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of whether a real risk does in fact exist           c  There is no need to establish that an actual risk existed at the time           d  The reasonableness must be assessed from the perspective of an ordinary and reasonable person in the position of the employees involved at the relevant time           e  The reasonable concern must continue during all times that the relevant industrial action is occurring  and          f  Previous incidents  occurrences or beliefs may be relevant to a basis for a concern for health or safety in the circumstances  Accordingly the issue is not whether certain matters did in fact constitute a risk to health or safety  but rather whether any employee reasonably held a concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety  The applicant accepts  correctly in my view  that an employee may have a concern even though his or her concern arose only from something communicated by a union official  However  such a concern must still be objectively reasonable  It will not be reasonable merely because it was raised by a union official  ImminentdistinguishedLeighton Contractors Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   WASC         IR  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  htmlThe respondents point to the fact that they are not the employees in question and did not fail or refuse to attend for building work and are therefore not capable of engaging in building industrial action  They rely on Leighton Contractors Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   WASC         IR   at     It follows  they submit  that there is no cause of action against the respondents for engaging in building industrial action and  therefore  unlawful industrial action  in the manner alleged in paragraphs  a  and  b  of the Details of Claim in the application  and therefore no serious question to be tried in relation to those allegations  The respondents further contend that the application does not contain any reference to the accessorial provisions found in s   which treats persons involved in a contravention of a civil penalty provision as having contravened the provision  Le Miere J in Leighton Contractors Ltd   IR   at   correctly stated that a defendant who was not a relevant employee and who did not fail or refuse to attend for building work is not capable of engaging in building
