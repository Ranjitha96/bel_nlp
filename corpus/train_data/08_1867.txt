Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd  ACN       v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedJones v Dunkel     CLR   The appellants contend that the primary judge has mis applied the rule in Jones v Dunkel     CLR   and that the primary judge has relied upon the evidence of Mr Breed in reaching conclusions about the evidence of Mr Tracy and matters going to Mr Tracy s credit  Further  the appellants say that they have been denied procedural fairness as they were not provided with an opportunity to cross examine Mr Breed in respect of his affidavit tendered in evidence by the respondents  These matters concerning Mr Breed are said to involve errors of law affecting fact finding and give rise to arguable grounds of appeal  Mr Lynch gives emphasis to these matters particularly the contended denial of procedural fairness in the opportunity to cross examine Mr Breed  in his oral submissions in support of the stay application  Mr Lynch says that the appeal is not frivolous and raises arguable grounds  He says that if the first and second respondents resist the stay of the orders on the cross claim on the ground fundamentally that the appellants have failed to reach the threshold of an arguable ground of appeal  the challenge to the findings on credit and their relationship with the evidence of Mr Breed raises at least an arguable ground of appeal   The notice of appeal recites   grounds of appeal  It is not useful in these reasons to recite all of the grounds of appeal nor is it useful to undertake an analysis of the merits of any of them  It is useful however to identify the focus of the grounds of challenge in exercising the discretion in relation to the stay of the orders on the cross claim  in particular   By grounds                   again                                    and   the appellants contend that the primary judge reached findings which are against the weight of evidence  By grounds                     and   the appellants contend for errors of law in the reception into evidence of Mr Breed s affidavit  the denial of an opportunity to cross examine Mr Breed  procedural unfairness  the refusal to draw an adverse inference against the first and second respondents in accordance with Jones v Dunkel and errors of law in reliance upon the affidavit in relation to particular findings  By ground   the appellants say that the adverse finding on credit based upon a failure to adduce evidence of a serious accusation is unreliable because the appellants did not plead such an allegation and were not obliged to adduce evidence of it  By ground   the appellants say that credit findings concerning Mr Tracy which rely upon allegations by him of the use by the first respondent of a particular pesticide are unreliable and made in error as the particular allegation was not pleaded against the first respondent   By grounds   and  A  the appellants say that the primary judge erred in law by finding that the first respondent when authorising the provision of a valuation dated   June   to Mr Tracy  did not contravene s   of the Act on the basis that the valuation mentioned financial years not crop years   By grounds   and   the appellants contend that the primary judge erred in law in concluding that the contended failure to disclose particular matters was misleading or deceptive

losses were suffered as a direct consequence of contravening conduct in the sense contemplated by Sheppard  Wilcox and Pincus JJ in Netaf Pty Ltd   Anor v Bikane Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   and secondly  the third appellant was in any event insolvent from incorporation and its guiding mind  Mr Tracy  had little experience in the industry on the evidence and findings at trial   The appellants

at first instance if execution of the judgment is stayed   Sevenhill Holdings Pty Ltd v Musovic per French J   On the question of a nugatory appeal  the Queensland Court of Appeal  Keane JA  McMurdo P and White AJA agreeing  in Cook s Construction v Stork Food Systems considered that even if the refusal of a stay were  in the circumstances of that case  to lead to the receivership or liquidation of the appellant  substantive rights could nevertheless be pursued by the receiver or the liquidator   Although the respondents contend that four grounds of criticism of the appeal     demonstrate that the appeal can not succeed and no arguable ground of appeal has been articulated  the grounds of appeal do not fall into the class of case described in Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation or Sevenhill Holdings v Musovic   notwithstanding the difficulties the appellants confront  In other words  the appellants have raised contentions that are other than frivolous  It is true that many of the grounds of appeal challenge findings of fact as against the weight of evidence  Similarly  the grounds of appeal call into question the findings of the primary judge on questions of credit in circumstances where the primary judge had the benefit of assessing the evidence of Mr Tracy and Mr Strahley in the context of all the evidence  Nevertheless  the appellants are entitled to seek to persuade the Court on appeal  that the various challenged findings ought not to have been made or that errors of law were made in the treatment of particular topics such as reliance or any of the other matters framed by the notice of appeal  In so observing  of course  I make no comment about the merits or otherwise of any particular matter raised by any of the grounds of appeal   However  the first appellant has no capacity to pay the judgment debt or costs  No protective mechanism has been put forward by Mr Tracy or the first appellant to ensure that any stay order is  fair to all parties   Mr Tracy has not offered any undertaking on behalf of the first appellant not to charge or encumber any of its assets pending appeal and no security is offered over any assets of Mr Tracy  There is no proposal to pay the judgment sum or any part of it into Court  The absence of any such proposal is no doubt due to the incapacity of the first appellant to be able to do so and a disinclination in Mr Tracy to suggest any other mechanism for a supervised investment account   The appellants  principal discretionary consideration urged upon the Court is that a refusal of a stay with any consequential payment of monies  particularly the deposit monies  to the first respondent would occur in circumstances where the first appellant has no reasonable confidence of repayment if ultimately successful  The appellants however have not demonstrated that residual injustice will arise by complying with the orders at first instance should the appeal be successful  In that sense  the appellant has not demonstrated that the appeal will be rendered nugatory by a refusal of a stay  Inconvenience in satisfying the judgment debt or  alternatively  the prospect of changes in the administration of the first appellant either by reason of receivership or liquidation does not of itself render an appeal nugatory
