the ground that there has been a contravention of the Act  the consequence of s   of the Act is that  relevantly  the facts which would justify the relief must include facts which would allow the Court to be satisfied that the result of the election is likely to have been affected  The minimum assertion necessary to constitute such a fact is one raising the matter or matters by which the election is likely to be affected   Webster at   per Gaudron J  McClure v Australian Electoral Commission   HCA         ALR   at     per Hayne J   As Dawson J outlined in Sykes v Australian Electoral Commission   HCA         ALR   at   paragraph  a  requires not only the essential facts relied on to be set out but also those facts must be sufficient to justify a finding in invalidity  As his Honour pointed out  otherwise s  a  in conjunction with s   would achieve little followedNile v Wood   HCA           CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As noted above  s   of the Act provides that  subject to subs   no proceedings shall be had on the petition unless the requirements of  relevantly  s   are complied with  The   day requirement of s  e  is one which must be complied with if proceedings are to be had on the petition within the meaning of s    In Nile v Wood   HCA           CLR   the petition failed to include a prayer for relief as required by s  b   Justices Brennan  Deane and Toohey stated at   that if there are defects in the petition in a failure to comply with s   those defects are not capable  by reason of s   of being cured by amendment after the period of   days fixed by paragraph  e  for the filing of a petition  Accordingly the petition was held to be incurably defective and no proceedings could be had on it  at     Accordingly  as the   day period has now expired  any amendment to the petition is not available as the petition does not comply with s  a  of the Act   The Act does provide one exception to the requirements of s    Section   provides that the Court may  at any time after filing the petition and on such terms  if any  as it thinks fit  relieve the petitioner wholly or in part from compliance with s  aa  citedRobertson v Australian Electoral Commission   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There are some difficulties in distinguishing between the facts required by s  a  as to which no amendments are to be made after the   day period and the facts needed to comply with s  aa  where compliance can be dispensed with at any time after the filing of the petition  As Dawson J observed in Sykes at   the precise distinction between those two subparagraphs   is a matter of some obscurity    His Honour continued  in a passage adopted by Toohey J in Robertson v Australian Electoral Commission   HCA         ALR   at      it appears that under para  a  the essential facts may be stated with a degree of generality and it is para  aa  which requires sufficient particularity to identify the specific matter or matters relied on followedRudolphy v Lightfoot   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This is not a case of a lack of particularisation  The facts in the petition do not comply with s  a  of the Act even at a level of generality  The inclusion of s  aa  which refers to the particularity of the content of the petition emphasises the imperative nature of the other provisions of s     Rudolphy v Lightfoot   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  including s  a    In Rudolphy   the High Court confirmed that   once the forty day period has expired  it is not possible thereafter to amend the petition which has been filed within time so as to cure any non compliance with the requirement of section      at    Amendment to the petition is not available   Mr Smith seeks by the petition an order that the Senate elections be declared void on the ground that the registration of the Fishing and Lifestyle Party contravened Part XI of the Act  However  his petition does not allege sufficient facts that would be capable of showing that any such wrongful registration is likely to have had any effect on the outcome of the elections in question  Any amendment to the petition is not available as the   day period referred to in s  e  has now expired   The petition fails to comply with s  a  of the Act and must therefore be dismissed  I will hear the parties as to costs   I certify that the preceding twenty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

In the present case there are no facts set out or assertions made in the petition as to the likely outcome of the election other than the possibility that  because of a preference deal  the quota or a

on followedWebster v Deahm   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commission submits that  as pointed out by Gaudron J in Webster v Deahm   HCA         ALR   at   the very minimum assertion necessary to constitute a fact which will invalidate an election or return for the purposes of s  a  of the Act is one that raises a matter or matters by which the election was likely to be affected  such as an assertion   that goes to or bears upon the casting or counting of votes     The petition does include some alleged facts under the heading  The Senate Election Facts   Apart from setting out some general matters about  above and below the line  voting  the following facts are alleged  described as  particulars       xxxi  The above the line groups especially like minded ones are known for doing preference swaps or deals which create preference flows that either enhance or restrict a group vote tally to reach the required Quota to become elected or excluded  so the preference flow is most important to parties who fail to gain the quota at first preference           xxxii  The inclusion or exclusion of above the line groups with their preference  deals  is crucial in the Senate preference system for any group to achieve quota or deciding last Senate spots  Is there a remedy for unscrambling election Senate results if a group is removed from the election after the votes have been cast and counted       original emphasis  These alleged facts do not address the matters raised in Webster   Read beneficially to Mr Smith  they do suggest that the existence of a party as a group affects the actual votes recorded and also the directed distribution of preferences  That distribution may be influenced and affected as alleged by   deals done prior to the election for the distribution of preferences     Mr Smith  in his submissions  made it very clear that in questioning whether there was a way of  unscrambling  election results  his case as set out in those alleged facts is that the Senate election is a complex system of preference votes that are   non lineal    He says that if a party is removed  there is no process available by any   lineal means   to know what would happen and that  if the party were not on the ballot paper  the outcome in terms of the likely voter pattern would be   unpredictable    He submits that there is an infinite list of variables that are likely to affect the outcome of the election and that the result of the change of one of those variables would result   in chaos   which  he said  would flow from the change in just one variable before the election   The Commission points out that this amounts to a case based on the contention that one variable can   change anything and everything    It submits that the statutory threshold necessary is that the election is likely to be affected   Accordingly  the facts relied on to invalidate the election or return under s  a  must be sufficient to establish  as a threshold  that the election is likely to be affected  An allegation of chaos that may affect the outcome is  it submits  insufficient   In a case where the relief sought is an order under s  v  or  vii  of the Act  declaring that a person who was returned as elected was not duly elected or declaring an election void  on the ground that there has been a contravention of the Act  the consequence of s   of the Act is that  relevantly  the facts which would justify the relief must include facts which would allow the Court to be satisfied that the result of the election is likely to have been
