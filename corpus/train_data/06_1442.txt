Commission v IMB Group Pty Ltd   FCA    regulator seeking penalty for conduct in breach of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  notwithstanding that conduct had ceased  followedBeitseen v Johnson     IR   The notice of motion before the Court concerns an application by the Tax Agents  Board of Queensland  the Board  for orders that an appeal of Mr Aalders commenced by notice of appeal filed on   August   be dismissed  The claim is brought pursuant to the discretionary power of the Court in s   Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  or alternatively O   r   Federal Court Rules to dismiss or permanently stay an appeal on the grounds that to proceed would be futile or would involve the Court in the determination of issues that are moot or hypothetical  That these provisions confer this power on the Court in such circumstances is clear from the decision of the Full Court in Beitseen v Johnson     IR   at     Mr Aalders  a chartered accountant who was a registered tax agent in New Zealand  applied to the Board for registration as a tax agent in Queensland on   August    The application was on two grounds  first  under the Trans Tasman Mutual Recognition Act    Cth   the TTMR Act  and second  under the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   Tax Act    The Board refused Mr Aalders  application for registration under both Acts  and he applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal  for review of that decision   The Tribunal delivered its decision on   July    In that decision  the Tribunal    affirmed the decision of the Board to reject Mr Aalders  application for registration as a tax agent in Queensland pursuant to the TTMR Act  but    set aside the decision to reject the Mr Aalders  application for registration as a tax agent pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Act  and remitted the matter to the Board for reassessment with the direction that Mr Aalders qualified for registration as a tax agent in Queensland   It is common ground that Mr Aalders is now registered as a tax agent in Queensland  The chronology filed by the Board indicates that Mr Aalders was registered as a tax agent on   August     Mr Aalders has now appealed the decision of the Tribunal  but only in respect of the Tribunal decision Q  with respect to his application for registration as a tax agent pursuant to the TTMR Act    To uphold the ruling of the Tribunal would create a situation which requires the New Zealand government to give up its right to its own sovereign decisions and to make those subservient to whims of the tax bureaucracy of Australia in order for the TTMR regime to apply     Mr Aalders subsequently filed further written submissions including     There prevails unwarranted discrimination against New Zealand Chartered Accountants based on supposition and assumptions based on ignorance and prejudice rather than on fact      The Tribunal is biased in its approach to New Zealand tax agents     Mr Aalders also referred in detail to Crowley v Tax Agents  Board of NSW     ATC   a decision of the Tribunal   SUMMARY DISMISSAL     The relevant powers of the Federal Court are found in s   Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and O   r   Federal Court Rules   Beitseen v Johnson     IR   at    Section   provides     The Court has power  in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction  to make orders of such kinds  including interlocutory orders  and to issue  or direct the issue of  writs of such kinds  as the Court thinks appropriate   The principle has also been applied in the Federal Court in a number of cases  for example Beitseen v Johnson     IR   La Roche v Cormack     FCR   Rocklea Spinning Mills v Anti Dumping Authority     FCR   at   Mayne Nickless Ltd v Transport Workers Union of Australia     FCA  Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Administrative Appeals Tribunal   FCA     Vanstone v Clark   FCAFC    In Beitseen   to which I was also directed by Ms Brennan acting for the Board  the trial judge had made orders directing members of a union to perform and observe the rules of that organisation by treating the respondent as having been validly appointed to the position of secretary in the union  and by treating as null and void a purported resolution of the union that an election be held for that position  The respondent s appointment was for the unexpired term of the previous incumbent in that role  however it was common ground that the unexpired term would expire shortly afterwards  and that an election was in progress to determine who would fill the office for a full term from that time  The appellants sought to appeal the decision at first instance on the basis of issues including whether the respondent was eligible to be appointed to the position pro tem  whether the union could have filled the position by appointment a casual vacancy  and whether the appointment of the respondent had not been effectively revoked by a subsequent meeting  Woodward  Northrop and Ryan JJ held that    in the circumstances there was no real contest between the parties as to the right of the respondent to occupy the position    resolving those questions would be to furnish an advisory opinion which courts traditionally  and for good reason  have been averse from doing    although the appellants genuinely desired to agitate the issues involved in the grounds of their notice of appeal  such a desire does not satisfy the requirement that the legal rights of the parties should be in actual controversy as articulated Hole v Insurance Commissioner   As explained by their Honours       On our understanding that requirement entails that any judgment which might be given on the appeal should confirm or modify rights which remain capable in a real and genuine sense of being enjoyed    at     In the case before me there is no question that Mr Aalders is genuinely desirous of resolution of the issue of the application of the TTMR Act to New Zealand tax agents seeking to practise in Australia  From the facts of the case before me  however  it is equally clear that  so far as Mr Aalders is concerned  the point is moot  Whether the TTMR Act applies to New Zealand tax agents seeking to practise in Australia is  considered objectively  no longer relevant to his circumstances  Mr Aalders was registered as a tax agent in Australia following the decision of the Tribunal  on a different basis to the application of the TTMR Act  To paraphrase the words of their Honours in Beitseen and Hole     there remains no real contest between Mr Aalders and the Board as to his registration as a tax agent    his desire to agitate the issue of the application of the TTMR Act to New Zealand tax agents does not satisfy the requirement that the legal right of the parties should be in actual controversy    no outcome from Mr Aalders  substantive appeal  irrespective of whether I were to find in his favour or against him  and no direction I could

TTMR Act and the TTMR Arrangement to removing regulatory barriers to trade and commerce between Australia and New Zealand as evidenced in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trans Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill     are not in dispute  However  with respect  I am not satisfied that Mr Aalders  submissions raise issues of genuine public interest sufficient to displace the traditional approach of Courts to what are  at the end of the day  hypothetical questions in the context of this case  While Mr Aalders submits that the principle he seeks to agitate has wider significance than the circumstances of his individual case  there is  for example    No evidence which could lead me to the conclusion that the differences in the taxation regimes between Australia and New Zealand do not warrant different approaches to registration as tax agents or that there is an issue of public policy in ensuring that New Zealand tax agents are able to be registered in Queensland without complying with requisite Australian standards     No evidence before me which could lead me to the conclusion that appropriately qualified New Zealand tax agents are not able to be registered in Queensland on other bases  including under the Tax Act  as Mr Aalders was      No indication of the scale of the problem if any facing New Zealand tax agents seeking to be registered in Queensland     No evidence that the inability  to the extent there is an inability  of New Zealand tax agents to be registered as tax agents in Queensland creates an issue of public interest in Australia   as distinct from New Zealand  to the extent that it is an issue of public interest in New Zealand  which is also unknown and may indeed be irrelevant for the purposes of the exercise of my discretion in this matter      Notwithstanding Mr Aalders  claims concerning the approach by New Zealand courts to Australian medical practitioners seeking to practise in New Zealand no evidence there is a conflict between inconsistent decisions between Australia and New Zealand in the interpretation of the TTMR statutes on each side of the Tasman which it would be desirable to resolve  Further  notwithstanding Mr Aalders  submissions concerning Crowley v Tax Agents  Board of New South Wales     ATC   and its undesirability as a precedent in reinforcing discriminatory treatment of New Zealand educated chartered accountants  I am not persuaded that it is appropriate at this stage to revisit the approach taken in that case     No issue involving  for example  the administration of justice  public safety  issues of public or media attention or difficult issues of law which have been raised and which should be resolved     No longer  a matter  between Mr Aalders and the Board in relation to his registration as a tax agent  with the exception of what he described as the offence he took at his perceived treatment by the Tribunal  TS p   ll     and his desire that the Board take a different approach to other New Zealand tax agents seeking registration   Indeed the last point in many ways crystallises the issue concerning whether there is a public interest in the Court hearing Mr Aalders  appeal  Mr Aalders in his written submissions asks        that if he is not allowed to appeal a questionable determination of equivalent occupations  which discriminates against NZ educated Chartered Accountants in public practice  often included in the omnibus description of Tax practitioners  under the Trans Tasman Mutual Recognition Act   and the TTMR arrangement  who else  other than him  may bring such a proceeding to bring about a correction of a most curious decision  One obvious answer to the question of  who else  other than Mr Aalders  is a New Zealand tax agent who seeks registration as a tax agent in Australia  who cannot be registered by means of the Tax Act or other avenues  and therefore who cannot achieve registration as a tax agent in Australia other than by reference to the TTMR Act   Should such a person be unsuccessful before the Board and subsequently before the Tribunal  their application might very well come to the Federal Court of Australia for determination  However Mr Aalders is not such a person  He was successful in his case before the Tribunal against the Board  and has been registered as a tax agent  Other than what are clearly his strong feelings in relation to the relevant issues  he has no personal interest in general principles applicable to New Zealand tax agents becoming registered as tax agents by the Board citedDouglas v

to obtain registration as a tax agent on any other basis  As I have already pointed out earlier in this judgment citing Lord Loreburn LC in Glasgow Navigation Company v Iron Ore Company   that is not the function of a Court of law   The only question which remains then is whether determination of the issue of the application of the TTMR Act to New Zealand tax agents in these circumstances would be

him as a New Zealand tax agent    the courts in New Zealand have enforced the Trans Tasman arrangements  for example in relation to medical practice  and the Australian courts should also do so    the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal   FCA     Vanstone v Clark   FCAFC    In Beitseen   to which I was also directed by Ms Brennan acting for the Board  the trial judge had made orders directing members of a union to perform and observe the rules of that organisation by treating the respondent as having been validly appointed to the position of secretary in the union  and by treating as null and void a purported resolution of the union that an election be held for that position  The respondent s appointment was for the unexpired term of the previous incumbent in that role  however it was common ground that the unexpired term would expire shortly afterwards  and that an election was in progress to determine who would fill the office for a full term from that time  The appellants sought to appeal the decision at first instance on the basis of issues including whether the respondent was eligible to be appointed to the position pro tem  whether the union could have filled the position by appointment a casual vacancy  and whether the appointment of the respondent had not been effectively revoked by a subsequent meeting  Woodward  Northrop and Ryan JJ held that    in the circumstances there was no real contest between the parties as to the right of the respondent to occupy the position    resolving those questions would be to furnish an advisory opinion which courts traditionally

the requirement that the legal rights of the parties should be in actual controversy as articulated Hole v Insurance Commissioner   As explained by their Honours       On our understanding that requirement entails that any judgment which might be given on the appeal should confirm or modify rights which remain capable in a real and genuine sense of being enjoyed    at     In concluding that it is not appropriate for the Court to continue with this matter  I adopt the comments of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Mayne Nickless Ltd v Transport Workers Union of Australia     FCA     The courts have an obligation to conduct their proceedings  and to deal with an ever increasing workload  with as much expedition as the overriding demands of justice permit  No encouragement should be given  therefore  to the use of scarce judicial time to decide appeals that are essentially moot  There are other litigants with cases pending before the Court for hearing or delivery of judgment and their claims involve the determination of substantial legal rights of practical importance  This is not the situation in this appeal  see and compare Beitseen    In the circumstances I am of the view that  in the exercise of the Court s discretion  the appeal should be dismissed  Accordingly I propose to grant the notice of motion sought by the Board   ORDERS        The notice of motion filed

summarised as follows     There is a clear case for summary dismissal of the appeal on the grounds that there is no actual controversy between the parties as to Mr Aalders  legal or practical right to be registered as a tax agent      At its highest  the appeal involves consideration of one of perhaps multiple alternate bases for his current registration      Even if Mr Aalders were successful in the substantive appeal  the appeal would not provide the appellant with any consequential relief as the Tribunal has already remitted the matter to the Board for reconsideration with directions necessitating the registration of Mr Aalders as a tax agent      Mr Aalders has acknowledged that he has no personal interest in the outcome of the appeal  and in effect he seeks a hypothetical opinion from the Court on the application of the TTMR Act to the registration of tax agents      This is not a matter where  notwithstanding the lack of practical outcomes of the appeal  the appeal would resolve an important issue of public law as was the case in Vanstone v Clark   FCAFC     The submissions of Mr Aalders in response may be summarised as follows     The governments of Australia and New Zealand have put in place a mutual recognition regime as part of the creation of a free trade area      The courts in New Zealand in relation to medical practice have enforced the principles of mutual recognition and he would have expected the Australian judiciary  including the Tribunal  to do the same      Section   of the TTMR Act and the provisions of the Trans Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement  TTMR Arrangement  allow a person in an occupation or profession registered in New Zealand to practise in Australia and vice versa  The Arrangement was ignored as irrelevant by the Tribunal      The position taken by the Board before the Tribunal was a ploy or disguise to attempt to defeat the intent and spirit of the Arrangement and the TTMR Act      The Tribunal failed to give proper consideration to the equivalence of tax agents in Australia and New Zealand      The Tribunal failed to consider for mutual recognition purposes the ability and fitness of Mr Aalders      As a result  tax agents from jurisdictions including New Zealand are discriminated against in Australia      The decision of the Tribunal in relation to TTMR is fundamentally wrong and unjust  and breaches the spirit of the TTMR and the TTMR Arrangement  Unless the precedent is overturned the entire concept of mutual recognition will be  killed off by a bureaucracy unwilling to follow the direction given by the Government     The application by the Board to have Mr Aalders  appeal struck out prejudices every New Zealand educated chartered accountant in public practice  who in terms of the TTMR Act is entitled to practise in Australia and who is afforded educational and qualification equality by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia   The principle has also been applied in the Federal Court in a number of cases  for example Beitseen v Johnson     IR   La Roche v Cormack     FCR   Rocklea Spinning Mills v Anti Dumping Authority     FCR   at   Mayne Nickless
