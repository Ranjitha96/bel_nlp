natural Justice   Mr J M Patel of counsel prepared written submissions on behalf of the Appellant in support of the proceedings before Federal Magistrate Lloyd Jones and the Appellant relied upon those written submissions in support of the grounds of appeal before this Court  In those submissions Mr Patel addresses three grounds of appeal  The first ground is that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error in failing to properly construe and apply a correct understanding of the notion of  persecution  and the elements of a  well founded fear  of persecution for the purposes of Article  A  of the   Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  the Convention  as amended by the   Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees  the Refugees Protocol  for the purposes of s   of the Act citedSJSB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The statutory obligation of the Tribunal upon a reconsideration is to assess the scope and content of the Appellant s claims to determine  on all the material properly before the Tribunal  whether the Tribunal can be affirmatively satisfied that the Appellant holds a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  Notwithstanding that the Tribunal constituted by a Tribunal member other than Mrs Nicholls previously accepted aspects of the version of events asserted by the Appellant  Mrs Nicholls was obliged to discharge the statutory jurisdiction by examining the claims and reaching or failing to reach  the required degree of satisfaction  If not satisfied of the relevant matters  Mrs Nicholls was bound to  refuse to grant the visa   s  b  of the Act   In so approaching the matter  the Tribunal acted correctly and within jurisdiction and in a manner consistent with the observations of their Honours in SJSB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at     per Ryan  Jacobson and Lander JJ  Minister for Immigration
