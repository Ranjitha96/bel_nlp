Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at    By notice of appeal filed on   January   the appellant raises the following unparticularised grounds  that essentially assert that the Federal Magistrate erred  by not finding that the Tribunal erred as alleged in the grounds below           It is not reasonable that the Refugee Review Tribunal did not accept that I am a Falun Gong practitioner while the Tribunal accepts that I have ever observed other persons practice Falun Gong in China            The decision made by the Tribunal is illogical        I believe that my fear of persecution is well founded  At the hearing of the appeal before me the appellant  assisted by an interpreter essentially repeated the content of her grounds of appeal and overall sought to challenge the findings of fact by the Tribunal that she was not nor ever had been a practitioner of Falun Gong  In any event an error of fact does not amount to error of law  Abebe v

although it was accepted that the appellant may have observed other people practising Falun Gong in both China and Australia  the appellant herself was not a Falun Gong practitioner  There is nothing  in my opinion  which is either not reasonable or illogical in this finding  Observing other practitioners of Falun Gong  of itself  says nothing about whether the appellant was or was not herself such

Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn relation to the amended grounds his Honour rejected ground   on the basis that  while the Tribunal did not mention the appellant s claim to have lost her employment at the end of her detention in the key paragraphs under the heading  Findings and Reasons  it had earlier identified the claim as part of the appellant s application to the delegate and noted that the statement containing it had accompanied the appellant s review application  The Tribunal  as he stated was clearly aware of that element of the applicant s claims  and dealt with it as part of a more general conclusion  This approach was in my opinion correct  WAEE v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at
