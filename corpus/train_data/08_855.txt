Kostopoulos v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As noted earlier  the applicant came to have his transitional  permanent  visa by operation of reg     of the Transitional Provisions Regulations  which provided      Subject to regulation    which is not relevant in these proceedings  if  immediately before   September   a non citizen was in Australia as the holder of a permanent entry permit  that entry permit continues in effect on and after   September   as a transitional  permanent  visa that permits the holder to remain indefinitely in Australia   The explanatory statement to the Transitional Provisions Regulations stated that reg   was  designed to ensure that  from   September   all visas and entry permits held immediately before that date  were  converted into one of two transitional visa classes by operation of law   The validity of reg   of the Transitional Provisions Regulations was upheld by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA         CLR   at       The Transitional Provisions Regulations were made pursuant to s   and s   of the   Reform Act  see the discussion in Nystrom at    Relevantly  s   and s   provided        The regulations may provide that  from   September   visas or permits in a specified Principal Act class and held by specified persons immediately before that date are to continue in effect as visas in a specified amended Act class      The regulations may provide that  from   September   specified persons are to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified amended Act class     Paragraph   of the explanatory memorandum to the   Reform Bill provides an explanation as to the anticipated effect of s   and s     The clause  i e  the relevant clause of the Migration Reform Bill   which introduced proposed s   and s   also provides that regulations may continue in force visas or entry permits of specified classes which were held immediately before the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas  Related to this provision  the regulations may also deem specified persons to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified class created after the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas   The import of s   and s   appears to be that the regulations made pursuant to those provisions may differentiate between visas or permits that are deemed to  continue in effect  as at   September   and visas that have been deemed to have been  granted  to a person as at   September    Indeed  and in contradistinction to reg     reg   of the Transitional Provisions Regulations provides that the holders of particular types of visas are deemed to have been granted a transitional  permanent  visa on   September    As reg   states      A non citizen who  immediately before   September   held an old visa of the kind known as     a  an Authority to Return  or    b  a Return Endorsement    is taken  on   September   to have been granted a transitional  permanent  visa permitting the holder     c  to travel to and enter Australia within   years after each departure from Australia  and    d  to remain indefinitely in Australia   An important element in the applicant s case was that the Minister s power to cancel under the then s  A  now s   of the Principal Act was restricted to visas and entry permits that had been  granted  to persons  and not acquired by operation of law  and this manifested a deliberate choice  This proposition is said to be apparent from the temporal proximity between the enactment of the Offences and Undesirable Persons Act and the enactment of the   Reform Act  which as noted earlier  created a distinction between visas that are taken to have been granted and visas that are deemed to continue in effect citedHall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Reference was made to the decision of Finkelstein J in Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   where his Honour observed  at           the power to cancel a visa that is conferred by s   should  in my opinion  be construed to allow the cancellation of a permit to remain in Australia  which by force of the transitional provisions continues in force as a visa  That is  because permission to remain in Australia granted before the Migration Reform Act continues in force as a visa  it may be cancelled as a visa  Any other construction would result in the absurd position that a non citizen who constitutes a danger or threat to the Australian community by reason of his or her past criminal conduct could not be removed from Australia   To similar effect were the observations of Kiefel J in Andary v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   where her Honour said that a transitional  permanent  visa  was liable to cancellation  citedAndary v Minister for

 at   where her Honour said that a transitional  permanent  visa  was liable to cancellation  citedMoore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR   Support for the applicant s contention can be found in the decision in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR   at   where a Full Court observed that the power conferred on the Minister to cancel a visa under s   only applies to visas that have been granted to a person  Where a visa has been granted to a person  s  F  operates so that any other visa held by that person is cancelled  On this basis  where an absorbed person visa is cancelled  a transitional  permanent  visa held by that person is also cancelled  However  the Full Court indicated that this process could not operate in reverse  It will be necessary to say something more about this judgment later in these reasons   The applicant also submitted that he had not  ceased to be an immigrant  prior to   April   and hence has never held an absorbed person visa as contemplated by s   of the Principal Act  If so  it was submitted  the applicant is not the holder of an absorbed person visa and is the holder of only one visa  a transitional  permanent  visa  which cannot be cancelled   The Minister submitted that there is no basis for treating the word  granted  in s   as limiting the cancellation power in the way submitted by the applicant   Granted  in the context of s   encompasses any means by which a person is given or acquires a visa  The word  granted  as it appears in s   should be read as encompassing any means of giving under the law  including giving by statute as well as giving by administrative decision  Indeed  the purpose of the language in question  granted to a person  it was submitted  is to distinguish s   which concerns the cancellation of visas that are already in effect  from s   which concerns a refusal to grant visas on character grounds  For the purposes of s   what is significant is that the person has a visa and not the means by which that visa was acquired   It is necessary to say something more about the Full Court judgment in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  The observations of the Full Court in     of their reasons entail a fairly unequivocal statement that a power to cancel a visa  that has been granted  would not be exercisable in relation to a transitional  permanent  visa because that type of visa had not been  granted  or could not be taken to have been granted  However these observations do not  in my opinion  form part of the ratio of the decision  The observations were made in a passage in which the Full Court was discussing ground one in the appeal  At   the Full Court indicated that two questions arose in the consideration of ground one  The first was whether the appellant could be taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa  which depended on whether he had been absorbed into the Australian community   The second was if he had not obtained an absorbed person visa  had the Minister effectively cancelled his transitional  permanent  visa  At   the Full Court concluded that the appellant had been absorbed into the Australian community well before to April    The Full Court then concluded that the appellant held an absorbed person visa which was taken to have been granted to him  In the result  it was a visa which had been  granted  and one the Minister was empowered to cancel  It does not appear to me that this chain of reasoning necessarily depended on a conclusion that the Minister had no power to cancel a visa which had not been granted   Nonetheless  even though these observations do not form part of the ratio of the decision in Moore   it is necessary for me  as a single judge  to give them significant weight  However  I am firmly convinced that the power to cancel conferred by s   was intended to be exercisable in relation to a transitional  permanent  visa  In this case  the applicant held such a visa because he had been originally granted an entry permit  When s  A was enacted in   the applicant held an entry permit that had been granted  That permit could have been cancelled by exercise of the power conferred by s  A  The removal of the reference to a power to cancel  a valid entry permit that had been granted  occurred at a time when  by the combined effect of legislative amendments and the promulgation of regulations  visas became the sole means of conferring a right to remain lawfully in Australia   It is inconceivable  in my view  that the amendments made in   to s  A were intended to render immune from the power to cancel  an entry permit which had been transmogrified into a transitional  permanent  visa  The power conferred by what was then the renumbered s   was plainly intended to authorise the Minister to cancel whatever visa was held by a person who the Minister thought ought no longer be able to remain in Australia having regard to that person s character  Obviously I am not concerned here with the appropriateness of the underlying policy or the way in which the power has been exercised in this or any other case  However  I have no doubt the power is intended to be exercisable in relation to any visa and the words  that has been granted  were not intended to condition or limit the power  These words remained as the truncated residue of the formulation first appearing in s  A  namely  a valid visa or a valid entry permit that has been granted    In my opinion  the Minister had power to cancel the applicant s transitional  permanent  visa  I order that the period within which the applicant is to file his application be extended  and the application be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy
