the permanent stay applications when they were first made  It was not improved by repetition discussedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer Swisse Securities Limited     ACSR   As already noted  s  A of the Act is in substantially similar terms to those of s   of the Corporations Act    Cth   In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer Swisse Securities Limited     ACSR   at     Palmer J  having reviewed a number of authorities on the construction and operation of s   continued      At the risk of some repetition  I summarise the principles which I draw from the presently applicable authorities      the jurisdiction which the court exercises under  the Corporations Act   s   is a statutory jurisdiction  not the court s traditional equity jurisdiction      Parliament has made it increasingly clear by successive statutory enactments that the court  in exercising its statutory jurisdiction under s     is not to be confined by the considerations which would be applicable if it were exercising its traditional equity jurisdiction      among the considerations which the court must take into account in an application for an injunction under  Corporations Act  s   are the wider issues referred to by Austin J     and by Davies AJ      they may be gathered under the broad question whether the injunction would have some utility or would serve some purpose within the contemplation of the Corporations Act       these considerations are to be taken into account regardless of whether the application is for a permanent injunction under s   or for a interim application under s         where an application under s   is made by ASIC rather than a private litigant the court is more likely to give greater weight to the broad question whether the injunction would serve a purpose within the contemplation of the Corporations Act       where there is an appreciable that is  not fanciful risk of particular future contraventions of the Corporations Act by a defendant  it would serve a purpose within the contemplation of the Corporations Act that the court grant not only a permanent injunction  but  in an appropriate case  an interim injunction restraining such conduct  Section   evinces an intention that the possibly severe consequences and the relatively promptness of proceedings for contempt of court be added to criminal prosecutions as a deterrent to contraventions of the Corporations Act         In my view these principles have application to the construction of s  A of the Act  The principle contained in the penultimate bullet point in the passage quoted in this paragraph has equal force where application is made for a permanent injunction   By s   of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act    Cth  APRA is established  inter alia  for the purpose of regulating bodies in the financial sector in accordance with other laws of the Commonwealth  such as the Banking Act   that provide for prudential regulation  Section  A of the Act is one of many provisions in the Act which enable APRA to take action designed to protect the interests of depositors and to promote the stability of Australia s financial system  Those objectives are to be borne in mind in exercising the discretion which is conferred on the Court by s  A   Mr Siminton has deliberately embarked on a course of conduct which has involved contraventions of the Act  He has established what he calls a  bank  and  with others  has been successful in encouraging a considerable number of people to make deposits in the  bank   They were promised high interest rates  They were told that interest payments would be made in ways which would facilitate evasion of income taxation payment obligations  Some depositors received some of the promised interest payments but then the payments ceased  Others received no interest  Some  who sought repayment of their deposits  were unsuccessful referred toAustralian Independent Distributors Ltd v Winter   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Australian Independent Distributors Ltd v Winter   HCA         CLR   the High Court was called on to determine whether a friendly society was carrying on  the business of banking  contrary to s   of the Act  The Court quoted the passage from the judgment of Isaacs J in Permewan Wright which Rich J had incorporated in his reasons in Melbourne Corporation  The Court treated what Isaacs J had said as constituting a  definition  of the  business of banking   at    The Court continued       If that definition is applied to the present case  as we think it should be  it is apparent that the second of these essential characteristics is absent  The power to lend money conferred on the Society by Rule   was limited to the making of loans to its members to enable them to acquire land or buildings to be used for residential or business and residential purposes and in fact none of the Society s moneys was used for the making of loans for that or any other purpose    The second essential characteristic which was found to be absent was the lending function  The society had not made any loans  For this reason  the Court held that the trial judge had been correct to hold that the society had not carried on the business of banking and had not  therefore  contravened s   of the Act   Counsel for Mr Siminton  relying on what was said by Isaacs J in Permewan Wright and by the Full Court in Winter   submitted that Mr Siminton could not be found to have carried on a banking business because the Terra Nova Cache did not make loans on a regular basis  It is true that the evidence disclosed only one loan  albeit a substantial loan made by the Terra Nova Cache under Mr Siminton s direction  It is to be noted  in this context  that the decision in Winter turned on the fact that the society had not loaned members  funds to anybody  In any event  the Court is empowered  by s  A of the Act  to grant relief where a person is proposing to engage in conduct which would constitute a contravention of s    When addressing meetings  at which he solicited deposits  Mr Siminton told those present that  once the Terra Nova Cache was established  loans could be made to citizens of the Principality of Camside  Point   on the information sheet which was made available at the meetings and in the Principality of Camside s website under the heading  HM Government of Camside Banking Facilities  advised readers that       It is envisaged that the next stage of Terra Nova Cache s development  once deposits are established  profitably traded and fully precious metal backed  that the bank will be offering interest free loans to its depositors owners    Even if no regular practice of making loans had been established prior to APRA commencing this proceeding it is clear that Mr Siminton proposed to offer loans to  citizens  of Camside once the Terra Nova Cache had become established   For these reasons I conclude that Mr Siminton was a person who carried on and was proposing to carry on the business of banking in Australia  He had engaged and was proposing to engage in conduct which constituted or would constitute a contravention of s   of the Act   Section    Section   of the Act makes it an offence for a person who  carries on a financial business  to use the words  bank  or  banking  in relation to such a business  A  financial business  is defined in s  c  to refer to a business that consists of  or includes  the provision of financial services or relates  in whole or part  to the provision of financial services  The term  financial services  is not defined  The words should be accorded their ordinary and natural meaning  They comprehend the provision of services of a financial nature citedAustralian Securities and Investment Commission v Burke   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Subject to hearing the parties I consider that the better course would be to appoint a receiver to deal with the funds which are subject to Gray J s order  This would seem to be an appropriate case for the appointment of a receiver

allow assets to be turned over in the course of business  Where these circumstances exist in combination  and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved  the Court may conclude  as I do in this case  that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected  and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors  referred

that s  xxxi  had no application because it did not involve an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth  much less an acquisition on just terms  The property was placed under the control of the Official Receiver in order to ensure that the pecuniary penalty provisions in s  B could not be rendered nugatory by disposition of property  In Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Cox     ALR

Cassidy   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Save for its first word s  A  is in the same terms as s   of the Corporations Law    Cth   now s   of the Corporations Act    Cth   As the Full Court noted in Medibank Private Limited v Cassidy   FCAFC         FCR   at     provisions of this kind can be traced back to the Chancery Amendment Act    UK    Lord Cairns Act   The purpose of such provisions is expressly to empower a Court to award damages to persons who have suffered as a result of conduct which contravenes legislative requirements whether or not a curial power to grant a mandatory injunction might also support such an order  The exercise of the power is conditioned on the existence of a power to grant an injunction  That power is conferred by s  A  which is a valid provision  In my opinion there is no reason  in principle  to distinguish between the power to grant injunctions and the power to require a respondent to pay damages occasioned by the same conduct which might justify the granting of an injunction  The granting of such relief does not cast the Court in the role of a  collection service  acting on behalf of third parties  It involves a judicial act in aid of a legislative purpose  Sections  A  is valid law of the Commonwealth   At the outset of the trial Mr Siminton sought an order that APRA s application should permanently be stayed or struck out as an abuse of process  No notice of motion seeking such an order had been filed but Mr Siminton had  prior to trial  filed and served a notice of preliminary objections which included a summary of the submissions which he desired to make in support of the strike out application  Counsel appearing for APRA did not object to the application being made or argued in advance of the trial proper   Mr Siminton submitted that the proceeding was an abuse of process because it had been brought for the collateral purpose of seeking information and evidence to substantiate or justify allegations that Mr Siminton had committed criminal offences under ss   and   of the Act  He said that the Court should so conclude because      APRA had failed to accept an offer by Mr Siminton to agree to certain forms of injunction    APRA s statement of claim failed to plead any cause of action for damages    APRA had conceded that it lacked evidence of lending by Mr Siminton and  therefore  that he had engaged in  banking    Of the fact that no charges had been laid against Mr Siminton    Of the alleged paucity of evidence linking Mr Siminton to any alleged breach of s     Of APRA s claim for certain interlocutory orders which Gray J had declined to make    Of the commencement of contempt proceedings against Mr Siminton which were heard before the trial of the present proceeding    Of APRA s attempt to use and rely on discovery  its seeking of particulars of Mr Siminton s defence and its application that directions be made requiring Mr Siminton to file witness statements in advance of trial  and    Of what was said to be the  linking of APRA s release of frozen funds for legal expenses to the provision of information    I take this to be a reference to the terms of order   of the orders made by Gray J on   January   under which Mr Siminton was given liberty to apply on notice in writing to APRA  supported by affidavit evidence of his

Mikasa  NSW  Pty Ltd v Festival Stores   HCA         CLR   Gibbs J dealt with s  AA of the Trade Practices Act      Cth   the forerunner of the present s   of that Act   His Honour said  at      In my opinion s  AA does not confer on the Court a discretion of an arbitrary kind  It appears from the section that the object of granting an injunction is to restrain a person who has already engaged in unlawful practice from again engaging in that practice  To acquire  rather than permit  the Court to grant an injunction once the condition precedent to its grant has been established would deny the Court the power to adapt a remedy of the needs of a case and would lead to an injustice  moreover  an injunction is in its nature a discretionary remedy  Since the discretion is conferred on a court and is to be exercised in proceedings inter partes  it must be concluded  when there is no indication in the Act to the contrary  that it is to be exercised judicially  The existence of the discretion does not alter the conclusion that the power conferred by s  AA is a judicial power  discussedR v Smithers  Ex parte McMillan   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This contention must fail  It is a matter for the Parliament to determine which measures it will adopt in order to secure compliance with legislation which is enacted pursuant to one of the heads of power conferred by s   of the Constitution   Parliament may determine to visit contraventions of an Act with criminal sanctions  It may also provide for civil remedies  It may determine to do both  In R v Smithers  Ex parte McMillan   HCA         CLR   the High Court dealt with a challenge to the validity of provisions of the Customs Act    Cth  which enabled certain office holders to apply to this Court for an order that a person  who had been involved in the importation of narcotic substances  pay a pecuniary penalty to the Commonwealth  The application could be made whether or not the person had been charged or convicted of any offence under the Customs Act   The Customs Act also made importation of such substances a criminal offence  The Court held  at   that     It would be a legitimate exercise of the power  s  i  of the Constitution when read with s  xxxix  and this is conceded to make it an offence to engage in dealing in narcotic goods  being prohibited imports  that have been imported in contravention of the Act and to impose severe penalties in respect of that offence  Similarly it would be a legitimate exercise of the power to make that conduct the occasion for liability to a civil action for penalties of the traditional kind  Section  B  in providing for the imposition of pecuniary penalties of the class provided for in Div    stands in no different position  It penalises dealings in narcotic goods that have been imported in contravention of the Act   In so doing it constitutes a deterrent to importation in breach of the statutory provisions and provides a further sanction with a view to ensuring compliance with the statutory provisions governing importation  Its importance in this respect is that it seeks to deprive the dealing in narcotic goods of the considerable financial rewards which are the chief inducement for importing them into Australia and for dealing in them   Sections   and   of the Act form part of a legislative scheme  protective of members of the public  which regulates the conduct of banking in Australia  Only approved persons may conduct banking businesses  Persons providing other forms of financial services may not adopt the title  bank  and thereby mislead the public as to their status  People may thereby be induced to deposit funds with the  bank   If conduct which contravenes the Act is discovered charges may be laid  The prosecution of criminal charges  however  will do nothing to protect depositors  funds  Nor will a pending trial prevent the defendant continuing to advertise that he or she is conducting a banking business  Section  A fills this void  It enables this Court to grant immediate and long term relief where contraventions of the Act have occurred  are occurring or  it is proposed  should occur  Injunctions may issue restraining persons from engaging in contravening conduct and may require such persons to take remedial action  Such provisions are  in my opinion  incidental to the enforcement of the regulatory regime which falls squarely within the banking power   Acquisition Of Property Other Than On Just Terms  The  freezing order  to which Mr Siminton refers was made by Gray J on   January   under s  A of the Act   There were  in fact  multiple orders  Those orders prevented Mr Siminton from dealing with funds and property held by him including deposits held in the Terra Nova Cache  Mr Siminton argues that  under the order of Gray J  the Commonwealth has acquired his property  namely his money and other assets  He has effectively been deprived of that property while the order remains in force  This  he submits  involved a contravention of s  xxxi  of the Constitution    In Smithers the High Court also upheld the constitutional validity of s  E c i  of the Customs Act which empowered this Court to direct the Official Trustee to take control of specified property of a person if there existed reasonable grounds for the belief that the person had engaged in narcotics dealing and derived benefits therefrom  The Court held that s  xxxi  had no application because it did not involve an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth  much less an acquisition on just terms  The property was placed under the control of the Official Receiver in order to ensure that the pecuniary penalty provisions in s  B could not be rendered nugatory by disposition of property  In Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Cox     ALR   at     Pincus J held that the same reasoning supported the validity of s  E c ii  which empowered the Court to make an order directing the Official Trustee to take control of all of the property of the person involved in narcotic dealings discussedRe Director of Public Prosecutions  Ex parte Lawler   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The words  acquisition of property  in s  xxxi  of the Constitution are not to be read in isolation  In Re Director of Public Prosecutions  Ex parte Lawler   HCA         CLR   at   Deane and Gaudron JJ observed that     T he power conferred by s  xxxi  is one with respect to  acquisition of property on just terms   That phrase must be read in its entirety and  when so read  it indicates that s  xxxi  applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms  It is not concerned with laws in connection with which  just terms  is an inconsistent or incongruous notion  Thus  it is not concerned with the law imposing a fine or penalty  including by way of forfeiture  or a law effecting or authorising seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize  Laws of that kind do not involve acquisitions that permit of just terms and  thus  they are not laws with respect to  acquisition of property  as that expression is used in s  xxxi     In Lawler the Court held that a provision of the Fisheries Management Act    Cth  which empowered a Court  which convicted a person who had engaged in unlicensed commercial fishing in Australian Waters  also to order forfeiture of the boat used to undertake the fishing  The statutory power to order forfeiture was held not to be a law with respect to the acquisition of property within the meaning of s  xxxi  citedR v Kirby  Ex parte Boilermakers Society of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Separation of Powers Point  It will be convenient to deal with the final two arguments advanced by Mr Siminton together  They allege that s  A of the Act confers legislative and executive power on the Court contrary to the implied limitation recognised in R v Kirby  Ex parte Boilermakers Society of Australia   HCA         CLR     As I understood the argument advanced by Mr Siminton it was that s  A of the Act confers very wide powers on the Court  It is said that these powers are wide enough to enable the Court to act as a Royal Commission or Board of Inquiry  to award damages without the assistance of guiding criteria and to act as a surrogate or  collection service  for third persons who may wish to obtain damages from Mr Siminton referred toSterling v Trade Practices Commission     FLR   The hearing of an application  made under s  A of the Act   is not a trial on indictment of any offence against a law of the Commonwealth and  in particular  of an offence against s   of the Act   cf Sterling v Trade Practices Commission     FLR   at    The application does not place Mr Siminton in jeopardy of a conviction for any offence or the imposition of any criminal penalty   Section  A of the Act was inserted in   see Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Act  No       s    Under the former legislation  ss   and   of the Act contained penalty provisions only  The inclusion of s  A was designed to allow APRA  subject to Court approval  to act pre emptively to stop undesirable activities rather than simply acting to impose punishment after the damage had occurred  see Explanatory Memorandum  Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Act  No       Many of its sub sections are drafted in the same or substantially the same terms as provisions to be found in other Commonwealth legislation  Comparisons can be drawn with s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  s  GD of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act    Cth  and s   of the Corporations Law    Cth   The constitutional validity of these equivalent provisions has been upheld by Court decisions spanning many years  Section   of the Trade Practices Act   which corresponds with s  A  was held by Lockhart J to be a valid law of the Commonwealth Parliament in Trade Practices Commission v Sterling     ALR   at      An appeal from his Honour s decision was dealt with by a Full Court  The appellant did not  on appeal  seek to argue that his Honour s decision as to the validity of s   was wrong  It was  however  argued that sub ss   and   of s   which contained provisions equivalent to those to be found in s  A  were invalid  being beyond constitutional power  These submissions were rejected by the Full Court  see Sterling v Trade Practices Commission     FLR   at     referred toThe University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Subject to hearing the parties I consider that the better course would be to appoint a receiver to deal with the funds which are

University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA   at     This case bears many of the features which led Austin J  in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Burke   NSWSC     to appoint a

preserved and protected  and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors  referred toTrade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Limited     FCR   In my view this is a case which requires the granting of injunctions which will restrain Mr Siminton from any repetition of his past misconduct  There is an appreciable risk that  unless restrained  Mr Siminton will resume the course of conduct which caused APRA to make this application  The granting of an injunction is also warranted as a means of marking the Court s disapproval of the flagrant breaches of the Act which had been perpetrated by Mr Siminton  see Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Limited     FCR   at     Mr Siminton should be restrained from      Receiving money from members of the public by way of deposit in the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside    Assuming or using the words  bank   banker  or  banking  or any words or phrases of like import  in relation to his business  and    Advertising  representing or stating that he will carry on banking business   The injunction should also prevent him undertaking such activities through servants or agents  Mr Siminton should also be required to publish and maintain on the first page that any user views on relevant websites  a notice warning them that neither the Terra Nova Cache nor the Principality of Camside are
