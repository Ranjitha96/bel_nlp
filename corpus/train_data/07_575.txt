 Anor   FCA         ALD   Oudyn and Duong v Australian Postal Corporation     AAR    The closest one comes to a finding of the kind raised in question   is in   of the Tribunal s reasons  however  read carefully  what is said there is a long way short of a finding that the applicant s claim for which Comcare accepted liability gave rise to a liability for compensation under s   of the SRC Act  Indeed  the Tribunal made no finding  in express terms  that liability for the adjustment disorder had been accepted specifically under the SRC Act  There is  but only arguably  an implication of such a finding in the Tribunal s reference to Oudyn in the context that the finding that the applicant s claim for his current psychological condition is not compensable under s   and does not override any continuing liability for the accepted condition of adjustment disorder  but that is as far as it goes  It is not  in my view  sufficient to sustain an error of law on the part of the Tribunal of the kind raised in question   approvedCollector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at  As I have already indicated  I also agree with his submission that the essence of the applicant s appeal on this ground is based on the use of the word  progressed  in   of the Tribunal s reasons  However  he further submits that particular words in a decision maker s reasons should not be read in

Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at   citedComcare Australia  Department of Defence  v Madia     AAR  This question is said to be sourced in the ground that having found that the applicant s condition progressed from the earliest accepted  injury  of  adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression  to a delusional paranoid disorder condition  at   of the Tribunal s reasons  the Tribunal should have found that the applicant s subsequent condition formed part of his compensable injury under the   Act  Comcare Australia  Department of Defence  v Madia     AAR    In making its finding that the applicant s condition had progressed  the Tribunal implicitly accepted that the underlying patho physiological condition  which caused the accepted injury and the subsequent condition  had not changed  On this basis it was not a new injury for which liability under s   of the SRC Act had to be established or accepted  My difficulty with this ground is that it seems to be predicated on the proposition that what was said by the Tribunal at   of its reasons  in particular its use of the phrase   The condition had progressed      amounts to a finding that the  adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression led  of itself  to the delusional disorder   In the face of the evidence referred to at   and   of the Tribunal s reasons and the Tribunal s actual findings at   and     of its reasons  I cannot accept that what the Tribunal said at   amounts to such a finding  And if there is no such finding  the ground and its inherent question of law do not arise  Dealing first with evidence        The psychiatrist who first diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a delusional disorder  Dr Brown  considered it was a constitutional condition  He based the diagnosis on a claim by the applicant that he had been injected in the neck by his supervisor at the Gosford DSS in        On the other hand  the applicant s treating psychiatrist  Dr Greenway  linked the applicant s delusional disorder to his treatment at the Gosford DSS      Dr Lambeth  called on behalf of the applicant  also considered the delusional disorder was contributed to by events at the Gosford DSS  He did not think it was related to the applicant s employment at the ATO      It was also clear from the medical evidence that the diagnosis of a delusional disorder was a quite distinct ailment from that of  an adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression   The delusional disorder had its own DSM IV classification and diagnostic criteria citedComcare v Hart     AAR   Comcare v Etheridge   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe Tribunal then considered whether the claim made by the applicant for his current psychological condition was compensable under s   of the SRC Act  It concluded  by reason of the exclusion in the definition of  injury  in subs   of the SRC Act that it  does not include any such disease  injury or aggravation suffered by an employee as a result of     failure by the employee to obtain a promotion  transfer or benefit in connection with his or her employment  and by reason of the construction of that exclusion by a Full Court of this Court in Hart v Comcare   FCAFC         FCR   affirming the first instance judgment of Whitlam J in Comcare v Hart     AAR   in particular at     and   that it was not     At the outset  counsel for Comcare submitted that none of these questions was a question of law  at best  each of the questions involved mixed questions of fact and law and this was not sufficient to support an appeal pursuant to s   of the AAT Act  In this regard  counsel for Comcare referred to what was said by Branson J sitting in a Full Court of this Court in Comcare v Etheridge   FCAFC         FCR   at     with whose reasons Spender J and Nicholson J agreed  namely        The nature of an appeal under s   of the AAT Act was considered in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     AAR   by Stone J and me particularly at      We expressed our approval of the observation made by Gummow J in TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth      ATR   at     that an appeal  on a question of law  is narrower than an appeal that merely involves a question of law  As his Honour pointed out  where an appeal lies  on a question of law  the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law  That is  the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated as required by O   r  b         The legislature  by creating a statutory right of appeal to a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in the narrow terms of s   disclosed an intention to limit the capacity of the Court on an appeal under s   to review factual findings of the Tribunal  An appeal pursuant to s   is thus quite different from an appeal from a judicial body under s   of the Federal Court Act  An appeal under s   is an appeal by way of rehearing  see  Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd     ALR   at      The subject matter of an appeal under s   of the AAT Act is  shorn of the requirement to determine what  if any  entitlement to relief flows from the answer to the question or questions of law  of the same character as the subject matter of a reference of a question of law to the Court made under s   of the AAT Act        In Birdseye Stone J and I also expressed approval of the observation of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corp v Lambroglou     AAR   at   that          If the question  properly analysed  is not a question of law no amount of formulary like  erred in law  or  was open as a matter of law  can make it into a question of law            A mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within the meaning of s   of the AAT Act  Stone J and I observed in Birdseye  at           In our view  O   r   discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the Tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law  It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that  in our view  one should expect to find the links between the question of law  the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal  citedCondell v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlI think Comcare s submission on this ground is correct and that it would not be inappropriate to dismiss the application  I have no doubt that questions     and   are mixed questions of fact and law  my only doubt concerns question    Because I can foresee an argument that it is a question of law  rather than undertake a comparative assessment of the arguments for and against the correctness of that proposition  I propose to deal with all the questions on which the appeal is brought on the basis that they are questions of law  But as Gyles J recently said in Condell v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC   at              that does not convert the appeal into a full appeal or permit findings of mixed fact and law to be made  An appeal on a question of law can only succeed if legal error in the AAT decision is demonstrated  citedDuong v Australian Postal Corporation     AAR  The

SRC Act  that its jurisdiction was limited to reviewing a decision made pursuant to ss   and   of the SRC Act in respect of the cessation  as at   December   of compensation payments for an accepted

Tribunal has no jurisdiction under s   of the AAT Act to make or review a determination under s   of the SRC Act  the parties cannot consent to the Tribunal being vested with such jurisdiction  R v Moodie  Ex parte Mithen     ALR   and Rosillo v Telstra Corporation Ltd     ALD     The applicant contended that this approach was contrary to the evidence and contrary to the principles in Lees   which have not been disturbed by the decision in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR   and which have been followed in Australian Postal Corporation v Mowbray   Anor   FCA         ALD   Oudyn and Duong v Australian Postal Corporation     AAR    Further  according to Comcare  it was unnecessary for this decision to address all of the matters see   of Lees that were necessary to give rise to liability under s   of the SRC Act  The delegate was satisfied that a relevant matter  namely whether the employee had suffered a work related  injury  had not been established  This was sufficient  on the reasoning of the delegate  to deny liability for the delusional disorder  The contention in the applicant s submission that  the first tier decision of the process found that as at   December   the anxiety and depression had progressed to a delusional paranoid disorder  is  according to Comcare  wrong  The decision simply found that as at   December   on the medical evidence  benefits were not payable under ss   and   of the SRC Act for an  adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression  the decision also rejected liability for a work related delusional disorder  On   November   the applicant s solicitors sought review of this decision  The applicant was entitled to do this pursuant to subs   of the SRC Act  Further  under subs   the applicant was required to set out reasons for the request  This the letter did  Although  in the main  the letter pressed the anxiety condition as requiring the continuation of benefits  it also argued that Comcare was liable for the applicant s delusional disorder which had been exacerbated by his employment  This question is said to be sourced in the ground that the Tribunal should have found that  on the proper construction of the scheme of the provisions of the SRC Act  as set out in Lees   that a pre requisite to Comcare making a determination as to whether it had a liability for a delusional paranoid disorder injury of the applicant was the making of a claim by the applicant  pursuant to s   of the SRC Act  for such an injury  The fact that a review decision concerning the applicant s eligibility for compensation payments under ss   and   of the SRC Act took into consideration the applicant s condition at the date of that decision did not give rise to a decision in respect of liability for a condition for which a claim had been made  There is a certain overlap between this ground and the first ground  both go to the question of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider and determine whether the applicant s delusional paranoid disorder was a compensable injury under s   of the SRC Act although the first ground was predicated on the premise  implied if not express  that a claim for such an injury had been made  The present ground raises the anterior issue whether a claim for such an injury had been made  At   of its reasons  the Tribunal acknowledged that the applicant had not made a formal claim after the commencement of the SRC Act  But the Tribunal went on            the applicant  did respond to an enquiry by Comcare after   December       In my view Comcare treated Mr Buhr s complaint as if a formal claim had been lodged after commencement of the  SRC  Act     Accordingly  I consider that the continuing correspondence from Mr Buhr and Comcare s responses and medical investigation of Mr Buhr s claim should be treated as a claim and acceptance of that claim under the  SRC  Act  Comcare conceded that there is no dispute that Lees at   set out what ordinarily will be required of a claim under s   of the SRC Act  In particular  that it be in writing and that it should be supported by a medical certificate  s    However  it observed that Lees did not fully set out the terms of s    In particular  it noted that subs   of the SRC Act also states       Strict compliance with the approved form referred to in subsection   is not required and substantial compliance is sufficient  Comcare further submitted that the Tribunal s conclusion at   is consistent with s   of the SRC Act  That is  notwithstanding the applicant s lack of a formal claim for a delusional disorder  the requirements of the section were  on the facts of this case  substantially complied with by him  Finally  reference was made to the rationale for ss   and   of the SRC Act  namely  to prevent prejudice to Comcare by late notification of events that could give rise to a claim  Comcare has long been aware of the general nature of the applicant s complaints about his work between   August   and   November    Neither the applicant nor Comcare adduced evidence that Comcare had been prejudiced by a claim being made in the way it was  I agree that the Tribunal s finding at   was open on the evidence and that  notwithstanding the lack of a formal claim for a delusional disorder  the requirements of s   were  on the facts of this case  substantially complied with by the applicant  I am therefore of the view that the Tribunal s finding at   does not raise a basis for an appeal on a question of law under s   of the AAT Act  The difficulty I have with this question is that I cannot identify in the Tribunal s reasons where it found the applicant s claim for compensation of   October   for an injury of extreme anxiety and for which the respondent accepted liability on   February   gave rise to liability for compensation under s   of the SRC Act  I do not read   of the Tribunal s reasons  in particular the sentences      In relation to Mr Buhr s psychological disorder a preliminary question arose  The first question was whether Mr Buhr suffered an injury or disease compensable pursuant to s   of the   Act     as being a reference to the applicant s claim for compensation of   October   and for which Comcare accepted liability on   February    These sentences clearly refer to the delusional or paranoid disorder that had disabled him from continuing to work  In any event  nothing in   amounts to a finding of the Tribunal  the paragraph is nothing more than a statement of the issues before the Tribunal  albeit an arguably ambiguous statement approvedMinister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs I have already indicated  I also

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe applicant contended that this approach was contrary to the evidence and contrary to the principles in Lees   which have not been disturbed by the decision in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR   and which have been followed in Australian Postal Corporation v Mowbray   Anor   FCA         ALD   Oudyn and Duong v Australian Postal Corporation     AAR    Finally  Comcare submitted that  on any view  the Tribunal had before it a reviewable decision that presently refused the applicant compensation under ss   and   of the SRC Act for the condition of  adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression   The Tribunal was not simply limited to considering the case within the four corners of a diagnosis that had been accepted previously if it was no longer apt  It was entitled to consider the evidence available to it and assess whether or not liability should be found for another mental condition that had emerged in the ongoing progress of the case  Hannaford   per Heerey J at   and    There is no doubt  in my view  that the first tier decision maker  Ms Failla  in making her determinations of   October   relied on and embraced as reasons for her decision  the  Statement of Reasons  referred to in and accompanying her proposal letter to the applicant of   February    That statement contained the following relevant observations and findings         Dr Brown further opined on the balance of probabilities Mr Buhr s Delusional Disorder is not related to his employment with the Commonwealth  but rather the expression of a constitutional predisposition prior to his employment with the Commonwealth and a progression of that psychological constitution s reaction to ongoing situations as he perceived them  The only connection to his Commonwealth employment is that his delusions are focused on this and he would be sensitive to any perception that he was rejected  considered inferior  was under threat or discriminated against  In terms of fitness for employment Dr Brown was of the opinion that Mr Buhr is not psychologically fit for any employment due to his Delusional Disorder                 In order for compensation to be payable under the SRC Act  it must be established that an employee              i  suffered an injury arising out of  or in the course of  that employment  or    ii  suffered an ailment or the aggravation of any such ailment that was contributed to in a material degree by the employment               The weight of the evidence suggests that Mr Buhr is no longer suffering a condition that arose out of or materially contributed by his Commonwealth employment  The condition Mr Buhr now suffers from is as a result of constitutionally acquired paranoid personality disorder  which has manifested into a Delusional Disorder  Both specialist Dr Brown and Dr Greenway are of the opinion that Mr Buhr suffers from a Delusional Disorder that has been brought about by his own perception regarding events associated with his Commonwealth employment             With regard to the mental condition I note that a number of allegations made regarding the cause of Mr Buhr s mental condition have been refuted or have been unfounded  refer point       and therefore supports the fact that it is his own perception of the events  Examples of these include conspiracy within the Public Service against him  audited by the tax department as a gesture of victimisation  persecuted by denying him a transfer on medical grounds  refused training  Including  as reported to Dr Brown and Dr Greenway  that he was threatened and that the Assistant Manager placed a needle in his arm and injected a material which would cause him to develop cancer             I accept on the basis of the medical doctors and specialist opinion that Mr Buhr may have suffered from this condition  however the  adjustment disorder  that was caused by his Commonwealth employment has now ceased and the condition Mr Buhr now currently suffers from namely  Delusional Disorder  is as a result of a constitutional predisposition                 Based on the evidence above and the requirements of the SRC Act   I propose to determine that Mr Buhr suffered an  adjustment disorder  and a  strained neck  as a result of his Commonwealth employment  However the conditions suffered have since ceased and the condition Mr Buhr now currently suffers from is a  delusional disorder  which is constitutional rendering him totally unfit for employment  In my view  a fair reading of the Statement of Reasons  in particular the passages extracted in   above  would lead one to conclude that Ms Failla  as the first tier decision maker  did determine that Comcare had no liability under s   of the SRC Act for the applicant s current  at that time  injury of delusional paranoid disorder because it was      not related to his employment with the Commonwealth  but rather the expression of a constitutional predisposition prior to his employment by the Commonwealth and a progression of that psychological constitution s reaction to ongoing situations as he perceived them
