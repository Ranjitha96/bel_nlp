cth HCA  html  It was the task of the Tribunal to make findings of fact and no reviewable error is exposed simply because those facts were resolved against the now Appellant  This Court should not go beyond its task of judicial review and trespass into the area of reviewing the merits of the decision as determined by the Tribunal  Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR    Brennan J there observed at     The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository s power  If  in so doing  the court avoids administrative injustice or error  so be it  but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error  The merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant power and  subject to political control  for the repository alone

Desam party but the Tribunal did not show     why it did not accept that the applicant s involvement in the party    In reviewing the approach of the Tribunal to the evidence given by the Appellant  it is of obvious importance to consider the difficult circumstances in which applicants for refugee status are called upon to give an account of their circumstances and to substantiate their claims  Taylor S  Informational Deficiencies Affecting Refugee Status Determinations  Sources and Solutions     U Tas LR    In Guo v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at   Foster J has also helpfully given the following reminder  It is well to remember that self contradictory statements and apparent evasiveness  although of obvious importance  do not necessarily require a conclusion that the witness is being untruthful in those aspects of his or her evidence or  more significantly  that the whole of his or her evidence should be rejected consideredGuy v Repatriation Commission   FCA
