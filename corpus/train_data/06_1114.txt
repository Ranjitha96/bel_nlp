Global Orthopaedic Technology Pty Limited v Orthotech Pty Limited  with Corrigendum dated   October     FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAustralian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton   Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Although Exactech was fully aware no later than   August   that Global s knee was known as an RBK  Global does not contend that Exactech adopted the RBK acronym for the purpose of appropriating to itself any part of Global s trade or reputation  cf Australian Woollen Mills Limited v FS Walton   Co Limited   HCA         CLR   at     The date for determining whether Global has established a reputation in the name RBK is November   when the first Optetrak RBK was implanted in Queensland   By that date Global had taken steps to market its product to a substantial portion of the target market of about   surgeons in Australia  Nevertheless  the evidence of Global s reputation in the name RBK was quite scant  It consisted of seven sources followedBritish Sugar PLC v James Robertson   Sons Ltd   RPC   It follows that I would need to be satisfied to a reasonably high standard that the acronym has acquired a secondary meaning amongst orthopaedic surgeons who carry out total knee replacements  Guide Dogs Owners    Friends  Association Inc v Guide Dog Association of NSW and ACT     IPR   at    The acronym would need to be close to a household word for the product amongst those surgeons  British Sugar PLC v James Robertson   Sons Limited   RPC   at     I have already found that the evidence does not satisfy me that the RBK acronym has become so closely associated with Global s RBK as to be distinctive of that prosthesis  The same finding disposes of the claim that RBK has acquired a secondary meaning   Global s submission that no other prosthetic knee was referred to in Australia by the name RBK does not advance its case  Nor does the dearth of references to that acronym in the literature or on the worldwide web followedButcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Also  whether or not the impugned conduct

 All that needs to be reiterated before turning to the question which arises is the principle that the conduct must be determined by reference to its effect on the hypothetical ordinary or reasonable

However  there are two short answers to this submission  First  the hypothetical reasonable purchaser is a sophisticated and experienced medical practitioner  Second  the checks and balances in the process of ordering and implanting the prosthesis are sufficient to dispel anything more than a fanciful possibility that the purchaser will be misled  cf Nike at     There was no dispute about the first of these propositions  The second was supported by a body of uncontroversial evidence  The evidence as to the checks and balances may be summarised as follows   First  it is plain that the suppliers of knee prostheses market their products to the surgeons who implant prosthetic knees  They do so in face to face meetings so that  as a consequence  the suppliers  representatives develop a personal relationship with the surgeons followedEquity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     IPR   However  even if the acronym RBK is descriptive  its use by another trader may  upon a consideration of all the circumstances  amount to misleading conduct if the acronym has acquired a secondary meaning so as to be distinctive of Global s product  Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     IPR   at     Importantly  Global accepts that whether or not RBK is descriptive  it cannot succeed in these proceedings unless it establishes that the acronym RBK is distinctive of its product  That is the essential issue in these proceedings   In Equity Access   Hill J said at   that the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not black and white  rather  there is a continuum  Thus  if the name RBK is closer along the continuum toward descriptive names  the heavier the onus will be upon Global to establish a secondary meaning  Also  small differences in other names will usually be adequate to avoid confusion  Hornsby Building at   Equity Access at     Moreover  it seems to me that the acronym RBK  as used in the target market of orthopaedic surgeons  is  at very least a long way toward the descriptive end of the continuum to which Hill J referred in Equity Access  I make that finding based upon the practice of using acronyms in the medical profession and upon the basis of the evidence of Drs Morris  Caldwell and Morgan as to their recognition of the RBK label   At most  the position seems to me to be analogous to that which was described as temporary and commercially irrelevant confusion by Lockhart J in Lumley Life Limited v  OOF of Victoria Friendly Society     IPR   at      This does not constitute misleading conduct  see also Equity Access at   followedGuide Dog Owners    Friends  Association Inc v Guide Dog Association of NSW and ACT     IPR  followedHornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is well established that  ordinarily  the use of a descriptive trade name ensures that it is not distinctive of a business and that its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public  Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre

is misleading or deceptive  or likely to be so  depends on the circumstances in which it is made  not on what might happen at a future point of time  Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited v Cassidy   FCAFC         ALR   at      I do not consider those observations to be in point  The procedures to which I have referred in the hospital ordering and implanting process are concerned with the detection of errors rather than the correction of misleading or deceptive conduct followedParkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases
