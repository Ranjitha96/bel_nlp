SZGQN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedApplicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  By further amended application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court the appellant asserted that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error as it  in summary         Denied the appellant procedural fairness by failing to invoke its power under s   to conduct any investigation in respect of the documents furnished by the appellant and upon which it placed no weight  The documents relevant to this submission were police and Court documents  and letters of support provided to the Tribunal post hearing  In relation to this submission the appellant relied on the decision of the Full Court in Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     where the Full Court found that  where a Tribunal found documents to be part of an elaborate fraud  but that the genuineness of documents could have been established by prompt investigation and there was no impediment to such an inquiry  a failure by the Tribunal to exercise the power under s  d  was a denial by the Tribunal to conduct a fair proceeding  Counsel for the appellant contended in this case that there was an obvious need to make further inquiry  that no impediment existed to such an inquiry  that the concerns of the Tribunal could have been readily resolved  and that to do so otherwise was a denial of procedural fairness in accordance with the principles espoused in Applicant M    FCAFC         Did not provide the applicant  in accordance with s  A Migration Act    Cth  the particulars of information the Tribunal considered was the reason or part of the reason for affirming the delegate s decision   Section  d    upon which the appellant relied in relation to the first ground  reads as follows      For the purpose of the review of a decision  the Tribunal may                 d  require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation  or any medical examination  that the Tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review  and to give to the Tribunal a report of that investigation or examination   Emmett FM noted that  since Applicant M    FCAFC     the Act had been amended to include s  B  Section  B is in Pt   Div   of the Act  and reads      This Division is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with     Sections       and   and Division  A  in so far as they relate to this Division  are taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters they deal with   Her Honour noted that  as a result of the enactment of s  B   common law rules as to natural justice do not apply in relation to matters heard under the Act  Accordingly  it was not open to the appellant to find any jurisdictional error in the case before the Court on a denial of procedural fairness arising out of a breach of s  d    Further in relation to this ground  the appellant submitted that a failure to exercise discretion under s  d  was a failure to comply with s   and a failure to act in accordance with s    The Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal explored concerns about police reports in a cogent manner and in the circumstances reasons to place no weight on documents were reasonable and not  slight   In relation to letters provided post hearing her Honour found that where letters departed from the assertions of the appellant the Tribunal s preference of the evidence of the applicant was an evaluation by the Tribunal of the evidence before it  It was open to the Tribunal to come to the findings and conclusions it did  There was no need for Tribunal to consider whether to exercise power under s  d   The Federal Magistrate was far from being persuaded that a breach of s  d  amounts to jurisdictional error or that the Tribunal committed a breach of s   or s     In relation to the second ground  namely the alleged breach of s  A   Counsel submitted that the Tribunal had regard to matters stated by the appellant in his protection visa application without giving written notice to the appellant of that information inviting his comment  Emmett FM said that not every piece of information that is a part of the decision is captured by s  A only that information that is part of the reason for affirming the decision under review  In her Honour s view  it was clear that any inconsistency in the claims in the protection visa application with the appellant s claims before the Tribunal played no part in the reasons why the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was falsely charged with a killing of a person in Bangladesh  or that he was assaulted by the BNP  Her Honour said the Tribunal stated the reasons for its decision  and they did not include the information identified by the appellant  Further  the only information to which the Tribunal had regard was evidence and material given by the appellant to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review  which is excluded from the obligations of s  A by operation of s  A b    Accordingly  her Honour was of the view that she had no jurisdiction to interfere with the decision of the Tribunal  and dismissed the appellant s application   By notice of appeal to this Court filed   October   the appellant raised similar grounds as those which were raised before her Honour         The Tribunal acted in breach of s  A by not providing the appellant with particulars of information which was the reason or part of the reason for the decision of the Tribunal  in particular in relation to question   of the protection visa  whether the appellant had ever been charged with a criminal offence  referred to by the Tribunal at CB     and which was used to bolster its conclusion that the appellant did not face false charges and did not fear persecution at CB     and          The Tribunal failed to discharge its duty in accordance with s   of the Act and failed to act in accordance with substantial justice and the merits of the case  in accordance with s   of the Act   The submissions of the appellant were in terms however of error by her Honour as to her findings in relation to these grounds   This ground of appeal is again substantially a restatement of the first ground of review before her Honour  in relation to which her Honour found against the appellant  In summary  the appellant submits that        her Honour erred in finding that  it is not open to the Applicant to find any jurisdictional error in the case before this Court on a denial of procedural fairness arising out of a breach of s  d  by reason of the introduction of s  B into the Act    her Honour s application of the Full Court s majority decision in

Court s attention to SZERH v MIC   FCA   at       the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by not seeking to exercise its powers under s  d  of the Act to require the Secretary to investigate the veracity of letters produced from various politicians which supported the claims of the appellant  where the need for such confirmation was  obvious  and where no impediments in terms of the addressee

Allsop J in SZEEU   FCR at   consideredSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first ground of appeal substantially restates the second ground of review before Emmett FM  Before me  the appellant submits that her Honour erred in finding the obligations under s  A  were not enlivened  Dr Azzi for the appellant submitted in summary         Emmett FM erred in finding that inconsistency as between the claims in the visa application and the appellant s claims before the Tribunal played no part in the reasoning of the Tribunal      Emmett FM erred in finding that the information was caught by the exclusion in s  A b         The Tribunal noted that the appellant claimed in his visa application that he has  never been charged with any offence that was currently awaiting legal action   However the appellant did not give his original protection visa application to the Tribunal  rather it was given to the Tribunal by the Department pursuant to s          The appellant s evidence at question   of the visa application was not adopted by the appellant at the hearing before the Tribunal  and needed to be adopted by the appellant before being deemed to have been given to the Tribunal by the appellant  NBKT v MIMA   FCAFC         The fact that the Tribunal expressly referred to the information in the visa application indicated that the information was sufficiently important to warrant specific mention  SZEEU v MIMA   FCAFC         FCR   at        The Tribunal also treated the information in the visa application as supportive of its conclusion that the appellant had not been charged with a killing of a person in Bangladesh  NBKS v MIMA   FCAFC   at      Under s  A  the Tribunal must give

in SZEEU   FCR at   however    One always needs to analyse and interpret the reasons of the Tribunal in order to understand the reason for the ultimate reason or conclusion of the lack of satisfaction of the existence of protection obligations  Merely because something is contained in the text of the reasons of the Tribunal which involves  information  does not conclude the question whether it was  and  in the relevant sense  would be  a part of the reason for affirming the decision  The whole of the written reasons must be analysed and interpreted in their context to assess why it was that the Tribunal acted as it did  and so  in the relevant sense  to assess what would be  prior to making the decision  the reason or a part of the reason   Having thus ascertained the reason or reasons  if there be more than one  why the Tribunal was not relevantly satisfied  any information that was  and thus  in the relevant sense  would be  a part of the reasoning process to explain such reason engages the operation of s  A   without any additional requirement    that the relative importance of the information to the reasoning process be assessed to form a judgment as to whether fairness requires the engagement of s  A   In SZEEU   FCR at   where an issue of inconsistency of prior statement arose  Allsop J also observed    If the Tribunal considers that inconsistency relevant to the assessment of the claims  it may be that the information would be part of the reason  If a Tribunal says that it does not believe an applicant for reasons that can be seen to include the fact that one thing was said in the prior statement and another at the hearing  or the fact that if what is now being asserted at the hearing is true it would have been in the prior statement in that form  the information would be part of the reason  The information is the knowledge imparted to the Tribunal of a prior statement in a particular form  The significance given to it by considering it in the light of evidence is the product of mental processes  The significance and those mental processes are not information  but rather  are why the information is relevant for s  A b    In the context of this ground of appeal  the following issues in the Reasons for Decision of the Tribunal are relevant        the Tribunal considered the details in his original application  including that false charges existed against him  but the Tribunal noted that elsewhere in his application  he said that he had never been convicted of a crime or offence and that he had never been charged with any offence that was currently awaiting legal action  see question   on Pt B of the application form    the Tribunal noted that on   April   the appellant had produced to the Tribunal  copies of what purport to be the following documents            o a letter from a lawyer dated   December   stating that a criminal case has been lodged against the Applicant  that a warrant has been issued for his arrest  that if he is arrested he will be put in gaol for a long time  that  y our enemy party worker s  sic  are trying to doom your life  and that in the circumstances his life will not be safe in Bangladesh  o an  Ejahar   petition for filing a case  submitted by a Sub Inspector of Police on   September   stating that he was on duty at Joypara College Road when a disturbance took place between the Awami League and the BNP in connection with the election in which a man named Salim Bhyan  sic  Senior Vice President of Dohar Thana BNP  was killed  The deposition names the Applicant  identified as Vice President of the Dohar Thana Juba League  as one of those involved  o a First Information Report  the initial claim or complaint which is the basis of an investigation  made by the same Sub Inspector on the same date in relation to the same incident  o a warrant issued by a magistrate in Dohar on   January   for the arrest of the applicant in relation to the same case  o an order for the attachment of the movable property of the Applicant issued by a magistrate in Dohar on the same date in relation to the same case  o a memorandum submitted by a Sub Inspector of Police reporting the execution of the order on   January   which states  somewhat curiously  that  a ll members of the accused were absconding  o an order sheet purporting to record orders made by a magistrate in Dohar in relation to the above case which somewhat curiously refers to  the convicted accused  o a  Charge Sheet  dated   July   in relation to the same case repeating the content of the Ejahar referred to above  o a Post Mortem Report dated   September   in relation to Salim Bhuyan  sic  identified as Vice President of the BNP of Dohar PS  Police Station  stating that the deceased suffered a stab wound in his left upper chest               the Tribunal also noted that the applicant produced an undated letter faxed to him from Bangladesh  purporting to be from Md Mahbubur Rahman  General Secretary  Bangladesh Awami League  Dhaka Zila Unit  certifying that the Applicant is an activist of the Jubo League and stating that the BNP and Jamaat e Islami took powering   through a rigged election    and that as part of this the Applicant has been implicated in concocted manslaughter cases    the Tribunal said that the appellant had told the Tribunal that  so far as he was aware  all the answers in his original application were correct and complete    the Tribunal stated  The Applicant said that the charge against him in relation to the killing of the BNP supporter on   September   was still pending  I asked him why he had said in his original application that he had never been charged with any offence that was currently awaiting legal action  The Applicant said that he had not been guilty of the offence  I noted that the question asked whether he had been charged with any offence  The Applicant said that when he had made his original application he had not had the details of the charges against him  He said that it had only been after he had come to Australia that he had obtained these details  I noted that the Applicant had been living at his home in Joypara until July    The Applicant said that he could only have obtained the details of the charges against him by going to the court or to the police station and then he would have been arrested    the Tribunal said  I put to the Applicant that it was a little difficult for me to accept that  if the police had wanted to arrest him  they would not have been able to do so before July    The Applicant said that it was true that the police had wanted to arrest him but he had been very fortunate    The Tribunal said that it put to the applicant that  the information available to the Tribunal indicated that forged or fraudulently obtained documents were readily available in Bangladesh  The police would work in collusion with applicants for refugee status in supplying bogus papers     The Applicant said that he did not reject this information but at the same time you would get fraudulent documents in any country in the world  In relation to the alleged false charges against the appellant  the Tribunal found  in summary        it preferred the appellant s evidence to what was said in the letters to the extent of any inconsistency    it did not accept that the appellant had in fact been charged in relation to the killing of Salim Bhuyan because            o he  continued to live in his home town  Joypara  sometimes staying at relatives  or friends  houses  until July   and I found his evidence with regard to how he managed to evade arrest unconvincing  o although  the Applicant said that when they had come to his home to arrest him he had just run out by the back door and that he had been very fortunate  the Tribunal did not accept that the police would not have been able to arrest him before July   if they had wanted to  o the appellant stayed in Bangladesh for a further two years after July   o the appellant s conduct in working for a company which was his party leaders  organisation did not suggest that he was in fear of being arrested  o despite the appellant s fear of being arrested he applied through a broker for a passport in what he said was his true identity  and the passport was issued in June   o although  as the Applicants said there must be some genuine documents in Bangladesh     I do not accept that he has been charged with the killing of Salim Bhuyan  citedSZERH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal
