Deangrove Pty Limited  Receivers and Managers Appointed  v Buckby   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedArtistic Builders Pty Ltd v Elliott   Tuthill  Mortgages  Pty Ltd     BPR   In forming a judgment as to whether a receiver took all reasonable care as required by s  A   it is necessary to have regard to the sale process adopted by the receiver  The issue to be determined is whether that process was not one where all reasonable care was taken to sell the property for its market value  whatever that value was  or alternatively for the best price reasonably obtainable   Artistic Builders Pty Ltd v Elliott   Tuthill  Mortgages  Pty Ltd     BPR   at     The respondents contended that s  A requires care to be taken in relation to the price at which any sale of property of a corporation is in fact made and imposes no obligation of care in relation to potential sales not made  On this basis they argued that s  A had no relevance to the letter dated   May   by which IHL s offer to purchase the   units was rejected citedExpo International Pty Ltd  Receivers and Managers Appointed   In Liq  v Chant     NSWLR   The relevant authorities indicate that the

liability for the traditional test when determining whether a receiver or mortgagee has breached its general law duty in the exercise of a power of sale  However  the findings of fact made by me in this matter render it unnecessary for me to express a concluded view on this question   As Dodds Streeton J observed in Florgale Uniforms Pty Ltd v Orders at      A breach of s  A is not established merely because market value  where it exists  or the best price reasonably obtainable is not achieved  Rather  a breach of s  A requires  in terms  a failure by the receiver to take all reasonable care to sell the property for not less than market value or the best price that is reasonably obtainable having regard to the circumstances existing when the property is sold  citedForsyth v Blundell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A further aspect of Deangrove s complaint regarding the   May   letter is that Mr Buckby acted prematurely in rejecting IHL s offer outright on   May   given the state of negotiations with Culley and Valemed  As the respondents did not hold a contract signed by Culley or Valemed for the purchase of the   units  it can be seen  with the benefit of hindsight  that a more cautious course of action might have been for Mr Buckby to avoid rejection of the IHL offer while letting IHL know that other parties were expressing interest in purchasing the units on terms more favourable to Deangrove  However  Mr Buckby is not to be criticised for seeking to bring IHL and Culley into competition as potential purchasers  see Forsyth v Blundell   HCA         CLR   per Mason J at     I accept the evidence of Mr Buckby that as at   May   he remained interested in negotiating with IHL in respect of the   units  albeit that he doubted IHL s capacity to complete  and did not intend to reject the possibility of further dealing with IHL  I further accept Mr Buckby s evidence that the purpose behind the letter dated   May   was to encourage IHL to lift its offer for the   units and that he hoped IHL would come back with an offer which matched the superior Culley offer  As Deangrove itself stressed  IHL apparently had good reason to be interested in purchasing the   units  it had effectively paid a deposit on the units by causing Islands to allot       shares to a nominee of Deangrove  Additionally  it had paid significant amounts by way of interest to the Bank  I therefore accept that Mr Buckby had reasonable grounds for believing  as I find that he did  that if IHL genuinely wished to purchase the   units it would respond to the letter of   May   with a counter offer   In addition to their submissions on each aspect of Deangrove s complaint  the respondents contended that they are entitled to rely on the business judgment rule in s   of the Act  It is not necessary for me to express a concluded view on whether the rule in s   has an application in respect of the duty imposed by s  A  Deangrove placed reliance on s   as well as on s  A  I find that in authorising the sending of the letter of   May   Mr Buckby made a business judgment within the meaning of s   of the Act  I am satisfied that  within the meaning of s     he     a  made the judgment in good faith for the proper purpose of seeking to maximise the amount to be received by Deangrove on the sale of the units   b  did not have a personal interest in the subject matter of the judgment   c  informed himself about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent that he reasonably believed to be appropriate  and  d  rationally believed that the judgment was in the best interests of Deangrove consideredGE Capital Australia v Davis   NSWSC         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  I am inclined to

v Davis   NSWSC         FLR   and approved in Ultimate Property Group Pty Ltd v Lord   NSWSC         NSWLR   and Florgale Uniforms Pty Ltd v Orders   VSC         ACSR   that the effect of s  A is to substitute a statutory test of liability for the traditional test when determining whether a receiver or mortgagee has breached its general law duty in the exercise of a power of sale  However  the findings of fact made by me in this matter render it unnecessary for me to express a concluded view on this question   I am inclined to doubt that the above contention reflects a proper reading of s  A  The opening words of the section suggest that the section is concerned generally with the duty of a controller when exercising a power of sale in respect of property of a corporation  A controller will commonly act in the exercise of a power of sale well ahead of any actual sale of property and his or her conduct at that time may affect the price ultimately achieved for that property  Nonetheless  as Young CJ in Eq observed in Ultimate Property Group Pty Ltd v Lord at      unless it can be demonstrated     that the property in fact sold for under the market price  it is merely a case of injuria sine damnum  ie injury without damage    However  as I did not hear full argument on the proper construction of s  A of the Act  I prefer to express no concluded view on the respondents  submissions  For the reasons set out below  assuming the applicability of s  A to Mr Buckby s conduct in authorising the sending of the letter of   May   I am not satisfied that any breach of the section by the respondents has been established   As is mentioned in   above  Deangrove s case against the respondents was refined during the course of the hearing to an allegation concerning the sending by the respondents  solicitor  on Mr Buckby s instructions  of the   May   letter  see   above   Deangrove alleged that Mr Buckby s conduct in authorising sending of the letter of   May   gave rise to a breach of the respondents  duties for a number of reasons
