  FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The nature of the Australian GST regime was explained in an early article by Professors G S Cooper and R J Vann   Implementing the Goods and Services Tax      Syd L Rev   and also by Hill J  with whom Stone and Allsop JJ agreed  in HP Mercantile Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR     HP Mercantile  at      I discuss each of these is turn   I recognise  as the parties pointed out  that the Act has been amended in various respects since the publication of this article  However  the article is useful in explaining in general terms some of the concepts in the legislation   Professors Cooper and Vann give the following description and illustration of the GST regime of tax and credits  at     The operation of the invoice based credit system is usually demonstrated by a simple numerical example  like that in Table   below  with three suppliers in a distribution chain  say a manufacturer  a wholesaler and a retailer   Supplier   supplies  sells  to supplier   for   before GST on which GST of   at a   per cent rate is charged  Assuming that the original supplier does not purchase inputs on which GST has been paid  which  even allowing that employee labour is untaxed  is more than a little improbable in the real world  there are no GST credits on the inputs used to make this supply  and so supplier   remits its net tax liability of    Supplier   then sells for   before GST and pays GST of   on the sale  Because supplier   purchased from supplier   and paid   including   GST for these inputs  there is a credit of   allowed against the output tax liability  which leaves a net tax payable by supplier   of    Similarly  for supplier   selling at   the GST on the sale is   and there is a GST credit of   relating to the purchase of inputs from supplier    When supplier   sells to a consumer  the price of   will include   of GST but the consumer is unable to claim tax credits and effectively bears the   GST out of the total purchase price of    Table       Manufacturer Supplier   Wholesaler Supplier   Retailer Supplier     Sale price before tax         Sale price after tax         GST on sale         GST credit on inputs         Net tax payable       If this were all that the GST involved  it would be a relatively simple tax to operate  although requiring considerable record keeping by the suppliers  As with any tax  however  there are many complications   Both parties called in aid certain passages from the judgment of Hill J in HP Mercantile   In that case  HP Mercantile Pty Ltd  the Trustee  was the trustee of The Recoveries Trust  the Trust   As trustee  the Trustee carried on an  enterprise   A question arose whether the Trustee should acquire a series of debts at a price which apparently was less than their face value  The Trustee paid for professional advice as to whether it should do so  due diligence services   Later  after it had acquired the debts  it paid for professional services connected with the recovery of them  debt collection services   The Trustee paid GST that was included in the amounts that it paid for both of the services mentioned  and claimed input tax credits in respect of that GST   The Commissioner denied the full input credits claimed by the Trustee  The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was of the view that the Commissioner s assessments were correct so far as they disallowed the full input tax credits for the amounts paid in connection with the debt collection services   The Trustee appealed to the Full Court from the Tribunal s decision so far as it related to the disallowance of the full input tax credits for the debt collection services   In the course of his Honour s discussion of the statutory scheme and the relevant provisions of the Act  Hill J noted that the Australian GST is a value added tax  the genus of which is that there is ordinarily no cascading of tax and the tax payable by each supplier in a chain is only upon the value added by that supplier  at    His Honour stated in relation to financial supplies  at       In terms of GST theory  it is generally accepted that there are certain kinds of activities where the basic system of output tax on supplies and input tax credits on acquisitions will not lead to taxation on the value added by each supplier in the chain  The most important example is said to be financial transactions of financial institutions such as  but not confined to  banks  because they constantly borrow and lend and turn over money in a way that amounts  such as interest charged  will not represent the real value added by the financial institutions  Indeed  as the explanatory memorandum distributed with the Bill which  as amended  later became the GST Act  the EM  says in Chapter   at      there is no readily agreed identifiable value for supplies consumed by customers of financial services   In such a case  it is the margin or imputed margin that is the real economic subject of the supply  There are other examples where this may be the case  one of which is the leasing of  or other dealings with  residential property  not being new residential property     By way of what may be seen as a compromise for the difficulties of applying the normal system of value added taxation to financial supplies and other difficult cases  value added taxation design has created a form of supply which is referred to in Australia as an input taxed supply but which  in international value added tax parlance  is referred to as an  exempt supply   An input taxed or exempt supply  and financial supplies made by financial institutions will be the main example  will not  generally speaking  attract output tax  but the entity which makes financial supplies will  likewise  not obtain an input tax credit for the tax payable on acquisitions it makes in the course of its enterprise of making input taxed supplies       At   Hill J observed that it was  perhaps  not unremarkable  that s     of the Act bears  in its structure  some similarity to the general business deduction provisions of the Australian income tax law  ie  s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  and s     of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   His Honour noted that in both the GST provision and the income tax provisions it is necessary first to satisfy a positive test  and that apportionment is called for where the positive test is only partly satisfied  In both cases also there are negative tests which exclude the allowance of a credit in the GST context or the allowance of a deduction in the income tax context   His Honour discussed at length  at  ff  the relationship required by s     a  between the acquisition and the making of the supplies that would be input taxed  The parties before the Full Court appeared to accept that the relationship had to be  real  and  substantial  and not  trivial   at     Since the relationship between both the due diligence services and the debt collection services on the one hand and the purchase of the debts on the other was direct  there was no question of an indirect relationship as there is in the present case  However  Hill J made the following pertinent observations relevant to the expression  relates to   at          It was common ground that the words  relates to  are wide words signifying some connection between two subject matters  The connection or association signified by the words may be direct or indirect  substantial or real  It must be relevant and usually a remote connection would not suffice  The sufficiency of the connection or association will be a matter for judgment which will depend  among other things  upon the subject matter of the enquiry  the legislative history  and the facts of the case  Put simply  the degree of relationship implied by the necessity to find a relationship will depend upon the context in which the words are found  So much appears from the various cases referred to by the Tribunal when discussing the meaning of these words        That the relationship contemplated here might be indirect follows  probably from s      which provides that an acquisition will not be treated as relating to supplies that are input taxed where the acquisition relates to making a financial supply which consists of a borrowing and the borrowing relates to the taxpayer making supplies that are not input taxed  Hence  input tax credits will not be disallowed if the acquisition which gives rise to them relates to the taxpayer making a borrowing but the borrowing is used by the taxpayer in making taxable or GST free supplies  In other words  s      would appear to contemplate that an acquisition having an indirect connection with a financial supply would otherwise  fall  within s     a     It follows  perhaps more clearly  as well from the requirement of apportionment to be found in the words  to the extent that  which indicate that an acquisition may relate to the making of supplies that are input taxed as well as supplies that are taxable  as would be the case with undifferentiated general overhead outgoings of an entity making both input taxed and taxable supplies  cf  Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at        It might be said  as indeed it is by the Trustee  that where the legislature intended to refer to an indirect connection in the GST Act  it did so  This can be seen for example in ss     and  a  as well as s    A   With respect  the mere fact that a particular subsection refers to relationships that are direct or indirect does not necessarily reveal that uses of the word  relation  in other subsections will be restricted to direct relationships  Whether that is the case will depend upon context  Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       I think that my construction is consistent with the policy underlying behind the input taxed supply provisions  see   above and the comments of Hill J set out at   above   It seems to me that by deeming an actual acquisition of an interest mentioned in subreg   or   of reg       to be a financial supply and defining consideration so widely in s     the legislature intended to catch an investment of the present kind  In acquiring the units  NMLA added nothing of value on which GST could be assessed   I note in passing that in HP Mercantile   which concerned an acquisition of a debt as part of a factoring arrangement  see  ff above  it seems to have been assumed by the parties and by the Court that the amount paid for the acquisition of the debts was consideration for the purposes of reg      a i   although  as AXA points out  the consideration was apparently less than the face value of the debts and so  value  can also be seen to have passed to the deemed supplier  the actual acquirer  of those debts          AXA s subset argument  AXA also argues that input taxed supplies and GST free supplies are subsets of taxable supplies  Accordingly  to be an input taxed supply  a supply must first satisfy the Act s definition of  taxable supply   The Commissioner disagrees and submits that input taxed supplies  GST free supplies and taxable supplies are three separate categories of supply   I set out s        s definition of  taxable supply  at   above  The proviso at the end of that section  beginning  However       does not by its terms require that each of the categories  GST free supply  and  input taxed supply  lie wholly within the category of  taxable supply   The proviso merely acknowledges the possibility that some taxable supplies may to some extent be GST free supplies and or input taxed supplies distinguishedVisy Paper Pty Ltd v Australian Competition
