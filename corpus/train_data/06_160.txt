Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Limited   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAinsworth v Walmsley     Eq   When considering proprietorship it is important to remember that there is no proprietorship in a mark per se  Under the common law  property in a trade mark is     the right to the exclusive use of some mark  name or symbol in connection with a particular manufacture or vendible commodity  Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Couch Co Ltd     De G J   S      See also Ainsworth v Walmsley     Eq      This Court has taken upon itself to protect a man in the use of a certain trade mark as applied to a particular description of article   The position is no different under the Trade Marks Act   The effect of the current statute  which is substantially similar to earlier legislation  is that a trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods or services specified in Schedule   to the Trade Marks Regulations    Cth  Trade Marks Act   ss       in combination with Trade Mark Regulations  reg         Sch   appliedArkwright v Newbold     Ch D   This was much less information about Strandbags Group s activities than was actually known to Colorado Group  Partly for that reason it is said that Mr Williams  statement was misleading  and did in fact mislead the Registrar  The statement is said to have been misleading in the following respects  and here I quote from Strandbags Group s submissions   a  at least  as to the   status of the Respondent s uses  and or  b  very possibly  so as to think that there was some relationship between the trade mark applicant and the Colorado Bag Co   As to  b  it is not being alleged that what was said was untrue  a direct misrepresentation  but  rather  that there was an implied or inferred representation to the effect that all that was known about Colorado Bag Co was being disclosed  Further  this is not a case of omission because an omission  if there be any  must render an actual statement false for it to be a misrepresentation  Arkwright v Newbold     Ch D      I propose to proceed on that view citedBarnsley Brewery Co Ltd v RBNB   FSR   Moving to the merits  I will begin by stating two principles  The first is so elementary that it hardly needs stating  The principle is this  Statute and vicarious liability apart  A cannot bring an action against B to recover damages or secure other relief for an injury done by C  The second principle is that the relevant time for determining whether there has been a passing off is the date on which the impugned conduct commenced   Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Ltd   RPC   J C Penney Company Inc v Penneys Ltd   FSR   or when the passing off was first threatened   Barnsley Brewery Co Ltd v RBNB   FSR   whichever is the earlier  The combined effect of the two principles is that the time at which it is necessary to assess Colorado Group s claim in passing off is   September    That is the day on which Strandbags Group completed the purchase of the Edgarlodge business and commenced its use of the  Colorado  mark  The earlier activities of Edgarlodge cannot be the basis for relief against Strandbags discussedBP plc v Woolworths Ltd     IPR   Having got these preliminary points out of the way  I can now return to the first question  As I have said  it is not in dispute that Colorado Group used the word  Colorado  in combination with the  simple mountain motif  on backpacks and shoes before the word  Colorado  was used by Edgarlodge  Speaking generally  however  a person who is the proprietor of a combination mark is not the proprietor for trade mark purposes of the marks comprising each separate component  In re J B Palmer s Trade Mark     Ch D   In re Royal Baking Powder Co   WN   Richards v Butcher     Ch    But there may be exceptions to the general rule  In BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     IPR   I was required to consider whether it was possible to dissect a mark that was made up of several components and obtain trade mark registration of only one component  I said  at     that it could be done  provided the component for which registration is sought  creates an impression which is totally separate from the other s  and is distinctive  that is it performs the trade mark function of identifying the source of the goods and services to customers   While I have heard no evidence on the point  my impression here is that each component  or at least the word  serves that function  On this basis  then  Colorado Group could be regarded as the first user of the  Colorado  mark appliedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Ltd   RPC   Moving to the merits  I will begin by stating two principles  The first is so elementary that it hardly needs stating  The

au au cases cth HCA  html  The next ground of attack against the registration of the trade mark is that it was not distinctive of Colorado Group s goods  The point arises in the following way  Generally  a word  name or device  or any other designation that may be a  sign  for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act   can only be distinctive of a person s goods or services if it is  inherently adapted to distinguish  those goods or services or  if it is not inherently distinctive  if it has become distinctive by use  that is if it has acquired a secondary meaning  A designation that is merely descriptive of the character of the goods or of their geographic origin or location cannot be inherently distinctive  At least in the case of a geographic description  there is necessarily great difficulty in proving that by reason of use or other circumstances  the designation  does in fact distinguish his goods  Clark Equipment Co v Registrar of Trade Marks   HCA         CLR     per

Vennootschap v J Townend   Sons  Hull  Ltd   AC   This brings me to the passing off claim  There is no dispute about the elements of the cause of action  There is a very useful summary of the five elements by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v J Townend   Sons  Hull  Ltd   AC      Here the question is whether Colorado Group can make out goodwill and misrepresentation  To prove damage it is no longer necessary to show loss of sales or disparagement of goodwill  It is enough if the exclusivity of the goodwill is eroded  Tattinger v Allbev Limited   FSR   Irvine v Talkspot Ltd   FSR    Thus if goodwill and misrepresentation are established  damages will be proven  The case was conducted on that basis discussedEstex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second preliminary point is whether the mark  Colorado  was used as a trade mark by Colorado Group or by Woolworths Corporation  the United States parent  In support of a submission that the use was by Woolworths Corporation alone  Strandbags Group relies on a passage from Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd   HCA         CLR        W e have no doubt that when an overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country  by means of sales to Australian retail houses  goods bearing his mark and the goods  bearing his mark  are displayed or offered for sale or sold in this country  the use of the mark is that of the manufacturer  Indeed  in this case  the respondent is the only person who has the right to use the mark and the retailer to whom the goods have been sold for re sale does not  in any relevant sense  use it   In my opinion that case does not support the argument  In the first place Estex established only that when a foreign owner of an Australian trade mark sells imported goods bearing the mark and the goods are then sold in Australia the foreign owner uses the mark in Australia  The case did not consider whether the local retailer also used the mark  Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks   HCA         CLR      In the second place there is little similarity between the facts of this case and those in Estex   Woolworths Corporation was not a foreign manufacturer of goods  It was not the owner of an Australian trade mark  It did not sell goods bearing the Colorado mark for delivery in Australia  What we have here is a local retailer which  through the agency of a related company  arranged for goods to be manufactured overseas bearing a mark nominated by the local retailer and then imported the goods for retail sale  The only involvement of Woolworths Corporation is that it authorised its local subsidiary to use one of its in house marks  It no doubt permitted other subsidiaries to use those marks in other jurisdictions  However that may be  merely authorising a person to use a mark in Australia is not use in Australia by the person giving the authority  It is clear in my view that only Colorado Group used the mark in Australia citedGeneral Electric Co of USA v General Electric Co Ltd     WLR   Whatever be the position in the years leading up to   from the time Strandbags Group purchased the Edgarlodge business both it and Colorado Group had a strong reputation in the Colorado brand  I think this finding must put an end to the passing off claim  In a trade mark case General Electric Co of USA v General Electric Co Ltd     WLR     Lord Diplock said   In cases of honest concurrent user  and Strandbags Group s use is concurrent  neither of the owners of  a common law trade mark  could restrict the other from using it  but as against a usurper who infringed it either owner of the mark could obtain an injunction   In a passing off case when two traders have a reputation in the same or similar names that are concurrently being used  neither of them can be said to be guilty of any misrepresentation  Each represents nothing but the truth  that a particular name or mark is associated with his goods or business  Habib Bank Ltd v Habib Bank AG Zurich     WLR     per Oliver LJ  If in such circumstances there might be confusion that is just  one of the misfortunes which occur in life  but it is not actionable as a passing off  Marengo v Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic Ltd   FSR

Marengo v Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic Ltd   FSR     citedHicks s Trade Mark  In re     VLR   I will look at proprietorship first  In In re Hicks s Trade Mark     VLR   Holroyd J said  at    A person cannot be properly registered  under the Trades Marks Act  unless he is the proprietor  Proprietor is the person who at the moment he makes application to be registered is entitled to the exclusive use of the name  whether he then or before publicly adopted it   Broadly speaking  a person may be the proprietor of a mark in one of two ways  First  in respect of a mark which has never been used the proprietor is the person who is  or claims through  the author of the mark  which could include the copyist of a foreign mark  and intends to use it  In re Hudson s Trade Marks     Ch D       Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm   Haas Co   HCA         CLR        Second  a person may be the proprietor of a mark if he has used it  provided no one else has used the mark before him  This last proposition requires some elaboration  In the case of an inherently distinctive mark nothing more than first use is necessary to establish proprietorship  The applicant need not show that the mark has gained public recognition  Any general use of the mark as a trade mark will be enough  although in a rare case the use may be so inconsequential that it should be ignored as de minimus  Perhaps care should also be taken when there has been only a slight use of the mark followed by a long period of non use  where something akin to the doctrine of abandonment might apply  If a mark is not inherently distinctive but indicates that an article emanates from some  usually anonymous  source because  or partly because  the mark has acquired a secondary meaning  strictly speaking first use is not sufficient to establish proprietorship  To make out proprietorship it is also necessary to show that the mark does in fact distinguish the applicant s goods from the goods of others  Even if this is not an aspect of proprietorship  as I think it is  unless a secondary meaning is established s   would bar registration of the mark citedHudson s Trade Marks  In re     Ch D   I will look

edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I will look at proprietorship first  In In re Hicks s Trade Mark     VLR   Holroyd J said  at    A person cannot be properly registered  under the Trades Marks Act  unless he is the proprietor  Proprietor is the person who at the moment he makes application to be registered is entitled to the exclusive use of the name  whether he then or before publicly adopted it   Broadly speaking  a person may be the proprietor of a mark in one of two ways  First  in respect of a mark which has never been used the proprietor is the person who is  or claims through  the author of the mark  which could include the copyist of a foreign mark  and intends to use it  In re Hudson s Trade Marks     Ch D       Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm   Haas Co   HCA         CLR        Second  a person may be the proprietor of a mark if he has used it  provided no one else has used the mark before him  This last proposition requires some elaboration  In the case of an inherently distinctive mark nothing more than first use is necessary to establish proprietorship  The applicant need not show that the mark has gained public recognition  Any general use of the mark as a trade mark will be enough  although in a rare case the use may be so inconsequential that it should be ignored as de minimus  Perhaps care should also be taken when there has been only a slight use of the mark followed by a long period of non use  where something akin to the doctrine of abandonment might apply  If a mark is not inherently distinctive but indicates that an article emanates from some  usually anonymous  source because  or partly because  the mark has acquired a secondary meaning  strictly speaking first use is not sufficient to establish proprietorship  To make out proprietorship it is also necessary to show that the mark does in fact distinguish the applicant s goods from the goods of others  Even if this is not an aspect of proprietorship  as I think it is  unless a secondary meaning is established s   would bar registration of the mark appliedShell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Applying the principles to be gathered from cases such as Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR     it is clear beyond any doubt that Strandbags Group s use of the word  Colorado  infringes the trade mark  A defence under s  f  was abandoned  The facts will not support the defence under s    This is not because  as was alleged  Edgarlodge is not Strandbags Group s predecessor in title  I am sure that it is having regard to the terms of the contract of sale  but because Edgarlodge s use of  Colorado  on backpacks was not a prior use followedTaco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR   The claim under s   must fail for the same reason as the passing off claim has failed  Although a s   claim may succeed where a passing off claim has failed   Peter Isaacson Publications v Nationwide News Pty Ltd     IPR   when  as here  there has been no misrepresentation  the s   claim cannot succeed  Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR    By the time Strandbags Group took over the Edgarlodge business the point had been reached where the court could not interfere with that company s trading even if in the past there had been misleading conduct engaged in by Edgarlodge  It is possible that prior to the sale Colorado Group could have taken action to restrain Edgarlodge s activities  Having failed to take that action  it cannot now complain about what is being done by Strandbags Group citedTattinger v Allbev Limited   FSR   This brings me to the passing off claim  There is no dispute about the elements of the cause of action  There is a very useful summary of the five elements by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v J Townend   Sons  Hull  Ltd   AC      Here the question is whether Colorado Group can make out goodwill and misrepresentation  To prove damage it is no longer necessary to show loss of sales or disparagement of goodwill  It is enough if the exclusivity of the goodwill is eroded  Tattinger v Allbev Limited   FSR   Irvine v Talkspot Ltd   FSR    Thus if goodwill and misrepresentation are established  damages will be proven  The case was conducted on that basis
