  FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited   FCAFC         FCR     Finkelstein J at   suggested  in these terms  that s  A of the Act had raised the bar in resisting dismissal of a proceeding    If the test under s  A raises the hurdle for the opposing party  it may be necessary for that party at a minimum to provide an outline of the evidence that will be relied upon  The outline must be sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute about facts that are material to the outcome of the case  That will enable the judge to make some assessment of the merits   It would not  of course  be necessary  in most cases  to require the party to do more than provide an outline  because that would turn the summary judgment application into a trial       emphasis added Justice Gordon in Jefferson Ford at   suggested that an assessment of whether a proceeding has no reasonable prospect of success requires an analysis of the pleadings  an assessment of the facts and  in part at least  a review of some of the evidence  In the present proceeding  there has been no engagement by the respondents with the amended pleading  That partly arises because the respondents contend that the amended pleading fails to plead material facts which establish  if proved  a cause of action based on accessorial liability on the part of Mr Sasse  Therefore  there can be no relevant engagement or an assessment in terms of the methodology contemplated by either Gordon J or Finkelstein J  Moreover  there can be no proper assessment of whether there is a genuine dispute as to factual matters as the material threshold facts have not been pleaded  The applicants say that the pleading properly asserts material facts from which  if proved  accessorial liability in Mr Sasse can be established  Nevertheless  the applicants say that the application by the respondents is premature and  in any event  the application should be treated as an application going to the adequacy of the amended pleading  If the Court is not satisfied that the amended pleading properly frames material facts establishing a cause of action in accessorial liability  the relevant paragraphs of the pleading ought to be dismissed and the applicants ought to be given leave to re plead the claims  The first question then is whether the amended pleading properly frames a cause of action in accessorial liability on the part of Mr Sasse  The statutory frameworkcitedYorke   Anor v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii
