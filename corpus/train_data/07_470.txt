    However  the critical question is whether the knowledge of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert should be imputed to other lawyers at BDW  In Red Earth at   Ryan J said     It is now well established that the knowledge of a solicitor joining a new firm should not automatically be imputed or attributed to other lawyers or employees at that firm  see Re a Firm of Solicitors   QB   at   per Staughton LJ  Unioil International Pty Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu     WAR   per Ipp J at     Newman v Phillips Fox     WAR   per Steytler J  Bolkiah  supra  at    As Lord Millett said in Bolkiah   whether a particular individual is in possession of confidential information is a question of fact to be proved or inferred from the circumstances of the case    Bolkiah at    See also the observation of Steytler J in Newman v Phillips Fox  supra  at     Applying that principle  and assuming the onus is on BDW  I am satisfied that no relevant information was passed on to anyone at BDW  The detailed evidence both from Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert and from solicitors at BDW  the veracity of which was not challenged  enables that conclusion to be safely drawn  The circumstances point the same way  A large and reputable firm like BDW would be aware of the obvious potential conflict when a solicitor previously acting on the other side of litigation has joined them  This would be clear  notwithstanding that Corrs had ceased acting for Arkaroola some six months earlier  So there was all the more reason to take positive steps  such as notifying the former client of Mr Lindwall and going out of their way to ensure that he had nothing to do with any matters relating to that client   As events have turned out  Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert left BDW before the present Federal Court litigation commenced so the risk of even accidental communication of relevant information hereafter can be ignored citedSpincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd   VSCA         VR  http www austlii edu

present purposes that Mr Salfinger has made out a case with sufficient particularity that confidential information concerning his affairs and those of Arkaroola passed into the possession of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert when they were at Corrs  Such confidential information would extend to what Gillard J in Yunghanns v Elfic Ltd  Supreme Court of Victoria  unreported    July   has
