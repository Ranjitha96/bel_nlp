Rossetto at   I referred to the test in s  A and observed that it provides   a more flexible and arguably less stringent test than that of Dey and General Steel  referring to Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR   and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR    In Rossetto at   I concluded that  by either test  I was satisfied that the cause of action in that case could not succeed and was liable to be struck out appliedEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Priestley then submits that my decision to refuse his first application for recusal was incorrect  as failing to apply the common law test in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR    He submits that I made an error of law   Mr Priestley points to Ebner at   where Gaudron J noted that the test with respect to the appearance of bias is    whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question  he or she  is required to decide     citing Johnson v Johnson     CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ   Mr Priestley says that it is necessary for me first to test his application for my recusal in the way described by the Court in Ebner and to consider the history of the proceedings and all relevant facts and circumstances as a whole to decide whether a perception of bias has arisen   I am fully aware of the test in Ebner and my consideration of Mr Priestley s submissions regarding a reasonable apprehension of bias was in accordance with that test  I do not consider that this ground supports a basis for me to recuse myself  Accordingly  this application for recusal is refused   Mr Priestley makes a further application for me to recuse myself and submits that I had   not disclosed all relevant circumstances regarding  my  decision to continue hearing this matter    He argues that I have not complied with the Guide to Judicial Conduct   at paragraph    f   That paragraph provides that if a judge decides to sit  the reasons for that decision should be recorded in open court  as should the disclosure of all relevant circumstances   The reasons for my decision on applications   and   have been recorded  Mr Priestley submits that the  relevant circumstances  that require disclosure are the circumstances surrounding my participation as a rule making judge and the process by which O   r   of the Federal Court Rules was passed   The respondents submit that the rule exists and has been made  The respondents say that the matters that go beyond this fact  such as who actually drafted the rule  are irrelevant   I do not consider that this application contains grounds that support a basis for recusal  Accordingly  this application for recusal is refused citedGeneral Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Rossetto at   I referred to the test in s  A and observed that it provides   a more flexible and arguably less stringent test than that of Dey and General Steel  referring to Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR   and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR    In Rossetto at   I concluded that  by either test  I was satisfied that the cause of action in that case could not succeed and was liable to be struck out citedJohnson v Johnson     CLR   Mr Priestley points to Ebner at   where Gaudron J noted that the test with respect to the appearance of bias is    whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that

proceedings and all relevant facts and circumstances as a whole to decide whether a perception of bias has arisen citedLaws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In any event  where the basis for the alleged apprehension of bias applies to all judges of the Court  the doctrine of necessity applies so that a judge of this Court has to hear the application  The doctrine of necessity permits a member of a court who has some interest in the subject matter of the litigation to sit on a case where no judge without such an interest is available to sit   Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ and Brennan J at     Accordingly  this application for recusal is refused   After I determined that I would not recuse myself on the ground of bias and  or reasonable apprehension of bias  Mr Priestley seeks to raise an additional ground as to why I should recuse myself  namely  my role as a rule making judge of this Court citedPriestley v Godwin   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The respondents in each proceeding have filed and served notices of objections to competency  When the notices came on for hearing before Gyles J  Mr Priestley raised a constitutional issue  the constitutional issue   Accordingly  Gyles J did not proceed with the hearing but ordered that s  B notices be served   Priestley v Godwin   FCA     Priestley   at     Mr Priestley challenges the constitutional validity of s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the Act  and O   r   of the Federal Court Rules which was made in furtherance of that section  Mr Priestley s primary submission is that the judges of the Federal Court were influenced by Parliament to replace the former test in the Federal Court Rules of  no reasonable cause of action  made  he says  under the Court s inherent jurisdiction  with the statutory test contained in s  A  thereby compromising the independence of the Court   On   June   the constitutional issue was listed for hearing on   July   before me  On   July   Mr Priestley sent a letter to my Chambers requesting that the hearing be   adjourned for a time and date to be determined by the Federal Court    The basis for this request was   the commencement of proceedings in the High Court   for an order to show cause  I declined to adjourn the hearing and the matter came before me on   July     Mr Priestley presses his application for an adjournment  on the basis that he has filed an application in the High Court  That application relates to his objection to any judge of the Federal Court  or any judge that participated in the making of O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   sitting on his matter  The application to the High Court also relates to the decision of Stone J in Priestley not to recuse herself  Mr Priestley has joined me as a defendant in the High Court proceedings  filed before the first return of these proceedings before me  on the basis of bias and  or reasonable apprehension of bias   The respondents neither consent to nor oppose the application for adjournment  Although proceedings have been filed in the High Court  no application has been made to remove this matter to the High Court  The proceedings are before me for hearing  The Court has set aside the time for that hearing and the parties are present  The respondents are represented by counsel and solicitors  I see no sufficient reason to adjourn the matter because Mr Priestley has brought an application in the High Court  That application relates  in part  to a prior aspect of these proceedings  specifically Stone J s refusal to recuse herself  and an anticipatory claim concerning me   The application for an adjournment is refused   Mr Priestley has made four applications that I recuse myself from hearing the matter citedRossetto v Meriton Apartments Proprietary Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Mr Priestley submits that I am disqualified from hearing this matter by reason of my specific interest in O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   Mr Priestley submits that I have made comments in a judgment regarding s  A of the Act and that I have therefore considered and applied s  A  He submits that this is a further ground for a reasonable apprehension of bias  He says that in Rossetto v Meriton Apartments Proprietary Limited   FCA   I made comments to the effect that s  A is a valid law of the Commonwealth and that this shows that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias on my part   In Rossetto at   I referred to the test in s  A and observed that it provides   a more flexible and arguably less stringent test than that of Dey and General Steel  referring to Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR   and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR    In Rossetto at   I concluded that  by either test  I was satisfied that the cause of action in that case could not succeed and was liable to be struck out consideredWebb v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Priestley submits that I should recuse myself from hearing this matter due to a reasonable apprehension of bias  Mr Priestley points to Deane J s statement in Webb v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at   where his Honour noted that one of the categories of disqualification by reason of appearance of bias was   disqualification by interest    where some direct or indirect interest in the proceedings  whether pecuniary or otherwise  gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of prejudice    Mr Priestley submits that I have an interest in the proceedings and that I am biased as a rule making judge of the Federal Court   Further  it is Mr Priestley s submission that there is no judge presently sitting on the Federal Court who can sit on his case  either because that judge was also a rule making judge with respect to the impugned rule  or because the judge has applied s  A of the Act  Although judges have been appointed to the bench since O   r   was passed  Mr Priestley submits that these judges are also biased as they have applied s  A of the Act in their judgments  Mr Priestley says that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of that judge because he or she has therefore been influenced by Parliament   Mr Priestley proffers two alternatives to myself or any other judge of the Court hearing his matter  He submits that the matter could be referred to the High Court under s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   the Judiciary Act   and that he could apply for a writ of prohibition and ask the High Court to issue s  B notices in order for the High Court to examine the constitutional validity of s  A of the Act  The other alternative Mr Priestley proffers is that Parliament appoint a new judge to the Federal Court to sit on his case
