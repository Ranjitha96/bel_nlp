the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the application because there is no matter   in the sense of a justiciable controversy  within s  B A  of the Judiciary Act   It is common ground that the word matter in that subsection has the same meaning as it has in Ch III of the Constitution  see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at

sought under O   r  a   In Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones  UK  Ltd     FCR     Cell Tech Communications   Lindgren J made a number of observations about the scope of O   r    His Honour said that the rule was to be distinguished from an application for summary dismissal  O   r   and an application for the striking out of pleading  O   r    To these I would add an application for summary judgment  Federal Court Act s  A  and an order for dismissal which may follow the determination of a separate question under O   r    Lindgren J also made the point  at   that  although the other procedures he identified were to be distinguished from O   r   that was not to say that  considerations relevant to such applications may not be relevant to an application under one or other of the paragraphs of O   r    The authorities establish that O   r   is not confined to cases where there has been service outside the jurisdiction  While O   r  b   c  and  d  refer to service of an originating process   a  does not  and under that subparagraph an originating process may be set aside where the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim made in it  or where the originating process constitutes an abuse of process  F Sharkey   Co Pty Ltd v Fisher   FCA         FLR       ALR     Cell Tech Communications  at    The second respondent s first ground  see   above  raises an issue of jurisdiction and  if made good  engages the power to set aside the originating process  By contrast  the second ground does not raise an issue of jurisdiction  and  even if made good  does not engage the power to set aside the originating process  I have not been able to find any direct authority addressing the submission by the second respondent that an originating process served within the jurisdiction may nevertheless be set aside because the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits  There is authority that it is not appropriate to exercise the power in O   r   on the ground that a party s pleadings are defective  Cell Tech Communications at   per Lindgren J  I do not think the power in O   r   extends to cases where the originating process has been served within the jurisdiction and a respondent claims that the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits  The rules  and now s  A of the Federal Court Act  provide adequate procedures for a party who claims that the case against him or her has no substance  The second respondent s submission that I can order that the application be set aside under O   r   because the applicant does not have a prima facie case on the merits must be rejected  I would not permit the second respondent to call in aid s  A of the Federal Court Act in circumstances where it was not referred to in the application or supporting affidavit and was only mentioned briefly in submissions  Jurisdiction In her application  the applicant relies on s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act and s   of the Federal Court Act  The important provision is s  B A c  because s   gives this Court power to grant declarations only in those matters in which the Court has original jurisdiction citedF Sharkey   Co Pty Ltd v

cases cth HCA  htmlThere have been considerable developments in the law relating to declarations since the decision in In re Judiciary and Navigation Acts   One of the leading High Court decisions in the area of declarations is Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    That case dealt with the statutory power of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in s   of the Equity Act    NSW  to make a declaration  Gibbs J said  at   that it was neither possible nor desirable to fetter the broad discretion in s   by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise  His Honour said that  in general  the requirements identified by Lord Dunedin in Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd     AC   should be satisfied before the discretion to make a declaration is exercised  In the latter case  Lord Dunedin said  at      The question must be a real and not a theoretical question  the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it  he must be able to secure a proper contradictor  that is to say  some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought  citedGardner v The Dairy Industry Authority of New South Wales     ALJR  The second respondent s submission in this case is that there is no matter within s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act because there is no real controversy between parties  He submits that the question raised  and the relief sought  is abstract or hypothetical  If that proposition is rejected  the second respondent does not put any other argument suggesting that the Court does not have jurisdiction to make the declaration sought  It is not said  for example  that the Court would never make the declaration sought because it is claimed in relation to circumstances that have not occurred and might never happen in the sense explained by Gibbs J in The University of New South Wales v Moorhouse   HCA         CLR   at     or because it will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties in the sense explained by Mason J in Gardner v The Dairy Industry Authority of New South Wales     ALJR       ALR   at     discussedIbeneweka v Egbuna     WLR  Gibbs J also referred with approval to a passage in the advice given by Viscount Radcliffe on behalf of the Privy Council in Ibeneweka v Egbuna     WLR   at      After all  it is doubtful if there is more of principle involved than the undoubted truth that the power to grant a declaration should be exercised with a proper sense of responsibility and a full realisation that judicial pronouncements ought not to be issued unless there are circumstances that call for their making  Beyond that there is no legal restriction on the award of a declaration  discussedIMF  Australia  Ltd v Sons of Gwalia Ltd  admin apptd      ALR  There has been a good deal of debate in the authorities as to whether  in the case of a general statutory power to make declarations  and leaving aside a statutory intention to exclude the remedy of declaration  there are any jurisdictional limits on the power of the Court to make a declaration  or whether all the matters which from time to time have been identified in the authorities as relevant are no more than discretionary considerations  see  for example  the discussion of this issue by King CJ in J N Taylor Holdings Ltd  in liq  v Bond     SASR   at      There is also a question of whether jurisdiction and discretion are  congruent  in relation to declaratory relief  That was said by French J in IMF  Australia  Ltd v Sons of Gwalia Ltd  admin apptd      ALR     Sons of Gwalia   at     to be debatable  In Sons of Gwalia   French J considered a case involving a declaration as to the lawfulness of future conduct  His Honour said  at        In my opinion  the issue in the present application is neither hypothetical nor contingent  It involves a real question  namely whether IMF can lawfully proceed to do what it intends to do in using information on the Sons of Gwalia register to approach members and former members of the company with a view to joining them in possible recovery action against the company  The capacity of courts to declare that conduct  which has not yet taken place  will or will not be in breach of the law  contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction  Commonwealth of Australia v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       ALR    In my opinion  there is a matter in this case and it arises under a law of the Parliament  namely  the Migration Act    Cth   There is a real controversy and the question raised is not an abstract or hypothetical question  It seems to me important not to confuse considerations relating to the desirability of the Tribunal ruling on the issue and then the matter proceeding by way of judicial review through the seeking of constitutional writs  Those considerations are relevant  perhaps highly relevant  to whether this Court should  as a matter of discretion  entertain the application for declaratory relief  They do not go to the question of whether there is a matter  discussedIn re the Judiciary Act     and In re the Navigation Act       HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe starting point in determining whether there is a matter within s  B A  of the Judiciary Act is the early decision of the High Court in In re the Judiciary Act     and In re the Navigation Act       HCA         CLR     In re Judiciary and Navigation Acts    For there to be a matter   it is not enough that there be a legal proceeding  there must be  some immediate right  duty or liability to be established by the determination of the Court   see at   per Knox CJ  Gavan Duffy  Powers  Rich and Starke JJ   The Court said  at   that the power to confer jurisdiction under Ch III of the Constitution did not include a jurisdiction to  determine abstract questions of law without the right or duty of any body or person being involved  referred toJ N

a hypothetical and a non hypothetical question  His Honour was dealing with a case involving a declaration as to the lawfulness of future conduct  He said that the difference between a hypothetical and a non hypothetical question was one of degree and he referred to the following passage from the United States case of Maryland Casualty Co v Pacific Coal   Oil Co   USSC       US     at      The difference between an abstract question and a  controversy  contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree  and it would be difficult  if it would be possible  to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy  Basically  the question in every case is whether the facts alleged  under all the circumstances  show that there is a substantial controversy  between parties having adverse legal interests  of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment      Brennan J said  at          A controversy as to the lawfulness of future conduct cannot be said to be immediate and real if it is unlikely that the applicant will engage in the conduct   Golden  Acting District Attorney of Kings County v  Zwickler   USSC         U S      at p     If the prospects of the applicant engaging in the conduct are uncertain  the uncertainty may deprive the controversy of a sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the making of a declaration   Steffel v  Thompson   USSC         U S      at p     The degree of uncertainty as to whether the applicant will engage in the conduct proposed will usually determine whether the circumstances call for the making of a declaration    Original emphasis  referred toMentha v GE Capital Ltd     ALR  The considerations referred to in the above passage
