Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedHamdan v Ramsfeld   S Ct      In recent times  challenges to certain US government actions at Guantanamo Bay have centred on appeals as to the lawfulness of the laws rather than their lawful application   Hamdan v Ramsfeld   S Ct      citedMarbury v Madison   U S      Section  v  appears in the Australian Constitution as a consequence of the finding by the Supreme Court in the United States in Marbury v Madison   U S       Sir Edmund Barton  later an original judge of the High Court  in the debates of the Australasian Federal Convention in Melbourne in    Official Record of the Debates of the Australasian Federal Convention  Melbourne     March   Vol II at page   referred to the terms of section   of Article III of the United States Constitution   After referring to Marbury v Madison   Sir Edmund said       although jurisdiction was given as to cases arising out of the Constitution that itself was only an appellate jurisdiction  Jurisdiction was not given in any express terms as to writs of mandamus  prohibition  or injunction  Therefore there was only an appellate jurisdiction  When the United States Congress tried to confer an original jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of the United States  it was held that  as there was no such jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution   it could not be conferred by an Act of Congress  because such an Act was outside the Constitution   For that reason  the statute was held to be void   The purpose of s  v  in the Australian Constitution was to ensure that  unlike the Supreme Court  the High Court had original jurisdiction in respect of writs of mandamus  prohibition or injunction   Sir Edmund said  at p     This will give the High Court original jurisdiction  as well as appellate jurisdiction  in these cases  so that when a person wishes to obtain the performance of a clear statutory duty  or to restrain an officer of the Commonwealth from going beyond his duty  or to restrain him in the performance of some statutory duty from doing some wrong  he can obtain a writ of mandamus  a writ of prohibition  or a writ of injunction consideredPlaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   the High Court was concerned with provisions in the Migration Act   namely ss   and     which  on their face  purported to render some decisions made under the Migration Act immune from judicial review   Section   provided      In this section   privative clause decision  means a decision of an administrative character made  proposed to be made  or required to be made  as the case may be  under this Act       Section   of the Migration Act provided    A privative clause decision         a  is final and conclusive             b  must not be challenged  appealed against  reviewed  quashed or called into question in any court  and   c  is not subject to prohibition  mandamus  injunction  declaration or certiorari in any court on any account   The centrality of the constitutional writs for the protection of the Rule of Law in Australia appears from their Honours  observations in Plaintiff S    immediately following the significance of the Rule of Law for the Constitution noted in the quotation by Dixon J set out above  The five judges said      The reservation to this court by the Constitution of the jurisdiction in all matters in which the named constitutional writs or an injunction are sought against an officer of the Commonwealth is a means of assuring to all people affected that officers of the Commonwealth obey the law and neither exceed nor neglect any jurisdiction which the law confers on them  The centrality  and protective purpose  of the jurisdiction of this court in that regard places significant barriers in the way of legislative attempts  by privative clauses or otherwise  to impair judicial review of administrative action  Such jurisdiction exists to maintain the federal compact by ensuring that propounded laws are constitutionally valid and ministerial or other official action lawful and within jurisdiction  In any written constitution  where there are disputes over such matters  there must be an authoritative decision maker  Under the Constitution of the Commonwealth the ultimate decision maker in all matters where there is a contest  is this court  The court must be obedient to its constitutional function  In the end  pursuant to s   of the Constitution   this limits the powers of the parliament or of the executive to avoid  or confine  judicial review   The primary question in the present proceedings is whether  as the applicant claims  the Minister committed jurisdictional error in his exercise of the powers that s   of the Migration Act confers on him in relation to the cancellation of the applicant s visa   Chief Justice Gleeson in Plaintiff S  said at     Section  v  of the Constitution confers upon this court  as part of its original jurisdiction  jurisdiction in all matters in which a writ of mandamus  or prohibition  or an injunction  is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth  It secures a basic element of the rule of law  The jurisdiction of the court to require officers of the Commonwealth to act within the law cannot be taken away by parliament  Within the limits of its legislative capacity  which are themselves set by the Constitution   parliament may enact the law to which officers of the Commonwealth must conform  If the law imposes a duty  mandamus may issue to compel performance of that duty  If the law confers power or jurisdiction  prohibition may issue to prevent excess of power or jurisdiction  An injunction may issue to restrain unlawful behaviour  Parliament may create  and define  the duty  or the power  or the jurisdiction  and determine the content of the law to be obeyed  But it cannot deprive this court of its constitutional jurisdiction to enforce the law so enacted   Parliament has in s   of the Migration Act created and defined the requirements that have to be met before the power given to the Minister to cancel a person s visa can be exercised   Callinan J in Plaintiff S  commenced his reasons for judgment with the following    Constitutional law in a federal system has been described as  a unique mixture of history  statutory interpretation  and some political philosophy   Menzies  Afternoon Light     p     In resolving this case  resort to each of these is necessary  history for an understanding of the law in relation to prerogative writs at the time of Federation and the considerations which moved the founders to use the language that they did in s  xxix  and  xxxvii  and Ch III of the Constitution   statutory interpretation to construe both the provisions of the enactment under challenge  and the Constitution which is both the source of the power to enact them  and the instrument which prescribes the powers conferred on this court to examine and pronounce upon their validity  and  political philosophy for an understanding of the need for each of the arms of government  the parliament  the executive and the judiciary to pay due deference to  and not to intrude upon the roles of one another  in the good  that is to say the lawful and efficient government of the nation   As Callinan J s observation emphasises  in the proper administration of the lawful and efficient government of the nation  each of the arms of government   the parliament  the executive  and the judiciary   has a role to play  and each of the arms of government must pay due deference to  and not to intrude upon  the roles of the other arms of government   The preceding observations demonstrate that there is no room for the view  sometimes uttered  that the executive should have exclusive responsibility over all matters involving national security   True it is that the executive is charged with a heavy responsibility in matters of national security  but parliament has defined the limits defining the discharge by the executive of that responsibility  and it is for the judicial arm of government  to ensure that ministerial or other official action  is  lawful and within jurisdiction  as the plurality judgment at   of Plaintiff S    set out at   makes plain   As David Jackson said in the article on the growth of constitutional writs earlier referred to  at         Section  v  reflects a distinct constitutional value  namely that there will always be a court which has jurisdiction to determine the legality of the performance by officers of the Commonwealth  judicial or non judicial  of their functions  or the legality of their failure to perform them     It is a value which I think does assist in maintaining the rule of law in this country      The Right Honourable Lord Bingham of Cornhill  the former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales  speaking extra judicially on  The Rule of Law      Commonwealth Lawyer   referred to the Constitutional Reform Act    UK  which radically reconfigures the legal system in the United Kingdom   The Full Court noted that the joint judgment of Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ in Plaintiff S  held  at   that an administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is  regarded in law as no decision at all  appliedRe Patterson  Ex parte Taylor   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Gaudron J said in Re Patterson  Ex parte Taylor   HCA         ALR   at           A decision maker falls into jurisdictional error if he or she misunderstands the nature of the jurisdiction to be exercised  misconceives his or her duty  fails to apply himself or herself to the question to be decided or misunderstands the nature of the opinion which he or she is to form             the parliamentary secretary misunderstood the nature of the jurisdiction she was exercising by failing to appreciate that there would  in effect  be no opportunity for Mr Taylor to seek revocation of her decision citedSunday Times v United Kingdom     EHRR   The European Court of Human Rights said in Sunday Times v United Kingdom     EHRR   at       The law must be adequately accessible  the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case     a norm cannot be regarded as a  law  unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct  he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee  to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances  the consequences which a given action may entail   The third sub rule advanced by Lord Bingham at   was that        the laws of the land should apply equally to all  save to the extent that objective differences justify differentiation      While some special legislative provision can properly be made for some categories of people such as children  prisoners and the mentally ill  based on the peculiar characteristics of such categories  we would regard legislation directed to those with red hair  to adapt Warrington LJ s long lived example  as incompatible with the rule of law citedShort v Poole Corporation   Ch   Warrington LJ said in Short v Poole Corporation   Ch   at     It may be also possible to prove that an act of the public body  though performed in good faith and without the taint of corruption  was so clearly founded on alien and irrelevant grounds as to be outside the authority conferred upon the body  and therefore inoperative  It is difficult to suggest any act which would be held ultra vires under this head  though performed bona fide  To look for one example germane to the present case  I suppose that if the defendants were to dismiss a teacher because she had red hair  or for some equally frivolous and foolish reason  the Court would declare the attempted dismissal to be void     My view then is that the only case in which the Court can interfere with an act of a public body which is  on the face of it  regular and within its powers  is when it is proved to be in fact ultra vires  and that the references in the judgments in the several cases cited in argument to bad faith  corruption  alien and irrelevant motives  collateral and indirect objects  and so forth  are merely intended when properly understood as examples of matters which if proved to exist might establish the ultra vires character of the act in question   Further  if the discretion to cancel a visa holder s visa were to be enlivened on the basis of a perfectly innocent association with a person who had engaged in criminal activity  the position is not much different from the exercise of a power conditioned on the circumstance that a person had red hair  in the celebrated example of Warrington LJ in Short v Poole Corporation   Ch     It is no answer to this criticism of the Chan test that the Minister s power  if conditioned on such a premise  could be expected to be exercised only in those circumstances where the Minister thought it appropriate to exercise the power  The exercise of a power conditioned on such an consideration would be an exercise of power alien to the object of the purposes of the Migration Act  consideredR v Zaphir   Qd R   In R v Zaphir   Qd  R   Zaphir had been charged with an offence under s   of the Criminal Code  Qld  which relevantly provided    Any person who threatens     cause any detriment     to another with intent to compel him to do any act which he is lawfully entitled to abstain from doing  is guilty of a misdemeanour      On the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal  it was argued that the  detriment  in the section had necessarily to involve a criminal or unlawful connotation   Wanstall CJ with whom Matthews J agreed said at     It is sufficient for present purposes to treat s    of the Code as at least bringing within its scope the uttering of a threat to cause a detriment to another by inducing a violation of his legal right  contractual or otherwise  Whether or not it extends to threats to cause a detriment to another by bringing about a consequence which is not in violation of the other s legal right should be left for decision in an appropriate case citedRailway Express Agency Inc v New York   US     Concerning the requirement that the law be of general application  and equal in operation  Lord Bingham quotes the observation of Justice Jackson in the Supreme Court of the United States in Railway Express Agency Inc v New York   US           The framers of the Constitution knew  and we should not forget today  that there is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally  Conversely  nothing opens the door to arbitrary action so effectively as to allow those officials to pick and choose only a few to whom they will apply legislation and thus to escape the political retribution that might be visited upon them if larger numbers were affected  Courts can take no better measure to assure that laws will be just than to require that laws be equal in operation   These comments  in my opinion  bear on how the  association test  in s  b  of the Migration Act is properly to be construed  Did Parliament intend that the definition of  not passing the character test  should apply to persons whose  association  with persons who are criminals does not bear adversely on their character  as well as to those whose  association  with such persons does bear adversely on their character  Lord Bingham said at     My sixth sub rule expresses what many would  with reason  regard as the core of the rule of law principle  It is that ministers and public officers at all levels must exercise the powers conferred on them reasonably  in good faith  for the purpose for which the powers were conferred and without exceeding the limits of such powers  This sub rule reflects the well established and familiar grounds of judicial review   See Jeffrey Jowell   The Rule of Law Today  in Jeffrey Jowell and Dawn Oliver  eds  The Changing Constitution     th ed   Oxford    pp    consideredChurch of Scientology v Woodward   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to the deference that Courts ought properly give to decisions of the executive in matters of national security  observations by the High Court in Church of Scientology v Woodward   HCA         CLR   are relevant   Mason J  as his Honour then was  said  at     It would be too much to say that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be impliedly excluded by statute  though no case of implied exclusion was cited to us in argument  But it is not too much to say that any suggestion that Parliament has impliedly excluded judicial review  especially for ultra vires  should be viewed with extreme caution  indeed with healthy scepticism   At   Mason J said    Surveillance in association with the obtaining  storage and dissemination by a government organization of information relating to private citizens can only be justified in a democratic society by the need to protect that society  i e   on security grounds        No one could doubt that the revelation of security intelligence in legal proceedings would be detrimental to national security  But it does not follow that ASIO s activities should be completely free from judicial review  To so conclude would be to ignore the protection which is given by the doctrine of Crown privilege to information the disclosure of which is prejudicial to national security      It is one thing to say that security intelligence is not readily susceptible of judicial evaluation and assessment  It is another thing to say that the courts cannot determine whether intelligence is  relevant to security  and whether a communication of intelligence is  for purposes relevant to security    Brennan J  as his Honour then was  said  at     Judicial review is neither more nor less than the enforcement of the rule of law over executive action  it is the means by which executive action is prevented from exceeding the powers and functions assigned to the executive by law and the interests of the individual are protected accordingly   At   Brennan J asked        how can the gravity of a security risk be evaluated by a court  It may be necessary to evaluate Australia s relationships with foreign countries  the stability of international affairs  the passion inspired by a particular cause or the likelihood of adherents to the cause taking violent steps in support of it  it may be necessary to evaluate rumour or suspicion as well as proof  It may be reasonable  even necessary  to determine the gravity of a risk by intuition rather than deduction  It may be truly said that the skills and procedures of a court do not fit it to find the point on the scale of gravity of every risk which may be thought to pose a threat to the Commonwealth  the States and Territories and the people thereof  and it may be accepted that a court will not necessarily have or be able to obtain all the evidence needed to allow it to quantify a risk precisely  However  it does not follow that judicial review is excluded   As to the intersection of matters of national security with the administration of civil justice  Brennan J said at     The secrecy of the work of an intelligence organization which is to counter espionage  sabotage  etc  is essential to national security  and the public interest in national security will seldom yield to the public interest in the administration of civil justice       It is right to acknowledge the political character of the Minister s office  and his accountability to the Parliament  and of the government ultimately to the electorate  The Minister is nonetheless susceptible to the requirements of the law that he act within the jurisdiction conferred by the Parliament on him citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Whether such an inference can be drawn in the circumstances where a Minister of the Crown has not given evidence was the subject of separate observations by Kirby J and Callinan J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR     Before that decision  there was commentary in the textbooks and in the authorities supporting the view that the rule did  in fact  apply to Ministers   In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   Kirby J and Callinan J  in separate opinions  observed that the rule in Jones v Dunkel may not apply in the same way to Ministers as it does to others   Kirby J said at     Similarly  I would not attach a great deal of significance to  or draw adverse inferences in these cases from  the failure of the Minister to give oral evidence or to submit himself to cross examination  Although Ministers  whilst holding office  are not immune in this country from giving evidence before courts  a court would not ordinarily hasten to draw an inference that the Minister had deliberately refrained from giving oral evidence because of a concern that the impugned decision would be revealed as affected by bias or that the Minister would be forced to make concessions damaging to the Minister s case  Ministers have to perform highly complex and onerous functions  They carry heavy burdens that severely limit the time available for them to give evidence in individual cases  In Mr Jia s case  the Minister might have considered it sufficient to rely on the record as  in the opinion of the majority of this Court  it is held to be  Applying the test of whether the parties  or the public  might entertain a reasonable apprehension that the Minister might have been biased  I do not believe that the principle expressed in Jones v Dunkel   that an adverse inference may sometimes be drawn from a failure to give evidence  should loom large in evaluating appearances in the applications brought to this Court by Mr Jia and Mr White   Similarly  Callinan J stated at     Adverse inferences may not be so readily drawn against a Minister in this type of litigation as might be drawn against a party who avoids the witness box in other proceedings   More recently  in Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     Sackville J referred to the High Court s observations in Jia but found it unnecessary to decide whether it applied to the circumstances of the case before him which did not involve purported bias by the Minister as was the case in Jia   but rather  failure to have regard to certain information  Sackville J had concluded  at   that assuming the rule applied  it would not assist the applicant   However  in most  if not all  cases  because of the factors expressed by Pincus J  and also Kirby J and Callinan J in the passages set out above  the absence of a Minister giving evidence in the for the witness box will be easily understood consideredCraig v State of South Australia   CLR   As to what constitutes jurisdictional error  the High Court in Craig v State of South Australia   CLR   said at     If such an administrative tribunal falls into an error of law which causes it to identify a wrong issue  to ask itself a wrong question  to ignore relevant material  to rely on irrelevant material or  at least in some circumstances  to make an erroneous finding or to reach a mistaken conclusion  and the tribunal s exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected  it exceeds its authority or powers  Such an error of law is jurisdictional error which will invalidate any order or decision of the tribunal which reflects it consideredMIMA v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This passage was referred to by McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ in MIMA v Yusuf   HCA         CLR    Their Honours continued at      Jurisdictional error  can thus be seen to embrace a number of different kinds of error  the list of which  in the passage cited from Craig  is not exhaustive  Those different kinds of error may well overlap  The circumstances of a particular case may permit more than one characterisation of the error identified  for example  as the decision maker both asking the wrong question and ignoring relevant material  What is important  however  is that identifying a wrong issue  asking a wrong question  ignoring relevant material or relying on irrelevant material in a way that affects the exercise of power is to make an error of law  Further  doing so results in the decision maker exceeding the authority or powers given by the relevant statute  In other words  if an error of those types is made  the decision maker did not have authority to make the decision that was made  he or she did not have jurisdiction to make it  Nothing in the Act suggests that the tribunal is given authority to authoritatively determine questions of law or to make a decision otherwise than in accordance with the law   The central question in this case is whether the Minister misconstrued the terms of s  b    A person does not pass the character test if             b  the person has or has had an association with someone else  or with a group or organisation  whom the Minister reasonably suspects has been or is involved in criminal conduct consideredLobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court  French  Sackville and Hely JJ  in Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR     Lobo  is directly relevant to the present question   In Lobo   the delegate of the Minister was concerned with the grant of a subclass   visa  Clause     of the Second Schedule of the Migration Regulations prescribed a criterion in which the Minister must be satisfied before he could grant such a visa  His satisfaction that the criterion had been satisfied was a necessary condition of his power to grant the visa  If he was satisfied that the criterion had been satisfied  and that the other conditions set out in s  a  of the Migration Act were met  then he had a statutory duty to grant the visa   The Full Court said at     Where the minister misconstrues one of the criteria prescribed in the Act or regulations and  because of that misconstruction he considers that the criterion has not been satisfied  it is as though he did not consider the criterion at all  For  on the face of it  he has failed to ask the question which the Act and regulations  upon a proper construction of the criterion  require him to ask  In such a case  absent s   the minister s decision would be a nullity  The minister has not done that which the Act requires him to have done  The decision would be a purported decision of no legal effect   On the appeal to the Full Court in Lobo   it was not disputed that the departmental policy to which the Tribunal adverted was narrower than the criterion for a subclause   visa set out in cl     of the Second Schedule to the regulations  In the light of that concession  the Full Court concluded that failure to satisfy the criteria set out in the departmental policy did not equate to failure to satisfy the criterion in cl      In consequence  the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error   The Full Court said at     It is apparent from the reasons of the tribunal     that the tribunal treated assessment according to the departmental policy as assessment for the purposes of cl      In so doing it erred and its error was jurisdictional  It did not address the question which s   of the Act required it to address   An application for special leave was refused by the High Court  Gummow and Hayne JJ    HCATrans   on   February   their Honours stating that the decision in Lobo by the Full Court of the Federal Court was  not attended by doubt  citedMIMIA v SGLB   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In MIMIA v SGLB   HCA         ALR   Gummow and Hayne JJ  with whom Gleeson CJ agreed  indicated at   that the nature of the alleged error in Plaintiff   was the denial to the plaintiff of jurisdictional fairness   Their Honours in   and   turned to other cases where the nature of the alleged error turned on the meaning of the legislative criterion of jurisdiction  Their Honours said      In other cases  the nature of the alleged error will turn upon the meaning of the legislative criterion of jurisdiction  making the construction of the legislation the primary and essential task  Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Applicants S  was such a case  The court divided on the question whether  on the proper construction of the relevant regulations under the Act  as picked up by s   the tribunal had been obliged to determine to its satisfaction whether applicants were entitled to protection visas by reason of membership of the family unit of a person who had already been granted a protection visa  The majority answered  no  Gaudron and Kirby JJ were of the other view       However  in the light of the detailed specification of the criteria for the grant of the various classes of visa  including protection visas  it is impossible to treat the consideration by the minister s delegate  and hence the tribunal  of what are the relevant criteria  the issue in Applicants S    and the satisfaction thereof  as other than conditions precedent to the making of a valid decision to grant or refuse to grant a visa under s    Further  certain observations by Gaudron and Kirby JJ in Applicants S   not on an issue upon which the division in the court turned  are  with respect  compelling  Their Honours said        The detailed specification of matters bearing upon the grant of a protection visa inserted into the Act at the same time as was s   makes it clear that the Parliament was not enacting provisions to the effect that decision makers could validly grant or refuse to grant protection visas on the basis of a bona fide attempt to determine whether the criteria for the grant of a protection visa have been satisfied  as distinct from the decision maker s actual satisfaction or lack of satisfaction as to those criteria  And as already pointed out  a decision maker cannot be said to be satisfied or not satisfied if effect is not given to those criteria because  for example  they have been misconstrued or overlooked   The grounds of the application to this Court by Dr Haneef are       The Respondent fell into jurisdictional error by deciding that the threshold requirement under s  c  of the Migration Act had been satisfied based on upon misconstruction of the expression  association  in s  b               The Respondent fell into jurisdictional error by failing to take into account a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion under s     namely                 a  the nature and extent of the alleged  association  between the Applicant and the persons whom the Respondent suspected of criminal conduct                   b  the weakness or strength of the evidence supporting the charge against the Applicant                 c  hardship to the Applicant as a result of the cancellation                     The Respondent fell into jurisdictional error by taking irrelevant considerations into account in the exercise of the discretion under s     namely                 a  that the Applicant had been granted bail by the Brisbane Magistrates Court                   b  that the  Australian Government has a strong interest in deterring non citizens from providing support to terrorist organisations networks  when the Applicant has not been convicted of any offence involving provision of such support                   The Respondent s purpose in cancelling the visa under s   was to allow the Applicant to be detained when he had been granted bail and that was an improper purpose       Particulars          a  The Respondent knew that the Applicant had been granted bail on   July                b  the Respondent expressly took into account that that Applicant had been granted bail in making his decision to cancel the Applicant s visa               c  the Respondent cancelled the visa on   July   within several hours of the decision to grant bail being made               d  the Respondent had not previously notified the Applicant that he was considering the cancellation of the visa               e  on   July   the Respondent also knew that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police intended to ask the Attorney General to issue a criminal justice stay certificate  or believed that the Commissioner had the power to issue such a certificate himself               f  on   July   the Respondent informed the media that the Applicant would remain in detention until his trial               g  the Respondent knew that if he cancelled the visa and a criminal justice stay certificate was issued by the Attorney General  ss   and   of the Migration Act would operate to require that the Applicant be kept in immigration detention pending his trial               h  a criminal justice stay certificate will be issued which will operate to authorise the detention of the Applicant               i  the purpose of the Respondent is to be inferred from the matters set out above   It is to be noted  particularly in the light of ground   that ground  a  was not pressed by the applicant in these proceedings   It is necessary to consider each of these grounds in turn   The argument for the application on this ground focuses on the four paragraphs of the Minister s Statement of Reasons which appear under the heading  Character Test    Its relevance for the present case is for the guidance it gives as to the proper approach of statutory construction of a composite phrase  The High Court  Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Heydon and Crennan JJ  said at     The primary judge considered  craftsmanship  and  aesthetic appeal  as distinct and consecutive questions  before going on and  considering both aspects together   This was an error in the construction and application of the Copyright Act      In this case  in my opinion  the importance of context cannot be overestimated   The  association test  is one of four criteria by which a person does not pass the character test  It is relevant that the other three are  a  if the person has a substantial criminal record   c  if  having regard to either or both of the person s past and present criminal conduct  or the person s past and present general conduct  the person is not of good character  or  d  the presence of the person in Australia would involve a significant risk that the person would engage in criminal conduct or act in the other reprehensible ways specified in s  d ii   v    Each of  a   c  and  d  requires the decision maker to look at the person  ie  the visa holder  each of them requires an assessment of qualities personal to them  which qualities  parliament has said  determine that that person fails the character test   In that context  it would be striking if the criterion in  b  which this case is concerned  could be met by an or any association with a person  group or organisation reasonably suspected of having been or is involved in criminal conduct  Such an association could be a completely innocent  and involve not the slightest reflection on that person s character  The association could be of the most transient kind  could be not only innocent but historically ancient   Having regard to the context  it seems to me impossible to conclude that Parliament would have intended that a person fail the character test where relationship of a visa holder with a person  group or organisation was utterly remote from the criminality that person

appliedGodley v MIMIA   ALD   The applicant submitted that some support for the conclusion that an  innocent association  is not sufficient for the purposes of s  b  and that there must be some nexus between the visa holder and the criminal conduct by way of knowledge of  or belief in  or even suspicion of criminal conduct  was to be found in the observations  albeit dicta   of Lee J in Godley v MIMIA   ALD     Lee J said at       Section  b  combines a finding of fact by the minister with the formation of a reasonable suspicion  First  the minister must form a reasonable suspicion that a person  group or organisation has been or is involved in criminal conduct  It may be taken that to be a reasonable suspicion the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds  Second  the minister must make a finding of fact that the visa applicant has  or has had  an association with that person  group or organisation  Again it would be necessary for there to be material capable of supporting that finding  It is unnecessary to consider the meaning of the word  association  but for a visa applicant not to pass the character test it may be taken to require the minister to make relevant findings of fact as to the knowledge  or awareness  by the visa applicant of the facts that point to the involvement of the person  group or organisation in criminal conduct consideredMIMIA v Godley   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The decision of Lee J was upheld on appeal in MIMIA v Godley   FCAFC         FCR    The Full Court  however  did not refer to or deal with that passage in Lee J s judgment   It was submitted by the Solicitor General that the Full Court quoted the passage of Lee J s judgment preceding   and subsequent to that paragraph  but did not quote that passage  the suggestion being that the Full Court declined to endorse those remarks   However  the position is that  having spoken of s   generally  Lee J  in   dealt with s  a    in   dealt with s  b    and in   dealt with s  d  notfollowedMIMA v Wai Kuen Chan   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  For the Minister it was submitted that that test is supported by the decision of Emmett J in MIMA v Wai Kuen Chan   FCA     that judgment of Emmett J is correct  and that that is the test which the Minister applied   It is on these competing interpretations that an issue is joined   For the Minister  it was submitted that the expression  an association with  can have various meanings which may range from a mere connection or link  to participation in a common goal or purpose  It was submitted that      In the present case  when the word  association  is used as noun without any adjectival qualification the expression of words affords a low threshold test  All that paragraph  b  requires is that the visa holder has  an association with  the person  group or organisation that the Minister reasonably suspects has been involved in criminal conduct  If the visa holder has an association the threshold test is satisfied    The submissions by the Minister on the establishment of the required association are as follows            The Minister was entitled to take into account and did take into account the following matters of fact relevant to the existence of an association between the Applicant Dr Haneef and Kafeel Ahmed  Kafeel  and Dr Sabeel Ahmed  Sabeel   hereinafter collectively referred to as  the Ahmed Brothers                     Dr Haneef and the Ahmed Brothers were second cousins                       They had stayed in the same boarding house accommodation in the United Kingdom                         Kafeel had lent money to Dr Haneef                        Dr Haneef had left his mobile phone with some credit remaining on his SIM card to Sabeel                        There had been conversations in an internet chat room with Sabeel mainly relating to family matters  and                    These matters were sufficient to enliven the Minister s discretion  They established an association between Dr Haneef and both of the Ahmed Brothers         Emphasis added    The fact recited in       involves a slight overstatement  The information before the Minister was that Dr Haneef had stayed in the same boarding house accommodation in the United Kingdom as Dr Sabeel Ahmed   Mr Bennett submitted that facts pointing to an innocent connection was sufficient to establish the  association  in s  b  and that the Minister was correct to so find  He advanced six reasons          First   in applying the test which he did the Minister complied with the only direct authority of this Court on the meaning of the expression  an association with                  Secondly   the Minister also applied the test which has been set out in Ministerial Direction   in relation to the operation of s                   Thirdly   the decision of Emmett J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Chan is correct and ought to be followed because it accords with the ordinary meaning of the words used by the section  it accords with the Legislative intention of the provision as derived from the Second Reading Speech in relation to the introduced section and it gives effect to the purpose of the section in its amended form                  Fourthly   the Applicant s submissions adopt a meaning of  association  not relevant to the word as used in the legislation and by doing so ask the Court to read the section as if it had not been the subject of the   amendment                  Fifthly   the construction sought to be placed on s  b  by the Applicant would deprive it of much of its utility                  Sixthly   the effect of the legislation was that the circumstances arose  Dr Haneef had an association with his cousins who were involved in criminal activities  which entitled the Minister to cancel Dr Haneef s visa in the first instance  Dr Haneef was invited to and entitled to satisfy the Minister that he did not fail the  character test   He chose not to do so   The Solicitor General submitted    The Minister has adopted the approach authorised by this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Chan   There Emmett J rejected the submission that in order to come within the scope of the section the person had to have some form of community of purpose or ideas with the person  group or organisation involved in the criminal conduct such that there was a nexus between the visa holder and the alleged criminal conduct   The applicant conceded   The Respondent s view that any association is enough is supported by the decision of Emmett J in MIMA v Wai Kuen Chan   FCA     For the applicant  however  it was pointed out that there was no contradictor in Chan   and that Emmett J s attention  does not seem to have been drawn to all the relevant legislative provisions and the extrinsic material   Emmett J s judgment was given ex tempore  and in particular  the significance of s  C  was not adverted to  The applicant respectfully submitted that Chan was wrongly decided   On the appeal  Ms Chan did not appear  Emmett J summarised the Minister s contention as to the existence of an association between Mrs Chan and her husband  which have been earlier set out  Emmett J said      The Tribunal concluded that an association by way of family ties such as I have just summarised is not of itself sufficient to ground the relevant association        The Tribunal considered that it was necessary that there be some nexus between the visa holder and the criminal conduct of the person with whom the visa holder was associated  However  I do not consider that the language of s b  justifies such a limitation   There is nothing in the paragraph itself to limit the association in that way  Rather the scheme of the provision is to confer upon the Minister a discretion under s   to cancel a visa if certain prerequisites are satisfied  The first prerequisite is that the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test and the second is that the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test       Even if those prerequisites are satisfied  the words  the Minister may cancel a visa   emphasis added  indicate that there is still a discretion to be exercised by the Minister or his delegate as to whether or not to cancel a visa  There may be good reasons why  in a particular case  notwithstanding that the prerequisites are satisfied  the Minister may in the exercise of his discretion decide not to cancel a visa  For example  it may be that there is no nexus between the criminal conduct of the person with whom the visa holder had an association and the visa holder   as was found to be the case in relation to Mrs Chan       It may be a relevant consideration that the visa holder had no knowledge of the criminal conduct of the other person   It may be a relevant consideration that the visa holder did not knowingly take a benefit from the proceeds of the associate s criminal conduct   Those matters   however  are matters for consideration upon the exercise of the discretion if the discretion arises  They are not matters to be taken into account in determining whether or not the discretion arises   namely  whether or not the person has had an association with someone else whom the Minister reasonably suspects has been involved in criminal conduct       It may be significant that s   was relevantly amended with effect from June    Prior to   June    the Minister had power to refuse to grant a visa or to cancel a visa   if     the Minister     is satisfied that the person is not of good character because of the person s association with another person     who the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe has been or is involved in criminal conduct   In that form  the Minister was required to make a judgment as to whether or not the visa holder was not of good character because of the association with the person involved in criminal conduct       The effect of the amendment was to remove any question of whether the Minister is satisfied as to the good character of a visa holder  The provisions in their present form merely require that the Minister be satisfied that the person does not pass the character test  The character test requires a more mechanical exercise  namely  whether or not for present purposes  the person has satisfies any of the four criteria set out in s  a   d        The change in the legislation confirms the construction that I consider is the proper construction of the words contained in the paragraph  It follows in my view that the Tribunal erred in law  Accordingly  the decision should be set aside and the matter should be remitted to the Tribunal for decision according to law    Emphasis added    Emmett J in his reasons for judgment  did not give his opinion as to what the  association  in s  b  meant  although it may be inferred that a connection or combination was enough  He clearly held that an association by way of family ties was of itself sufficient to ground the necessary  association   That view suggests that any association  whether innocent or sinister  whether fleeting or regular  whether in the distant past or contemporary  is sufficient to enliven the discretion to cancel   In my opinion  that is the test which the Minister applied  that is the test which the Solicitor General on behalf of the Minister says the Minister applied  and further  that is the test which the Solicitor General on behalf of the Minister contends is the correct test   In my respectful opinion  Chan was wrongly decided   Emmett J opined in Chan that the innocence of the association would be a relevant consideration in the exercise of the Minister s discretion  However  the Act does not confer any opportunity to be heard on how the discretion should be exercised  either prospectively or retrospectively  after the decision to cancel  cf s  C   There is no opportunity for a person to make representations as to the exercise of discretion about cancellation  or as to the circumstances whether cancellation was or was not in the national interest  The only opportunity afforded by s  C  is to seek to establish that the person passes the character test  That opportunity is empty  and is doomed to fail if  by definition  totally innocent associations mean that the person does not pass the character test   Section s  C  provides that a person whose visa has been cancelled can make representations to the Minister and the Minister may revoke the original decision if the person satisfies the Minister that the person passes the character test  as defined by s     The decision under s   to cancel a visa is made without any obligation to accord natural justice to the visa holder  The opportunity conferred by s  C  is not to make representations to the Minister concerning whether to exercise the discretion to cancel the visa  nor whether the cancellation is in the national interest  That opportunity is only in respect of the element of whether the person can satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test   A professional association  whether as a doctor  lawyer  social worker  or teacher  would be within the respondent s construction of the association test  A mere familial or social association would be enough  So much is implicit in Emmet J s rejection of the view of the Tribunal that the association by way of family ties  summarised by Emmett J in   of his reasons  was sufficient to ground the relevant association appliedChan v MIMA   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth AATA  html  It is necessary to consider Emmet Js judgment in Chan in some detail  as well as the reasons for decision of Deputy President Purvis QC in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from whose decision the appeal was made to the Federal Court by the Minister  Chan v MIMA   AATA    Mrs Wai Kuen Chan did not appear on the appeal   The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  on   February   cancelled the applicant s class UC  temporary business entry  sub class   visa on the basis that the respondent Minister was not satisfied that the applicant passed the character test  pursuant to s   of the Migration Act   Deputy President Purvis said  at     The issues that arise for determination in this application are         a  Whether there is or has been a relevant association between the Applicant and her ex husband Mr Wong Kam Fei    b  if the answer to  a  is in the affirmative whether  the Tribunal reasonably suspects that Mr Wong has been or is involved in criminal conduct    c  if the answers to  a  and  b  above are both in the affirmative and the applicant thereby does not satisfy the character test  whether the Tribunal should or should not exercise its discretion to cancel the Applicant s visa   Deputy President Purvis  at   referred to paragraph     of Direction Number   the forerunner to Direction Number   which replaced it  The paragraphs in each Direction are identical    The meaning of  association  for the purposes of the Character Test encompasses a very wide range of relationships including having an  alliance  or a  link  or  connection  with a person  a group or an organised body that is involved in criminal activities   Association  does not require actual membership of a group or an organised body that is involved in criminal activities  In establishing criminal association  the decision maker may have regard to the following   a  the degree and frequency of association the non citizen had or has with the individual group or organisation   b  the duration of the association  and   c  the nature of the association   A professional association  whether as a doctor  lawyer  social worker  or teacher  would be within the respondent s construction of the association test  A mere familial or social association would be enough  So much is implicit in Emmet J s rejection of the view of the Tribunal that the association by way of

Kirby and Hayne JJ held at     and       The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute  The meaning of the provision must be determined  by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole   In Commissioner for Railways  NSW  v Agalianos   Dixon CJ pointed out that  the context  the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed   Thus  the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed              Furthermore  a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision  In The Commonwealth v Baume Griffith CJ cited R v Berchet to support the proposition that it was  a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause  sentence  or word shall prove superfluous  void  or insignificant  if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent             However  the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have  Ordinarily  that meaning  the legal meaning  will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision  But not always  The context of the words  the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction  the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction

connection or combination      the connection of ideas in thought  or an idea connected with or suggested by a subject of thought       The word  associate  which can either be a verb or a noun  is

 my most intimate associates     a confederate  an accomplice  an ally   The observations of the High Court in Project Blue Sky at   in the judgment earlier set out have direct application to this consideration   Counsel for the Minister said that the character test  which a person does not pass if the person has or has an association with a person or group or organisation that the Minister reasonably suspects has been or is involved in criminal conduct  does not involve any question about the character of the person being assessed   Mr Bennett submitted that the words  the character test  are not words to be read as having a meaning  He says that those words are  just a convenient definition   He submitted   one does not read character test and say   oh  well  this is about character  that means something about character   Of course it doesn t   It is not consistent with the direction given by the High Court in Project Blue Sky to construe a statutory provision in such a wide fashion as to include circumstances that are clearly alien to the object of the statute  The provision should be read so as to accord with the object and purpose of the statute  A wider construction  which goes beyond that object  is not to be adopted on the basis that the Minister will confine the exercise of his powers to only those instances within the wider construction which are consistent with the object and purpose of the statute   In my opinion  there is nothing in the legislative history of the section  including the changes introduced by the Migration Legislation Amendment  Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct  Act     which provides support for the interpretation which the Minister applied  and for which his counsel in these proceedings  seeks to vindicate   Emmett J in Chan placed some reliance on the amendments to s   brought about by that Amending   Act in reaching the  any association is sufficient  view

rulings but otherwise sat completely silent throughout a non jury trial with the result that his or her views about the issues  problems and technical difficulties involved in the case remained unknown until they emerged as final conclusions in her or her judgment would not represent a model to be emulated   According to Direction       The object of the Act is to regulate  in the national interest  the coming into and presence in Australia of non citizens  To facilitate this object  the Minister has been given a discretion to     cancel a visa where     the visa holder does not pass the Character Test  In exercising this power  the Minister has a responsibility to the Parliament and to the Australian community to protect the community from criminal or other reprehensible conduct and to     cancel visas held by non citizens whose actions are so abhorrent to the community that they should not be allowed to     remain within it    Emphases added    In my opinion  the requirement of some nexus between the visa holder and the criminal conduct suspected of the person or group with whom the visa holder has an association  is reinforced by the terms of paragraph     of Direction

Section   is designed to provide a procedure whereby persons who have been granted visas or persons who would otherwise be entitled to the grant of a visa may have that visa cancelled or refused if those persons are undesirable persons to travel to or remain in Australia   Persons will be undesirable if they fail to pass the character test                      The definition of a person passing the character test in s   shows that Parliament intended that persons who have been convicted of relatively serious crime  associate with criminals   have a history including an immediate history of criminal conduct or general conduct indicating bad character  are a significant risk of engaging in criminal conduct or undesirable conduct  s  d  should not be permitted to travel to or remain in Australia   Shortly put  persons who have committed or are likely to commit criminal or other like conduct should not be permitted to travel to or remain in Australia  Because the purpose is to exclude those persons  the matters that are relevant to the exercise of the Minister s discretion will include any fact or circumstance which would suggest that a person of otherwise bad character  as it is defined in the Act  should be allowed to travel to or remain in Australia         Emphases added    For the Minister  it is said that the approach for the applicant to the interpretation of s  b  is to impose limitations in the section  which do not exist  and which could have been easily imposed if the legislature had so intended   However  the submissions by the Minister attribute to the applicant a desire to introduce limitations  which in fact the applicant does not seek to do  The Minister s submissions assert that the section does not say that the visa holder need be a member of a group or organisation  nor a participant in criminal activity  nor does the section say that the association of the visa holder with the person  group  or organisation  need be an ideological or criminal association  or an association by which the visa holder or applicant would benefit from the criminal activity  Moreover  the section does not say that the circumstances identified have to be such as to reflect adversely on the character of the visa holder or applicant  All of this may be accepted consideredMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   Thus in Schlieske v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   the Full Court of the Federal Court  Fox  Wilcox and French JJ  held that where a particular deportee was wanted by authorities in West Germany  of which he was a national  Australian authorities were entitled to do everything necessary for the enforcement of a deportation order under the Act  but were not entitled to go beyond that  In particular  the Court held that to deport a person to a particular country for the purpose of presenting a person to the law enforcement authorities of that country is outside the purposes of the Migration Act    Wilcox and French JJ in their joint judgment said  at       The golden rule is that the Australian authorities are entitled  notwithstanding their knowledge that a particular deportee is wanted in the country of destination  to do everything which is necessary for the enforcement of the Migration Act and the proper implementation of the deportation order  But they are not entitled to go beyond that  and in purported exercise of powers under that Act  to take steps whose only purpose is the bringing to justice of the deportee in a foreign country  At that stage the Australian authorities would not be exercising deportation powers  they would be involved in an unlawful extradition distinguishedPark Oh Ho v Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   In Park Oh Ho v Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   the Full Court of the Federal Court  Sweeney and Foster JJ  Morling J dissenting  held that a deportation order had not been issued for the purpose of securing various persons  removal from Australia  but was to secure their continued detention in custody  so that their evidence would be available in contemplated criminal proceedings   The decision of the Full Court upheld the decision of Davies J at first instance  to declare the deportation orders a nullity and set them aside  The matter went to the High Court  but only on the question of whether the Full Court had been correct in upholding the refusal of Davies J to make a declaration of unlawfulness  It was on this basis that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court was reversed consideredPark Oh Ho v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   In the High Court  Park Oh Ho v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR    Mason CJ  Deane  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ  referred to the findings of Davies J  confirmed by the Full Court  that more of the deportation orders had been made by the delegate of the Minister for the legitimate purpose of giving effect to a decision that a prohibited non citizen should be deported as soon as appropriate arrangements for that deportation could be made  and that each had been made for the impermissible purpose of detaining the particular appellant in custody so that his evidence would be available in the criminal proceedings  and the conclusion of Davies J that the deportations were all intrinsically flawed   Their Honours noted at     Davies J  held that each of them  the deportation orders   should be treated as a nullity  and ordered that they be  set aside ab initio     A decision by the Minister to cancel a visa on character grounds under s   of the Migration Act   validly made  has the result of the visa thereupon ceases to be in effect  s   of the Migration Act   Thereafter  the person to whom the visa is issued is an unlawful non citizen  in the terms of sections   and   of the Migration Act   is liable to detention under s   of the Migration Act   and for removal from Australia under s   of the Migration Act    As a consequence of s  E   no further application for the grant of a visa can be made by the person whose visa has been cancelled  The only exception  pursuant to s  E a    is an application for a protection visa  Because the person cannot  after cancellation  obtain a visa  that person s status has been determined for all time  That person is an unlawful non citizen liable to detention and removal from Australia citedSydney Municipal Council

v Lebanese Moslem Association     FCR   Pincus J  at   found it  hard to resist  drawing certain inferences that assisted the applicants in that case  This was despite the fact that Senior Counsel to the respondent Minister argued  so Pincus J said   with some cogency that performance of his ministerial duties would be impractical if he were to spend substantial amounts of time in courts being cross examined about his decisions   After stating  at   that Pincus J only hesitantly concluded in Lebanese Moslem Association that the rule applied to Ministers not giving evidence  Callinan J said  at     It is unnecessary to decide in this case whether the rule should have application to a Minister in modern times  But on any view it cannot be applied in any unqualified way to a modern Minister of State  and not just for the reasons that Pincus J described as cogent  Considerations of public interest immunity may loom large in some cases  A Minister is a policymaker and policy advocate as well as a decision maker  Further  the statement of principle in Jones v Dunkel is no more than a particular instance of the old rule stated by Lord Mansfield in Blatch v Archer and cited recently by this Court in Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council   that evidence has to be weighed according to the circumstances of  as well as the capacity of  a party to adduce it   However  in most  if not all
