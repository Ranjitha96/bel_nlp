Minister for Environment Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedMinister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSection   is very similar to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TP Act   The joint submissions note that in Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree  No     FCA     Greentree   Sackville J said that the appropriate approach to imposing pecuniary penalties under s   of the EPBC Act is the same as that under s   of the TP Act  subject to any necessary adaptations specific to the relevant type of damage caused  The parties contended that I should adopt his Honour s approach  and I shall do so  The joint submissions note that the Court has considered the amount of the pecuniary penalty to be imposed pursuant to the EPBC Act in several recent cases  In Greentree   a corporate entity contravened s   of the EPBC Act by taking the deliberate action of clearing  ploughing and subsequently sowing wheat that had a significant impact on the ecological character of a declared Ramsar wetland  The maximum penalties were the same under s   of the EPBC Act as apply to the present conduct  Sackville J found that the contravening conduct was deliberate  as the respondents  as a corporate entity and its director  carried out the contravening conduct when they were well aware that any unauthorised action had a significant impact on the ecological character of the Ramsar wetlands site and would constitute a contravention of the EPBC Act  The deliberate conduct was found to be more than an isolated act of the kind that might occur as the result of an impulsive error of judgment  and that it was planned conduct  The nature and extent of the contraventions of the EPBC Act suggested that substantial pecuniary penalties were warranted  The personal respondent was ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty of   and the corporate respondent was ordered to pay    The parties jointly submit that the Court should consider the first respondent s conduct as more serious than the relevant conduct in Wilson and Warne   but less serious than that in Greentree   Whilst that analysis may reflect the comparative degrees of culpability  it is not clear how the comparison leads to the proposed and agreed penalty  The submissions further note that the proposed penalty equates to approximately   of the maximum penalty which could be imposed upon an individual pursuant to s   of the EPBC Act  The parties jointly submit that this is relevant to the assessment of penalty in light of the second respondent s role in the conduct of the first respondent and that any penalty upon the first respondent is essentially a penalty upon the second respondent  They draw support for that contention from the decision in Greentree   I do not accept that contention  Greentree relevantly concerned charges against a company and its director where the company was effectively a  one man  company  and the personal respondent was its sole director and sole shareholder  Sackville J noted  at     I infer that Mr Greentree will bear the burden of any diminution of Auen s assets that will result from the imposition of a pecuniary penalty on the company  It is appropriate to take that fact into account in order to prevent Mr Greentree being punished  in effect  twice over  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd  No     FCA         ALR     at     per Finkelstein J  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler   NSWSC         ACSR     at         per Santow J  On the other hand  Auen has been involved in a deliberate contravention of s   of the EPBC Act   The contravening conduct was undertaken in Auen s commercial interests  It is also necessary to bear in mind that the maximum penalties that can be imposed on a corporation are ten times larger than the penalties that can be imposed on individuals who contravene the EPBC Act   The overall pecuniary penalty should obviously be no less than if Auen  a corporation  had been the sole contravenor  On the contrary  the overall penalty should reflect the fact that Mr Greentree  as well as Auen  has contravened s   of the EPBC Act   His Honour first fixed the pecuniary penalty payable by the personal respondent  It was about   of the maximum  He then said at     Having regard to the maximum penalty applicable to a contravention by an individual  I think that a pecuniary penalty of   should be imposed on Mr Greentree  Had Auen been the only contravenor  taking into account its status as a private company and the higher maximum penalty applicable to a contravention by a corporation  I would have imposed a penalty in the order of    Having regard to the desirability of avoiding penalising Mr Greentree twice over  I think that Auen should pay a penalty of    In my view  the total penalty of   is appropriate in the circumstances of the case     That does not amount to his Honour determining the penalty imposed on the company as if it were an individual  The contrary is the case  His Honour recognised that a significant penalty should be imposed on the company having regard to the higher applicable maximum  The amount he would have ordered was  however  reduced somewhat for the reasons explained in that passage  In this matter  there is no penalty to be imposed on the second respondent  It is appropriate to impose a penalty on the first respondent as a corporation  having regard to the applicable maximum  It is the sole contravenor against whom a penalty is sought  It is not appropriate to adopt the lesser maximum applicable to individuals because the second respondent  its managing director  was the person who decided upon and arranged for the clearance of the vegetation on its behalf  Of course  that is not to say its individual circumstances should not be considered  It would be appropriate to take into account in the present circumstances that any penalty imposed on the first respondent is effectively a penalty imposed on the second respondent  if the second respondent were also the subject of a pecuniary penalty  in order to avoid the second respondent being punished  twice over   Here  the applicant no longer seeks orders against the second respondent  In these proceedings  the second respondent will not personally be the subject of a pecuniary penalty  Another factor raised by the parties The joint submissions refer to the fact that the first respondent did not make a profit from reselling the property  and submit this is a relevant factor in assessing the appropriate pecuniary penalty  In Greentree   Sackville J noted at   that    It is true that the evidence does not suggest that either Mr Greentree or Auen reaped a substantial financial reward from the development of the Windella Ramsar site  That is a factor to take into account     His Honour made that remark because it was part of the picture about why those respondents took the actions they did  He went on to note that the contravening conduct was motivated by commercial considerations  It may be a relevant factor to take into account  if the first respondent undertook the land clearing for commercial reasons  that it did or did not profit by virtue of the contravening conduct  However  I do not consider that the fact that  since the contravening conduct  the property has been resold at a loss is of any especial significance  There may be many reasons for that  It is unlikely to have become less valuable because its cropping potential was increased by the contravening conduct  There is certainly no evidence on that topic  It may be that it was resold at a lower value because the market generally had fallen  It may be that the first respondent had disposed of certain water rights attaching to it  It may be  although it is unlikely  that the property was allowed to run down  Without evidence  the reason for the lower resale value of the property is simply unexplained  If the focus is on the profitability of cropping the illegally cleared land  again there is no evidence to indicate whether the particular cleared land was cropped at a profit or a loss  compared to the more generally available cropping area citedTrade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR    In Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR     at     French J  as he then was  identified the following additional considerations as being relevant to the level of pecuniary penalty imposed  including  the size of the contravening company  the degree of power it has  as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market  the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended  whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level  whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act  as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention  and whether the company has shown a disposition to co operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention    Obviously  the second of those matters is inapt in relation to a contravention of s   of the EPBC Act  and possibly so too is the fifth of those matters citedNW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR  http www
