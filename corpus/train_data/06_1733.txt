Dellios v Zegarac   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedJess v Scott     FCR   In Jess v Scott     FCR   at   a Full Court discussed the meaning of  special reasons  in O   r   and said that it is        an expression describing a flexible discretionary power  but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure  in the particular circumstances  from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served   In this matter Ms Zegarac has not  in her affidavit accompanying her notice of motion  advanced any persuasive reason why she did not seek to appeal from the judgment of Phipps FM by the time allowed under the rules of Court  or before   November    Indeed no reasonable explanation for the delay has been advanced  There was no reason for her to wait for authentication of the order of Phipps FM before appealing  In any event  she had   days after her receipt of the orders to apply to appeal or apply to extend the time in which to seek leave to appeal  The delay is not slight but almost a year in circumstances where she has taken other legal steps in the legal dispute between her and Mr Dellios followedLow v Commonwealth   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Low v Commonwealth   FCA     the Court declined to extend the time within which to appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate in circumstances where the proposed appeal was bound to fail   Apart from leave not being granted because of the lack of a reasonable explanation of the delay  I am also of the view that the current proposed appeal is bound to fail for the reasons set out below   Phipps FM declined to set aside the bankruptcy notice because he was not satisfied that Ms Zegarac had a counterclaim  set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of her judgment debt or a counterclaim that could not have been set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained  see s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act   His Honour also refused to grant Ms Zegarac an extension of time in which to comply with the bankruptcy notice under s  a    His Honour retraced the history of the controversy which led to the proceeding before him  He noted that Mr Dellios acted for Ms Zegarac in Supreme Court proceedings concerning a property dispute with her de facto husband  A dispute ensued between Ms Zegarac and Mr Dellios about fees which Mr Dellios alleged to be owing to her  Mr Dellios obtained a judgment against Ms Zegarac in the Magistrates Court of Victoria at Heidelberg  His Honour  Cashmore M heard the matter  During the proceeding  Ms Zegarac applied for leave to file a counterclaim alleging professional negligence against Mr Dellios  Cashmore M refused leave for the counterclaim to issue but during the course of his reasons for judgment  rejected Ms Zegarac s allegation that Mr Dellios had engaged in professional negligence   Phipps FM noted that an appeal from the order of Cashmore M was dismissed by Cummins J in the Supreme Court of Victoria on   June    His Honour also referred to Ms Zegarac s commencement of a proceeding in the Magistrates Court of Victoria alleging professional negligence against Mr Dellios  That proceeding also raises allegations of defamatory conduct against him   On   April   after publication of the judgment of Phipps FM  Magistrate Smith of the Magistrates Court of Victoria struck out Ms Zegarac s claim in which she made allegations of professional negligence and defamation  By an application dated   June   she has applied to set aside the orders of Smith M  That matter is yet to be heard by the Supreme Court   Since the refusal of Phipps FM to set aside the bankruptcy notice  the following relevant events have also occurred      On   May   Mussett R heard the creditor s petition and made a sequestration order     On   June   Ms Zegarac filed an application to review the exercise of power by the Registrar   The hearing of that review is scheduled for next Friday   December       On   July   Ryan J declined to grant a stay of the sequestration order  but noted the undertaking of Mr Dellios to consent to the adjournment of the unresolved Supreme Court proceeding until the hearing and determination of the review   At   of his reasons for judgment  Phipps FM said     This issue is whether Ms Zegarac has a counterclaim set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt which she could not have set up in the proceeding in which it was obtained     There is no challenge to that aspect of his Honour s reasoning  However  Ms Zegarac contends that his Honour erred in saying that the professional negligence claim was one which was or could have been set up before Cashmore M  There is no basis for that contention  His Honour correctly held that that claim could have been brought before Cashmore M  In fact  Ms Zegarac applied for it to be before him  Although that application was formally refused  he dealt with and rejected her claims of professional negligence in his reasons for judgment  Phipps FM correctly stated at   that        the important thing  for the purposes of s  g  is that it is a claim which could have been raised      I agree  Importantly  it was not a counterclaim that could not have been set up in the proceeding before Cashmore M   His Honour below  in effect  described the defamation claim as inchoate in the sense that the basis for it has not been set out in Ms Zegarac s claim in the Magistrates Court of Victoria  This is the same claim which Smith M later struck out  Importantly  Phipps FM said at   that     Ms Zegarac    does not show any basis for damages as a result of what she alleges in her defamation claim  and that is an essential part of any set off or counterclaim that is asserted under s  g       I agree with that view   His Honour also held at   consistently with his above views that there was no basis for extending the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice  He dismissed Ms Zegarac s application with costs   Ms Zegarac has not demonstrated any error in his Honour s reasoning in the matter below  I consider the reasoning to be free from doubt such that it would be futile to extend the time within which to allow an appeal to be filed   I will order as follows       Paragraphs           and   of the respondent debtor s motion of   November   is dismissed      The respondent debtor pay the applicant creditor s and trustees  costs of  and associated with the motion   Middleton J previously
