Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedWhite Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Lindgren J has recently collected the cases on the meaning and effect of s  A and comparable provisions  White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at         where he considered the test to be whether there are  real  as opposed to  fanciful  or  merely arguable  prospects   Lilly s motion gives rise to three issues  The first is the viability of the applicant s claim to relief under s   of the Trade Practices Act   The second is whether the applicant has standing to claim relief under the ADJR Act  s   of the Patents Act and s  B of the Judiciary Act   The third is whether  assuming it has standing  it should be denied relief because of its delay  In a s  A context  in each case the question is whether the Court is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the applicant succeeding in the relevant claim or issue   The applicant alleges that in applying for an extension of the term of the Patent  Lilly represented to the first respondent  the Commissioner  that the pharmaceutical substance on the ARTG on which it relied was disclosed in claims   to   and   of the Patent  The applicant alleges that these representations were made in trade and commerce and were false followedGlueck v Stang     IPR   In Glueck v Stang     IPR   the applicant alleged that Novopharm  in trade or commerce  engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent  At   to   Lindgren J said  The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO     were not made in trade or commerce  They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand  and     the APO     on the other hand  Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO      Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts      The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation  No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non s   sense  However  in Concrete Constructions the High Court     rejected the view that the expression  in trade or commerce  in s   referred to the  immense field of activities  in which corporations may engage in the course of  or for the purposes of  carrying on some overall trading or commercial business       The applicant sought to distinguish the present case from Glueck on the ground that the facts of the two cases were different  That is true  but the proposition derived by Lindgren J from the authorities referred to is applicable here  Essentially that is because of the passage in Concrete Constructions at   upon which Glueck was based  in which it was said  What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons  be they consumers or not  with whom it     has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which  of their nature  bear a trading or commercial character   It is that relationship that is absent here  I am not persuaded that Glueck is plainly wrong  and accordingly I should follow it appliedConcrete Constructions  NSW  Pty Ltd v Nelson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The course of authority to which Lindgren J referred consisted of

Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd   FCAFC         IPR   at   the Full Court referred to the observations of McLelland J in a trade mark context in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd     NSWLR   at     Ritz   and said   Adapting  that language to the design context  the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged and thus would include any person who would be or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his or her being  appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense  by the entry not being expunged   I return to the Assa Abloy test recorded at    Adapted to the present case  the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the applicant would be disadvantaged in the sense that it would be prevented from exploiting the invention in any of the respects falling within the definition of  exploit  in the Patents Act   That includes a number of things preparatory to placing a product in the marketplace  Matters falling within the concept of  launching  a product include importing  keeping for the purpose of offering for sale  and using  In my view the fair reading of par   of Mr Gray s affidavit is that propounded by the applicant  Nor do I think the use of the word  marketing  in par   of that affidavit bears the emphasis Lilly places on it  All Mr Gray is saying is that in order successfully to sell a product  that is to say make money out of it  PBS listing is essential  As appears from   and   the applicant has pleaded only that it has not yet obtained TGA approval  believes it will obtain it in late   or early   and will not import and sell the product until it receives TGA registration  It does not plead PBS listing as a precondition  The Assa Abloy test speaks of the existence of a reasonable possibility of disadvantage  For the purposes of a s  A application  I am not satisfied that that possibility does not exist  I am not persuaded that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the ADJR  s   and s  A parts of the proceeding by reason of a lack of standing   Section  c  of the ADJR Act provides that an application for an order of review in relation to a written decision  that was furnished to the applicant  must be lodged within the prescribed period or within such further time as the court allows  Under sub s   the prescribed period is the period commencing on the day on which the decision is made and ending on the   th day after the decision is  furnished to the applicant   Subsection   provides that where no period is prescribed  the court may refuse to entertain an application if of the opinion that the application was not made within a reasonable time after the decision was made  In forming an opinion for the purposes of subs   the court is to have regard to the time at which the applicant became aware of the making of the decision  subs  a  consideredRitz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd     NSWLR   In Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd   FCAFC         IPR   at   the Full Court referred to the observations of McLelland J in a trade mark context in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd     NSWLR   at     Ritz   and said   Adapting  that language to the design context  the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged

being expunged followedAustralian Foreman Stevedores Association v Crone     FCR   In my view delay in relation to the ADJR part of the proceeding is to be determined under s   and   and not under subs    In this case the applicant discovered the existence of the decision through its own resources  I agree with Pincus J in Australian Foreman Stevedores Association v Crone     FCR   that the expression  furnished to the applicant  contemplates delivery specifically to the applicant by the decision maker  Accordingly the matter is to be approached under subss   and     It is common ground that the alleged delay in relation to the s   and s  B parts of the case are to be dealt with on the same basis as the ADJR aspect  so that relief may be refused if application was not made within a reasonable time   A chronology of the relevant events will assist in understanding the parties  contentions on delay     January   Extension of term granted   March   Applicant incorporated May
