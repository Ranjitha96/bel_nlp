Mentha  in the matter of Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedRe Diamond Press Australia Pty Limited   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The principles which apply to an application for an extension of time to convene and hold a second meeting of creditors have been considered in a series of cases commencing with a decision of Young J in Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd     ACSR   at    The principle applied by Young J was also stated in Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Limited   NSWSC   at   by Barrett J  His Honour said that  The function of the Court on an application such as this is   to strike an appropriate balance between   the expectation that the administration would be a relatively speedy and summary matter and   the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders   Barrett J observed at   of Diamond Press that experience suggests that transactions of the kind contemplated in that case do take time  particularly where an informal tender or competitive selling process is undertaken and structured due diligence procedures are adopted  His Honour said that all of those matters are conducive to the aims of s  A b  of the Act and that they would allow the administrators to present a clearer picture to the second meeting  It seems to me that his Honour s observations are particularly apt in the circumstances of this case followedFincorp Group Holdings Pty Limited     ACSR   In Fincorp Group Holdings Pty Limited     ACSR   Barrett J granted an extension of time  the effect of which was that the convening period set by s  A would be some three months longer than if the extension had not been granted  His Honour in that case at   and   pointed to the complexity of the sale process as a matter which justified the extension referred toHayes  in the matter of Estate Property Group Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Hayes  in the matter of Estate Property Group Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA     Gyles J took a slightly different approach from that which was adopted in the cases referred to above  His Honour made orders extending the convening period for up to   days but he reserved consideration of any application to further extend the period if a case were made out for such a further extension  His Honour said he would then exercise the power provided for by s  A   See also Hall  in the matter of Australian Capital Reserve Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA   at      The effect of the approach taken by Gyles J  if adopted in the present case  would be for an extension of time to be dealt with in stages and that is a matter I have considered carefully in considering the application that was made to me this morning   It seems to me that there are three reasons why I ought to grant the extension of up to   days as sought by the administrators rather than to adopt the staged process suggested by Gyles J   The first reason is that the cases indicate that an extension of two and a half to three months is not unusual where there is a relatively complex sale process  Bearing in mind the intervention of the holiday period  it seems to me that the effect of the orders which are presently sought is to grant an extension of up to two and a half months  because the Christmas and New Year holiday period intervenes and it is not unusual for a period of up to two working weeks to be lost as a result of that holiday period   Second  I have taken into account that Mr McMaster considers that if the sale process is completed in a shorter period of time than is currently anticipated  the administrators will immediately look to convene a meeting of creditors because there is no value in prolong the process for any longer than is necessary  That is the importance of the extension for  up to    days rather than for a fixed period of   days  It allows a degree of flexibility  which would not otherwise be available in accordance with the process contemplated by s  A      and    I accept Mr McMaster s opinion and I note that the statements made by the two creditors who oppose an extension for up to   days seem to proceed upon the basis that there will actually be an extension to   March   whereas in truth  what is proposed is that the extension be for up to   days  Accordingly  as Mr McMaster has said  if he is able to do so  he will convene the meeting of creditors earlier than   March     It seems to me that there is a benefit to the administration in extending the convening period only once rather than adopting the staged process suggested by Gyles J  That is not to say that in an appropriate case the process contemplated by Gyles J would not be suitable  But in this case where the administrators are of the view that the company will be able to meet post appointment cash flow  in effect  obtaining the benefit of the moratorium period provided for in Pt    A   the staged process would not be of any utility  Indeed  it would be costly in the administration and would divert resources from the completion and attention to the details of the sale process which is now being undertaken   I have already referred to the fact that extension is not for a fixed period  but is for a period of up to   days  and that Mr McMaster says if he is able to do so  he will convene the meeting of creditors at the earliest possible time  He does not wish to prolong the process unnecessarily  Mr McMaster is an experienced administrator and I consider that I ought to act upon the statement set out in   of his affidavit   For these reasons  I propose to make the orders set forth in   to   of the short minutes of order which I have signed and dated and placed with the

More recently in Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd   NSWSC   at     Barrett J reiterated the principles referred to above  His Honour said at   of Lehman Brothers that a matter to be considered closely in such an application is the impact that prolongation of the administration will have on persons whose claims are affected by the statutory moratoriums arising from Pt    A of the Act referred toMann v
