html  The appellant did not advance any reason why the Parliament would have intended the Act to be construed in a way which prevented the tribunal from coming to a decision in an applicant for review s favour before a hearing either on reconsideration of the original material before it or on subsequently becoming aware  say  of country information  perhaps recent or up to date or from conducting another review  which supported a result favourable to that applicant  This beneficial construction is open  There is no reason to reject it  ASIC v DB Management Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at          appliedMinister for Immigration v SZFML   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Neither counsel was able to refer to any decision directly on point  However  in Minister for Immigration v SZFML   FCAFC         FCR   at           Spender  French and Cowdroy JJ considered the operation of Div   of Pt   of the Act in the context where an applicant for review had instructed her migration agent that she wished to attend a hearing of the tribunal in response to its invitation under s     but the agent  purportedly on her behalf informed the tribunal that she did not wish to appear   Their Honours referred to the fact that the tribunal had followed a similar administrative procedure to that used here  It had combined the invitation under s   with a notification of the date  time and place of the appearance pursuant to s  A    SZFML   FCR at      They went on to consider what they identified as the  logical structure of ss   and  A    They held that this involved the following theoretical sequence   SZFML   FCR at             The tribunal considers whether it should decide the review in the applicant s favour on the basis of the material before it  If it so finds  it can make the decision immediately and end the review  Otherwise it has to issue an invitation unless one or other of the conditions in ss  b  or  c  is satisfied     The tribunal asks the applicant for review whether he or she consents to it deciding a review without him or her appearing before it  If that consent is given  the applicant is not entitled to appear and the tribunal can then proceed to decide the review     However  if the applicant does not give that consent  the tribunal must consider whether ss  C  of   applies to him or her  and if not  then the invitation must be issued     The tribunal must give the applicant notice of the day on which  and the time and place at which he or she is scheduled to appear  A minimum time between the giving of that notice and the actual hearing is prescribed in Reg    D     If the applicant does not appear at the hearing  then the tribunal is authorised to make a decision on the review without any further steps to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it     Notwithstanding the above  the tribunal has a discretion to reschedule an applicant s appearance before it   In SZFML   FCR at         the applicant s migration agent had notified the tribunal that the applicant for review had consented to it deciding the review without her appearing before it  in circumstances where she had not authorised the agent to do so  Their Honour s said   SZFML   FCR at        No question of the application of s  A arises  That provision only operates where an applicant has been invited to appear before the Tribunal and does not appear at the time and place at which the applicant is scheduled to appear  In this case the Tribunal proceeded on the basis of the apparent consent tendered on behalf of SZFML   It did not proceed on the basis of her non appearance at a scheduled hearing   Thus  Spender  French and Cowdroy JJ analysed the situation as one in which the tribunal had proceeded on the basis of the apparent consent pursuant to s  b  rather than on the basis that the applicant for review had not appeared at the hearing  see also SZFML   FCR at      Earlier their Honours had referred to Applicant NAFF   v Minister for Immigration   HCA         CLR   at   where McHugh  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ said at               Although the Tribunal was obliged to provide an informal mechanism of review  s     and although the Tribunal was not bound by  technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence   s  a    the Act established important requirements of a substantive kind  several of which were designed to ensure that applicants for review received procedural fairness  The duty of the Tribunal under s   to review the delegate s decision  which arose once the appellant had applied for review  continued until one of the outcomes described in s   was arrived at  for example  the affirming  the varying or the setting aside of the decision        One aspect of the overall duty to review was the duty to invite the appellant to give evidence and present arguments  s    The duty to review therefore entailed a statutory duty to consider the arguments presented and in that way to afford the appellant procedural fairness  That implied that if the Tribunal thought that the arguments had been presented so inadequately that the review could not be completed until further steps had been directed and performed  it could not be peremptorily concluded by the making of a decision before that direction was complied with or withdrawn   The Minister argued that the response to the invitation to hearing form and his Honour s finding demonstrated that the appellant had consented under s  b  to the tribunal deciding the review without him appearing before it  He pointed to what Spender  French and Cowdroy JJ had said in SZFML   FCR at     namely that where one of the conditions set out in s   is satisfied  the entitlement to appear before a tribunal established under s   either did not come into existence or ceased to exist and the tribunal s duty to invite the applicant for review to appear before it was thus discharged  The appellant riposted that the structure of s   implied that the consent referred to in s  b  had to antedate the issue of the invitation and that once issued the invitation could not be withdrawn   I do not accept the appellant s argument  After issuing an invitation but before the date of the hearing  the tribunal could decide the review in favour of the applicant for review  If it did that  further conduct of the review would be otiose  Not only would there be no need for a hearing but there would be nothing for the applicant for review to put to the tribunal  since the decision already made by it would have granted the applicant what he or she had applied to get in the first place  A reconsideration by the tribunal after issuing an invitation to a hearing under s   resulting in a decision to grant the applicant for review a protection visa would enable the tribunal to pursue the objective in s   of providing a mechanism of review that  among other things  was quick  There would be no purpose in continuing to a hearing or suspending the notification to the applicant for review of the favourable decision until some future time simply because  the earlier review of the tribunal was that a hearing ought to take place  A saving of the tribunal s time  public expense  and  possibly  expense for the applicant would ensue from the immediate notification of a favourable decision prior to the scheduled hearing date   Again  it is difficult to see any purpose in the legislative scheme to require the tribunal to go through the empty form of holding a hearing when it had been informed by the applicant for review that he or she consented to the tribunal deciding the review without him or her appearing before it  even after the invitation to attend the review had been issued  Such a consent  if given after the applicant for review has been informed that the tribunal did not consider that it should decide the review in the applicant s favour on the material before it and thus wished to invite him or her to a hearing so as to persuade it to the contrary  would be an informed consent to a decision being made against the interests of the applicant  Such a consent engages the operation of s   so that after it has been given the applicant is no longer entitled to appear before the tribunal  As Spender  French and Cowdroy JJ considered  once the applicant for review consents to the tribunal deciding the review without him or her appearing before it  the tribunal can proceed under ss  b  and   to determine the application for review on the basis of the consent  SZFML   FCR at      Their Honours distinguished that mode of the tribunal proceeding from its acting on the basis of the power to decide the review under s  A  following the non appearance of an applicant  The applicant for review by rejecting an invitation to appear under s     can waive his or her right to a hearing  That has the effect of an applicant for review consenting to the tribunal deciding the matter without him or her appearing before it   For these reasons  the tribunal was entitled to proceed on the basis that the applicant had consented to it determining the review pursuant to s  b    The appellant also argued that by dint of s  B    if a decision is not made orally or the applicant is not in immigration detention  s  B    the date of any decision of the tribunal is the date on which it is handed down  He argued that this provision had the effect of deeming the decision to have been made on a date different to that which it actually records as being the date on which it was made  The appellant argued that until a decision to which s  B  applied was handed down  the tribunal could change its mind on the course or decision it had previously decided to adopt citedMinister for Immigration v Bhardwaj     CLR   Similarly  as Minister for Immigration v Bhardwaj     CLR   held  a decision affected by jurisdictional error is treated as being no decision at all  see also Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth     CLR   at     per Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ   There  the tribunal had made a decision in ignorance of a medical certificate provided by the applicant

unjustifiably allows an inferior court to proceed to judgment in excess of its jurisdiction without having set up the objection  The conduct of a party seeking the remedy of prohibition is relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant it  see Zimpel v Allard   HCA         CLR   at   per Griffith CJ  Barton and O Connor JJ applying Willes J s advice to the House of Lords in Mayor of London v
