ALR   is a contrary example appliedBoston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt will be seen that the provision requires an assessment of the prospect of Mr Habib s proceeding being successful  If this prospect is less than reasonable the Court may give judgment on the proceeding to the respondent  The insertion of subsection   has altered the pre existing position that only proceedings which are hopeless or bound to fail should be dismissed  Nevertheless  it is a jurisdiction to be exercised with caution  Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at     per Rares J  The Commonwealth also applies to strike out various portions of the pleading pursuant to O   r   which relates to pleadings said not to disclose a reasonable cause of action or which are otherwise embarrassing  In relation to both s  A and O   r   it is appropriate to assume in Mr Habib s favour that he would succeed at trial in proving each and every allegation of fact contained in the pleading  The Commonwealth s argument is that  even making that assumption  the proceeding cannot succeed  For present purposes the contents of the pleading may be summarised as containing the following sets of allegations   a  allegations that Mr Habib was wrongfully arrested in Pakistan by the Pakistani and US governments in October    b  allegations of his torture whilst in Pakistan at the hands of the Pakistani authorities   c  allegations of extraordinary rendition to Egypt and allegations of torture at the hands of Egyptian authorities   d  allegations of his removal from Egypt to Afghanistan and thence to Guantanamo Bay   e  allegations of mistreatment by the US government at Guantanamo Bay   f  allegations that the Commonwealth was aware that Mr Habib was to be the subject of a rendition to Egypt and that  to the Commonwealth s knowledge  this would most likely involve torture   g  allegations that the Commonwealth made no effort to secure his release from Egypt notwithstanding its awareness that he was being  or was very likely being  tortured there   h  allegations that the Commonwealth provided the Egyptian authorities with information and documents that the Commonwealth had obtained from Mr Habib s home in Australia which the Commonwealth either knew or should have known would be used in his torture   i  allegations that the Commonwealth failed to take any sufficient steps to procure his release from Guantanamo Bay   j  allegations that an officer or officers of the Commonwealth interrogated Mr Habib in Guantanamo Bay whilst he was shackled to the floor   k  allegations that following his return to Australia he was persecuted and harassed by the Commonwealth by its assisting the publisher of the Daily Telegraph in a defamation suit brought by Mr Habib against that publisher and  additionally  by denying him a passport   l  allegations of defamation by the Commonwealth constituted  generally  by statements by its officials that Mr Habib was a terrorist citedBreen v Williams     CLR  Even assuming those obstacles could be overcome  Mr Habib s case on the breach of the alleged duty is conceptually deficient for the purpose for which his advisers seek to advance it  In the written submissions it was submitted on his behalf as follows   As Gaudron and McHugh JJ note  at   in Breen v Williams the fiduciary s obligations under Australian law are proscriptive not prescriptive  but this does not permit the choice of a course which conflicts with either the duty owed or the dependence of the Applicant on the Respondent  In the present case a choice to decline to take steps favourable to the Applicant inevitably placed the Respondent in a position of conflict given the trust the Applicant placed in the Respondent with the Applicant abandoned to obvious unlawful detention and  rendition   But the nature of the  position of conflict  was left unexplained  Equity imposes upon fiduciaries a duty of undivided loyalty  Maguire v Makaronis   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  The duty is the obligation to avoid being placed in a position where that undivided loyalty might be challenged  The breach of duty arises merely from being placed in the position of conflict and does not require that the conflict be acted upon  Thus the  no conflict  rule is infringed where a fiduciary occupies a position where his self interest and the duty to the beneficiary conflict  Warman International Ltd v Dwyer   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  It is also infringed where the fiduciary takes upon herself conflicting obligations  Breen v

Navigation Company Ltd v Attorney General     Ll L Rep  The Commonwealth s submission was that it could not possibly be said that it had acted for  or on behalf of  Mr Habib  This submission is too simplistic  It is accepted that there is some kind of duty owed by the State to its overseas nationals  For example  in Mutasa v Attorney General   QB   at     Boreham J spoke of the Crown having a duty to protect a citizen from unlawful detention but of that duty being one of imperfect obligation and thus unenforceable  So too  in China Navigation Company Ltd v Attorney General     Ll L Rep

criticisms which have been made of the present position I could not possibly say that Giller was clearly wrong  Accordingly  I am bound to follow it  I am therefore faced with two quite different harassment cases each being seriously flawed  The current pleading does not allege psychiatric damage sufficient to constitute physical harm  While the mental and psychological distress it does allege is capable of being seen as flowing from the Commonwealth s behaviour towards Mr Habib upon his return to Australia  the decision in Giller renders this claim untenable  On the other hand  the proposed pleading suggests that the harassment is constituted by the Commonwealth s actions prior to his arrival back in Australia but that harassment is not said to be causative of any loss  Both pleadings are deficient in form  It is plain  I think  that the harassment allegation must be struck out  The question is whether leave to replead should be granted  I deal with that issue at the end

Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe application is made by an amended notice of motion filed   July   and seeks the summary dismissal of the proceeding  The current form of Mr Habib s pleading is the third further amended statement of claim which I shall refer to as  the pleading   Leave to file the pleading was granted on   October   but  as was made clear on the occasion of that grant of leave  this was on the basis that the Commonwealth s complaints about the pleading s predecessor would be taken as standing against the pleading  Habib v Commonwealth of

Court of Australia Act    Cth  for judgment in relation to all but one part of Mr Habib s case on the basis that the proceedings have no reasonable prospect of success  Section  A provides    Summary judgment     The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if   a  the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the

referred toHamdan v Rumsfeld   US    A written submission was received connecting the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions to the negligence case but  contrary to the grant of leave  not to the misfeasance in a public office case  The Commonwealth submitted  correctly I think  that no case was being put by Mr Habib based on the Geneva Conventions insofar as the tort of misfeasance in a public office was concerned  I am bound to accept that submission  There is  therefore  no occasion to consider whether Mr Habib was a prisoner of war covered by the Third Geneva Convention  or a civilian covered by the Fourth Geneva Convention  an enemy combatant  as the Commonwealth submitted at the hearing  or simply a person not covered by either Convention because there was no armed conflict in Pakistan at the time Mr Habib was detained  as the Commonwealth submitted in writing   Nor is there any need to consider the impact of Article   of the Third Geneva Convention which  on one view  requires the protection of that Convention to be afforded to a person whose status is unclear until such time as that status is determined by a competent tribunal  cf Hamdan v Rumsfeld   US

possibly be said that it had acted for  or on behalf of  Mr Habib  This submission is too simplistic  It is accepted that there is some kind of duty owed by the State to its overseas nationals  For example  in Mutasa v Attorney General   QB   at     Boreham J spoke of the Crown having a duty to protect a citizen from unlawful detention but of that duty being one of imperfect obligation and thus unenforceable  So too  in China Navigation Company Ltd v Attorney General     Ll L Rep   at   Rowlatt J spoke of an alleged duty to assist a citizen against piracy as being but a  political  duty  cf  Hicks v Ruddock   FCA         FCR   at           per Tamberlin J  Thus  it is a little glib to say that there was no aspect of the relationship between Mr Habib and the Commonwealth which could involve it in potentially  acting  on his behalf  I have no doubt that the first duty does not exist  in the sense that it is not a  duty at law  although it may exist as an unenforceable political duty of imperfect obligation  Hicks v Ruddock   FCA         FCR   at           per Tamberlin J  To embark upon a substantive consideration of whether the foreign policy steps taken by the Commonwealth were reasonable would involve this Court in directly examining the merits of Australian foreign policy  For reasons already given  such a duty cannot be countenanced  The duty propounded in the proposed pleading is in a different category  It seeks to avoid the difficulties inherent in pursuing a remedy which requires this Court to pass on the adequacy or otherwise of Australian foreign policy  Instead  it contends only that the Commonwealth owed Mr Habib a duty to consider whether to intercede with the foreign States on his behalf  It is apparent that this novel duty has its origins in this Court s decision in Hicks v Ruddock   FCA         FCR    In that case Tamberlin J refused to strike out a judicial review action brought by a Guantanamo Bay detainee against the Attorney General  He sought to review the Commonwealth s decision not to intervene on his behalf with the US to seek his release  He did so on the basis that the Commonwealth had taken into account certain irrelevant considerations  Tamberlin J refused to strike the case out  The duty pleaded in the proposed pleading arguably does not fall foul of the difficulty outlined in Re Ditfort   To hold that the Commonwealth should have considered whether to intercede on Mr Habib s behalf does not  arguably  involve an impermissible examination of the merits or otherwise of foreign policy  However  Mr Hicks  and Mr Habib s cases are conceptually very different  Mr Hicks sought judicial review of a decision and habeas corpus  Mr Habib seeks damages in tort  Inherent in the claim in tort is much more than Mr Hicks  claim to have the Commonwealth reconsider its position  It is a claim of wrongful conduct causing damage  It must necessarily travel further than a mere claim for reconsideration which claim Hicks v Ruddock holds to be arguable and into territory which requires the Court to reach a conclusion on what the outcome of that reconsideration should have been  Indeed  as Lord Steyn explained at     in Kuwait Airways   the doctrine rests  in part  on the absence of available standards by which to judge the actions of the foreign state involved  Where the potential allegation is that the US and Egypt have committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions a clear standard is available  cf  Hicks v Ruddock   FCA         FCR   at           per Tamberlin J where the potential interaction between the act of State doctrine and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions was examined  For those reasons  I do not think it can be said that the doctrine prevents a misfeasance suit potentially going forward  Indeed  on one view of things  it may well lie in the heart of the exceptions  Conclusionreferred toHospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Commonwealth submitted that no fiduciary duty could arise  There is  of course  no complete or comprehensive statement of what constitutes a fiduciary  However  where a novel fiduciary duty is alleged it is customary to refer to the judgment of Mason J in Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation   HCA         CLR   at     which is in these terms   The accepted fiduciary relationships are sometimes referred to as relationships of trust and confidence or confidential relations  cf  Phipps v  Boardman   UKHL         A C      at p    viz   trustee and beneficiary  agent and principal  solicitor and client  employee and employer  director and company  and partners  The critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense  The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position  The expressions  for   on behalf of  and  in the interests of  signify that the fiduciary acts in a  representative  character in the exercise of his responsibility  to adopt an expression used by the Court of Appeal consideredHunter v Canary Wharf Ltd   UKHL       AC  The authors of The Law of Torts in Australia  th ed  OUP    devote an extensive section advocating a change to this position  They note the existence in the US of a right to recover where a case involves  extreme and outrageous intentional invasions of one s mental and emotional tranquility  citing Alcorn v Anbro Engineering Inc   P d     at     per Burke J  They also note the remarks of Lord Hoffman in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd   UKHL       AC   at   to this effect   The perceived gap in Khorasandjian v  Bush was the absence of a tort of intentional harassment causing distress without actual bodily or psychiatric illness  This limitation is thought to arise out of cases like Wilkinson v  Downton     Q B    and Janvier v  Sweeney     K B     The law of harassment has now been put on a statutory basis  see the Protection from Harassment Act   and it is unnecessary to consider how the common law might have developed  But as at present advised  I see no reason why a tort of intention should be subject to the rule which excludes compensation for mere distress  inconvenience or discomfort in actions based on negligence  see Hicks v  Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police   UKHL         All E R     The policy considerations are quite different  I do not therefore say that Khorasandjian v  Bush was wrongly decided  But it must be seen as a case on intentional harassment  not nuisance appliedKuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Company  Nos   and     UKHL         AC  Each of Mr Habib s claims would require a conclusion that a foreign State had committed grave wrongs  However  I would not regard the act of State doctrine as necessarily applicable to a claim based on misfeasance in a public office  This is because it is arguable that there is an exception to the principle where the acts of the foreign State in question constitute grave breaches of international law  Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Company  Nos   and     UKHL         AC   at     per Lord Nicholls  with whom Lord Hoffman agreed at

Egypt have committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions a clear standard is available  cf  Hicks v Ruddock   FCA         FCR   at           per Tamberlin J where the potential interaction between the act of State doctrine and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions was examined  For those reasons  I do not think it can be said that the doctrine prevents a misfeasance suit potentially going forward  Indeed  on one view of things  it may well lie in the heart of the exceptions  ConclusioncitedMaguire v Makaronis   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBut the nature of the  position of conflict  was left unexplained  Equity imposes upon fiduciaries a duty of undivided loyalty  Maguire v Makaronis   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  The duty is the obligation to avoid being placed in a position where that undivided loyalty might be challenged  The breach of duty arises merely from being placed in the position of conflict and does not require that the conflict be acted upon  Thus the  no conflict  rule is infringed where a fiduciary occupies a position where his self interest and the duty to the beneficiary conflict  Warman International Ltd v Dwyer   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  It is also infringed where the fiduciary takes upon herself conflicting obligations  Breen v Williams     CLR   at   per Gummow J referred toMutasa v Attorney General   QB  The Commonwealth s submission was that it could not possibly be said that it had acted for  or on behalf of  Mr Habib  This submission is too simplistic  It is accepted that there is some kind of duty owed by the State to its overseas nationals  For example  in Mutasa v Attorney General   QB   at     Boreham J spoke of the Crown having a duty to protect a citizen from unlawful detention but of that duty being one of imperfect obligation and thus unenforceable  So too  in China Navigation Company Ltd v Attorney General     Ll L Rep   at   Rowlatt J spoke of an alleged duty to assist a citizen against piracy as being but a  political  duty  cf  Hicks v Ruddock   FCA         FCR   at           per Tamberlin J  Thus  it is a little glib to say that there was no aspect of the relationship between Mr Habib and the Commonwealth which could involve it in potentially  acting  on his behalf appliedNorthern Territory of Australia v Mengel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Commonwealth submits that such a pleading does not allege the elements of the tort of misfeasance in a public office  It is difficult to fault that submission  The tort was discussed by the High Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Mengel   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ  That case establishes that the tort has the following elements   a  an act or omission by a public officer done   i  with intent to harm  or   ii  knowingly in excess of his or her authority  and   b  involving a foreseeable risk of harm  and   c  causing loss or damage  It may be that element  a ii  will be satisfied where an official recklessly disregards the means of ascertaining the extent of his or her power  Mengel at    There is no suggestion in this case that the Commonwealth itself deliberately harmed Mr Habib  All of the actual harm appears to have been caused by the Pakistani  Egyptian and US authorities  So viewed  the matter cannot involve intent to harm in the sense identified in Mengel   The knowledge limb  and its possible extension to the position of an official who recklessly disregards the means of ascertaining the extent of his of her power  directs attention to paragraph   of the pleading which alleges   The respondent gave to Egyptian security officials information and documents including tapes of private telphone conversations  sim cards  a laptop computer  his address book  his Egyptian identity card  files taken from his home including files relating to Raqeem  Kadr  Mohammed Al Asra and Mohammed Dawood and photographs which the respondent knew or should have known would be used by those officials in the course of interrogation of the applicant  involving maltreatment and torture  This allegation might sustain an allegation of misfeasance in a public office if it could be alleged that so acting was beyond the executive power of the Commonwealth and that the officials involved recklessly disregarded the means of ascertaining the limits of their authority  As I have previously said  because s   of the Constitution extends the executive power of the Commonwealth to the maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth  it is beyond that power to facilitate a breach of those laws  Thus  if it could be said that the provision of intelligence by the Commonwealth to the Egyptian authorities for use  to the knowledge of the Commonwealth  in Mr Habib s torture was contrary to Commonwealth law then at least one element of Mengel would be satisfied  During the course of the hearing discussion took place about the operation of the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions  which deal respectively with the protection of prisoners of war and civilians during armed conflicts   Prior to   September   the Geneva Conventions Act    Cth  made  grave breaches  of those Conventions a Commonwealth crime   Grave breaches  under both Conventions included torture and inhuman treatment  Article   and   respectively   The Act had extra territorial operation according to its tenor  s    Section     of the Criminal Code  Cth  had the effect of making it an offence to aid  abet  counsel or procure the commission of those crimes  On   September   the offences created by the Geneva Conventions Act    Cth  were removed from that Act and re enacted as Chapter   Division   of the Criminal Code  Cth   There may be an argument that these offence provisions had the consequence that neither the executive power of the Commonwealth under s   of the Constitution   nor any other source of statutory power such as s   of the Australian Federal Police Act    Cth  or s   of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act    Cth  conferred lawful authority to aid  abet  counsel or procure the torture or inhuman treatment of Mr Habib  With that in mind  I granted leave to Mr Habib s counsel to put on further submissions about the relationship between the Geneva Conventions and the tort of misfeasance in a public office  In the circumstance where none of the constitutive elements of the tort have been pleaded  no explanation of how such a cause of action might operate proffered and an invitation to explore the interaction between the Geneva Conventions and Mengel unaccountably declined  it seems to me that the action must be struck out  In this context  it is also useful to consider the allegation in paragraph   of the proposed pleading that Commonwealth officials interviewed Mr Habib at Guantanamo Bay whilst he was shackled in chains  Whether such actions amount to aiding and abetting within s     of the Criminal Code  Cth  need not be decided  However  one question which might arise is the extent to which the construction of Division   is informed by matters of international law  In that regard  the advance report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism has indicated that  even the mere presence of intelligence personnel at an interview with a person who is being held in places where his rights are violated  can be reasonably understood as implicitly condoning such practices  Martin Scheinin  UN Doc A HRC    at    However  the nature of any such debate does not presently fall for

Misfeasance in a public officeappliedRe Ditfort  Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  NSW      FCR  That the Commonwealth has the power to conduct foreign relations is undoubted  It is conferred by s   of the Constitution on the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor General as her representative  No doubt that power bears many similarities to the similar prerogative power possessed by the Queen in her capacity as the sovereign of the United Kingdom  As Gummow J pointed out in Re Ditfort  Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  NSW      FCR   at   the question in this country is not the content of the prerogative but rather the meaning and operation of s    This has the immediate consequence that the question of whether the executive power extends to a particular topic is a question about the operation of s   and hence is a matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution within the meaning of s  i   And  because s   in turn is concerned with the maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth  it follows that the executive power is subject to those laws  In consequence  the scope and ambit of the executive power existing under s   may  in a particular case  require an examination of the extent to which Commonwealth legislation has intruded into  or perhaps more accurately regulated  that power  In such a case  there would not only be a question of interpretation of s   but also  potentially  a matter arising under a law of the Parliament within the meaning of s  ii  of the Constitution   There are a number of different aspects to that broad principle  First   it is plain that the courts will absolutely abide the executive s views on questions such as the accession of foreign territory  the recognition of a foreign sovereign or the recognition of foreign States and ambassadors  see Chow Hung Ching v The King   HCA         CLR   at   per Latham CJ  Secondly   generally speaking  the issues which arise between nation States are unlikely to generate matters within the meaning of ss   and   of the Constitution for the rights and obligations in that plane do not form part of domestic law  Re Ditfort at   per Gummow J  Thirdly  for related reasons  such questions are usually unable to bring forth a plaintiff who has standing  Re Ditfort at    Fourthly   complaints about the conduct of Australian international relations are likely to take a court into an area which involves the consideration of undertakings or obligations depending entirely on political sanctions  Where that occurs it is generally thought there is no matter in the requisite sense  Re Ditfort at    For example  a complaint by an Australian exporter that trade sanctions had been negligently imposed on a country to which it exported would immediately involve this Court in the consideration of matters which it is institutionally unsuited to resolve  Gerhardy v Brown   HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan J  The duty pleaded in the proposed pleading arguably does not fall foul of the difficulty outlined in Re Ditfort   To hold that the Commonwealth should have considered whether to intercede on Mr Habib s behalf does not  arguably  involve an impermissible examination of the merits or otherwise of foreign policy  However  Mr Hicks  and Mr Habib s cases are conceptually very different  Mr Hicks sought judicial review of a decision and habeas corpus  Mr Habib seeks damages in tort  Inherent in the claim in tort is much more than Mr Hicks  claim to have the Commonwealth reconsider its position  It is a claim of wrongful conduct causing damage  It must necessarily travel further than a mere claim for reconsideration which claim Hicks v Ruddock holds to be arguable and into territory which requires the Court to reach a conclusion on what the outcome of that reconsideration should have been followedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR  http www austlii

executive power is consigned to the Chapter III courts  In that regard  at a functional level  the situation is not so very different to the treatment given by the English courts to the question of the extent of the prerogative  For  at least since the Case of Proclamations     Co Rep     ER   the courts of that country have asserted  and the other branches of government have eventually accepted  the final role of the courts in determining the ambit of that prerogative  Just as a Commonwealth law may delimit the scope of the executive power  so too it is well established that the prerogative may be excluded by statute  Attorney General v De Keyser s Royal Hotel Ltd   UKHL       AC   is an example of where a statute was found to have curtailed the prerogative  In Australia  Barton v

Dwyer   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBut the nature of the  position of conflict  was left unexplained  Equity imposes upon fiduciaries a duty of undivided loyalty  Maguire v Makaronis   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  The duty is the obligation to avoid being placed in a position where that undivided loyalty might be challenged  The breach of duty arises merely from being placed in the position of conflict and does not require that the conflict be acted upon  Thus the  no conflict  rule is infringed where a fiduciary occupies a position where his self interest and the duty to the beneficiary conflict  Warman International Ltd v Dwyer   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  It is also infringed where the fiduciary takes upon herself conflicting obligations  Breen v Williams     CLR   at   per Gummow J consideredWilkinson v Downton     QB  I turn then to the harassment claim  Strictly speaking  there is no such tort  However  there is an action on the case for the intentional but indirect infliction of harm  In Wilkinson v Downton     QB   the defendant told the plaintiff that her husband had been seriously injured in an accident and that she should go and fetch him  This was completely untrue  On hearing the statement the plaintiff suffered a violent shock to her nervous system initially involving vomiting but subsequently producing permanent physical consequences  Some of these involved serious mental illness and included weeks of physical suffering  Wright J said  at      The real question is as to the   l    the greatest part of which is given as compensation for the female plaintiff s illness and suffering  It was argued for her that she is entitled to recover this as being damage caused by fraud  and therefore within the doctrine established by Pasley v  Freeman     T  R    and Langridge v  Levy     M    W     I am not sure that this would not be an extension of that doctrine  the real ground of which appears to be that a person who makes a false statement intended to be acted on must make good the damage naturally resulting from its being acted on  Here there is no injuria of that kind  I think  however  that the verdict may be supported upon another ground  The defendant has  as I assume for the moment  wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff that is to say  to infringe her legal right to personal safety  and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her  That proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of action  there being no justification alleged for the act  This wilful injuria is in law malicious  although no malicious purpose to cause the harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to the defendant  It is  however  clear that in Australia a distinction is drawn between psychological harm  mere distress  and psychiatric harm  physical injury   The tort in Wilkinson v Downton is confined to cases of physical injury which may include nervous shock  such as suffered by Mrs Wilkinson  but does not include mere mental distress or anguish  The authors of The Law of Torts in Australia also point to a decision of McDonald J in Gimson v Victorian Workcover Authority     VR   at     where a pleading was permitted to go forward to trial in which mere mental distress was alleged  More recently  however  the Victorian Court of Appeal has considered the issue in Giller v Procopets   VSCA    In that case the defendant showed  or threatened to show  to others video footage depicting himself and the appellant  his former de facto partner  engaged in sexual activity  One of the claims was that those actions constituted the tort in Wilkinson v Downton   The appellant did not suffer psychiatric harm as a result of the threat but she did suffer severe emotional distress  Ashley and Neave JJ held that the tort did not extend to mental distress           Maxwell P reached the opposite conclusion       The ratio decidendi of Giller is that the tort in Wilkinson v Downton is not available unless there is actual physical injury and that extreme mental distress does not constitute physical injury in the requisite sense  It would be inappropriate for me to depart from Giller unless convinced it was plainly wrong  Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say Dee Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at         Whilst I can see the force of some of the criticisms which have been made of the present position I could not possibly say that Giller was clearly wrong  Accordingly  I am bound to follow it  This is an allegation that what was suffered was mental or psychological shock which  not being a claim for psychiatric harm  takes the claim outside the principle in Wilkinson v Downton   The words  seriously wounded and injured  when first appearing are in contradistinction to the words  suffered great pain of body and mind  mental and psychological shock and distress  which follow  The natural reading is that the first phrase is concerned with physical injury  the second with mental anguish  I accept that the words  otherwise seriously wounded and injured  may also contain an allegation of physical injury  However  for two reasons I do not read those words as applying to the harassment claim  First   it is unclear from paragraph   which of the very many allegations contained in paragraphs   to   of the pleading  of which only paragraphs   to   appear to be concerned with harassment  are connected to which of the losses alleged in paragraph    Secondly   it is apparent from the proposed pleading that the harassment claim is no longer pressed on the basis of events following Mr Habib s return to Australia  Instead  paragraph   of the Proposed pleading alleges   The actions and conduct of the respondent during the material time amounted to sustained harassment and intimidation of the applicant  I assume the words  material time  refer to the period after Mr Habib was picked up in Pakistan until his release from Guantanamo Bay  This must be taken to be so because the allegations contained in the pleading relating to the events which occurred upon Mr Habib s return to Australia  with the exception of the defamation allegations  have been omitted from the Proposed pleading  The pleading of loss in the Proposed pleading is at paragraph   and is in these terms   The applicant suffered physical and mental damage caused by prolonged unlawful incarceration  torture and ill treatment in Pakistan  Egypt and Cuba  and unlawful incarceration in Afghanistan  Be all of that as it may  it seems to me that there is the possibility that Mr Habib has a case for misfeasance in a public office and  perhaps  harassment in the Wilkinson v Downton sense  Particularly where there has been so far only one strike out application I do not think that I should deny leave to replead unless I am satisfied that the defects in the statement of claim are incapable of being cured  I am not satisfied of that in the case of the two causes of action I have mentioned  I do not see any basis upon which I may dispose of the defamation allegations as I cannot say they are incapable of succeeding even if they seem out of place in a case such as this  My conclusion  therefore  is that the pleading must be struck out but that there should be a grant of leave to replead the claims with respect to misfeasance in a public office  harassment and defamation  In relation to those matters  particularly the first  it is to be emphasised that the pleading raises issues which are of considerable technical complexity involving as they do the interaction between constitutional and administrative law and the law of tort  Although I have not acceded to the Commonwealth s argument as to the adequacy  from a technical perspective  of the pleadings it may be safely assumed that the next pleading will be held to proper standards
