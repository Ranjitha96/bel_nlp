Wahab v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toHussein v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The MRT also concluded that that the nominator did not require assistance because of  other serious circumstances  at the time of application  Citing Hussein v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Hussein   the MRT stated that it was  not satisfied that the nominator s concerns for the safety of the visa applicant manifest a need for assistance due to circumstances serious enough to reach the threshold set by  death  prolonged illness or disability   The MRT noted that the nominator worked on a full time basis and that Mr Kleynhan s August   report stated that the nominator s stress level had not been a major concern in     Next  the MRT considered whether the assistance provided by the appellant was  substantial  within the meaning of regulation      The applicant claimed that he assisted his uncle by providing him with company  assurances and moral support  as well as helping with household chores  The MRT concluded that this assistance was not  substantial  in the relevant sense  Finally  the MRT considered whether circumstances had changed sufficiently at the time of decision to alter any of these conclusions  The MRT determined that the appellant was not a special need relative of his uncle at the time of decision   On   July   the appellant filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia  pursuant to s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  for review of the MRT s decision  The proceeding was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court  Before a Federal Magistrate  the appellant argued that the MRT had misapplied the definitions of  prolonged illness   other serious circumstances  and  substantial and continuing assistance   In a decision delivered on   November   his Honour dismissed the application for review  This is an appeal from that judgment   The parties agreed that  although the  special needs relative  regulation was omitted from the Regulations on   December   the MRT was to have determined the application as the law stood at the time of application on   July    The appellant s Notice of Appeal raised a number of grounds  not all of which were pursued at the hearing today   In written submissions  the appellant contended that the MRT erred in law in regard to its finding that the nominator s depression did not amount to  other serious circumstances  within the meaning of regulation      Citing Wu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR     Wu   per Heerey  Moore and Goldberg JJ  the appellant argued that the MRT mistakenly applied Hussein when it held that the words  death  disability or prolonged illness  constrain the meaning of  other serious circumstances   The appellant argued today that the MRT therefore failed to consider whether depression other than that defined as clinical or medical depression could amount to  other serious circumstance    The first respondent also disputed that the MRT misapplied the definition of  serious circumstances   The first respondent argued that Wu did not support the view that  serious circumstances  should be understood independently of the nearby terms  death  disability or prolonged illness   Thus  in first respondent s submission  there was no error in the MRT s application of Hussein    If it were necessary to do so  I would also reject the appellant s argument that the MRT misapplied the definition of  serious circumstances   Contrary to the appellant s submission  Wu is consistent with the view that the terms  death  disability or prolonged illness  are relevant to the meaning of  other serious circumstances   In fact  in Wu at   the Full Court held that a circumstance  is sufficiently serious  if  in relation to a citizen  it would require assistance of the same sort that would be required if the citizen was suffering from a disability or prolonged illness   Thus  the Wu Court  like the MRT in this case  considered the meaning of  serious circumstances  in light of the nearby terms  It was clearly open to the MRT to decide that no  other serious circumstances  were present at the time of application  Even if Hussein no longer correctly states the law in all respects  the Tribunal s reliance on this decision did not lead it into relevant error appliedWu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA

Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Cohen   HCA         ALR     Cohen   per McHugh J  the first respondent claimed that as  serious circumstances  is used in its ordinary  non technical sense  its meaning is a question of fact  Accordingly  the first respondent submitted that  even if the MRT did apply erroneous precedent concerning the meaning of  serious circumstances  this was not jurisdictional error   As no error has been shown in the MRT s decision  I need not consider the significance of Cohen and whether or not any error of interpretation would have been a jurisdictional error   I would order that the appeal be dismissed with costs     I certify that the preceding twenty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny

Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  To be a special need relative  a visa applicant must be willing and able to provide substantial and continuing assistance  see  e g   Chow v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Moore  Emmett and Bennett JJ  The language of regulation     makes this clear   Because of the appellant s concession that it was open to the MRT to find that the assistance he provided to the nominator was not substantial  the appellant has also effectively conceded that it was open to the MRT to find that he did not satisfy a necessary requirement of the visa  The appeal must be dismissed if only for this reason
