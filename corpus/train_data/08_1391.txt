Irving v Smith   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBrash Holdings Limited  Administrator appointed  v Katile Pty Ltd     VR   The submission that the expression  creditors  should be limited to persons to whom the Company was indebted as at the date the notices were sent out or published under s  A  is also inconsistent with the reasoning of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Brash Holdings Limited  Administrator appointed  v Katile Pty Ltd     VR    In that case the Court had before it for consideration the provisions of Pt    A of the Corporations Law  the predecessor of the present Pt    A of the Act which  for all relevant purposes  was in the same form as the current Pt    A  The administrators of a group of companies had sought declarations as to which creditors of a company were bound by the deed of company arrangement  The relevant enquiry focused on s  D of the Corporations Law  The Court said at      In our opinion  the reference to  all creditors  in s  D  must be read and understood in the context of all other references to  creditors  in Pt    A  What has so far been described is sufficient to show that the general scheme of the Part is to involve the company s creditors  without further limitation or description  The word  creditors  should  in the absence of any good reason otherwise  be read as used in the same sense throughout Pt    A  and it is difficult to suppose that sections  drawn so widely as  for instance  s  A  describing the object of the Part  had in mind anything less than all of the creditors for the time being of the company    The Court said further at    Once it is decided  for the reasons we have given  that the expression  all creditors  in s  D  should not be confined to those having claims for money sums due and payable on or before the day specified in the deed  we see no alternative but to treat the creditors of the company for the purposes of Pt    A as those who would have been creditors had the company gone into liquidation and the relevant date for the purposes of s   been the day specified in the deed   The reasoning in Brash Holdings Limited  Administrator appointed  v Katile Pty Ltd  supra  was adopted and followed in Selim v McGrath     FLR    Barrett J considered that for the purposes of s  A creditors in a voluntary administration under Pt    A of the Act were all persons who had debts or claims against a company provable in its winding up and said  at    The boundaries are therefore those set by s   which refers to  all debts payable by  and all claims against  the company  present or future  certain or contingent  ascertained or sounding only in damages       citedSelim v McGrath     FLR   The reasoning in Brash Holdings

said at    In determining whether a deed is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial or unfairly discriminatory  the background of the general principles underlying Pt    A of the Act must be considered  A creditor has the basic right to payment  to the winding up of a company  or to the administration of the company in a manner that keeps the business of the company going which ultimately resulting  sic  in the creditor receiving payment out of the property of the company  The court will look at the whole of the effect of the deed and assess  its unfairness  if any  to the plaintiff creditor bearing in mind the scheme of Pt    A   the interests of the other creditors  the company and the public generally   It is necessary to consider the total circumstances of the case so as to determine whether there is overall unfairness    footnotes omitted    In the circumstances of the present case  the last sentence of this quotation is critical   The plaintiff s case  in essence  was that effect could not be given to the Deed without injustice and that the Deed was oppressive  prejudicial to and discriminatory against creditors because of the amount for which the land is to be sold pursuant to the Deed of Company Arrangement  Although the Administrators had received an independent valuation of the land which provided a valuation of     million net of rectification costs  the Administrators had set out in their report factors which made it problematic whether such a value could be received on the sale of the land  Having regard to the circumstances and factors set out in the Administrators  report  I do not consider that effect cannot be given to the Deed without injustice  It is the plaintiff who is complaining about the injustice but I do not consider that there is any injustice to the plaintiff in circumstances where in a context and with the background to which I referred  the creditors  by a majority of number and value  have decided to go the route of deed of company arrangement rather than liquidation   The assumptions and factors identified by the Administrators required the creditors to make a choice  The choice they made did not result in a Deed which was oppressive to  or prejudicial to  or discriminatory against the general body of creditors  and the plaintiff in particular  having regard to the factors which had to be taken into account in determining whether what the Administrators called either a high scenario  a medium scenario or a low scenario in terms of return to creditors might be achieved
