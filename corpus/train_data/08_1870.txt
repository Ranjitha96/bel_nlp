Ltd  Clark  New Jersey    at   consideredDavid Grant   Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd     CLR   The submissions of Mr Walker SC  who appeared for the applicant in these proceedings  may be summarised as follows     The legislative provision pursuant to which the Minister made his decision was s  B EPBC Act      The validity of s   and s   EPBC Act as statutory provisions is not in contest  however in relation to the application of these sections s  B is distinguishable from such provisions as ss     and   because      a  section  B does not impose any obligation on the Minister to make a decision of the kind referred to in those other sections  b  the operation of s  B is conditional upon a decision of the Minister which satisfies s  B  namely a decision of a particular description which is made within   business days after the Minister receives the referral       Section   and s   are concerned with the validity of decisions which there is an obligation to make      The construction of s  B urged by the Minister leads to absurd results because it places s  B in conflict with other provisions of the EPBC Act      A continuing right to make a decision under s  B cannot co exist with the alternative and inconsistent procedure under s   and s   EPBC Act      If s   and s   are capable of applying to a decision purportedly made by the Minister under s  B more than   business days after the receipt of a referral  it should be concluded that s  B  evinces an intention to exclude the prima facie operation of those provisions      The principles articulated in David Grant   Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd     CLR   apply to this case      Section  B and Ch   Pt   Div  A EPBC Act were inserted as part of a new process designed to enable the Minister to make a  prompt refusal  for a proposed action that would be clearly unlikely to receive approval under the other provisions of Ch    To treat a decision made any time outside the   business days referred to in s  B  as effective to invoke s  B  would be to dispense entirely with the  prompt refusal  rationale of the provision  This would be in direct conflict with the evident statutory purpose of s  B and must be rejected by reason of s  AA Acts Interpretation Act    Cth    The applicant has also submitted that s   and s   do not apply to s  B because  paraphrasing an issue posed in David Grant     CLR      T he difficulty in construction arises  perhaps not so much from the particular text of either  s  B  or  ss   and   as from the interrelation between those   provisions in circumstances where the enactment of  ss   and   preceded that of  s  B  and the earlier section is general and the later section is specific in its operation   First  there is nothing in the language of s  B which suggests that making a decision within   business days is a condition of validity of a decision made under that section  This can be contrasted with  for example  the language of s  G Corporations Act    Cth  to which the applicant referred in submissions  and which was the subject of consideration by the High Court in David Grant     CLR    Section  G Corporations Act    Cth  provides    A company may apply to the Court for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on the company    An application may only be made within   days after the demand is so served    An application is made in accordance with this section only if  within those   days       a  an affidavit supporting the application is filed with the Court  and     b  a copy of the application and a copy of the supporting affidavit  are served on the person who served the demand on the company   In David Grant     CLR   the High Court observed at     In providing that an application to the court for an order setting aside a statutory demand  may only  be made within the   day period there specified and that an application is made in accordance with s  G only if  within those   days  a supporting affidavit is filed and a copy thereof and of the applications are served  sub ss   and   of s  G attach a limitation or condition upon the authority of the court to set aside the demand  In this setting  the use in s  G  of the term  may  does not give rise to the considerations which apply where legislation confers upon a decision maker an authority of a discretionary kind and the issue is whether  may  is used in a facultative and permissive sense or an imperative sense    Here  the phrase  a n application may only be made within   days  should be read as a whole  The force of the term  may only  is to define the jurisdiction of the court by imposing a requirement as to time as an essential condition of the new right conferred by s  G  An integer or element of the right created by s  G is its exercise by application made within the time specified  To adapt what was said by Isaacs J in The Crown v McNeil   it is a condition of the gift in sub s   of s  G that sub s   be observed and  unless this is so  the gift can never take effect  The same is true of sub s    This consideration gives added force to the proposition which has been accepted in some of the authorities that it is impossible to identify the function or utility of the word  only  in s  G  if it does not mean what it says  which is that the application is to be made within   days of service of the demand  and not at some time thereafter and that to treat s   as authorising the court to extend the period of   days specified in s  G would deprive the word  only  of effect     I agree with the submission of the Minister that it follows from the applicant s interpretation of the legislation that  immediately upon the expiration of the   business days time limit in s  B  even in circumstances where the Minister considers that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts  the Minister s power to invoke Div  A could not be exercised  and the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss     and    I accept the Minister s submission that this interpretation is not supported by the terms of Ch   Pt    It is highly unlikely that the

UKPC   at     particularly as  if the time limit under s  B were absolute  the subsequent invalidation of any decision made under s  B would result in substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose

Ltd   NTSC         NTR   at   However in any event  and more compellingly in relation to s  B  neither the purpose nor the structure of Ch   Pt   as a whole support a construction of s  B that a decision made under that section after the expiration of   business days is invalid  Although the legislative purpose in enacting Div  A was to facilitate a prompt refusal by the Minister of an action which would have unacceptable environmental impacts  the legislation does not support an interpretation that a decision made by the Minister on  for example  the  st business day after the referral would not be of equal validity to a decision made within the prescribed time period  The event upon which the operation of the section depends is the prompt making of a decision by the Minister that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts  not the passage of   business days  In other words the making of a decision of the Minister is critical the time period of   business days  while relevant to the making of the decision  does not determine its validity  cf Hatton v Beaumont     NSWLR   at    To paraphrase the learned authors of Administrative Law in Australia   to which I referred earlier in this judgment  the provision as to time in s  B simply regulates a function which has already been conferred on the decision maker  namely that of making a decision in the circumstances described in s  B a  EPBC Act   Explanation as to the legislative purpose of Ch   Pt   Div  A  including s  B  can be found in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act  No      Cth  which inserted Ch   Pt   Div  A into the EPBC Act  So far as relevant the Explanatory Memorandum provides as follows     This item inserts new Division  A of Part   of the Act  Division  A establishes a new process that allows the Minister to make a prompt refusal for an action that would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected by Part   of the Act  This avoids the expense and time involved in conducting the full assessment and approval process under Chapter   for actions that would be unlikely to receive approval under Part   of the Act  The scope and process for making a prompt refusal is established in three new sections of the Act    B   C  and  D     If the Minister considers that an action would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected under Part   of the Act on the basis of the information contained in a referral then the Minister may decide under s  B that Division  A applies to the action  The other provisions of Chapter    referral assessment and approvals processes  then cease to apply to the action  Under s  C the Minister must then notify the person proposing to take the action and provide reasons why the action is unacceptable  The person may withdraw the referral  withdraw the referral and refer a new proposal  or request the Minister to reconsider the referral     New s  D outlines the process to be followed in the event the Minister is asked to reconsider the referral  At the completion of this process the Minister may either confirm that the action is not to be approved  or determine that it should be subject to the formal assessment and approvals processes under the Act  If the Minister decides that the referral should be assessed  the Chapter   processes and timeframes recommence at the point where they were initially stopped under s  B of the Act   Significantly  I note that the Explanatory Memorandum makes no mention of the   business day time period  nor is any importance attached to that period of time  Consistently with the proposition that it is the making of the decision which is critical  the Explanatory Memorandum refers to promptitude  and the avoidance of expense and time otherwise applied in making a full assessment citedHelman v Byron Shire Council     LGERA   As Mahoney JA observed in Hatton v Beaumont     NSWLR   at   The administration of the law would be

Construction and Interpretation of the Laws  The Lawbook Exchange Ltd  Clark  New Jersey    at   appliedProject Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The submissions of Mr Gotterson QC  who appeared for the Minister in these proceedings  may be summarised as follows     Section   and s   are express provisions in the EPBC Act which put beyond doubt that it is clearly not a purpose of the EPBC Act that an act done outside a time period set by the EPBC Act should be invalid      Even apart from those provisions  the same result is achieved by applying the approach to statutory interpretation as articulated in Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR         The purpose of Ch   Pt   Div  A EPBC Act  which was inserted into the EPBC Act in   by the Environmental and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act  No       was explained in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying that legislation      Section   and s   also call for  prompt  decisions to be made      Importantly  a prompt refusal under s  B avoids the expense and time involved in conducting the full assessment and approval process for an action that is unlikely to receive approval      The construction of s  B advanced by the applicant risks substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose of s  B      On the applicant s argument once the   business days have elapsed the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss     and   even if the Minister considers the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts  This is precisely what s  B was intended to avoid      The real condition precedent to the application of Ch   Pt   Div  A is the formation of the opinion by the Minister  While the Minister is obliged and required to act within the time specified in s  B  it does not follow that the consequence of a late decision is that it is invalid and of no effect   In my view  substantially for the reasons advanced by Mr Gotterson QC on behalf of the Minister  the application must fail   Notwithstanding the detailed submissions of the applicant  a plain reading of the EPBC Act demonstrates clearly that failure of the Minister to comply with a time limit prescribed by the EPBC Act does not affect the validity of a decision under the Act made outside a set time limit  including decisions made under s  B  No contortion of the legislation or speculation as to the manner in which s  B is to be construed in the broader context of Ch   Pt   detracts from the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in s   and s   EPBC Act  That the failure of the Minister to comply with a time limit set by the EPBC Act does not affect its validity is clear not only in relation to any action of the Minister under the Act as a whole  s   but  in my view crucially  is clear in relation to any decision made by the Minister under Ch   EPBC Act  s    Although the legislation reflects an apparent duplication so far as concerns decisions under Ch    which  presumably  would also fall within the scope of actions of the Minister for the purposes of s   the effect of that duplication is to remove any doubt as to the validity of decisions made under Ch   including those in Pt   Div  A and more specifically s  B  notwithstanding a failure to comply with a set time limit   However putting to one side for the moment my views concerning the application of s   and s   I consider that in any event the legislative purpose of the EPBC Act is that a decision made by the Minister under s  B more than   business days after receipt of a referral will be valid  This is clear from applying the principles articulated in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR     as well as taking into consideration the explanation of Ch   Pt   Div  A in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying that Division introduction into the EPBC   The majority of the High Court observed in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR     an act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect  Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition  The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute  its subject matter and objects  and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition   at     cf at     As was observed in commentary on Project Blue Sky   CLR    in my view correctly  On this approach   there is a fundamental difference between a provision which simply regulates a function which has already been conferred on the decision maker and a provision which establishes an essential pre condition to the valid exercise of the function   Lane WB and Young S  Administrative Law in Australia  Lawbook Co    at   Applying the principles articulated in Project Blue Sky   HCA         CLR   to the facts of the case before me  an important question is whether the legislative purpose of the EPBC Act is that a decision made by the Minister under s  B more than   business days after the referral is received is invalid  taking into account the language of the statute  its subject matter and objects  and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition   Historically there is a wealth of authority supporting the principle that failure to perform an act within time limits prescribed by legislation does not necessarily invalidate the act notwithstanding that it is made after the expiration of that time limit  While these cases  and the extent to which the courts applied the traditional distinction between directory and mandatory requirements  must be read in light of the test for determining validity articulated in Project Blue Sky   HCA         CLR     nonetheless it is useful to note that traditionally  where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the Legislature  such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed  or  in other words  as directory only  The neglect of them may be penal  indeed  but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them  It has often been held  for instance  when an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done  that the Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time  Thus  the   Hen  IV   c   which required justices to try rioters  within a month  after the riot  was held not to limit the authority of the justices to that space of time  but only to render them liable to a penalty for neglect   Maxwell Sir PB  The Interpretation

the submission of the Minister that it follows from the applicant s interpretation of the legislation that  immediately upon the expiration of the   business days time limit in s  B  even in circumstances where the Minister considers that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts  the Minister s power to invoke Div  A could not be exercised  and the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss     and    I accept the Minister s submission that this interpretation is not supported by the terms of Ch   Pt    It is highly unlikely that the legislature would have intended that non compliance with the time limit in s  B would inevitably prevent the Minister from making a valid decision  cf Charles v Judicial and Legal Service Commission   UKPC   at     particularly as  if the time limit under s  B were absolute  the subsequent invalidation of any decision made under s  B would result in substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose of s  B  This is not a case where  for example    the consequences of failure to comply strictly within the prescribed time limit outweigh the public interest in the Minister making a valid decision that the proposed action would have unacceptable environmental impacts and invoking Ch   Pt   Div  A  cf comments of the House of Lords in R v Soneji     WLR   or    the object contemplated by the legislature
