IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Court might be aided in answering that question by evidence given by experts  Plainly enough  evidence can be given by experts of the meaning those skilled in the art relevant to the field of the invention would give to technical terms  phrases and concepts accepted within the relevant discipline  Where the specification addresses and the claims contain  technical terms  the Court must have evidence before it of the technical meaning so as to understand the meaning a person familiar with the state of the art at the priority date would attribute to those terms  A proper understanding of how a relevantly skilled reader would understand such terms enables the Court to construe the claims in the context of the specification and attribute meaning to the claims in isolating the essential integers  In undertaking that exercise  the Court will determine what weight ought to be attributed to particular expert evidence  The construction of the patent is a matter entirely for the Court aided by evidence of the understanding of the skilled reader  The proper construction of the patent is not determined by findings preferring one expert s view of the construction of the patent  over another  The patent will be construed according to the ordinary meaning to be attributed to the language of the document informed by the Court s understanding of technical terms through evidence reflecting the understanding of a person skilled in the relevant art  as to these principles generally  see Sachtler GMBH   Co  v R E

member of other professional bodies in the engineering field  Dr Gilmore has undertaken design work in relation to  hand winders  for a participant in the blinds industry and has undertaken work for Uniline  Dr Gilmore has provided a number of affidavits with reports annexed  Dr Gilmore s evidence provides an analysis and explanation of the spring clutch assembly described in the patent in suit  Dr Gilmore describes the spring  the assembly of the components  the general utility of the assembly and the functional operation of the clutch  Dr Gilmore considers in detail claim   of the patent in suit and at page   of his report dated   February   Dr Gilmore sets out his preferred interpretation of claim    Dr Gilmore also expresses views about the features of assembly of Uniline s spring clutch  its functionality and whether the Uniline spring clutch embodies each of the integers falling within claim   of the patent in suit  Apart from the question of construction of the patent in suit and matters going to functionality of each assembly  Dr Gilmore gives evidence as to the features of the spring clutch assembly described in US Patent   and expresses an opinion as to whether the

simply state the propositions to be applied derived from these authorities and some others in construing claim   of the patent in suit and any claim upon which it rests  In that sense  the Court does not first construe the claims without reference to the specification and then determine whether ambiguity exists   Sachtler    The document is read in its entirety and clear meaning is to be given to the clear words of a claim  Although the Court seeks to construe the language of the claims taking account of the skilled reader s  e g  a person skilled in the relevant art  practical and commonsense understanding of terms and particular language  clear language ought to be given its natural and apparent meaning and not read down as though the evidence of the skilled reader imported a qualification upon a claim inconsistent with that meaning  No doubt evidence of particular applied terms of art in any given field or discipline may make the construction of the language of a claim using those terms a difficult question of balance between the natural expression of the language of the claims and the conditioning influence of terms of art  Adopting a purposive approach to construction of the claims does not mean that clear limitations in the scope of the monopoly contained in the language of the claims can be avoided or the reach of the monopoly extended beyond the clear limits of the language selected  A purposive approach to construction as opposed to a purely literal one will raise the question of whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used  would understand that strict compliance with the descriptive words or phrases used in a claim was intended to be an essential requirement of the invention  If so  as a matter of construction  a variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed even though it could have no material affect on the way the invention works  That question does not arise where the variant would in fact have a material affect upon the way the invention works   Catnic Components Ltd v Hill   Smith Ltd   RPC     Kirin Amgen Inc  v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd

is of unitary construction   Claim   was introduced into the patent by amendment by leave granted by IP Australia on   November   consequent upon an application made by the patentee on   October    Amendments to claim   were made at the same time  see   and   of these reasons   Mr Hunter gave evidence that claim   does not add anything to the scope of claims   to   as those claims comprehend a helical spring of unitary construction with reverse winding and a plurality of helical springs of alternate winding which operate in the same way as a spring clutch incorporating a spring of unitary construction with reverse winding  In that sense  it is not said by Mr Hunter or SBriggs that claim   aids in the construction of claims   to   on the footing that claim   prescribes a monopoly directed to the integers of claim   limited to a unitary spring and thus claim   must address something other than a spring clutch incorporating a unitary spring  It is not said that  by inference drawn from claim   claims   to   are directed to multiple adjacent separate springs of alternate winding  SBriggs says claims   to   bring within the monopoly a helically reverse wound unitary spring and a plurality of springs that cause the spring clutch of Exhibit   to operate in the same way as a spring clutch incorporating a reverse wound unitary spring  As Mr Hunter points out  it is then difficult to see exactly what claim   adds to the scope of claims   to   on that view of those claims  Mr Hunter is correct in this respect  The language of claim   requires as an essential integer of the monopoly  the presence of a single reverse wound unitary spring  The introduction into the patent of claim    in its current amended terms  with the result that selective engagement of the tabs of the helical spring of claims   to     was elevated into an amended claim   as part of a redefined control means  see claim  a  and  b  does not say anything about the helical spring of claims   to    In order to construe the language of claims   to   post amendment in a way which extends the integers of those claims to multiple separate springs of alternate winding  further amendments would have been necessary to claims   to   to adopt clear language that brought a plurality of springs within the boundaries of the monopoly  That result does not arise simply by inference from an amendment to claim    and related amendments to claim    The express reciting in claim   of a spring of unitary construction adds nothing to claims which address a single unitary spring of reverse winding  Having regard to the construction adopted in relation to claims   to   it follows that the threats of infringement proceedings made by SBriggs by the letter from its solicitors to Uniline dated   April   and the further letter dated   July   from those solicitors to the patent attorneys for Uniline are unjustifiable as no infringement is made out  The Amended Cross Claim for infringement of the patent in suit fails  Issues going to validity of the patent assuming the  counter factual   construction  hypothesis  General approach Claim   of the patent in suit demands the presence of a single unitary reverse wound spring engaging a longitudinal slot and key device  Plainly  that invention is not anticipated by US Patent    If claim   extends to the inclusion of a plurality of multiple springs of alternate winding with tabs engaged by the control device of claim   is that invention disclosed by US Patent   Each expert has sought to answer that question by applying a different method of analysis  Mr Hunter isolated the essential features of claim    and other claims upon which it depends  and compared those features with the invention disclosed by US Patent   that is  the novel elements claimed for the invention  Table A  para   Hunter affidavit    March    Mr Hunter could not see all the integers of claim   in the integers of the invention of US Patent    claims                  as to a helical spring for the purposes of claims       and   and as to the feature of a single longitudinal opening defined by edges selectively engaging one or more of the tabs of the spring  and    Thus  no anticipation arises in his view  Mr Hunter separately considered the essential features with the prior art disclosures identified in US Patent    Table B  para   Hunter affidavit    March    Mr Hunter could not see all of the integers of claim   in the prior art  claims                         claim    because the prior art does not disclose alternate wound springs  but otherwise all essential elements of claim   disclosed  and    Mr Hunter did not accept as correct  the methodological approach adopted by Dr Gilmore to determining anticipation by looking to the prior art disclosures of US Patent   and the disclosures in that part of US Patent   which identify features of novelty in the invention  and ultimately the integers of the claims of that patent  so as to put the disclosures together to see and understand whether the combination of claim   of the patent in suit is disclosed in US Patent    SBriggs says that  unremarkably  US Patent   discusses the prior art and then distinguishes the invention from it  It does so  in part  by depicting embodiments of the invention in drawings   to   and distinguishing the invention from the prior art depicted in drawings   to    The specification describes the shortcomings of prior art clutches manifested in variations in frictional drag due to differential radial loads at bearing surfaces of prior art clutches  see   and   of these reasons   SBriggs says that the specification teaches away from the prior art and combinations evident in the prior art  It says Mr Hunter  as a skilled addressee  is led away from the prior art configuration of a single longitudinal slot to the particular features of US Patent   in which novelty is claimed as determined by the integers of those claims  Mr Hunter cannot see the combination of a plurality of springs of alternate winding engaging a non complex single longitudinal slot and key device  in any of those claims  Mr Hunter separately compares the prior art of Figures   to   with the discussion of the prior art and concludes that the integers of claim   are not disclosed in the prior art  In particular  the prior art does not disclose springs of alternate winding  Moreover  US Patent   it is said  does not claim a clutch that includes a second shaft with a single longitudinal opening with edges of that opening that selectively engage one or more of the tabs  as claim   of the patent in suit requires  The method adopted by Mr Hunter might usefully lead the skilled addressee to an answer to the question of whether the integers of claim   are anticipated by US Patent    Mr Hunter has sought to find that answer by looking to the prior art disclosures  He has looked to the discussion of the invention  the assertions of novelty and the integers of the claims of US Patent   to see if he can find the integers of claim   revealed in those claims  If the answer to either inquiry conducted by Mr Hunter is yes  the method would usefully reveal anticipation  If the answer to either inquiry is no  the method may simply reflect an impermissibly restricted inquiry  In determining whether a document  in this case US Patent   discloses the integers of claim   it is legitimate to look to the whole of the document to isolate the presence or disclosure of elements of the combination of claim   in the prior art  and relevant drawings  and in the discussion of the advantages of the invention over the prior art  the integers of the claims recited in the patent and drawings embodying the invention  The disclosures in the patent taken as a whole may reveal to a skilled addressee  the combination of the claim in the patent in suit  If  however  the combination is to be found in a combination of disclosures rather than a disclosed combination   the skilled addressee must see and reach the combination without calling in aid his own inventive skills or ingenuity in making the combination  Nor will the disclosures anticipate the combination of claim    assuming the counter factual  even though putting together the combination might be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant art  whether Dr Gilmore or Mr Hunter or any other skilled addressee   US Patent   does not disclose the combination of a plurality of springs of alternate winding engaging a non complex single longitudinal slot and key configuration to facilitate smooth transition of rotational forces between the input and output shafts of a spring clutch  The patent addresses use of multiple springs  some of which may be reverse wound in one embodiment  to support the output load in a way that overcomes an asymmetrical application of supporting forces  that produces reaction forces at the bearing surface within the clutch  by configuring a clutch employing a multiplicity of springs so as to support the load with very nearly a pure couple of forces without producing reaction forces in the bearings as a direct result of the forces produced by the springs  The invention thus eliminates frictional drag and US Patent   is entirely directed to that objective  The discussion in US Patent   of firstly the disadvantages of prior art clutches and secondly  the manner of overcoming frictional drag by a pure couple of forces  does not disclose the combination of claim   of the patent in suit  To the extent that such a combination might be revealed to a person skilled in the art  such a person would need to apply an inventive step in doing so  Thus  applying the counter factual  US Patent   does not anticipate the combination

Gilmore made no reference to the points of differentiation  by reference to questions of misalignment of tabs  in the functional operation of a spring clutch incorporating three separate springs as compared with the functional operation of a spring clutch of claim   incorporating a single unitary reverse wound spring  the evidence of Mr Hunter and Dr Gilmore in its totality  as persons skilled in the relevant art  is such that it is simply not possible to conclude that a variation from the language of the claims of the patent in suit constituted by the use of three separate adjacent springs loaded onto shaft   in the manner of Exhibit   has no material affect upon the way the invention of claim   works  for the purposes of question   of the Improver questions  If two experts emblematic of persons skilled in the relevant art  at least for the purposes of these proceedings  cannot agree that a spring clutch incorporating three separate adjacent springs positioned on shaft   of a spring clutch in the manner of Exhibit   functions in a way which would reflect no material affect upon the evident functionality of a spring clutch incorporating a single unitary spring of reverse winding  the Court cannot be satisfied that the variation has no material affect upon functionality  The question is not to be resolved by simply accepting one person skilled in the art over another but by approaching construction taking account of the total evidence of those skilled in the art  The weight of the evidence having regard to Dr Gilmore s evidence is such that it cannot be said or found that no material affect by the use of the variant is established  That being so  Improver questions   and   do not arise  Even if I accept entirely the evidence of Mr Hunter and reject the evidence of Dr Gilmore on this aspect of the case  thus answering Improver question   yes  and assume or accept that the variant of adopting three adjacent separate springs of alternate winding was obvious at the date of publication of the patent in suit to a reader skilled in the relevant art  thus answering the second Improver question  yes  the answer to the third Improver question must necessarily be  no  Here  the patentee has selected language that defines a monopoly in terms of a single spring engaging a non complex single longitudinal slot and key configuration of two shafts  coaxial with a first shaft  to achieve identified advantages of the invention  A single spring is essential to the claims  It is the integer which enables the spring clutch to discharge its clutching function  A skilled reader would understand from the language of the claims in the context of the specification that the patentee intended that strict compliance with the primary meaning of the language of the claims was an essential requirement of the invention  Moreover  Mr Hunter acknowledges that multiple springs can work in a spring clutch when they are all wound in the same direction

htmlUniline says that if the claims of the patent  properly construed  include within the monopoly a spring clutch comprised of a plurality of springs with reverse windings and tabs  such claims are not fairly based upon disclosures in the body of the specification  Uniline says that the invention as claimed by the terms of the monopoly might well be narrower than the disclosures contained in the specification but the claims cannot travel beyond the disclosures in the body of the specification  Uniline asks  consistent with Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited   HCA         CLR     whether there has been a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of that which is claimed or  put another way  whether the claims travel beyond the disclosures in the specification   Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    I have construed the claims to require a single unitary reverse wound spring as an essential integer  Those claims so construed are consistent with the disclosures in the specification  If  however  an assumption is made that the proper construction of the claims brings within the scope of the monopoly a plurality of springs of alternate winding  do the claims travel beyond the specification  The specification contemplates an invention answering the problems of the prior art by providing for a bi directional spring clutch that confers the advantages of a single spring engaging a non complex slot and key engagement mechanism or control means  The specification plainly discloses the use of multiple springs sequentially engaged in prior art spring clutches by a complex configuration of openings and barriers as an aspect of a prior art bi directional clutch  If the counter factual hypothesis is adopted that the claims include use of a plurality of springs  that hypothesis would seem to follow necessarily from an acceptance of the proposition that the object of the invention  properly construed  is to avoid a plurality of springs in combination with a complex configuration of openings and barriers  Therefore  on that hypothesis of construction  a plurality of springs engaging a slot and key control means  that is  a non complex control means  is sufficiently disclosed by the specification by reason of the description of the object of the invention and the claims are thus  upon the counter factual  fairly based  However  neither the object nor the claims contemplate a plurality of springs as an integer of the claimed invention  If the object of the

that if the claims of the patent  properly construed  include within the monopoly a spring clutch comprised of a plurality of springs with reverse windings and tabs  such claims are not fairly based upon disclosures in the body of the specification  Uniline says that the invention as claimed by the terms of the monopoly might well be narrower than the disclosures contained in the specification but the claims cannot travel beyond the disclosures in the body of the specification  Uniline asks  consistent with Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited   HCA         CLR     whether there has been a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of that which is claimed or  put another way  whether the claims travel beyond the disclosures in the specification   Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    I have construed the claims to require a single unitary reverse wound spring as an essential integer  Those claims so construed are consistent with the disclosures in the specification  If  however  an assumption is made that the proper construction of the claims brings within the scope of the monopoly a plurality of springs of alternate winding  do the claims travel beyond the specification  The specification contemplates an invention answering the problems of the prior art by providing for a bi directional spring clutch that confers the advantages of a single spring engaging a non complex slot and key engagement mechanism or control means  The specification plainly discloses the use of multiple springs sequentially engaged in prior art spring clutches by a complex configuration of openings and barriers as an aspect of a prior art bi directional clutch  If the counter factual hypothesis is adopted that the claims include use of a plurality of springs  that hypothesis would seem to follow necessarily from an acceptance of the proposition that the object of the invention  properly construed  is to avoid a plurality of springs in combination with a complex configuration of openings and barriers  Therefore  on that hypothesis of construction  a plurality of springs engaging a slot and key control means  that is  a non complex control means  is sufficiently disclosed by the specification by reason of the description of the object of the invention and the claims are thus  upon the counter factual  fairly based  However  neither the object nor the claims contemplate a plurality of springs as an integer of the claimed invention  If the object of the invention

the statements in the documents dated   October   concern the effect of the prior art  A statement made by an applicant in good faith to the Commissioner concerning the effect of the prior art is unlikely to provide a basis for concluding that such a statement of opinion is false  when that opinion is subsequently shown to be incorrect   ICI Chemicals   Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corporation Inc      FCR    A statement made expressing an opinion about the relationship or otherwise between disclosures in the prior art and changes to the scope of the monopoly defining the claims  so as to address differentiation of the invention from elements of the prior art  simply reflects a debate between the Commissioner and the applicant about the scope of the claims and the effect of proposed changes to the language of the claims judged against the prior art  Statements about those matters are simply  as in this case  argumentative statements going to matters of opinion about which minds might  in good faith  differ  There is no suggestion of bad faith on the part of SBriggs  The suggestion in this case is that SBriggs proposed an amendment which had the effect of impermissibly broadening the scope of claims   to   by reference to the express limitation contained in claim    Claim   is limited in its terms to a spring of unitary construction  Claims   to   are not said to bear an inclusive construction of multiple springs of alternate winding as a matter of inference from claim    They are said to bear that construction for the reasons earlier identified  The amendments proposed by SBriggs either narrow the scope of two claims to better differentiate the invention from the prior art or not  Whether that statement is true or correct is simply a matter of debate between the applicant and the Commissioner  As Mr Hunter says  claim   adds nothing to claims   to    No false statement or misrepresentation arises out of putting a view of the effect of the changes  Accordingly  declarations will be made that threats of patent infringement proceedings made by SBriggs on   April   by its solicitors and a further letter by its solicitors dated   July   are unjustifiable  SBriggs shall be restrained from further threats of patent infringement  The Amended Cross Claim of SBriggs by which relief is sought for infringement of claim   of the patent in suit  is to be dismissed  The Amended Further Cross Claim by Uniline by which revocation of the patent in suit is sought  which only arises if infringement is found  is to be dismissed  I certify that the
