Chamberlain  in the matter of South Wagga Sports and Bowling Club Ltd  Administrator Appointed    FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedRe Diamond Press Australia Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The basic principles are reflected in an observation by Barrett J in Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at     His Honour there observed that the function of the Court on an application under s  A is to strike an appropriate balance between the expectation that the administration would be a relatively speedy and summary matter  and the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders  This statement also reflects the object of Pt    A which is stated in s  A of the Act  A further principle which is relevant is that the impact of the prolongation of the administration may have on persons whose claims are affected by the statutory moratorium arising from Pt    A of the Act   Although the present application is not made under s  A  but under s  A  it seems to me that the principles which I have stated above should also inform the exercise of the discretion to further extend the time for convening a meeting  I am satisfied in accordance with those principles that the proper exercise of my discretion is to grant the further extension of time which is sought  I will therefore make orders in terms of   to   of the draft orders which I will sign and date  and place with the Court papers   I certify that the preceding ten   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson    Associate Dated    January   Solicitor for the Plaintiff  K P Farmer   Associates   Date of Hearing    January       Date of Judgment    January           AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toHenry Walker Eltin Group Ltd  Administrator Appointed      ACSR   An application has now been made to the Court for a further extension of time to hold a meeting of creditors  The application is made under s  A  of the Act rather than under s  A   This is because there is ample authority for the proposition that the power to order an extension of time for convening a meeting under s  A does not extend to authorising a subsequent extension under that section  see for example Henry Walker Eltin Group Ltd  Administrator Appointed      ACSR   at   per Hely J  However  the decision of Hely J in Henry Walker Eltin is also authority for the proposition that there is power under s  A of the Act to further extend the convening period  notwithstanding that an earlier extension has already been granted   The reasons why the furthered extension is sought are recorded in an affidavit of Mr Chamberlain sworn on   January    In short  the affidavit discloses that the steps required by the Registered Clubs Act    NSW  and the Registered Clubs Regulation    NSW  were duly taken  but that when the period for expressions of interest expired on   December   only one club had contacted Mr Chamberlain in relation to the proposal  Mr Chamberlain has been advised that the club which approached him is now considering various options which require a little time for consideration   Perhaps more importantly for the purposes of the present application  Mr Chamberlain has now received a number of inquiries from other sporting clubs which may lead to other options for the Club to amalgamate  Because the convening period ordered by the Court was due to expire tomorrow  Mr Chamberlain does not consider that he and the Committee of Inspection will have sufficient time to consider and respond to the various inquiries made by the relevant sporting clubs referred toMann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd     ACSR   The authorities which deal with the principles applicable to an extension of time to convene and hold a second meeting of creditors have been considered in a number of cases  commencing with the decision of Young J in Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd     ACSR   at
