http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Had I not formed the opinion that s  A had not been complied with  I would have granted relief under s  v  because the Tribunal used its erroneous understanding  that is  irrelevant material  to come to the conclusion that the appellant was lying about the loss of her house  That conclusion materially affected its reasoning process about her credibility generally so as to lead to the dismissal of her claims  As Mason CJ held in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at     at common law     the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law   see too  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Rajamanikkam   HCA         CLR   at                    appliedCraig v South Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The problem here is that the Tribunal failed to identify the original claim in relation to the burning of the appellant s house and instead attributed to her a claim of a markedly different character  namely one in which that assertion had not been made  The Tribunal thus identified a wrong issue and committed a jurisdictional error   Craig v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at    It is when the Tribunal seeks to use information which it considers would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision that the requirements of s  A  are engaged   By s   of the Act the Tribunal was authorized to get the information in the material given to the Registrar by the Secretary of the Minister s department pursuant to s    Section   provides       In conducting the review  the Tribunal may get any information that it considers relevant  However  if the Tribunal gets such information  the Tribunal must have regard to that information in making the decision on the review   Since  here  the Tribunal got the information in the departmental file given to it pursuant to s     the Tribunal was required by dint of s   to have regard to that information in making the decision on the review  Two consequences followed  first  s   made the information in the file relevant and  secondly  s  A a  applied to any of that information which the Tribunal considered would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review   The Tribunal in so acting did not  have regard to that information  in contravention of its obligation under s   to do so  As the High Court said in Craig v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at      If such an administrative tribunal falls into an error of law which causes it to identify a wrong issue  to ask itself a wrong question  to ignore relevant material  to rely on irrelevant material or  at least in some circumstances  to make an erroneous finding or to reach a mistaken conclusion  and the tribunal s exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected  it exceeds its authority or powers  Such an error of law is jurisdictional error which will invalidate any order or decision of the tribunal which reflects it  referred toDranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Minister also referred me to more recent authority including Stone J s decision in SZGIZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     to like effect  The Minister submitted that the Tribunal had a duty to consider all the material before it for the purposes of identifying what claim or claims an applicant for review had made in support of the claim for a protection visa  relying on the decision of the High Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR    see e g  at         and    For that purpose it was said that the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to all of the material before it   Of course  the Tribunal is entitled to make erroneous findings of fact and would commit no jurisdictional error by doing so  In Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at           Gummow and Callinan JJ held that a failure to respond to a substantial  clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts not only amounted to a failure at common law to accord natural justice but also was a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction  The former category or error was shielded from judicial review by s  a  of the Act but the latter attracted jurisdiction pursuant to s  v  of the Constitution   Of course  the grant of relief under s  v  is discretionary  see eg   ALR at       The Tribunal did respond to some claim as to the loss of the appellant s house but misconceived what she had asserted  The function of the Tribunal was to review  pursuant to s   of the Act  the decision of the Minister on the claim made  It was not entitled to reframe that claim by materially altering it and then to proceed to decide the reframed claim while ignoring or overlooking the claim actually made  Yet  that is what happened in the present case for the Tribunal only purported to consider the original claim because it misconceived it  Therefore  the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error  and did not simply make an error of fact  because the actual claim made by the appellant was never considered  The Act required the decision on that claim to be reviewed  What happened here was that the Tribunal considered and decided a claim the appellant had never made  namely one which omitted mention of the loss of her house followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Rajamanikkam   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

made  the existence of some facts  then  although the evaluation of those facts is for the Secretary of State alone  the Court must enquire whether those facts exist  and have been taken into account

generally so as to lead to the dismissal of her claims  As Mason CJ held in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at     at common law     the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law   see too  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Rajamanikkam   HCA         CLR   at                    followedMinister for Immigration v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am of opinion that it is essential to have regard to the statutory obligation in s   of the Act for the Tribunal to make and record findings of fact and to give reasons  As McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf   HCA         CLR   at          It is not necessary to read s   as implying an obligation to make findings in order for it to have sensible work to do  Understanding s   as obliging the Tribunal to set out what were its findings on the questions of fact it considered material gives the section important work to do in connection with judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal  It ensures that a person who is dissatisfied with the result at which the Tribunal has arrived can identify with certainty what reasons the Tribunal had for reaching its conclusion and what facts it considered material to that conclusion  Similarly  a court which is asked to review the decision is able to identify the Tribunal s reasons and the findings it made in reaching that conclusion  The provision entitles a court to infer that any matter not mentioned in the s   statement was not considered by the Tribunal to be material   Repatriation Commission O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan J  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   at     per Deane  at   per Fisher J  cf Fleming v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at                  The Tribunal s identification of what it considered to be the material questions of fact may demonstrate that it took into account some irrelevant consideration or did not take into account some relevant consideration   Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR      The task of statutory construction obliges courts to construe a relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions in the statute as is pointed out by McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at       When s  A refers to  the reason or part of the reason  it does not divide the reasoning process into what is said to be  integral  from what the Tribunal is required to express as its reasons in the language of s    In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at     Finn and Stone JJ discussed the need to isolate what their Honours termed to be  the integral parts of the reasons for the tribunal s decision   Their Honours said that task  necessarily  was an interpretive one   The task of the Tribunal is to set out what it regarded as its material reasoning as the passage cited above from Yusuf demonstrates  In the present case  this distinction may not matter because the Tribunal used the language  in light of all the above information  in coming to the conclusion that the appellant had been untruthful in relation to the burning of her house  having identified   inter alia   the initial application that the appellant had made for her visa as part of that information  And  in stating its ultimate conclusion that it was not satisfied that the appellant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations  the Tribunal said that it had     considered the evidence as a whole    Indeed  it would be a work of supererogation to suggest that the Tribunal did not have regard to that original application in coming to its assessment of untruthfulness  For it was what was omitted from that information  as the Tribunal incorrectly perceived  which was part of the critical reasoning that it adopted   In a practical sense  in the present case  one only has to think that if the Tribunal had told the appellant of its erroneous understanding that her original application was relevant for the review because there was no assertion of harm  she would have been able to point out that that was a complete misreading and that she had claimed that her house had been burnt  It is pointless to speculate as to what might have happened thereafter  for the imperative requirements of the Act were not observed and the consequence is that the procedural fairness which the Act mandated be accorded to the appellant was denied her  For that reason I am of opinion that there was a jurisdictional error vitiating the Tribunal s decision followedNABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As the Full Court said in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at              if the Tribunal makes an error of fact in misunderstanding or misconstruing a claim advanced by the applicant and bases its conclusion in whole or in part upon the claim so misunderstood or misconstrued its error is tantamount to a failure to consider the claim and on that basis can constitute jurisdictional error  The same may be true if a claim is raised by the evidence  albeit not expressly by the applicant  and is misunderstood or misconstrued by the Tribunal  Every case must be considered according to its own circumstances  Error of fact  although amounting to misconstruction of an applicant s claim  may be of no consequence to the outcome  It may be  subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which  the  contention rests which has been rejected  Applicant WAEE  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD    at    But as the Full Court said in WAEE  at           If the tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which  if accepted  would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion  and if that contention is supported by probative material  the tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty  imposed by s   to conduct a review of the decision  This is a matter of substance  not a matter of the form of the tribunal s published reasons for decision  followedNAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   Jacobson J considered the position where an applicant for review had been asked by the Tribunal when giving oral evidence as to whether the material in that applicant s original visa application was true and correct  He held that the answer and the matter to which it referred was not information given by that applicant within the meaning of the exception in s  A b   at      I agree with his analyis for the reasons his Honour gave   Where the Tribunal seeks to use the way in which an applicant for review formulated his or her claim originally as part of the reason for rejecting the claim  whether by reason of omissions or not  I am of opinion that in the natural and ordinary meaning of the language of the section  the original application or grounds stated by the applicant for review cannot be other than a part of the reason for rejecting the claim when that rejection is expressed in the language used in the Tribunal s reasons in the present case   Accordingly  I am of opinion that there has been a jurisdictional error established in the reasons of the Tribunal in that it failed to give the appellant particulars in accordance with or otherwise comply with s  A  in coming to the conclusion that the appellant had not suffered harm  inter alia   because she had been untruthful regarding the destruction of her house  That conclusion was based  at least in part  on the Tribunal taking into account the information which the appellant originally put before the delegate in the visa application followedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Moreover  his Honour asked Ms Wong  who had also appeared before him as counsel for the Minister  to make submissions on a possible contravention of the procedure laid down in s  A in light of the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    His Honour adopted as correct Ms Wong s submissions that there had been no contravention of s  A because sufficient independent bases for the Tribunal s decision appeared in its reasons   FMCA       But as Allsop J pointed out in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at        Weinberg J agreeing at   FCAFC     that approach is inconsistent with the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    I agree with Weinberg and Allsop JJ  The decision of the majority of the High Court in SAAP v Minister   HCA         ALR   of course  was decided after Finn and Stone JJ s judgment was given  Hayne J  with whom Kirby J expressly agreed on this point   ALR at       said that where the Act prescribes steps that the Tribunal must take in conducting its review and those steps were directed to informing the applicant for review  among other things  of the relevance to the review of the information that is conveyed  any failure to comply with the requirements of s  A rendered the decision invalid  McHugh J was equally emphatic   ALR at     appliedSecretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council   UKHL       AC   Lord Wilberforce said in Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council   UKHL       AC   at  D E        If a judgment requires

appellant s claim about her house in the present case was highlighted by the Tribunal s positive conclusion that she had been untruthful about it  That was tantamount to a finding that she had deliberately lied  Whether or not the lie was on oath  there is a difference between the rejection of a person s evidence and a finding that he or she deliberately lied as Brennan  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ explained in Smith v NSW Bar Association   HCA         CLR   at    Their Honour s concluded     But  as a matter of logic and common sense  something more than mere rejection of a person s evidence is necessary before there can be a positive finding that he or she deliberately lied in the giving of that evidence   The finding of the appellant lying about her claim was tied by the Tribunal to its misconception of what the original claim was and was arrived at in the prism of that pejorative misconception reversedSZDGB v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  In this appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate   SZDGB v Minister for Immigration   FMCA   the only issues which realistically could amount to a jurisdictional error by the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  are  first  whether the provisions of s  A  of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act  were observed and  secondly  whether the Tribunal made a mere error of fact by wrongly finding that the appellant had not claimed that her house had been burnt down in her original claim for a protection visa   The appellant is a citizen of the Republic of Indonesia of Chinese ethnicity  She arrived in Australia on   March    On   March   she lodged an application for Protection  Class XA  Visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  the Department   On   September   a delegate of the first respondent  the Minister  refused to grant a protection visa   On   October   the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate s decision  The reasons which she gave in the application for review were that she did not agree with the delegate s decision because the Chinese were persecuted in Indonesia  were the victims of racism there and many had been murdered in that country  She also made some assertions about the then President of Indonesia and sought  empathy    Moreover  his Honour asked Ms Wong  who had also appeared before him as counsel for the Minister  to make submissions on a possible contravention of the procedure laid down in s  A in light of the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    His Honour adopted as correct Ms Wong s submissions that there had been no contravention of s  A because sufficient independent bases for the Tribunal s decision appeared in its reasons   FMCA     followedSZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Moreover  there is a number of judgments in the Court in which conflicting views have been expressed as to whether the general proposition in VAF v Minister     ALR   at   lays down a rule of general application that identified gaps  defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps etc  can never amount to information  In SZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     Allsop J pointed out there may be a distinction  sometimes fine  but nevertheless important  between information which may be knowledge acquired by the Tribunal and the subjective appraisal or thought processes of it  His Honour concluded  at   FCA   at            If  as here  the very form and content of a statement  including what was not said  is central to the rejection of virtually all of the evidence of the appellant  I do not see anything  Branson J said  in NIAH of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     FCA   at   as necessarily inconsistent with an application of s  A      To say that there is no information here because the statement  which is information  lacked the aspect now being adduced would be to fail to recognize that the information that is central to the reason for the decision is that the appellant said so much and no more on an earlier occasion  That is the relevant information  followedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  At no time did the Tribunal give the appellant any particulars under s  A  The Tribunal had before it  and had regard to  the information which the applicant had provided in her original visa application and the other material in the departmental file  including that which the delegate had elicited from her  None of the information of the kind just mentioned fell within the meaning of the exception in s  A b  SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at             applying Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al

toSZGIZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Minister also referred me to more recent authority including Stone J s decision in SZGIZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     to like effect  The Minister submitted that the Tribunal had a duty to consider all the material before it for the purposes of identifying what claim or claims an applicant for review had made in support of the claim for a protection visa  relying on the decision of the High Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR    see e g  at         and    For that purpose it was said that the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to all of the material before it discussedVAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   The Minister argued that for the obligation to provide particulars under s  A  to be engaged  the Tribunal must consider that the information to which it refers is adverse to the applicant for review s claim to have the review decided in his or her favour and must be integral to the decision  The Minister relied on a line of authority in the Court  in particular the decision of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at      Moreover  the Minister submitted that to the extent that the Tribunal s reasons identified omissions in the claims made by the appellant in support of her application for a visa it was the omissions and nothing more which constituted the reason why  or the integral part of the reasoning why  the Tribunal came to reject the appellant s claim  In that respect the Minister relied upon what Finn and Stone JJ had earlier said in the VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at       namely      As to the first of these  there is now a considerable body of case law concerned with the compass of the term  information  in its s  A  setting  The following propositions emerge from it             i  the purpose of s  A is to provide in part a statutory

imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice  VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     BC                       ii  the word  information  in s  A  has the same meaning as ins   Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at       and in this setting it refers to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the tribunal  Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     BC  at   irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis  Win  at         and                  iii  the word does not encompass the tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes or determinations  Tin at   Paul at
