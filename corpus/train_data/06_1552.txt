fairness    at   This is also pointed out by Isaacs and Rich JJ in Gould and Birbeck and Bacon at         pleadings should state with sufficient clearness the case of the party whose averments they are  That is their function  Their function is discharged when the case is presented with reasonable clearness  Any want of clearness can be cured by amendment or particulars   No real explanation has been given by the applicants as to why  in light of the information the applicants appeared to receive on discovery and which lead to the inclusion in Mr Tracey s statement of evidence in the form of pars               and   no application has been made before now to amend the amended statement of claim to plead these claims  To have sought to rely on this evidence only by the vehicle of the witness statement is  at best  with respect  unwise   However having said this  the principles I need to apply in relation to this matter are clear citedHurley v McDonald s Australia Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my view notwithstanding the lateness of this application    Opening submissions have not yet been made in this trial  Trial time has  until today  been occupied with rulings as to admissibility of evidence  one of which has resulted in this application  Although evidence in chief closed some months ago  this is not a case as discussed by Barwick CJ in Leotta where examination and cross examination of witnesses and their evidence has already taken place     The material has been before the respondents since   May   in the form of evidence in a statement of the second applicant  I acknowledge the points made by Mr Bell concerning the substance of the claims  however I also note comments made by Mr Perry to the effect that the substance of these complaints are articulated in the relevant paragraphs of Mr Tracy s affidavit     The fact that the proposed amendments appear to have substance in substantiating the claims of the applicants militates towards granting leave to allow the amendments to be made  on the basis that disallowing them could have a substantial effect on the outcome of the proceedings  I note in this regard comments of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Hurley v McDonald s Australia Ltd   FCA   at        Although the respondents have expressed concerns as to compensation by way of costs  the respondents are entitled to apply for costs to compensate them in respect of this late amendment and the Court would entertain such an application  The respondents have already indicated that they are not interested in applying for an adjournment appliedKetteman v Hansel Properties Ltd   AC   This was to some extent adopted by Lord Griffiths in Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd   AC   at   although his Lordship indicated that the position could be very different if an application were  for example  made at the end of the trial by a defendant seeking to run a defence wholly different from that pleaded  In summary his Lordship said    Whether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge who should be guided in the exercise of the discretion by an assessment of where justice lies     Justice cannot always be measured in terms of money     A judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants  the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues  the raising of false hopes and the legitimate expectation that the trial would determine the issues one way or the other     The judge must weigh in the balance the pressure on the courts caused by the greater increase in litigation   His Lordship also said  Furthermore to allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end of the trial      at  appliedLeotta v Public Transport Commission  NSW      ALR   As Barwick CJ said in Leotta v Public Transport Commission  NSW      ALR   at      It is  of course  proper to allow a plaintiff to amend their pleadings during the course of the trial provided the interest of the defendant can be adequately safeguarded by adjournment and otherwise  That is one thing and a matter of common enough experience  But to my mind it is quite another and a very different thing to allow the plaintiff  after the evidence is closed  evidence which has been taken with a view to the cause of action set up in the pleadings  to then formulate a new claim which has not been the subject of examination in the evidence   The issues for trial need in every case to be settled  preferably before the trial begins  If they need amendment during the trial in order to allow the matter really in difference between the parties to be litigated  then the necessary amendments should be made so that thereafter it can clearly be seen to what the evidence thereafter to be given  ought to be addressed     In my view notwithstanding the lateness of this application    Opening submissions have not yet been made in this trial  Trial time has  until today  been occupied with rulings as to admissibility of evidence  one of which has resulted in this application  Although evidence in chief closed some

respondents have already indicated that they are not interested in applying for an adjournment citedState of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In summary  Mr Bell on behalf of the respondents submitted in reply    The pleadings in proposed pars  f  to  k  do not indicate why they are misleading or deceptive for the purposes of par  A of the amended statement of claim     The respondents do not know the nature of the complaints in proposed pars  f  to  k   By way of example  Mr Bell argued that in relation to proposed par  f  it was unclear whether the applicants were complaining about an issue concerning chemicals  or EBS disease  or some other problem     As a result  the respondents have not addressed these points in preparing their case  they have not had their witnesses address these points in their statements  and they have not prepared cross examination on this basis     Given the history of non compliance by the applicants with directions of this Court in this matter  it would be unfair to the respondents to permit such a late further amendment to the statement of claim  Mr Bell strongly pressed the point that  notwithstanding the principle articulated by the High Court of Australia in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim  the extent of the  dalliance  of the applicants in complying with Court directions is now at the stage of being unfair to the respondents  In this light  Mr Bell submitted that the proposed amendments to the statement of claim do cause the respondents a problem     An adjournment and a costs order would mean nothing because the applicants have no money   I note that  if I were to allow the proposed amendments to the further amended statement of claim by inclusion of pars  A f  to  k  there is potential scope for readmittance to evidence of the paragraphs in Mr Tracy s statement which were deleted following my ruling on Tuesday  and to which I have already made reference in this judgment  I do not decide this issue at this stage   I acknowledge Mr Bell s points concerning lateness of compliance by the applicants with Court directions  This is a source of inconvenience to the Court and the respondents and is an issue in relation to which the respondents could make submissions as to costs during the substantive hearing of this matter  It is unfortunate that this matter has been characterised by what appear to be irregularities in compliance with directions  when the purpose of directions is to provide certainty to the parties and this Court  Obviously  the most recent example of what I describe as these irregularities is the application before me today
