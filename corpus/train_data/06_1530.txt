person aggrieved  by the  relevant act  omission or decision   The term  person aggrieved  was discussed by Gummow J in the context of an application for an order of review under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   ADJR Act  in Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers v Secretary  Department of Transport     FCR   at      His Honour observed that the term  aggrieved  has long appeared in statutes as a way of identifying persons who have standing to utilise a procedure established by the statute    He said       In each instance the content of the expression is to be seen in the light of the scope and purpose of the statute in issue    citedTooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs     FLR   What emerges from his Honour s judgment  by reference to common law standing requirements for the issue of certiorari is that  at            it was by no means apparent that  grievance  necessarily involved injury to property or present legal interests or  special damage  in any technical sense      His Honour acknowledged the force of the observation by Ellicott J in Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs     FLR   at     that the meaning of a  person aggrieved  is      not encased in any technical rules and that much depends upon the nature of the particular decision and the extent to which the interest of the applicant rises above that of an ordinary member of the public   Gummow J was considering the term in the context of standing to bring an application under the ADJR Act which has specified grounds for judicial review  The scope of review under s   is not confined by specified grounds citedEx parte Sidebotham  Re Sidebotham     Ch D   McLelland J discussed the term  person aggrieved  in

Development Corporation Ltd   NSWR   Where an appeal is brought against a discretionary or evaluative decision of receivers and managers  and particular decisions involving qualitative judgment  the scope for curial intervention is necessarily confined  In the case of a court appointed receiver and manager  Street J in Duffy v Super Centre Development Corporation Ltd     NSWR   said  at        The receiver and manager is appointed as an officer of the Court to undertake in that capacity the management of the business of the company as well  of course  as undertaking the care of the company s assets  To the extent to which he makes decisions from time to time  they are in effect made under the authority of the Court itself  and they are subject to review and control by the Court should a proper case be made out requiring such intervention  Whilst this Court does  therefore  have an ultimate control over the day to day actions of a receiver and manager  it is a control which is not in my view to be too freely exercised  If  of course  there can be shown to be some defect in the manner in which the receiver and manager is conducting his duties a defect arising out of some want of good faith or out of some erroneous approach in law or in principle then that is clearly a ground on which the Court would entertain an application by one of the interested parties for appropriate directions or some other form of remedial order  Where  however  the challenge made is that there has been an absence of prudence and wisdom in the receiver s decisions  a far heavier onus rests upon the party who seeks to challenge the decision in question  The Court will not concern itself with minor and ordinary decisions that he may have made  it must be shown that there is a decision of real significance in the affairs of the company and as to which there are real and substantial grounds for questioning its correctness before the Court will embark upon an investigation of what  if any  directions ought to be given      Those observations were repeated by his Honour in Re Mineral Securities Australia Ltd  In Liq      NSWLR   at   a case involving a challenge to a decision of a liquidator  To the extent that those observations related to court appointed receivers and managers  they apply with greater force to receivers and manages privately appointed with extensive powers

   The appeal to the court from a liquidator s rejection of a proof of debt arises under s   Corporations Act    Cth   That section is one which enables appeals to the court to be made in relation to manner of acts  omissions or decisions of a liquidator  The role which the court takes on the appeal is affected significantly by the nature of the act  omission or decision which is being appealed against  Where the appeal is against a discretionary decision by a liquidator  or against a decision involving matters of business judgment  the court will reverse the liquidator s decision only when it is satisfied that he was acting unreasonably or in bad faith      His Honour went on at   to distinguish the approach taken on an appeal from a liquidator s rejection of a proof of debt  a distinction which I respectfully accept   I would not set the threshold required under s   in respect of the discretionary decisions of private receivers and managers so high that it is necessary to show that there has been something akin to unreasonableness in the sense necessary to vitiate the exercise of a statutory power under administrative law  It is sufficient to say that at the very least the person bringing an appeal under s   in these circumstances must demonstrate that the decision is informed by some error of law or significant factual error or is otherwise so unreasonable  in the circumstances  that it should not be allowed to stand  The content of those somewhat ambulatory considerations will be informed by the significance of the decision to the affairs of the company   In the present case  having regard to the obligations of the receivers and managers under the Charge  the limited cash  in their judgment  available to the company  its liability to the mortgagee and the potential claims of other creditors  I see no basis upon which the receivers and managers  refusal to make available funding for the purpose of defending winding up proceedings should be interfered with  The company has charged all of its assets in favour of the mortgagee  In so doing it has disabled itself  following the appointment of the receivers and managers  from having access to those assets for other purposes  Mr Carey s arguments about the financial position of the company do not establish a basis for gainsaying the judgment of the receivers and managers   Whether or not after protracted proceedings it might be shown that the receivers and managers  evaluation was erroneous and that of Mr Carey correct  is not a possibility that can form a basis for interfering with the decision   The amount required is small  It may be that if Mr Carey wishes to defend the proceedings in the name of the company it can be obtained from some other source  I decline to interfere with the decision of the receivers and managers in this case    I certify that the preceding forty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice
