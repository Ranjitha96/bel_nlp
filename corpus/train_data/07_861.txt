      Pty Ltd  Controller Appointed  v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toHunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   Section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   AAT Act  provides that a person such as the applicant may appeal to this Court  on a question of law  from any decision of the Tribunal  The AAT Act provides that such an appeal is to be instituted not later than   days after  a document setting out the terms of the decision of the Tribunal is given to the person or within such further time as the  Court  allows  see s  A  of the AAT Act   Where a person makes an application to institute an appeal out of time  the Court will consider the relevant factors  including any explanation the applicant may advance for the delay and the applicant s prospects on the appeal  if leave were granted  see  for example  Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   at     per Wilcox J  There may be other matters too  such as the prejudice to the applicant  or the respondent   It is not suggested that the respondent would suffer any prejudice by reason of the applicant s delay in instituting the appeal if leave were granted  The Tribunal gave its decision on   November   and emailed a copy of the decision to the applicant s accountant the same day  The delay in instituting this application on   December   is insignificant  Unsurprisingly  the respondent neither consents to nor opposes the application for an extension of time   If there were merit in the appeal  then a refusal to grant leave would plainly prejudice the applicant referred toErgon Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  First  the notice of appeal as presently drafted does not state a ground of appeal that this Court can hear and determine  Under s   of the AAT Act   the subject matter of an appeal from the Tribunal is the question of law that is

Branson J referred toRe Jarra Hills Pty Ltd and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   Moreover  even if the applicant were able to formulate a question of law raising the issues considered by the Tribunal in this case  it is unlikely that error would be shown in the Tribunal s decision  Section   of the SGA Act does provide for the amendment of assessments but it was not suggested  and the circumstances do not indicate  that the power to amend might properly have been exercised in the case of the applicant  As the Tribunal noted  there would appear to be no legislative provision that would accord a decision maker the power to remit all or part of the SGC  or nominal interest and administrative component  see  in this regard  the discussions in Re Jarra Hills Pty Ltd and the

austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Court s discretion to grant leave to a company to carry on proceedings other than by a solicitor has been considered from time to time  Recently  Bennett J commented in Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd   FCA   at   that such discretion must be exercised judicially according to the requirements of justice and in favour of the company where sufficient reason is demonstrated   I accept that  as the respondent argued  Mr Bellin produced very little evidence in support of his application to represent the applicant  In other circumstances  this would be reason enough to decline the leave that has been sought  It would appear  however  that a controller has been appointed to the applicant  Given the nature of the application and the particular circumstances of the case  including Mr Bellin s familiarity with the matter  I would grant Mr Bellin the leave he seeks solely for the purposes of my hearing and determining this application   I certify that the preceding thirty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny    Associate Dated    June   Counsel for the Applicant  The applicant was represented by its director  Mr H  Bellin     Solicitor for the Respondent  Mr S  Linden of the Australian Government Solicitor     Date of Hearing
