Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment  Heritage   the Arts   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAnvil Hill Project Watch Association Inc v Minister for the Environment and Water Resources     ALD   at   The function of the referral step is not to fix in stone all the details of a proposed  action  for the subsequent approval process  Rather  this mechanism results in the proposal either being brought within the Environment Act assessment and approval regime  or being exempted from the requirements of assessment and approval under the Act  In Anvil Hill Project Watch Association Inc v Minister for the Environment and Water Resources     ALD   at   Stone J described the scheme of the Act as providing     an initial clearing house so that actions that are likely to have a significant impact on the environment are properly assessed and those that do not fall into that category may be identified in a timely way and not impeded    The referral mechanism operates as a kind of triage system  It is not the function of the triage nurse to make a detailed diagnosis  let alone prescribe treatment   Since the environmental approval process for a major project can stretch out over years  as witness the present case  it would be a strange result if making an environment positive  or environment neutral but cost positive  change meant proponents were forced to start all over again  with inevitable cost and delay  If Blue Wedges  argument is correct there would be a strong disincentive for proponents to keep looking for environmentally friendly changes to a project   The text of the Environment Act does not support Blue Wedges  construction   The term  action  is defined in the broadest terms  By s   it includes     a  a project  and    b  a development  and    c  an undertaking  and    d  an activity or series of activities  and        e  an alteration of any of the things mentioned in paragraph  a   b   c  or  d           This width of definition is not surprising  given the varied work that the term has to do in the Act  including in the prohibitions in Pt   and given the limitless range of possible human conduct which might affect the environment  ranging from major complex operations like the Project to a simple  transient event   When it comes to particular proposed actions  the Act does not purport to define a particular proposed action by reference to a description of the proposed action given in any document  Further  subject to certain limited exceptions described below  the Act does not require the referral to contain any particular information or to descend to any particular level of detail about the proposed action citedBuck v Bavone   HCA         CLR   at    http www austlii edu

construction presented in that case were not questions of general importance  citedMees v Roads Corporation   FCA         FCR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Blue Wedges argued that the regime established under Ch   of the Act proceeds on the assumption that the nature of an action referred for assessment will remain consistent throughout the assessment process  It said the regime is predicated on a series of decisions designed to ensure that the impacts of the action which has been referred are adequately assessed for each of the designated controlling provisions  That regime  it is said  would be subverted if the action changed during the course of the referral process such that the impacts of the action were likely to be different from the impacts of the action which was originally referred for determination  It is for this reason  so the argument went  that the Act places such importance on the accuracy of the information provided for the purposes of assessment  Blue Wedges cited Mees v Roads Corporation   FCA         FCR   at     where it was said the Minister     has no fact finding role in the process of examining a referral of a proposed action  The Environment Minister must make a decision on the information provided in the referral  This consideration renders it all the more important that the referral document must contain information that is truthful and complete  so as not to mislead   However  the Act expressly provides for the Minister to invite comments on the referral from various persons and bodies  including the public at large  s   and to seek further information from the proponent  s    Nor is there any reason to suppose that the Minister could not seek advice on factual matters from the Department or from any other person who might be able to assist the Minister in making a decision  Further  s   enables the Minister to reconsider his or her decision under s   in various circumstances  including where new information becomes available or where there has been a substantial change in circumstances relating to the likely impacts of a proposed action  So while obtaining truthful and accurate information is without doubt important  the freedom explicitly given to the Minister to obtain information from any source suggests  amongst other things  that it was contemplated the Minister might want information about a change in the proposed action   Although in the present case the Referral came for the  then  proponent of the Project under s   the Environment Act also provides that a referral may come from a State or Territory  s   or a Commonwealth agency  s    There is a further provision that if the Federal Minister believes a person proposes to take an action that the Minister thinks may be or is a controlled action  the Minister may request that person  or a State or Territory that has responsibilities relating to the action  to refer the proposal  s     Thus the Environment Act contemplates that a proposed action may be referred and made subject to the Act s processes whether the proponent likes it or not  This is hardly surprising  it could not be left up to proponents to decide whether or not the Act should apply  The significance of this for present purposes is that a proposed action may be referred to the Federal Minister against the wishes of the proponent  and regardless of its stage of development  and whether or not the proponent has had the opportunity to respond to issues raised by the Minister or anybody else  It would be quite unworkable if in such circumstances the proposed action could only be assessed in its form as at the time of referral   Moreover  none of the decisional steps along the way the controlled action decision  identification of controlling provisions  selection of assessment method require a detailed assessment of the proposed action  That step only comes when the assessment itself is carried out and the subsequent approval given or refused  There seems to be no point in insisting that all the details of the proposed action remain the same throughout the whole process citedMinister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Accordingly  Blue Wedges submitted  the Assessment did not adequately assess all of the impacts of the Project  By making his decision on the basis of the Assessment and by failing to request additional information under s   of the Act  the Minister has failed to have regard to all considerations relevant to his decision under s   of the Act  see Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc   FCAFC         FCR     Although s  d  of the Environment Act envisages that the Assessment report should contain  enough  information to let the Minister make an  informed decision  the Act does not require that the report is the sole repository of information for the Minister to make such a decision  Indeed  s    amongst other sections  assumes that the Minister may have other sources of information available on which to base a decision under s   and may need to utilise those sources even after the receipt of an Assessment report   Section   of the Act provides    If the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that he or she does not have enough information to make an informed decision whether or not to approve for the purposes of a controlling provision the taking of an action  the Minister may request any of the following to provide specified information relevant to the making of the decision         a  the person proposing to take the action          e  any other person the Minister considers appropriate
