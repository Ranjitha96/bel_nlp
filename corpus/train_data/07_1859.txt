Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Engaging in resale price maintenance is engaging in anti competitive conduct  which the legislature has prohibited in the public interest  As Merkel J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd   FCA     Humax   at   engaging in resale price maintenance is a serious offence  This is apparent from the magnitude of the pecuniary penalties that corporations  and those through whom they act  may face for contravention of s   of the Act    The consent orders proposed by the parties include       a  declarations under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  that the particular conduct in which each of the respondents engaged constituted a contravention of the Act    b  injunctions restraining each of the respondents from engaging in proscribed conduct for a period of three years from the date of the order   c  orders requiring TEAC to establish an education and compliance programme for its employees     d  an order that TEAC pay a pecuniary penalty of   in four instalments  and    e  an order that Mr Allison pay a pecuniary penalty of   in four instalments     There is to be a further order  providing for what is to happen in the event of default in the payment of any instalment of penalty   The proposed probation order in this case is very like the probation orders made by Merkel J in Humax and by Tracey J in Digital Products  Section  D contemplates orders of the kind proposed as adverse publicity orders  see orders   and   in the proposed minute of orders   I also accept that the proposed penalties are consistent with the proper application of the totality and parity principles  compare Digital Products and Dataline at      I was referred to a schedule of previous determinations  Whilst I have had regard to it  I have also borne in mind the observations in Dataline   where a Full Court said  at        T  he Court is confirmed in the view that there is little to be gained in undertaking     a detailed comparative analysis of the conduct of each corporation in the identified cases  the extent to which particular officers of those corporations engaged in the contravening conduct or the scale and dimension of the conduct  The constellation of circumstances  essential character of the conduct and the factors to be weighed by the Court are inevitably sufficiently different in each case that previous determinations ultimately provide little utility in precisely informing the appropriate pecuniary penalty to be imposed in any particular contravention      However  an assessment of previous determinations in relation to resale price maintenance conduct may provide a high level broad range within which an appropriate pecuniary penalty may be imposed having regard to the character and content of the contravention and other considerations reflecting some elements broadly consistent with the evidence in the particular case   After making these observations  the Court undertook an analysis of several cases with sufficiently similar facts to provide a high level broad range of comparison  The penalties imposed in a number of
