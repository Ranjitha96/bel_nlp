and Citizenship v SZLIX   FCAFC         ALR   at    appliedCollector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     ALR   The word  decision  in the Code has  by virtue of s   the same meaning as in the AAT Act   There was no suggestion that the removal of the approvals and registrations by the Authority was other than a  decision  for the purposes of the wide definition of that word provided in s   of the AAT Act   The issue is whether for the purposes of s  a  of the AAT Act it was a  decision s  made in the exercise of powers conferred by      s   of the Code  The meaning of  decision  in s   of the AAT Act was considered in Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     ALR    The majority construed  decision  as including one in purported exercise of powers conferred by the enactment  Brian Lawlor per Bowen CJ at   and Smithers J at     A number of decisions  using that word loosely  were made by the Authority  It made a decision to remove the approvals and registrations from the Record and Register respectively  This was the consequence of its earlier decision to treat these approvals and registrations as of no legal effect  a decision that  at law  it had made no decisions to approve under s   or to register under s   of the Code   The question here is whether the Authority s decision to regard the various approvals and registrations as of no effect at law and to implement that decision by  removing  those approvals and registrations from the Record and the Register constituted a purported exercise of powers conferred by the enactment and therefore reviewable pursuant to s   of the Code by the AAT  This test is an objective one  I would respectfully adopt what Bowen CJ said on this point in Brian Lawlor at       It seems inappropriate to interpret s   so as to make this dependent upon the state of mind of the official  It would  if adopted  appear to introduce a false issue and to impose upon the person aggrieved the burden of proving it  He could well be the very person  who was ignorant of that state of mind  Perhaps also it would involve the consequence that if the evidence on an appeal to the Tribunal showed that an official did not honestly believe he was acting in the exercise of powers conferred by the enactment  the appeal would have to be dismissed notwithstanding that the absence of honest belief might not affect the legal standing of the decision      in the ordinary course  it would be reasonably clear from the objective facts under which enactment or in the exercise of which statutory powers an official had purported to act  The adoption of this view would mean that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a decision in fact made  which purported to be made in the exercise of powers under an enactment  It could then proceed to determine whether the decision was properly made in fact and in law   Emphasis added   In my opinion it did not  The Authority took no step provided for under Div   of Part   of the Code directed to cancellation of approvals and registrations   Section   of the Code provides that the Authority must not cancel an approval or registration unless it has first given notice and then waited for an adequate period thereafter as provided under s  a  and  b   The Authority did not give any such notice s   It did not make entries in the Record or Register provided for under s   following cancellation under the Code   Nor did it give any notice under s  A  This was not by reason of error or omission on the part of the Authority  This is not a case involving a  colourable exercise of actual power  Brian Lawlor at p   per Deane J  The Authority deliberately took no steps to cancel the approvals and registrations under the Code  Here  the Authority placed no reliance  actual or purported  upon the Code to remove the approvals from the Record and the registrations from the Register  Indeed it stated in correspondence to Imtrade that as a result of fraud arising from the provision of the false name and address in respect of Evergreen the relevant active constituents were  unapproved  and the relevant chemical products were  unregistered    The Authority did issue a recall notice to Imtrade under s   of the Code  It was not a pre condition to doing so that the Authority must first have cancelled the registrations under Division   of Part   of the Code  It is open to the Authority to issue a recall notice where a chemical product is not registered  s  a   The Authority considered that the various chemical products were unregistered because the registrations  vitiated by fraud  had been  removed  from the Register   Accordingly it is  I think  wrong to

reading speech in respect of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill contained the following    Through this mechanism  evaluation  registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products and related matters will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals  The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control of use matters      The agvet code focuses on the registration of chemical products  approval of active constituents  and approval of labels  The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health  occupational health and safety  the environment  product performance  and trade and commerce  The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application  The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards discussedLeung v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     FCR   The Authority submits that the approval of each active constituent by the entry pursuant to s  a  of the Code in the Record of the relevant particulars was in law not an approval and could be ignored  The same is said of the registrations and the variations to the relevant particulars of registrations under s  a  and s  h i  respectively  This is so  it says  because subject to limited exceptions  a person will not be permitted to keep an advantage obtained by fraud  an administrative decision procured by fraud may be ignored as an invalid decision and of no effect at law  This is what the Authority has purported to do here  It has manifested its view that it may ignore the approvals in the Record and the registrations in the Register  which are each in electronic form  by deleting each of them  They no longer appear in the Record or the Register  It has not purported  as I have said  to cancel the approvals and registrations under the provisions of the Code  The Authority submits that the decision of the Full Court in Leung v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     FCR   is warrant for their actions   The issue in Leung was whether the Minister for Immigration could  absent an express statutory power to do so  revoke the grant of a certificate of Australian citizenship where the applicants had misled his delegate about their factual circumstances  The appellants sought a certificate of Australian Citizenship  which involved two steps  the Minister must grant the Certificate and the applicant must make the prescribed pledge of commitment  The appellants made representations of fact  asserting that during their time spent overseas they were engaged in activities beneficial to the interests of Australia  namely the promotion and export of Australian goods  rough opals and fresh produce to Hong Kong   On the basis of these representations the Minister exercised his discretion under s   of the Australian Citizenship Act    Cth  in favour of the appellants  In fact  the applicant and his wife had both been practicing as medical professionals in Hong Kong for the better part of the time they initially claimed to have been promoting Australian exports  The Certificates were granted  However  before the appellants made their pledges of commitment  it was discovered that the representations of fact were false  The Minister s delegate then decided to  revoke  the decision to grant the Certificates   The Court was divided in its reasoning  The majority  Finkelstein J and Beaumont J concurring  concluded that as the decision to grant the certificate was procured by fraud it was invalid and could be ignored without any formal process of revocation  It was unnecessary  the majority concluded  to rely upon any express or implied power of revocation under the statute to proceed as it did   Heerey J resolved the appeal on the basis of an implied statutory power to revoke a certificate of citizenship where a statutory criterion for the issue of the certificate did not in fact exist although such a power terminated once the pledge of commitment had been made because a person could not be deprived of citizenship other than by virtue of s   of the Citizenship Act   His Honour said   there is no general rule or principle of administrative law that decisions based upon a wrong factual basis may be revoked by the decision maker still less that such decisions do not need to be revoked and may simply be ignored  The supposed general rule would necessarily extend indefinitely in time and to factual errors for which persons affected by the decision were in no way responsible  Such persons might have arranged their own affairs on the basis of the decision   Finkelstein J however expressed the opinion that        the true principle is this  To ignore an invalid decision is not to revoke it  It is merely to recognise that that which purports to be a decision does not have that character  To decide the matter again is not a reconsideration of it  It is in fact the original exercise of the power to make the decision      Nor is there any need to find either an express or an implicit power of reconsideration  Those doctrines  to the extent that they are applicable to administrative decision making  only apply to validly made administrative decisions   In Leung the question of fact and law as to whether Mr and Mrs Leung were entitled to the favourable exercise of the discretion under s  b i  of the Citizenship Act was disputed  The dispute involved questions of fact  The Minister had not purported to rely upon the common law doctrine of vitiation by fraud but rather upon s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  as the source of power to revoke the certificate of citizenship  The AAT resolved the factual dispute in favour of the Minister  Finkelstein J observed that no point had been taken that the AAT lacked jurisdiction and proceeded on the basis that it did  Importantly however  when the matter was before the Full Court the factual controversy had been resolved  It was not in dispute by then that the decision to grant the certificate of citizenship had been procured by misrepresentation  The question was whether in those circumstances the decision to grant the certificate as a result of proven misrepresentation was thereby vitiated   The concept of invalidity involves questions of mixed fact and law  There may be evidentiary considerations  In Leung  Finkelstein J  drawing on observations by Lord Hoffman in R v Wicks   UKHL       AC   at   said at     In other words the presumption of the validity of an administrative decision  to the extent that the presumption is to be made in a particular case  is no more than a rule of evidence pursuant to which a certain assumption will be made by a judge unless there is evidence which contradicts that assumption  As Kirby J said in Ousley at   the presumption is merely a tool in

court decision to say so   Kirby J cites other strong support both judicial and from legal commentators in Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj     CLR   at       The concept of absolute invalidity has been rejected by the High Court  at least in the context of judgments and orders of federal courts declared by legislation to be  superior courts  of record  Bhardwaj per Kirby J at   Residual Assco Group Ltd v  The question of invalidity and its consequences was considered by the High Court in Bhardwaj  The respondent  whose student visa was cancelled by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs applied to the Immigration Review Tribunal for a review of the decision  The Tribunal proposed to deal with the matter on   September   and invited the respondent to attend a hearing  Late in the afternoon of   September   the Tribunal received  from the respondent s agent  a letter stating that the respondent was ill and would be unable to attend the next day  and requesting an adjournment  By an administrative oversight  the letter did not come to the attention of the member of the Tribunal to whom the matter had been assigned  The Tribunal dealt with the matter on   and   September  adversely to the respondent  and notified the respondent and his agent on   September  The reason given for the Tribunal s decision was that the respondent had not provided any information which suggested that the cancellation of his visa was unfair or inappropriate  When the respondent s agent was informed of the decision  the attention of the Tribunal member was drawn to the letter of   September  A new hearing date was arranged  The Tribunal heard the respondent s explanation of the conduct which had resulted in the cancellation of his visa  accepted the explanation  and  on   October   revoked the cancellation  The issue in the appeal concerned the capacity of the Tribunal to proceed as it did thereby correcting its own error  The Minister contended that the power of the Tribunal to review the delegate s decision was spent after it made the decision in September   Likewise  the error in Bhardwaj might be characterised as  flagrantly invalid  to use the language of Cooke J in Blenheim   In their joint judgment  Gaudron and Gummow JJ referred to the decision as one which  clearly involved a failure to exercise jurisdiction   Hayne J said that it was not seriously disputed in the Courts below or in the High Court that due to an oversight  the Tribunal had not given the respondent the opportunity to appear and give evidence and present arguments which s  a  of the Migration Act    Cth  required he be given before the Tribunal made the September decision  This was the jurisdictional error involved   In Bhardwaj Hayne J in the same vein said    If there is no challenge to the validity of an administrative act or decision  whether directly by proceedings for judicial review or collaterally in some other proceeding in which its validity is raised incidentally  the act or decision may be presumed to be valid  But again  that is a presumption which operates  chiefly  in circumstances where there is no challenge to the legal effect of what has been done  Where there is a challenge  the presumption may serve only to identify and emphasise the need for proof of some invalidating feature before a conclusion of invalidity may be reached  It is not a presumption which may be understood as affording all administrative acts and decisions validity and binding effect until they are set aside   Whether an administrative decision ought be presumed to be valid until set aside by a court will depend upon the particular case having regard always to the particular legislation under which the decision was made   In my opinion  the presumption in this case cannot be displaced  merely at the instance of the Authority  in the face of factual questions  the resolution of which is necessary before determining the legal validity or otherwise of the several decisions to approve and to register  It is a fact that incorrect information was given to the Authority by Imtrade concerning the name and address of the manufacturer  Evergreen was a fictitious name  The factual question whether this affected induced or procured the several decisions is disputed  The Authority cannot determine that question for itself   There is a further reason why curial disposition is necessary in this case  The presumption of validity is of particular importance here because the legislation involves a system of approvals and registration affecting innocent third parties  Approvals and registrations require by s   and   respectively to be published by the Authority  at least in the Gazette  The position under s   in respect to variations and s   in respect to suspensions or cancellations is the same  Approval and registration confers important rights upon third parties such as suppliers and purchasers of chemical products  It also protects them against criminal liability  For example  supply and possession with the intent to supply unapproved active constituents and unregistered chemical products are offences under the Code  ss         Some offences are indictable offences  s   and may involve imprisonment  ss         Conviction for offences under the Code may involve forfeiture of property  s    Part  A of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals  Administration  Act   deals with importation  manufacture and export of chemicals  Under Part  A   it is an offence to import into Australia an active constituent that has not been approved or a chemical product that is not registered  s  B   The removal of the approvals and registrations by merely deleting these electronically has the very real potential to expose innocent third parties to prosecution as well as financial loss  The system of recorded approvals and registrations enables third parties to organise their affairs accordingly   Compliance with the Code may also be the subject of injunctions  as well as action involving the execution of search warrants with Inspectors having powers of entry and seizure   Furthermore  Part     Div   of the Code empowers the Authority in certain circumstances to suspend or cancel approvals and registrations  Upon cancellation  the Authority must give written notice to interested and approved persons as defined in s   and to any other person it believes notice should be given  s  A   After such notice  that person is taken to have been issued with a permit to  possess  have custody of  use or otherwise deal  with the constituent or product for a certain period of time  s  A   A penalty applies for not acting in accordance with the instructions contained in the notice  s  A  ss         Accordingly  s  A  protects  for a period of time  third parties affected by the cancellation  That protection is not available to them in the circumstances which presently exist  The Authority issued a recall notice to Imtrade under s   of the Code  I will consider this in more detail below  It is relevant in the present context to note that under Clause   of the Notice  which sets out various definitions  there is included the word  Permit   It is stated to mean a permit under Part   of the  Agvet Codes   There is however no operative clause in the Notice concerning permits  A consideration of Part   of the Code immediately demonstrates that its provisions are not apt to the circumstances of this case   The observations of Hayne J at   and Kirby J at   in Bhardwaj are relevant to these third party considerations   In my opinion  it is for this Court to decide the legal question involving as it does a preliminary factual enquiry  Indeed  the Authority seeks declarations from this Court that each approval and each registration was of no legal effect because each was affected  procured or induced by fraud  I will now consider those questions citedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It is fundamental to the Authority s case that invalidity be

possibility  Wati v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at      Wati on this point was referred to with apparent approval by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and

HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There has been much controversy as to whether invalid administrative decisions may simply be ignored by the decision maker without judicial determination  The debate between the absolute and relative invalidity schools of thought is far from resolved  There is a very useful discussion of these in a paper presented by Robert Orr and Robyn Briese at an AIAL Forum in October   Don t Think Twice  Can Administrative Decision Making Change Their Mind  Absolute invalidity means that a decision maker  and those affected by the invalid decision may just ignore it as if it had never been made  There is no requirement for judicial review to achieve this result  It does not constitute a decision  Support for it is found in Ouslow v R   HCA         CLR   per McHugh J and by some commentators  Sykes  Lanham  Tracey and Esser  General Principles of Administrative Law   th ed  Butterworths    at  referred toPosner v Collector for Inter State Destitute Persons  Vict      CLR   Hayne J attached significance to whether the earlier decision would be set aside by the Federal Court or the High Court under s  v  of the Constitution at   concluding that where a decision would be set aside the power has not been exercised         It might seem that the practical application of such a test by a decision maker raises its own self evident difficulties  absent clear authority on all fours  with the circumstances of the case in question  However I do not take his Honour to have been referring to circumstances other than where there is a clear error involved as in his citation at   of Dixon J in Posner v Collector for Inter State Destitute Persons  Vict      CLR   at   suggests   How is invalidity to be determined  In the present case  alleged fraud amounting to jurisdictional error is involved  However the facts other than in respect to the variation of relevant particulars in respect of   existing valid registrations are in contest  Accordingly  it cannot be assumed that a Court would set aside the decisions of the Authority  Even in respect to the variations to the particulars  I do not think that it could be assumed that the provision of false particulars would lead a Court to declare the underlying valid registrations as thereby invalid  Posited in that way  it might be said that the necessary precondition to the right to ignore a decision  earlier made  has not been established and necessarily requires judicial determination of both fact and law on the question of validity

information was material to the Authority s decision making process  No reason has been proffered as to why this information was to be regarded as significant other than for the purpose of complying with Regs   and   which concern events after the relevant decisions were made  cf Sharples v O Shea  unreported Supreme Court of Queensland  Atkinson J    August   at     The position in respect to the registration of chemical products is to the same effect  registration under s   is effected by the entry in the Register  amongst other things  of the particulars prescribed by Regulation    However this occurs only after the Authority decides to register under s     It is no answer for Mr Suter to say in his affidavit sworn on   June   at   Unless the APVMA was satisfied that the second respondent had provided any information that the APVMA required  under section   of the Agvet Code  it could not grant the application for approval or registration  If the second respondent at the time it made its applications for approval of the active constituents and registration of chemical products had told the APVMA in its applications that the information concerning the identity of the manufacturer and site of manufacture to be entered into the Record and the Register respectively was false  or if the APVMA had been aware of the falsity of those particulars  the APVMA would not have

issue of fraud  did not seek to prove what information it actually had received and relied upon in making its several decisions to approve and register under ss         Rather  senior counsel for the Authority referring to the statement of French J said    We know what was the fraud  we know how it was effected and how it was acted on  It was acted on by the making of the registration  The fact that it was operative     flows from the legislation that it was operative      Accordingly  the case for the Authority is that the provision of the fictitious name and address of Evergreen being particulars prescribed under Regulations   and   necessarily leads  as a matter of inference  to the conclusion that each approval and registration was procured or induced by fraud  I do not agree   Section  a  and  b  together provide in effect that an application to the Authority under s   for approval of an active constituent or for registration of a chemical product must be made in writing in or to the effect of the approved form and contain  or be accompanied by  any information that the Authority requires  There is no evidence as to whether the various applications were made in or to the

No       NSWLR   Fraud requires to be strictly articulated and proved  Wentworth v Rogers  No       NSWLR   at  D per Kirby P  A finding of fraud is not to be made lightly  I am not persuaded that the misinformation provided  at some point  by Imtrade to the Authority led to operative fraud  namely  that the Authority was actually induced by the provision of that information to make the decisions to approve and to register  I am not prepared to infer such fraud merely because Regs   and   require particulars of the name and address of the manufacturer to be recorded and registered  There are provisions in the Code which lend support to the conclusion that such information is not operative in the making of those decisions   First  the provision of such particulars is not immediately referable to the objects of the Act or Code which as I have indicated centre upon concerns of safety and health of individuals  animals and the environment  The Authority points to paragraph  d  of the preamble to the Code which concerns the creation of a regulatory system that is open and accountable and which gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of chemical and veterinary products  The particulars in question do not  I think  touch on that object  They are particulars which I earlier suggested may well be maintained in the confidential part of each of the Record and Register  Certainly  according to Mr James Suter who is acting CEO of the Authority  in his affidavit in support of the application sworn on   June   at   the identity of the manufacturer and address of the site at which chemical products are manufactured are kept in the confidential part of the Register   Second  incorrectly recorded or registered relevant particulars may be corrected in the Record and Register by the Authority under the provisions of s   of the Code  Furthermore  Part   Div   of the Code provides for suspension and cancellation of approval or registration  Under s   it is only if the relevant particulars or conditions for approval or registration cannot be varied to comply with the prescribed requirements that the approval or registration may be cancelled  The legislature has prescribed this approach for cases where the prescribed requirements are not complied with
