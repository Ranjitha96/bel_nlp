of Stamp Duties  NSW  v Buckle   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A less straightforward question arises when the relevant person is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust  The term  discretionary trust  has been said in the High Court to bear a meaning  disclosed by a consideration of usage rather than doctrine  and to be used in a way that is  descriptive rather

Commissioner of Taxation v Vegners     ALR   at   Gummow J said that the expression  discretionary trust  is used to identify a species of express trusts in which  unlike a fixed trust  the entitlement of the beneficiaries to income  or to corpus  or both  is not immediately ascertainable  at           the beneficiaries are selected from a nominated class by the trustee or some other person and this power may be exercisable once or from time to time      His Honour described the power of the trustee as a  special or hybrid power   Thus  at              a power exercisable in

significance to the nature of the beneficiaries  interests appears in the judgment of Romer J in Re Smith   Ch    at      Where there is a trust under which trustees have a discretion as to applying the whole or part of a fund to or for the benefit of a particular person  that particular person cannot come to the trustees  and demand the fund  for the whole fund has not been given to him but only so much as the trustees think fit to let him have  But when the trustees have no discretion as to the amount of the fund to be applied  the fact that the trustees have a discretion as to the method in which the whole of the fund shall be applied for the benefit of the particular person does not prevent that particular person from coming and saying   Hand over the fund to me   citedRe Nelson  Note    Ch   In Re Nelson  Note    Ch   the trustees of a deceased estate under a will were empowered by its terms to apply the income of one third of the estate for the benefit of such of the testator s son  daughter in law and granddaughter as they thought fit  It was an exhaustive discretionary trust with a closed class comprising the three named beneficiaries  The three beneficiaries collectively mortgaged their share and interest under the will  The Court of Appeal rejected an argument that there was no interest to be mortgaged  The disposition was described by Swinfen Eady MR as      an absolute gift between the three individuals who are of age and sui juris   They had all concurred      in assigning by way of mortgage their interest   Duke LJ and Eve J agreed   The Master of the Rolls in Re Nelson distinguished the case of Re Coleman     Ch D   which was relied upon by the appellants  In Re Coleman the trustees had power to apply the income of a trust fund for the benefit of a class or any one of them to the exclusion of the others  One of the beneficiaries assigned his share and claimed unsuccessfully that an appropriate portion  one quarter of the income  should be paid to his assignee  Swinfen Eady MR said of that case  at      The answer to that was that he did not take an equal fourth or any other share and the trustees could have applied the whole of the income to the other members of that class  That is quite a different case from the present case  where all the members of the class have assigned their shares to the mortgagees  citedRe Coleman     Ch D

citedGartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners   UKHL       AC   Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners   UKHL       AC   concerned a trust under which the trustees had a discretion to apply the income of a fund for the maintenance or benefit of all or any of the testator s son  daughter in law or children  if any  and to accumulate surplus income  A principal issue in the case was whether the potential beneficiaries of the trust had  interests in possession  in the trust fund for estate duty purposes  The House of Lords rejected that contention  Lord Wilberforce said  at      No doubt in a certain sense a beneficiary under a discretionary trust has an  interest  the nature of it may  sufficiently for the purpose  be spelt out by saying that he has a right to be considered as a potential recipient of benefit by the trustees and a right to have his interest protected by a court of equity      Lord Wilberforce also made the point that the term  interest  may have different meanings according to the context in which it is used  at              it may be a right  with some degree of concreteness or solidity  one which attracts the protection of a court of equity  yet it may still lack the necessary quality of definable extent which must exist before it can be taxed   The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia considered these questions in R   I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd     WAR    The case involved contempt proceedings for alleged breach of a mareva injunction  One of the persons bound by the injunction exercised his powers as appointor under a trust deed to make his son guardian of the trust and removed himself as appointor  His son then removed the other trustee  Anchorage  and appointed a company with which he was associated as trustee  The new trustee  with his consent and that of his wife  declared that they be excluded as general beneficiaries  The question was whether these transactions amounted to a breach of the terms of the injunction  The Full Court held that a beneficiary of a trust of the type then in question did not have a proprietary interest in any particular  assets  of the trust fund or in the trust fund as a whole  The expectancy which a beneficiary has that the trustee might appoint capital of the trust fund in his or her favour lacked the requisite aspect of  value  to enable it to be regarded as an asset  In his judgment in that case Owen J said  at        A beneficiary of a trust of this type does not have a proprietary interest in any particular asset of the trust fund or in the Trust Fund as a whole  see Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioner   UKHL       AC     The Trust Deed confers on a trustee a mere power  It is a power of very wide import  The trustee can determine whether an individual beneficiary is to benefit at all  and if so  in what way  from the exercise of the power in his or her favour  In this sense  the beneficiary has nothing more than an expectancy  The trustee has a duty to administer the trust bona fide having regard to the purpose for which it was established      ASIC sought to distinguish that case on the basis that the question with which it was concerned was whether the interest of a general beneficiary under a discretionary trust could be characterised as an  asset   In my opinion  however  the observations of Owen J have

discussed earlier  the beneficiary who effectively controls the trustee s power of selection because he is the trustee or one of them and or has the power to appoint a new trustee has something approaching a general power and the ownership of the trust property  There are cases in the Family Law jurisdiction which have dealt with like circumstance  In Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper   HCA         CLR   Gibbs J said  at            if a company is completely controlled by one party to a marriage  so that in reality an order against the company is an order against the party  the fact that in form the order appears to affect the rights of the company may not necessarily invalidate it      Stephen  Aickin and Wilson JJ agreed citedIn the Marriage of Ashton     Fam LR   The Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in In the Marriage of Ashton     Fam LR   considered a case in which the husband was appointor of a family trust  He had the power to remove and appoint the trustee and could appoint himself  The trustee had the power to alter the terms of the trust at will  He was not a beneficiary of the trust but had received income from it  He was found to be  in full control of the assets of the trust   There were  good grounds for saying the trust is no more than the husband s alter ego   Strauss J said  at      In the result  having regard to the powers and discretions which the husband has  and having regard to what had in fact taken place  for the purposes of s    of the Family Law Act    Cth    the husband s power of appointment  and all the attributes it carries with it  amounts to de facto ownership of the property of the trust  citedIn the Marriage of Goodwin     FLR   A similar trust arrangement existed in In the Marriage of Goodwin     FLR    The trial judge had found that the reality in that case was that no person other than the husband had any real interest in the property or income of the trust except at the will of the husband  In upholding the trial judge  the Full Court said  at          we have no doubt that his Honour was entitled to find that the trust property was in reality the property of the husband in the present case  The husband had the sole power of appointment of the trustee which was a creature under his control and he was a beneficiary to whom the trustee could make payments exclusive of other beneficiaries as the husband saw fit      In the case of In Marriage of Davidson  No       FLR   the Full Court observed  at      Whatever may have been the position   years ago Australian courts today have to look at the reality
