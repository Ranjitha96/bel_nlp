  referred toAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe second argument was that the Board had denied CAP procedural fairness by acting on the untested assertions of Midnight Seas  Reliance was placed upon a dictum of Deane J in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at    I am by no means certain that the view of Deane J represents the current state of Australian administrative law  However  there is no need to decide that issue  The reasonableness  proportionality or arbitrary nature of the Board s decision is to be assessed in the context of its interim nature and the very limited co operation provided to it by CAP  So viewed  the alleged want of procedural fairness is illusive   d  The contempt issue I turn then to Sam s complaint  His concern is that the continuing investigation by the Board into the affairs of CAP has the capacity to prejudice his defence of the criminal proceedings against him  Those criminal proceedings are before the New South Wales Local Court  The charges arise solely under the Crimes Act    NSW   When hearing and disposing of those proceedings  the magistrate will not be exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth  Further  the prosecutor is not a federal officer or a federal agency but is  instead  a detective in the New South Wales Police Force referred toCommissioner of Taxation v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     CLR  It follows that these paragraphs are not supported by reg    Even if that were not so  however  the subparagraphs are ambiguous in that they leave the recipient unsure whether production of copies already existing is called for or whether copies of originals are to be made  The notice is

Hill J  FAILURE TO SPECIFY MATTERconsideredCommissioner of Taxation v De Vonk     FCR  There are a number of instances  of course  where this Court and the High Court in its original jurisdiction have assumed a jurisdiction in relation to criminal proceedings then pending before a State court  Hammond v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     Commissioner of Taxation v De Vonk     FCR     Watson v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR    However  in each of those cases the proceedings pending in the State court involved the alleged commission of a crime against a law of the Commonwealth  In Hammond  Mr Hammond had been charged with conspiracy in relation to the substitution of kangaroo meat for beef in the export market  apparently an offence against s  a  of the Crimes Act    Cth   Not only that  but the prosecuting body was the Commonwealth as were  effectively  the commissioners conducting the Royal Commission  In De Vonk   the applicant was charged with conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth as was Mr Watson in Watson   In each case  the question of whether a contempt was being committed was part of a matter arising under a law made by the Parliament or in which the Commonwealth was a party  Federal jurisdiction was  therefore  clear  There is no evidence to suggest that the Board is deliberately interfering with the proceedings before the Local Court  It is likely  if that were to be suggested  that the provisions of the Act would not authorise such behaviour  De Vonk at    However  as De Vonk shows  unintentional action may yet have the capacity to prejudice the administration of justice  It is necessary therefore to attend to the relationship between the Board s proceedings and those in the Local Court  The following factors are relevant   a  An important question in the criminal proceedings is whether CAP had any entitlement to receive the Midnight Seas cheque  If it did  then it is difficult to see how Sam could have fraudulently misappropriated it    b  Whether CAP was entitled to receive the cheque  and if so  on what basis  is a significant aspect of the Board s inquiry    c  CAP denies Midnight Seas  claim that it was not entitled to the proceeds of the cheque  Any explanation of CAP s position can  indeed should  be conveyed to Midnight Seas as the complainant for its comment  The Board s function of inquiry requires as much  Any information provided to Midnight Seas in that way will not be immune from release by Midnight Seas for the secrecy provisions of Part II of the Act do not operate upon Midnight Seas    d  If  and when  the Board comes to decide how it should proceed in relation to CAP s registration  then the Board will be required to give reasons for that decision  It is very likely that any such reasons will include the Board s conclusions on the questions of whether CAP was entitled to deposit the cheque together with an assessment of the circumstances leading to that conclusion    e  That assessment will involve  most likely  a consideration of CAP s relationship with Midnight Seas  a matter also centrally relevant in the criminal proceedings  Because of the secrecy provisions in the Act I do not think that the conduct by the Board of its investigation poses  in itself  a real risk to the integrity of the criminal proceedings  However  part of that investigation will require the Board to obtain Midnight Seas  response to CAP s account of how the cheque came to be deposited into its trust account  That raises  to my mind  a risk that the prosecutor  through Midnight Seas  will come to know  in advance  of CAP s explanation of how it obtained the cheque  That has the capacity to interfere with Sam s defence of the proceedings against him  Independently of that conclusion  the delivery by the Board of its reasons  if it should decide to suspend or cancel CAP s registration  is likely to reveal in advance of Sam s trial CAP s explanation of how it obtained the cheques referred toCraig v South Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOf course that argument leaves unscathed the Board s conclusion on the first point that is  that CAP had acted contrary to express instructions  It follows  therefore  that the Board s power to suspend CAP arose independently of the error I have identified  However  whilst that may be so  the Board s view of the status of the cheque was obviously relevant to the extent of any suspension it imposed  That being so  it was the commission of an error of law which effected the discharge by the Board of its powers  It was  therefore  a jurisdictional error in the sense discussed in Craig v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan  Deane  Toohey  Gaudron   McHugh JJ  There are  so it seems to me  no discretionary reasons not to quash the Board s suspension  On   March   the Board also suspended David s registration as a tax agent  A number of complaints were made about that step  For present purposes  however  it is clear that David s suspension followed on from CAP s suspension  Since I have concluded that CAP s suspension should be set aside it follows that David s must be set aside as well   c  The natural justice issue Since I have concluded that the second suspension notice should be set aside  it is not necessary strictly to deal with CAP s arguments about natural justice  Had it been  I would have rejected them  The first argument was that the Board was obliged to permit CAP to cross examine the complainant  Procedural fairness may so require in appropriate  if somewhat rare  circumstances  Here  however  the circumstances included the interim nature of the Board s act of suspension and the relatively short duration of the suspension citedFieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR  The applicants submitted that the view that s  G did not prescribe a topic which permitted the production of information was supported by three authorities  Smorgon v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   HCA         CLR     Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR     O Reilly v Commissioners of State Bank of Victoria     CLR    The notice was addressed to Armstrong Scalisi Holdings Pty Ltd  The applicants contended that a notice could not be addressed to a corporation but only to its proper officer  In truth  there were two submissions here  one  a submission that a notice could not be served upon a corporation  the other  that if it was  it had to be addressed to the corporation s proper officer  These arguments are  so it seems to me  quite without substance  It has been accepted that a corporation cannot be required physically to attend and give evidence for the very good reason that it is an abstraction lacking physical form  Smorgon v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group   HCA         CLR   at     per Stephen J  However  that physical constraint has no impact on the ability of a corporation to answer questions  It is for that reason well established that a corporation may be required to provide information  Indeed  Lockhart J described the contrary argument as  fallacious  in Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   an observation with which I respectfully agree  Burchett and Hill JJ also rejected the argument  at   and   respectively   The power in reg   to require production of books and documents is a power to produce books and documents in the custody of the person receiving the notice  It does not extend to require a party to bring documents into existence  Fieldhouse at     per Lockhart J    per Burchett J and   per Hill J  It follows that the notice could not lawfully require the production by CAP of copies of original documents held by it  Of course  it is possible that the notice did not on its proper construction seek the creation of documents but instead the production of any copy documents which were in fact held  Lockhart J canvassed this possibility in Fieldhouse at      In this case  I do not think that the natural and ordinary meaning of subparagraphs  a   c   d  and  g  is that they require production of copies already in existence  It follows that these paragraphs are not supported by reg    Even if that were not so  however  the subparagraphs are ambiguous in that they leave the recipient unsure whether production of copies already existing is called for or whether copies of originals are to be made  The notice is  therefore  also bad for uncertainty  cf  Commissioner of Taxation v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ  Fieldhouse at   per Lockhart J    per Burchett J and   per Hill J  FAILURE TO SPECIFY MATTER It has been held that a notice under s   which is bad in part may be severed  So much was held by Burchett J in Fieldhouse at   and by Hill J at    Lockhart J clearly assumed such a power to exist  However  on the facts in Fieldhouse   both Lockhart and Burchett JJ thought that severance was not practical because the provision of the copies was central to the notice so that parts of it no longer made sense if the paragraphs dealing with copies were excised  Hill J  on the other hand  did not share this concern  I do not think that the notice in this case suffers from that problem  Paragraphs  a   c   d  and  g  can be severed from the notice without the balance of it losing coherence  It should be noted in passing that the form of reg   may well present difficulties of application in the case of electronically held records  but it is not  presently  necessary to address the issues thereby arising  Interference with course of criminal jurisdiction Sam also challenged the notice on the general ground of its capacity to interfere with the criminal proceedings facing him  It is  I think  important to bring out into the open a suppressed premise upon which that argument rested  It was that the notice presently requires CAP to do something  In fact  the time for compliance with the notice expired on   February   and it is no longer capable of being complied with  There is presently no legal obligation upon CAP to provide the information sought in the notice  It would not be possible to obtain a court order to compel CAP to provide the information  In a real sense  the notice is spent  The possible relevance of the notice seems therefore only to be twofold   a  Although it is no longer capable of being complied with  the non compliance may have been a criminal offence  If the information which was originally required by the notice were now volunteered by CAP it might be relevant to any penalty which was imposed upon it  A related concern  I would think  is the capacity of the continuing failure to provide the information to constitute professional misconduct  Voluntary production may well be likely reduce the seriousness of these matters  The Board itself made this point in its letter of   March   which in terms said   As the Board has not withdrawn its Notice to give evidence to the Board dated   January   you are required to comply  Failure to do so may result in prosecution under regulation   of the Income Tax Assessment Act     Any conviction may reflect poorly on your good fame  integrity  character and fitness and propriety    b  It is possible that CAP may be prosecuted for a failure to comply with the notice  Despite these rather indirect incentives to provide the information to the Board  there was no evidence before me that CAP was proposing now to do so  David s evidence on this issue was   I wanted the Notice issue determined as I do not want to be prosecuted for failure to comply  I do not want to be issued with further notices that I believe are beyond what the Board is entitled to serve  Sam gave no evidence on this issue at all  There is  therefore  no evidence that CAP is intending voluntarily to produce the information previously sought in the notice  It is not the case that CAP is under a present obligation to provide the information sought  In that circumstance  the notice appears to present no real risk to the conduct of the criminal proceedings against Sam  Absent a real risk to the administration of justice in those proceedings  the notice should not be set aside on the basis that it constitutes a contempt  BLF at   per Gibbs CJ  ConclusioncitedGrassby v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au

Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at             Against that it may be said that the Board s function of protecting the public is being thwarted  This is  in a sense  true  No doubt matters of public interest inform the breadth of injunctive relief which may be granted  see Hammond v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs CJ  with whom Mason and Murphy JJ relevantly agreed  and   per Deane J  In that case the public significance of the investigation being performed by the Royal Commission made it appropriate only to prevent examination of the plaintiff and not any other witness  No doubt too  there is a public interest served by protecting the populace at large from unscrupulous tax agents  an interest to which the powers in s  K seem naturally inclined  However  there is a countervailing public interest in ensuring the proper operation of the criminal justice system  In this case the former does not warrant a narrowing of the injunctive relief I am otherwise minded to grant  The effect of my orders will be that the Board will be entitled to continue its inquiries so long as it does not divulge any of its results to other persons during the pendency of the criminal proceedings  It will also be restrained during the same period from concluding whether the registration of CAP should be suspended or cancelled as a result of the matters arising out of the Midnight Seas  complaint  For practical reasons  these conclusions must apply mutatis mutandis to David   e  Challenges to the notice for information I have already noted that CAP s initial responses to the Board were largely not to the Board s satisfaction and that it had  consequently  issued a notice to CAP on   January   formally requiring CAP to furnish it with information  That information was required by the Board to be provided initially by   February   but this was subsequently extended to the close of business on   February    Some of the information sought in the notice was provided to the Board on   February   but in respect of the balance a further extension was sought  That extension was not forthcoming and  assuming the notice to be valid  CAP had failed to comply with it by   February    That failure may well have constituted an offence against reg   of the Income Tax Regulations    citedHealth Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield     NSWLR  CAP submits that this second suspension should be set aside because it is  in effect  an act of double punishment  In my opinion  this contention should be rejected  I would accept that  generally speaking  an administrative power of suspension such as that conferred by s  K b  may not be used more than once in relation to a single episode of conduct  This is so because it is appropriate if the text permits to interpret such powers in a way which is consistent with notions of good administration and finality  Kabourakis v Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria   VSCA   at   per Nettle JA  with whom Warren CJ and Chernov JA agreed   Here  there is nothing in the text of s  K b  which would suggest that  in an ordinary case  it can be used to inflict a sanction repeatedly for the same conduct  This is not to accept any application in disciplinary matters of principles of issue estoppel  a course barred by established authority  Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield

is the general acceptance that the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of a State extends to the protection of the jurisdiction of courts involved in the administration of justice in the State  John Fairfax Publications at     per Spigelman CJ  That emerges from the Supreme Court s ultimate supervisory jurisdiction over the administration of justice  By contrast  this Court does not have a general supervisory jurisdiction over the administration of justice in New South Wales  or any other State   Thus  the mere fact that the Board s processes might constitute contempt of the Local Court

a positive statement  Mr Wright SC  who appeared with Ms Hirschhorn for the Board  put it neatly by suggesting that the language simply showed that the Board was keeping an open mind on the matter  There is force in each of these points but ultimately I cannot escape the conclusion that the Board did regard itself as entitled to suspend CAP if it failed to satisfy the Board that it had not misappropriated the cheque  I accept  of course  that notions such as the burden of proof have a limited role to play in administrative decision making but that  I think  only highlights how the Board has not actually discharged its function correctly  For the power to be enlivened the Board had to be satisfied that there had been one of the events referred to in s  K b   In the critical part of

not think that this passage provides support for an argument that a notice must specify the relevant matter  To the contrary  it cautions against careless recitation of language of the provision
