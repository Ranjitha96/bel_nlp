Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The plaintiff must  however  show that it has an arguable case against the proposed defendant to the standard or being able to resist an application for summary judgment by the proposed respondent had that proposed party been sued in separate proceedings  Review Australia Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd   FCA   at      I have read the affidavits of the several investors together with the affidavits of Mr Jones  to which I have referred  The evidence which establishes at least an arguable case includes relevantly         a  The existence  at all material times  of the relevant companies  namely               i  the proposed eighth defendant  and   ii  Firepower Holdings Group Limited              b  The issue of shares in Firepower to Green Triton on   June        c  The absence at all material times of a prospectus  profile statement or offer information statement lodged with the plaintiff in relation to any offer of shares in Firepower  s         d  The fact that the shares that were the subject of the alleged contravening offers made by the eighth defendant were among those issued to it on   June        e  The purpose of the issue of the shares to Green Triton was the sale or transfer of the shares  s   which is to be inferred on the basis of s   from the sales of shares by Green Triton that are described in the affidavits of Geoffrey Allan  Carol Ashworth  Darryl Edmondson and Nicholas Furlan  and from the transcript of Timothy Francis Johnston on   March    In the transcript  Mr Johnston is recorded to say that  in effect  the eighth defendant was  among other things  to bring funds into Firepower through the sale of shares      f  The alleged contravening offers were made by the first defendant  Axis International Management Pty Ltd as agent on behalf of the eighth defendant      g  The fact that those offers were made on behalf of the eighth defendant  is referred to in the transcript of the examination of Timothy Francis Johnston on   March    In the transcript  Mr Johnston is recorded to say that  in effect  the sixth defendant  Quentin Ward  in his position with the first defendant  had authority to make the offers shown in the share register on behalf of the eighth defendant      h  The absence of the exemptions set out in ss   and  A  see s    The exemptions that are potentially relevant for the purpose of this application are those set out in ss    sophisticated investors     offer through financial advisers     professional investors   to be read together with the definition of that term in section      offers to person associated with Firepower  and  A    and    certain offers of quoted securities   The Investor Affidavits establish  to the requisite degree of proof  the absence of the exemptions found in s    Section  A does not apply because Firepower has never been listed   In the current proceedings Green Triton should be joined as the eighth defendant  in my opinion  as it is a party necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceeding may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon and  furthermore  ought to have been joined and indeed would have been joined save for the fact that it was thought to have been deregistered at the time proceedings commenced  I will accordingly make an
