jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal      No denial of natural justice or breach of statutory requirements can be established on the part of the Tribunal   In Cheng   Siopis J addressed submissions that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in failing to consider whether the Delegate had denied the applicant procedural fairness by reason of an allegedly misleading s   notice  As here  the alleged denial of procedural fairness was relevantly based on the failure of the applicant s expectation of being able to raise matters relating to her medical and personal circumstances as a means of preventing the cancellation of her visa  when there was an alternative course available where those circumstances could be raised as grounds for reinstating her visa  at    His Honour applied Zhou and observed at   that  i  t does not avail the applicant to impugn the procedural fairness of a process which is legally unrelated to the process which led to the impugned decision  namely  the cancellation of the visa under s   of the Act    The processes are  as pointed out by his Honour at     legally separate     The decision under review in this case is that of the Tribunal  It is not suggested that the Tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness in its own procedures  Questions of procedural fairness must be considered by reference to the Tribunal s decision to affirm the Delegate s decision made under s   of the Act   Cheng at     The Minister submits that  as the hearing before the Tribunal is a merits review  the Tribunal can  in a legal sense   cure  any

no part of the Tribunal s review of the decision to cancel made under s    He submits that this was not considered in Cheng and that this inability on the part of the Tribunal to cure the denial of procedural fairness invalidates the Tribunal decision   This submission cannot be correct and ignores the reasoning in Zhou and Cheng   The Full Court in Zhou stated comprehensively at   that alleged defects in a s   notice are not material to an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal to affirm a cancellation decision under s   of the Act  Siopis J in Cheng specifically considered and rejected a submission that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by failing to consider an alleged denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Delegate by reason of a s   notice being misleading  The s   notice has no role in the Tribunal decision  It is irrelevant to the Tribunal s review of the Minister s decision to cancel the visa under s   a decision with a different statutory basis  Once it is irrelevant and the question for this Court is jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal  the applicant cannot succeed on the basis of a denial of natural justice concerning the Notice

Mr Gormly adopts the characterisation of the defects in the s   notice in Morsed and relies upon the denial of procedural fairness resulting from that notice with its attendant effect on the opportunity for the applicant to rely on exceptional circumstances to avoid cancellation of her visa  He refers to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR   at   and submits that  because of the consequences of compliance with the Notice  the contents of the Notice cannot be quarantined from the procedural fairness requirements of a cancellation under s

appliedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou     FCR   By a further amended application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  the applicant sought a declaration that Condition  b  of Sch   of the Regulations is invalid and a writ of certiorari to quash the Tribunal decision  This application to review the Tribunal s decision was referred to this Court by Emmett FM  A second further amended application was filed in this Court  The matter was then adjourned pending the anticipated judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou     FCR   which concerned one of the issues raised by the applicant in these proceedings   Put shortly  the grounds of the second further amended application are based on the alleged invalidity of condition  b  and a denial of procedural fairness to the applicant  It is not in dispute that  if Condition   is valid and there was no failure to accord procedural fairness  this application must fail   In order to understand the alleged denial of procedural fairness  it is necessary to consider s   of the Students Act  Section   provides that a registered provider of overseas student courses must send the student a written notice if he or she has breached a student visa condition relating to attendance or satisfactory academic performance  That notice must state  inter alia  that the student is required to attend in person before an officer of the Department to explain the breach and set out the

jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal      No denial of natural justice or breach of statutory requirements can be established on the part of the Tribunal   In Zhou   the applicant s visa was cancelled under s   of the Act on the grounds that she had breached Condition   of her visa  The Full Court considered whether alleged defects in a s   notice under the Students Act are material to the resolution of an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal to affirm a cancellation decision under s   of the Act  The Full Court determined that  even where the s   notice and the response to it give rise to the delivery of the notice of intention to cancel the visa under s   of the Act  at   and   there is no implied limitation on the operation of s    at   and no   legal interaction   between the s   notice under the Students Act and the exercise of power in s   of the Act  Invalidity of the s   notice can have no invalidating effect on the s   procedure  at     In Cheng   Siopis J

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   Mr Gormly places considerable reliance on Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   at     where the Full Court observed that a s   notice in relevantly indistinguishable terms was  for this reason  misleading   Mr Gormly acknowledges that the Act provides  by s  A  for its procedures to be an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule before the Tribunal  He contends that as the Notice was not a notice served under the Act but under the Students Act and  as that notice did not apply to the substantive right considered by the Tribunal and its validity was not part of the hearing before the Tribunal  that section does not apply   Mr Johnson makes six points in his submissions as to the alleged denial of procedural fairness       The Court is reviewing the decision of the Tribunal  which has no role to play in the processes of s   of the Students Act       It is now settled by

Even if it were misleading  the Notice did not affect the power of the Delegate to effect a visa cancellation under s     Humayun at    Further  the Tribunal conducted a merits review and any defects in the decision of the Delegate were cured by that review   Zubair   Cheng at        The question whether there could be a cure for any deficiency in the Notice that gave rise to a denial of natural justice could not affect the operation of s   of the Act  Such a denial could not result in jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal      No denial of natural justice or breach of statutory requirements can be established on the part of the Tribunal   I agree  with respect  with the observations of the Full Court in Morsed at   that the Notice does not inform the recipient that  where the breach was due to exceptional circumstances beyond her control  the only way that a holder of a student visa who has breached Condition   can avoid having their visa cancelled is not to comply with the Notice  The Notice is misleading for the reasons given in Morsed at       Mr Gormly adopts the characterisation of the defects in the s   notice in Morsed and relies upon the denial of procedural fairness resulting from that notice with its attendant effect on the opportunity for the applicant to rely on exceptional circumstances to avoid cancellation of her visa  He refers to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR   at   and submits that  because of the consequences of compliance with the Notice  the contents of the Notice cannot be quarantined from the procedural fairness requirements of a cancellation under s   of the Act  The failure to accord procedural unfairness cannot  he says  be cured by merits review by the Tribunal because of the lack of discretion on the part of the Delegate and the Tribunal citedRacecourse Co operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney General of the State of Queensland   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On its proper construction  the Act permits the opinion or assessment of the education provider to be provided for in the regulations  to be provided to the Minister and had regard to and be considered correct in the decision making of the Minister  see discussion in Racecourse Co operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney General of the State of Queensland   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs J    The fact that the scheme of the Act results in an absence of discretion in the cancellation of a visa where the Minister has decided that the requirements of Condition   has not been satisfied under s   does not determine that there has been a delegation of the power to specify visa conditions to the education provider  It does not convert the specification by the Governor General of conditions pursuant to s   into an impermissible delegation of the specification of the visa condition   Mr Gormly emphasises the misleading nature of the Notice  Specifically  he contends that the Notice implies that there exists a discretion on the part of the Department  so that an explanation for the breach will be taken into account  It does not  he observes  inform the applicant that her visa will be cancelled if a breach of condition did occur and she attends to  explain  that breach in response to the Notice  The applicant was thereby deprived of the opportunity of not responding to the Notice  awaiting the automatic cancellation of her visa and then applying to the Minister under s  K of the Act  where exceptional circumstances can be taken into consideration  s  L b   This represents the alleged practical unfairness of the denial of natural justice citedTurner v Owen     FCR   Mr Gormly relies upon the conclusion by French J in Turner v Owen     FCR   that delegating to the Minister the power to prohibit goods  which in his opinion   are of a dangerous character and a menace to the community   constituted an unlawful delegation because those words   are not indicative of a factual criterion or class description limited by any intelligible boundary   and were legislative in character  at    French J concluded that the regulations in that case impermissibly asked the Minister to prohibit  rather than the Governor General   Here  the delegation is not of the decision to decide whether a visa holder satisfies the criterion  Section   provides that the regulations may provide that visas are subject to specified conditions  Condition   is such a condition specified in the Regulations  The Minister decides whether to grant a visa  subject to satisfaction that the criteria are satisfied  s    The Minister decides whether a visa holder satisfies the specified condition  s   of the Act  reg    b ii  of the Regulations   Further  as a matter of reality  an academic result that  for a specified course  is  at least satisfactory  is limited   by an intelligible boundary   and is not legislative in character  cf Turner at     Section   which refers specifically to such matters for visa applicants  does not delegate the whole of power to decide whether an applicant for a visa satisfies the relevant criterion  The section provides for the making of regulations under which the Minister  when required to decide whether an applicant for a visa satisfies a specified criterion  may obtain the opinion  assessment  finding or decision of a specified person or organisation and have regard to it and to take it to be correct   The sub delegation in s   is not of a legislative but of an administrative character  It is not the delegation of a wide field of operation but  rather  a narrow question of fact citedTwinn v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  A sub delegation under s   is of the same character  The Act does not reserve any of the delegated functions in Condition   to the Governor General  The Governor General has exercised the power conferred by the Act to make regulations  within the limits laid down by the Act   Twinn v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at      The authorisation given by s   encompasses the making of regulations by the Governor General to allow administrative functions to be undertaken by the Minister for the purposes of the regulations   Twinn at    For the purposes of deciding whether an applicant for a visa satisfies the condition for a visa  the regulations may make provision for the Minister to have consideration of the matters enunciated in s   of the Act  The fact that this was particularised in s    to avoid doubt  indicates a statutory acknowledgment that the power to make regulations in respect of those matters already existed by reason of s   and s   of the Act   Once the Minister is satisfied that the condition has not been met  there is a mandatory cancellation by reason of s   but that does not convert the sub delegation into an effective abdication of powers  see generally Pearce D and Argument S  Delegated Legislation in Australia   rd ed  Butterworths    Ch
