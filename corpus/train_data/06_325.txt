Textile Clothing   Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedClothing and Allied Trades Union v J   J Saggio Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd     IR   It is appropriate to impose penalties because the relevant breaches were numerous and occurred over a period of nearly two years  I also accept the submission of counsel for the Union that the breaches were ones which offended an important regulatory regime  It is a regulatory regime designed to stop flagrant exploitation of outworkers in an industry notorious for such behaviour  see Clothing and Allied Trades Union v J   J Saggio Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd     IR   at   per Gray J  The breaches are serious and appear to have been committed in defiance of Part   of the Award   Given the above factors  it would ordinarily be appropriate to order a high range penalty in respect of the breach of each term of the Award  However  a countervailing factor is that there is no evidence of any prior offending behaviour by Southern Cross  Also  Mr Leongue  when interviewed by Union officials did not attempt to conceal the Award breaches and co operated with the Union followedTextile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Lotus Cove Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Lotus Cove Pty Ltd   FCA     Merkel J found that various breaches of cl   and cl   of the Award had occurred over a period of about one year  He imposed a penalty of   per cent of the maximum available on Lotus Cove for breach of the requirement to register imposed by cl      He imposed no additional penalty on Lotus Cove for related breach of cl       for failing to make an application to register   The circumstances prevailing in this matter and the circumstances in Lotus Cove are very similar  save that the period of time over which the breaches occurred in this instance is almost twice as long  As with Southern Cross  Lotus Cove co operated with officers of the Union and did not try to hide the breaches from them   Given the similarity between the two matters I would ordinarily take the same approach and impose a penalty on Southern Cross of   per cent of the maximum of   being    However  Southern Cross was advised of the outcome of the Lotus Cove case by a letter dated   September   and still failed to apply to register under Part   of the Award  In these circumstances a penalty of   per cent of the maximum is more appropriate  being a penalty of    That penalty will be imposed in respect of cl     of the Award  Although the non observance of cl       is technically another breach of a term of an award  consistently with the reasoning of Merkel J in Lotus Cove at   I consider that the breach of cl     and that of cl       to  essentially relate to one omission   That omission was the failure to apply for and achieve registration  Consequently  no additional penalty will be imposed for the breach of cl       of the Award   In Lotus Cove at   Merkel J imposed a single penalty of   per cent of the maximum available for breaches of cl       and the related cl       concerning the making of work records and the provision of a copy of work records  Applying a consistent penalty in this matter involves the Court in imposing a penalty of   on Southern Cross for breach of cl       of the Award and no additional penalty for its breach of cl         In Lotus Cove   Merkel J imposed an additional penalty of   per cent of the maximum for breach of cl       of the Award  I raise that amount slightly to   per cent  having regard to the longer period over which the breaches occurred in this case  Accordingly  I impose a penalty of   for breach of cl         Merkel J imposed a penalty of   per cent of the maximum for breach of cl       concerning the provision of lists  Considering the extra length of time involved in the current transgressions  it is appropriate to impose a penalty of   per cent of the maximum  being   in respect of the breach of cl        His Honour imposed no extra penalty for the breach of the requirement to provide copies of a list to the Industrial Registrar and the Union  I see no reason to depart from that approach   In Lotus Cove   Merkel J imposed a penalty of   per cent of the maximum available for the breach of cl     concerning the failure of Lotus Cove to provide information to an outworker  In the similar circumstances of this matter a like penalty is appropriate and I impose a penalty of   on Southern Cross for its breach of cl       In Lotus Cove there was no separate finding of a breach of any of the following terms of the Award  cll             and        I consider that the breaches of those terms of the Award are no less serious than those in respect of which penalties have been imposed at   per cent of the maximum rate  Accordingly  I impose a penalty of   in respect of each such breach   In accordance with the above reasoning I will order that       A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl     of the Clothing Trades Award    the Award  between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl       of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl       of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl       of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl       of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl       of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl       of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent      A penalty in the sum of   for breach of cl     of the Award between   December   and   September   be imposed on the respondent   The above penalties total    The total penalties in Lotus Cove were    However  since that time the maximum penalty has more than tripled and more breaches of the Award were alleged and found in this matter than in Lotus Cove   In addition  the failure to register in this matter occurred after Southern Cross was advised of the outcome in Lotus Cove    In accordance with s  b  of the Act the usual order is that the penalty be paid to the applicant  I see no reason to depart from that approach and will order that each of the penalties in this matter be paid to the Union   In addition to the orders referred to at   above  I will add an order that the penalties so imposed be paid to the applicant   I certify that the preceding forty three   numbered paragraphs are a true
