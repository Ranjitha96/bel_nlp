believe that entry is not authorised involves an objective assessment of whether facts were before that person sufficient to induce a reasonable person to believe that grounds existed for denying authority to enter  That view is consistent with the approach to the notion of  reasonable grounds  in George v Rockett     ALR   and Rema Industries and Services Pty Ltd v Coad   Ors     ALR    In determining whether reasonable grounds for a belief exist  there is a relationship between the objective facts that must engender such a belief and the role  standards and duties of the person confronting the relevant facts  In this case  the officials are permit holders under the Act and Mr Dettmer is an experienced State Secretary of the AMWU  In the face of an employer s objection to entry in the manner of   November   and correspondence from the employer pressing that objection  a permit holder and the Unions as organisations  must necessarily give consideration to the merits of the employer s claims and form a view as to whether the claims are well placed or not  If the Unions and the permit holders are satisfied that the claims are misplaced   the demonstrated consideration of the claims is very likely to suggest that the relevant person when seeking to enter the site had reasonable grounds for believing that entry was authorised even though events may subsequently demonstrate that entry was not authorised  Persons in the position of permit holders or officers of Unions cannot be said to have acted reasonably in the absence of reasonable investigation and enquiry into objections made and strongly pressed denying the very right of entry relied upon by those seeking entry  That follows because statutory rights of entry to premises carry with the exercise of those rights corresponding duties of enquiry to be reasonably satisfied that entry is authorised in the context of the facts and circumstances before the entry seeker  That corresponding duty is not only a function of a balance between rights and obligations but derives from Part   of the Act  the objects recited in s   of the Act and the regime established for granting permits to enter
