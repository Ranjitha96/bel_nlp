MZWKJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toMZWKJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  In rejecting the appellants  judicial review application  the learned Federal Magistrate held that the principles of Anshun estoppel applied as a result of the previous judicial review proceedings  His Honour did not find it necessary to consider whether issue estoppel applied  see MZWKJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA     MZWKJ   at    His Honour said  at   that     In my view the nature of the grounds claimed in this case are so similar  in substance  to those the subject of the order nisi application  even on the best case of the applicant with respect to the difference in focus between the country information and inconsistencies in evidence  that nonetheless the arguments ought to have all been brought as part of the initial proceedings  I fine that it was unreasonable that the applicant did not pursue his current basis for judicial review in the proceedings previously pending before Weinberg J  which were dismissed   His Honour formed the view  at   that in light of this it was necessary for him to determine  whether or not there are circumstances in this case which would justify granting the applicant leave to litigate these issues  despite having had an opportunity to do so before Weinberg J and not pursuing them on that occasion   After considering the matters on which the applicant relied in this regard  his Honour held  at   that the circumstances did not justify a further hearing   By their notice of appeal filed on   July   the appellants challenged the judgment of the Federal Magistrate on the grounds that         The learned Magistrate erred in finding that the application before him was barred by Anshun estoppel or otherwise       The learned Magistrate erred in not finding that the decision of the  Tribunal      was affected by jurisdictional error or that the Tribunal had acted without jurisdiction  appliedPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellants relied on the affidavits before the Federal Magistrate and also sought to rely on an affidavit of the first appellant sworn on   June    referred to below as  the   June   affidavit   In an outline of submissions filed on   December   the appellants stated that the issues raised by the appeal were    whether his Honour was correct in holding that Anshun estoppel applied  and   if his Honour was correct  did he err in finding that there were not  special circumstances  such as to justify a further hearing despite the rule in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Anshun     Thirdly  in the circumstances of this case  it is clear enough that Anshun estoppel applies in the substantive proceeding as against the appellants  Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding  Plainly enough  the  procedural fairness  ground that the appellants now seek to advance might have been brought forward for Weinberg J s consideration  Sundberg J reached the same conclusion in relation to much the same submission in MZWGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     MZWGJ   when he rejected a similar submission that Anshun estoppel did not apply in a subsequent judicial review proceeding because of the different focus of the Muin and Lie litigation  Indeed  as counsel for the first respondent observed  the grounds of the draft order nisi considered by Weinberg J were not  in any case  confined to an alleged failure to observe procedural fairness by virtue of a failure to afford an opportunity to comment on country information  which was the focus of Muin   They went much wider than this  On one reading  moreover  the draft grounds were capable of embracing the  inconsistencies  point that the appellants sought to raise in the present proceeding referred toMuin v Refugee Review Tribunal   Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In oral submissions  in respect of both limbs of his argument  counsel for the appellants emphasized that the proceeding in the High Court was part of what is sometimes referred to as the  Muin and Lie  litigation and focussed on the Tribunal s use of  country information  see Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal   Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal in   HCA         ALR     Muin    Counsel for the appellants submitted that the documents relevant to the High Court proceeding should be viewed in this light  The appellants further contended that  by the present proceeding  they desired to raise  a different aspect of the audi alteram partem rule     relating to the extent of the obligation of the Tribunal to put to applicants for comment matters of inconsistency within or between the evidence of applicants or witnesses    In written submissions  the appellants contended that there were special circumstances having regard to the following matters     a  The case potentially involves questions of life and liberty         b  The Minister is a respondent in her official capacity by force of statute  not in her personal capacity     c  The appellants were unrepresented at the earlier Court proceedings     d  If there was procedural unfairness in relation to the decision  it is jurisdictional error of such seriousness that usually relief would follow almost as of right   Thirdly  in the circumstances of this case  it is clear enough that Anshun estoppel applies in the substantive proceeding as against the appellants  Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding  Plainly enough  the  procedural fairness  ground that the appellants now seek to advance might have been brought forward for Weinberg J s consideration  Sundberg J reached the same conclusion in relation to much the same submission in MZWGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     MZWGJ   when he rejected a similar submission that Anshun estoppel did not apply in a subsequent judicial review proceeding because of the different focus of the Muin and Lie litigation  Indeed  as counsel for the first respondent observed  the grounds of the draft order nisi considered by Weinberg J were not  in any case  confined to an alleged failure to observe procedural fairness by virtue of a failure to afford an opportunity to comment on country information  which was the focus of Muin   They went much wider than this  On one reading  moreover  the draft grounds were capable of embracing the  inconsistencies  point that the appellants sought to raise in the present proceeding referred toBC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In support of their submissions in this regard  the appellants referred to BC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC     BC   at   and    Counsel for the appellants expanded on this submission in oral argument  He contended that it was clear from Weinberg J s ex tempore reasons that the appellants  who were then unrepresented  had a very limited grasp of the relevant law  Counsel also referred to the statement by the first appellant that had been made in June    He submitted that  if believed  the appellants  case was at the severe part of the  life and liberty  spectrum and the first factor should be given particular weight  He further argued that had the inconsistencies in question been put to the appellants and explained to the Tribunal s satisfaction  then the Tribunal might have reached a different decision  These factors cancelled out the delay factor  so counsel said  Counsel for the appellant also argued that if a court came to consider the substantive grounds of the present application  then these grounds had reasonable prospects of success  The appellants contended that  if they succeeded  then the appropriate course was for the Court to remit the matter to consider the substantive grounds of the application for relief  i e   that the Tribunal s decision was affected by jurisdictional error and should be set aside by reason of denial of procedural fairness    In their submissions of   December   the appellants also sought to raise as a new ground of appeal  whether Anshun estoppel does not apply as against at least the second appellant because her application was not heard on remitter of the prior proceeding  In written submissions filed in June   the appellants abandoned this ground   The first respondent opposed any grant of leave to the appellants permitting them to rely on the   June   affidavit   There was  so the first respondent submitted  no error in his Honour s exercise of discretion and BC was distinguishable from the appellants  case  Further  so the first respondent submitted  lack of representation cannot by itself amount to a special circumstance that would warrant an exercise of discretion in the appellants  favour  The first respondent accepted as relevant the likelihood that relief would follow any finding that the appellants had made out their procedural fairness ground  The first respondent submitted  however  that it was unlikely that a court would grant them the ultimate relief they sought  amongst other reasons  because of  an inordinate and unexplained delay in commencing proceedings   In any case  so the first respondent said  the appellants  procedural fairness argument was without merit  because the rules of procedural fairness did not require the Tribunal to disclose to the appellants that it intended to act on information of which they were or should have been aware  Further  the Tribunal was not obliged to notify the appellants of its mental processes or provide it with an opportunity to comment on preliminary findings before making its decision  The first respondent added     The Tribunal was not required to make the appellants  case for them  The Tribunal was not obliged to notify the appellants of deficiencies in their case  in order to give them an opportunity to present further material or argument  In particular  the rule in Browne v Dunne had no application to the proceedings before Tribunal  There was also no general duty on the Tribunal to make inquiries to obtain further information from the applicants or some other source   I accept the first respondent s submission that there is no error shown in his Honour s conclusion that Anshun estoppel applies to preclude the appellants from pursuing a further judicial review proceeding and  further  that the appellants have not established special circumstances to warrant a different conclusion  In BC  the Full Court had regard to the first two of the considerations relied on by the appellants  as set out at   above  in finding that there were special circumstances in that case  In BC   however  the Court observed that only marginal weight could attach to the fact that the first respondent is a  statutory respondent  see    The Court gave greater weight to other factors  which included the  life and liberty  consideration  also relied on here  the  complex bifurcated process of review  and the then state of the authorities  see   and    As the first respondent submitted  and the appellants did not deny  neither of the latter two matters were significant in this case  Furthermore  the appellants  reliance on the  life and liberty  consideration amounted to saying no more than his Honour should have afforded this consideration more weight than he did   Accordingly  nothing has been established that discloses relevant error in his Honour s finding  as to which see BC at   that in this case there were no special circumstances of the kind that would prevent the estoppel  compare Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at         citedNASB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  First  I would not grant leave to the appellants to rely on the   June   affidavit  As the Full Court said in NASB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     a party seeking to adduce further evidence on an appeal must show  first  that he could not  with reasonable diligence  have adduced the evidence at trial and  secondly  the evidence must be such that the result would very probably have been different  It is clear enough from its contents that the   June   affidavit cannot satisfy the first condition  Nor  having regard to the reasons stated below  can the appellants satisfy the second condition referred toSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Secondly  I note that s  A of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act   was not enacted at the relevant time and therefore does not apply  As a consequence  the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   has no application to this case discussedMZWGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Thirdly  in the circumstances of this case  it is clear enough that Anshun estoppel applies in the substantive proceeding as against the appellants  Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding  Plainly enough  the  procedural fairness  ground that the appellants now seek to advance might have been brought forward for Weinberg J s consideration  Sundberg J reached the same conclusion in relation to much the same submission in MZWGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     MZWGJ   when he rejected a similar submission that Anshun estoppel did not apply in a subsequent judicial review proceeding because of the different focus of the Muin and Lie litigation  Indeed  as counsel for the first respondent observed  the grounds of the draft order nisi considered by Weinberg J were not  in any case  confined to an alleged failure to observe procedural fairness by virtue of a failure to afford an opportunity to comment on country information  which was the focus of Muin   They went much wider than this  On one reading  moreover  the draft grounds were capable of embracing the  inconsistencies  point that the appellants sought to raise in the present proceeding   In this case  the appellants relied heavily on their lack of representation before Weinberg J  although it is common ground that they were represented before the Tribunal and filed their application in the High Court with legal assistance  As Sundberg J said in MZWGJ at   the lack of legal representation cannot of itself amount to special circumstances sufficient to warrant the court declining to apply Anshun estoppel  I agree  There is nothing in this case that would lend particular weight to this consideration   As to the fourth consideration relied on by the appellants  see   above  I accept the respondent s submission that his Honour was entitled to find that there was inordinate delay in not only commencing the present proceeding but also in the commencement of the order nisi application eventually heard by Weinberg J  This delay was plainly relevant  bearing in mind that delay of this kind can preclude the relief that the appellants ultimately seek even if successful citedCommissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   Indeed  although it is unnecessary to decide the point  unlike his Honour  I would not accept that the substantive case that the appellants desire to make is a tenable one  The appellants  submission that they were denied procedural fairness because the Tribunal did not put all the inconsistencies mentioned in its reasons to them for comment before deciding the case against them does not disclose an arguable case  This is tolerably clear when regard is had to the well recognized principles referred to in the first respondent s submissions  see   above and authorities such as Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone
