Godwin v Repatriation Commission   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAdministration of the Territory of Papua New Guinea v Daera Guba   PGHCA         CLR   First  as a general proposition  adjudication by an administrative tribunal is administrative in character and does not create an issue of estoppel   W J   F Barnes Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    And that general approach has been applied in respect of decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  Midland Metal Overseas Limited v Comptroller General of Customs     FCR    Hill J there observed at     Where  as occurred in the present case  the decision is remitted to the decision maker for reconsideration  it is evident that the ultimate decision will be one not made by the tribunal  but by the decision maker himself  But even where the tribunal substitutes its own decision for that of the original decision  maker  the tribunal in so doing is merely acting in an administrative capacity  Its decision is deemed for all purposes to be the decision of the decision maker  s   of the AAT Act  To use the language of Rich and Dixon JJ in Jolly v FCT   HCA         CLR   at   referring to the taxation boards of review  but equally applicable to the tribunal  the tribunal is   only another executive body in an administrative hierarchy    The tribunal s function  like that of the taxation boards of review which it  inter alia  replaced  is  to adapt the language of Kitto J in Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR   at   merely to do over again what the decision maker himself did  not to give a decision which affects the legal situation of the person dissatisfied with the decision but to work out  as a step in administration what the tribunal considers that position to be   In relation to the taxation boards of review  Kitto J in W J   F Barnes Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR   at   said   The board s decision was not  of course  an adjudication  it was administrative in character  and could not create an issue  estoppel   The full court of this court in Commonwealth v Sciacca     ALR       FCR   at   had no hesitation in saying   A finding by an administrative tribunal will not give rise to an issue estoppel        Hill J then went on to conclude  at   that the decision of the High Court in Administration of the Territory of Papua New Guinea v Daera Guba   PGHCA         CLR   did not require any contrary conclusion  This decision has since been followed  Lilienthal v Migration Agents Registration Authority   FCA   at       ALD   at   per Katz J citedBrowne v Dunn     R   It is not considered necessary  however  to resolve any such discrepancies as may have emerged from the differing accounts  nor is it necessary to resolve whether the submissions advanced on behalf of Mr Godwin went beyond the Application filed in this Court  as supplemented by his Outline of Submissions   It is also unnecessary to resolve whether or not submissions which were sought to be advanced were not available to the Applicant by reason of questions not being put to the advocate which should have been put in accordance with the principles of Browne v Dunn     R   at     per Lord Herschell LC  For example  the advocate was never asked in cross examination whether she had deliberately set out to obtain evidence to defeat the eligibility of the Applicant   In the present case there is no basis for concluding    as submitted on behalf of Mr Godwin    that the delegate was   off on a frolic to disprove the Applicant s entitlement    Such reliance as is sought to be placed  on behalf of Mr Godwin  upon the limited instructions given to the advocate in January   does not support any conclusion that the advocate was conducting any review of historical records which was not within the ambit of her instructions  And  even if the solicitor s account of the conversations with the advocate prevail  those conversations do not support any conclusion that there had been an unreasonable exercise of power or an exercise of power in bad faith   On behalf of Mr Godwin it is further contended that the Commission        has  by its decision dated   September   decreased the rate of the applicant s pension  relying on section    In doing so  the Respondent has failed to comply with the provisions of section   and section   which prohibits the Respondent from such action within six months of a decision by the Tribunal in respect of the rate of pension  The Tribunal decided the rate of pension for the Applicant on   August   less than two weeks before the Respondent s decision   Section   of the   Act provides as follows      This section applies to and in relation to a decision made before or after the commencement of this section but does not apply to or in relation to a decision of the Board referred to in subsection   or a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal referred to in subsection   that is binding on the Commission by reason that the period specified in that subsection has not expired    And s   provides as follows    Period of operation of certain decisions of Administrative Appeals Tribunal     Where  on a review of a reviewable decision  the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal expressly  or in effect   a  assesses a rate of pension or increased rate of pension   b  refuses to grant a pension  on the ground that the extent of the incapacity of the veteran was insufficient to justify the grant of such a pension   c  refuses to increase the rate of a pension  or   d  reduces the rate of a pension  that decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal shall  subject to subsection   be binding on the parties to the proceedings before that Tribunal for a period of   months commencing on the day on which that Tribunal makes the decision   The Tribunal on   August   concluded that Mr Godwin was entitled to receive a pension at the special rate with effect from   May    Pursuant to s   that decision was   binding     for a period of   months   as from   August     The delegate when conducting his s   review concluded that        Pension is     assessed at   of the general rate with effect from   August      The Tribunal s decision said nothing as to the period prior to   May   and s   has no application to that prior period   Nor did the delegate s decision purport to diminish the effect otherwise given to the decision of the Tribunal pursuant to s    In any event  the six month period referred to in s   has expired  The decision of the delegate  it should further be noted  has previously been stayed by an order of this Court   Accordingly  no breach of s   has been established   A final submission advanced on behalf of the Commission need not be finally resolved followedDavis v Repatriation Commission     FCR   The construction of s   urged by Mr Godwin was also said to be implicitly supported by the administrative decision making hierarchy proceeding from the Commission  thereafter to the Board  and finally to the Tribunal  It was understood that the submission advanced was that s   was to be confined to the initial repository of decision making authority and not to be extended to decisions which had been exposed to further administrative review  Albeit in the context of s   the same argument has been rejected  Davis v Repatriation Commission     FCR    Sundberg J there observed    The applicant s alternative argument took as its starting point the hierarchy of decision making established by the Act  The hierarchy consists of the Commission as primary decision maker  the Board as the second tier decision maker  and the AAT as the third tier decision maker and ultimate forum of merits review  It was said that the review mechanisms provided by s  and s  were intended to result in the final disposition of claims  It was submitted that while the word  matter  standing alone would receive a wide construction  in the context of the review provisions as a whole it must be limited to a degree which is necessary to achieve finality in the disposition of claims  If s  is not limited in this manner  the Commission could review decisions of the Board or the Tribunal again and again on any pretext in defiance of the review hierarchy  The limitation contended for was not more precisely formulated than this  but was said to lead to the conclusion that a medical report which merely repeats and endorses the conclusions in other reports based on documented observations  and which contains no new observation  fact  cause  circumstance  information  opinion or contention  is not capable of being a matter which was not before the Board when the decision to grant the pension was made  It was accepted that a medical report which was brought into existence to take into account some change in the facts and circumstances  or facts or circumstances not previously disclosed  might be in a different position   I see no reason to limit the ordinary meaning of the words  any matter that affects the payment of a pension      being a matter that was not before the     Board     when the decision to grant the pension     was made  in the manner contended for  The  hierarchy  argument  which purports to be based on the structure of the review provisions of the Act  ignores the fact that s  itself contains no less than seven exceptions to the simple three tier structure on which the submission is based  Far from supporting the contention that s  would  unless narrowed  permit the Commission to review decisions of the Board or Tribunal in defiance of the review hierarchy  a reading of the relevant parts of the Act as a whole shows that the three tier review structure contended for is simplistic  Not only does s  provide a number of additional grounds of review  but decisions made pursuant to the section are themselves subject to review under s         The fact that s  may be open to abuse  repeated reviews on any pretext  does not in my view require it to be read down  A capricious or unreasonable exercise of the power will be susceptible to review under s  of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act     For present purposes there is not considered to be any relevant distinction as between s   and s     The alternative submission advanced on behalf of s   should also be rejected  This alternative argument assumed that s   did confer a power upon the Commission to undertake a review    even after a Tribunal decision    but contended that there was no power to do so in the present proceedings because there was no evidence which was   false in a material particular      False   it was contended  should be interpreted as meaning   deliberately untruthful     There are at least two difficulties in acceding to this alternative submission   The Applicant concedes that the power conferred by s   may be exercised after there has been a review by the Tribunal  Given both the terms of s   and the decision of Sundberg J in Davis   that concession was quite properly made   The Applicant  however  contends that there is in the present proceedings no   matter   which was not before the Tribunal  Reliance is placed upon the following observations of Sundberg J in Davis         The power in s a  is available to the Commission only if it is satisfied of the existence of a matter that affects the payment of a pension and which was not before the decision maker  If the   new material   is no more than a repetition of material that was before the decision maker  it would not be reasonably open to the Commission to be relevantly satisfied that the material   affects the payment of a pension     The Applicant has variously identified the   matter    It is understood that the   matter   as defined by the Applicant  was whether or not the sampan incident occurred  The contention sought to be advanced is that the material relied upon by the delegate was  presumably    a repetition of material that was before the decision maker     It is considered that this submission should also be rejected for at least two reasons   First  the term   matter   can include new evidence relevant to the manner in which the prior decision was made  Section  a  has not been construed  and should not be construed  as precluding an exercise of the power of review where new evidence or other material becomes available which has not previously been considered  And it may not matter that that new material was available even at the time when the Tribunal made its decision  Thus  Sundberg J went on to conclude in Davis as follows    It was also submitted for Mrs Davis that because Professor Cade s report had been received in time for it to be used by the Commission in support of an application for review of the Board s decision by the AAT  it could not found an exercise of the Commission s power to review the Board s decision under s a   A variation of this argument was that the Commission  having had a reasonable opportunity to put Professor Cade s report before the AAT  had not done so  and so was not able to use the report to found an exercise of power under s   These assertions were not developed in argument  and in my view they have no substance  If material becomes available after the relevant decision is made  and it affects the payment of a pension  the power in s a  is available to the Commission  It is simply irrelevant that it becomes available at a time when the Commission might seek a review by the AAT  The Commission may engage in conduct which disables it from taking a particular course  but in the absence of any such conduct  it can pursue whichever avenue it chooses  The second argument advanced has overtones of estoppel without any factual basis to support the estoppel    Further  in Repatriation Commission v Richardson   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   Dowsett J concluded that it was open to the Commission pursuant to s   to have regard to material of which it was ignorant at the time the original decision was made to grant a pension   Section   should not be construed as excluding from the term   matter   new evidence  albeit evidence in relation to an area of factual dispute previously resolved  In Davis  it may be noted  the new evidence which satisfied the requirements of s  a  was a medical report which   contained an expression of opinion from a highly qualified medical specialist  based on contemporary clinical and laboratory evidence  that persuasively identified the cause of death to the exclusion of other possible causes     Second  there is the same difficulty as confronted the Applicant with respect to s   namely that the power conferred by s   is a power vested in the Commission if it is  satisfied   of the matters there set forth  The contents of the   report provided a basis for reaching that state of   satisfaction     Section   was thus also a basis for review open to the delegate consideredHanna v Australian Postal Corporation   FCA         AAR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The argument  however  ignores the effect given to a decision of the Tribunal  Section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  provides as follows    A decision of a person as varied by the Tribunal  or a decision made by the Tribunal in substitution for the decision of a person  shall  for all purposes  other than the purposes of applications to the Tribunal for a review or of appeals in accordance with section     be deemed to be a decision of that person and  upon the coming into operation of the decision of the Tribunal  unless the Tribunal otherwise orders  has effect  or shall be deemed to have had effect  on and from the day on which the decision under review has or had effect    In the present context  a decision of the Tribunal is deemed to be a decision of the Commission   for all purposes    Where there has been a decision of the Commission which has been reviewed by the Tribunal  as in the present proceedings  the subsequent decision of the Tribunal is nevertheless   deemed   to be a decision of the Commission  Section     it is considered  thus includes both a decision of the Commission and a decision of the Commission as altered  varied or affirmed  The effect of s   of the   Act cannot be confined to simply identifying the date from which a decision of the Tribunal is to take effect  To so construe s   is to give effect only to the latter part of the provision and is to ignore the   deeming   effect given to a Tribunal decision  To conclude that the power of review vested in   the Commission   by s   could not be exercised after review by the Tribunal would be to construe s   as excluding a power of review where there has been a decision which is deemed to be a decision of the Commission itself and deemed to be a decision of the Commission   for all purposes    A construction of a statutory provision which permits further administrative reconsideration subsequent to a Tribunal decision is not surprising  see  eg  Hanna v Australian Postal Corporation   FCA         AAR     Irrespective of s   of the   Act  however  it is further considered that the contrast in language relied upon by Mr Godwin as between s   and s   is misplaced  All that the language employed in s   prescribes are those circumstances in which the Commission may exercise the power there conferred  It may exercise those powers where it is   satisfied   that there is a   matter   that was not before any of the decision making stages  be the decision one made by the Commission  the Board or the Tribunal  Such a provision provides little if any basis for confining the ambit of the power conferred by s    The difference in language as between s   and s   is not considered to be a sufficient basis to construe s   as imposing any constraint other than the one prescribed by the legislature  namely that the Commission be satisfied that evidence was   false in a material particular   citedLilienthal v Migration Agents Registration Authority   FCA

the power of review where   the Commission is satisfied that evidence before  it  when it made a decision was false in a material particular    Where a discretionary power is vested in the Commission
