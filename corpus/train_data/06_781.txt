Restom v Battenberg  in the matter of Battenberg   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The disclosure of the contents of the letter of   March   in the Notice of Appeal signed by the debtor is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality  The only apparent purpose of the reference to the letter is to summarise the content of the letter and indicate that it supported the assertion that the debtor was domiciled in Australia  The reference to the letter in the Notice of Appeal cannot be linked to the Tribunal s alleged error since the letter is dated   March   and  according to the Notice of Appeal  the Tribunal s decision was made on   March    In my view it constitutes waiver of legal privilege in accordance with the principle expressed in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at   and for that reason I decline to set aside paragraph   of the subpoena   This subpoena was not referred to in the interim application  however it was raised at the hearing  As the documents sought under this subpoena are the same as those sought under the subpoena already discussed  the debtor s objections can be dealt with expeditiously  The documents produced in response to the above subpoena are also responsive to paragraphs   and   of this subpoena and there are no documents falling within paragraph    The only issue is the legal professional privilege issue discussed above and my conclusion is the same as that expressed above  for the same reasons   The notice seeks documents in eight categories  I was informed that there are not any documents in six of the categories  The remaining categories are in paragraphs   and        Trust account and general account statements of account from Salvatore Russo  solicitor for the period   January   to   December   issued with respect to the Union Club litigation in the Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division  Supreme Court of New South Wales defamation list  Administrative Decisions Tribunal  the Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal and the Applicant s litigation before Gyles J in the Federal Court and Full Court of the Federal Court       Statements of account and or memorandum of fees from Murray Aldridge SC and James Dupree for the period   January   to   December   and records by way of cheque butts  direct deposit and bank statements to show payment of same
