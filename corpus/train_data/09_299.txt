Duffy v Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union  No     FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toDuffy v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn   November   the Court published its reasons for judgment on liability issues in this proceeding  In that judgment the Court found that the respondent Union contravened s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act    Cth   the Act   This judgment deals with the question of the penalty  if any  which should be imposed on the Union for that contravention  These reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in the substantive matter   Duffy v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA    The Union engaged in unlawful industrial action under the Act by the imposition by its organisers of limited and short lived bans on the performance of work at a building site called the University Hill site  The relevant portion of the judgment in the substantive matter is set out at   to    The following points from that part of the substantive judgment are of particular current relevance   a    October   a ban was placed on work at the site because of the lack of a female toilet whilst a female worker was present and the absence of a site contamination report  after     am no work was performed on the site  other than by two employees of the head contractor  there were only two sub contractors working on site immediately before the imposition of the ban   i  Crushtec Australia Pty Ltd   who had Ms Sally Belcher performing work on site  and   ii  V G Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd who had Mr Fred Gilliland and Mr Shannon Gilliland performing work on the site    b    October  referred toAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing   Kindred Industries Union   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn recording that fine  I acknowledge that Union is a large body with considerable assets but it is a body which does not exist to make profit but exists for the benefit of its members  see Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing   Kindred Industries Union   FCA   at   per Gray J  It also should be acknowledged  in mitigation of penalty  that the relevant organisers  in imposing the bans  acted in response to what they perceived to be an unsafe workplace where as they were told by the site manager that no soil contamination report had been obtained for the site  The parties agree that each party should bear his and its own costs of the proceeding   I certify that the preceding twenty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toStuart Mahoney v Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWithin about six months of the relevant events  the Union organised a seminar designed to educate its officials about the effects of the Act  This conduct indicates a desire to avoid repetition of conduct in breach of the Act  see Stuart Mahoney v Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union   FCA   at   per Tracey J  There is similar previous conduct  most relevantly in Stuart Mahoney   The events of which occurred about a fortnight before the current events  although that case is not a prior contravention it shows that similar conduct had been undertaken in the past  I say  similar  in a rather loose sense because the imposition of the overtime ban in that matter was far more serious and had far more widespread effects than the transient bans in this matter  Deterrence is important  both general and specific  That is why  notwithstanding the conduct of the head contractor which led to the short lived bans of little consequence  there should be some monetary penalty imposed to reflect that a statutory provision has been breached  It is not as if there was no alternative but to impose a ban  Focussed talks with the head contractor at a high level and or a referral of the issue to the Commission and or Worksafe inspectors were alternative available courses of action  In Stuart Mahoney   Tracey J imposed a penalty of   for breach of s   of the Act in respect of events occurring about the same time as the instant events  Even taking into account the application of the totality principle in that case  the significance and seriousness of the current breach are far less than the circumstances considered by Tracey J  Accordingly  I consider a fine of   to be appropriate in the current circumstances
