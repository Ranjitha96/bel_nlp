Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  A delegate of the Minister refused to grant the permanent visa  That refusal was affirmed on review by the Migration Review Tribunal  An application for judicial review was refused by Connolly FM  Chinda Nouv v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FMCA    The appellant now appeals to this Court   The factual background  the relevant legislation and the terms of the Tribunal s decision are set out in the decision of the learned Magistrate and it is not necessary to repeat them   The appellant s counsel contended that the learned Magistrate erred in that he should have set aside the Tribunal s decision on the grounds that     The Tribunal failed to take into account a mandatory relevant consideration  namely the appellant s travelling to Cambodia to participate in her husband s funeral     The Tribunal misconstrued the visa criteria in that it   a  failed to fix a point in time at which the visa criteria were to be considered  and   b  failed to take proper account of the effect of the grant of the provisional visa appliedSean Investments Pty Ltd v MacKellar     ALR   at   However  the way with which the Tribunal was required to deal with the factual material before it was affected by the way the case was put  Thus in Sean Investments Pty Ltd v MacKellar     ALR   at   Deane J said         it is largely for the decision maker  in light of matters placed before him by the parties  to determine which matters he regards as relevant and the comparative importance to be accorded to matters which he so regards  The ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration will only be made good if it is shown that the decision maker has failed to take into account a consideration which he was  in the circumstances  bound to take into account for there to be a valid exercise of the power to decide   There were before the Tribunal some photographs showing the appellant at the funeral  Also some of the statutory declarations by friends of the appellant made passing reference to her attendance at the funeral  However  in four detailed submissions made to the Tribunal by the appellant s solicitors  totalling   pages  the only reference to the attendance at the funeral is in a letter of   September   at page   where the solicitors say     In response to some of the issues raised by the Delegate we are instructed               The clothing belonging to the applicant s deceased husband was taken to Cambodia by the applicant when she attended his funeral  It is normal for a widow to give her husband s clothing to the poor and this is what she did          The deceased left many of his personal papers with the applicant when he went to Cambodia  Copies of these accompany this letter  The applicant says this is consistent with normal arrangements between spouses  The applicant obtained her husband s passport from his mother in Cambodia when she visited at the time of the funeral     Thus the references to the appellant s attendance at the funeral were not only brief  but were incidental to some other issue that was being dealt with  The funeral attendance was not put as something of relevance in itself consideredHo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FMCA   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  As Phipps FM pointed out in the analogous case of Ho v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FMCA   at     the Tribunal may have  and often will have  different and additional evidence bearing on the parties  relationship at the time of the grant of the permanent visa  It must make its own assessment of that evidence  There is no basis in the regulations for saying that it must accept as correct a previous decision based on different evidence   The appeal will be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding fifteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

detailed reasons the Tribunal did not mention the appellant s attendance at the funeral  although it did  at   accept that she  may have experienced sadness at the time of the sponsor s death and     that she and the sponsor may have been friends or become friends in the process of preparing and pursuing the visa application
