Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Clark s submissions go to the merits of the Tribunal s reasons  In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR     Yusuf   at     McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ made clear that statutory obligations of the present kind require a statement of the administrative tribunal s actual reasons and findings and references to the evidence or other material on which the findings were actually based   Yusuf   HCA       CLR   was concerned with s   of the Migration Act    Cth    It is not shown that the statement of  reasons for decision  provided by the Tribunal did not contain its actual reasons for its decision  did not include its actual findings on material questions of fact  and did not contain a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were actually based   I turn now to the first question relating to s  K  According to the amended notice of appeal  Mr Clark relies on the following ground    The Tribunal erred by not taking into account the following relevant matters        i  the unusual unfair or unjust consequences of strict adherence to s   in the circumstances of this case  ii  the implication found in s   that consideration of the total amount of  periodic compensation payments  is to be deducted from the  lump sum compensation  upon its receipt thereby leaving the appellant in receipt of only one lump sum to the ultimate effect that  periodic compensation payments  have not been made  iii  the unintended effect  when considering the objects of the legislation that if the Appellant had received  compensation affected payments  and not  periodic compensation payments  that the commencement date of the preclusion period would then have commenced on   October   iv  the unfairness occasioned by the limitation placed on the Appellant s claim for economic loss compensation after the age of   coupled with the requirement that  periodic compensation payments  calculated up to the age of   were deducted from the appellant s  lump sum compensation    In its reasons  the AAT referred to Mr Clark s financial circumstances and health  the fact that he had been legally represented during his settlement negotiations  and that advice had been sought from  and given by  Centrelink   Mr Clark complains that the AAT failed to address the true nature of the  special circumstances  on which he relied  namely  that the very provision in s   for a preclusion period worked unjustly in his case  Much of what I have said above in dealing with the first question is relevant to this complaint followedSecretary  Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain   FCA         FCR     Chamberlain   Kiefel J addressed at some length the question of the circumstances that might be  special  within s  K  In particular  her Honour reviewed earlier cases and noted  at   that two of them  Kertland v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA         FCR   and Secretary  Department of Social Security v Smith     FCR   were  unusual  in that in them  it could be seen  objectively  that there could not have been a double payment  so that  it might be concluded that the statutory assumption operated unjustly   Her Honour thought that that situation would not often arise and set those cases apart from the usual   In Chamberlain   FCA       FCR   itself  the effect of the statutory formula was that the applicant would have to pay back more than twice the amount that had been allocated to loss of earnings and of earning capacity in her lump sum settlement  Nonetheless  her Honour thought that such a factor would be present in many cases and was simply an aspect of the outworking of the formula  Her Honour considered that it could not  by itself  amount to  special circumstances    Like Mr Clark  Mrs Chamberlain was elderly  She was aged   years when  on   January   she suffered personal injury in a motor vehicle accident  At the time she was in receipt of an age pension and she had previously received a disability support pension  She claimed to have been able and entitled to earn up to   per week from teaching music  without her pension entitlement being affected  Her claim was settled for   plus   for costs  The parties to the settlement allocated   to pain and suffering and medical expenses  and   to loss of earnings and of earning capacity   Mrs Chamberlain had continued to receive the age pension from the time of the accident  At that time  it was ss   and   of the SS Act that provided for the lump sum preclusion period and refund in Mrs Chamberlain s case  and s   of the SS Act that provided for a discretion in the Secretary to treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not having been made or not liable to be made if the Secretary should think it appropriate to do so  in the special circumstances of the case   Under s  a    the compensation part of the LSP was    The preclusion period was arrived at by dividing that sum by     giving a period of   weeks  The period ran from the date of the injury    January   to   October    The statutory formula produced the result that in respect of that period  Mrs Chamberlain was liable to pay to the Commonwealth     more than twice the sum of   mentioned above   Kiefel J stated  at         The basis for the Tribunal s view  that  special circumstances  were established  was its acceptance of what the parties to the settlement said had been offered and accepted for the economic loss component  It was far less than the statute assumed to be the case in applying the formulae  Again  however  this will be so in many  if not most  cases to which the Act applies  Further  the extent of the difference from the basis upon which the parties acted could not provide the necessary  special circumstance   The statute has selected a figure which may operate in an arbitrary way      The statutory objectives in utilising the formulae  referred to above  must also be borne in mind  It is not intended that a decision maker be required to consider contentions about what part of the compensation reflected the economic loss component  That is so whether one has regard to the application of the formulae or the discretion under s    The latter does not alter the objective and must be read in light of it   Her Honour set aside the Tribunal s decision   If Chamberlain   FCA       FCR   is to be followed  the present application must be dismissed   I respectfully agree with the approach that was taken by Kiefel J  The expression  special circumstances  in s  K does not embrace the circumstance that the   percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive  even grossly excessive  having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity  to the age of the injured person  and perhaps to other circumstances   Once one embarks on an inquiry of the kind that would be required in such a case  one is defeating the legislative intention  The Parliament must be taken to have contemplated as  usual  or  ordinary  the circumstances of people placed as Mr Clark is  In effect  by adopting the rough and ready   percent rule  the legislature has faced such people with a choice  not sue at all and to rely  instead  on such other entitlements as may be available  litigate to trial so that the Court will identify a figure for loss of earnings and of earning capacity  or settle subject to the operation of the   percent rule   In the present case  Mr Clark must be taken to have decided against the former two courses  I do not know why he did so  In one sense  it seems unfair that Mr Clark should suffer a preclusion period until   February   but I do not think that this constitutes  special circumstances  in the light of the legislative intention   If the position were otherwise  the r gime that was introduced in   would be defeated because it would be again open to parties to a settlement to attribute an artificially low figure to loss of earnings and earning capacity  and to the injured person  through s  K of the SS Act  to initiate the very kind of investigation that it was the intention of the   amending Act to eliminate   For the above reasons  I do not think that the AAT erred in law in failing to exercise the discretion given by s  K of the SS Act citedSecretary  Department of Social Security v Banks     ALD   It is useful to look at the policy considerations that informed the inclusion of the   percent rule in the SS Act  Provisions that were substantially the same as ss  a  were introduced by the Social Security Amendment Act    Cth   Act No   of     The Second Reading Speech on the Bill set out the reason for the rule  Australia  House of Representatives  Debates   April   Vol HR  p    Mrs Kelly  Minister for Defence Science and Personnel    This Bill contains measures to improve the administration and integrity of the compensation recovery provisions  Where a person receives personal injury compensation that makes up for lost income the Social Security Act provides that pension or benefit may be reduced or recovered  This is one way in which social security expenditures are directed to those most in need     Settlements of lump sum compensation particularly in the workers compensation jurisdiction are being manipulated to obscure the economic loss component and to avoid recovery of social security payments  To prevent this abuse  the Minister announced on   February   that  for future personal injury settlements made by agreement or by consent order    per cent of lump sum compensation will be deemed to be in respect of economic loss  This Bill gives effect to that proposal      It is clear that the policy objective was to prevent manipulation to obscure the economic loss component in compensation payments and instead deem a flat   percent in all cases  with a reduced preclusion period to compensate for an RPCP component  In deciding Mr Clark s case  the AAT had regard to this policy  citing the discussion of the amendments and the background to them by von Doussa J in Secretary  Department of Social Security v Banks     ALD     The construction supported by Mr Clark would itself result in an anomaly in relation to a young person whose loss of earning capacity accounted for a large part of his or her lump sum compensation payment  Assume a settlement for an LSP of   that there was an RPCP of   and that  although not specified  the sum of   included   for loss of earning capacity  According to the s   and s   formulae  the compensation part of the LSP would be only    On what basis in fairness would the injured young person have a claim to have the preclusion period  calculated by reference to that amount  begin back on the date of the injury  rather than the day after the end of the period covered by the periodical compensation payments of   The arbitrary figure of   would already be an understatement of the amount received for loss of earnings and of earning capacity  and to adopt the date of the injury as the start of the preclusion period would only increase the  over generous  treatment of the injured young person  In a perfect world  the preclusion period would run from the date of injury until the sum of   was exhausted  and in Mr Clark s case from   October   until whatever amount was included in the sum of   for loss of earnings and of earning capacity was exhausted  But in an imperfect world in which settlement figures were being manipulated so as to understate the component for loss of earnings and of earning capacity  the legislature has solved the problem by the rough and ready   percent rule   The provisions reflect a policy decision to treat that which remains after any repayment of any periodic compensation payments as relating  as to   percent  to loss of earnings or of earning capacity  in respect of the period after the expiry of the period covered by those payments  The provisions reflect an acceptance by the legislature that it is not practicable to achieve complete justice attuned to the circumstances of each individual case referred toSecretary  Department of Social Security v Smith
