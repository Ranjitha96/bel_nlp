Wiri People v Native Title Registrar   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedGudjala People   v Native Title Registrar   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The decision of the Registrar to accept or reject an application is a purely administrative function  the decision depending upon whether or not such application satisfies the prescribed criteria   Gudjala People   v Native Title Registrar   FCA   at      Similarly  the decision by the Registrar or his delegate that he is  or is not  satisfied of the requirement under s  C  b  is an administrative decision under the Act   As French J said in Strickland v Native Title Registrar   FCA         ALR   at   in relation to the concept of  satisfaction  of the Registrar under s  B     There is scope for evaluative judgment in an expeditious administrative process carried out by people with relevant specialist experience  It is not for the Court  in reviewing the Registrar s decision  to substitute its own view of the sufficiency of the native title rights and interests for those of the Registrar unless it can be shown that the Registrar s state of satisfaction is based upon some error of principle distinguishedNorthern Territory of Australia v Doepel   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In my view the applicant s argument confuses the terms of ss  C   and  C  b   While there is obvious intersection between ss  C   and   the matters of which the Registrar is required to be satisfied by each section are  in my view  quite different  In relation to s  C   the Registrar must be satisfied as to the contents of the application and that it contains information required by ss   and    cf Mansfield J in Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel   FCA         FCR   at     whereas in relation to section  C   the Registrar must be satisfied as to the identity of the claimed native title holders including the applicant   The applicant relied on Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel   FCA         FCR     where I note Mansfield J held in relation to s  C   In my judgment  s  C  relevantly requires the Registrar to do no more than he did  That is to consider whether the application sets out the native title claim group in the terms required by s    That is one of the procedural requirements to be satisfied to secure registration  s  A b   If the description of the native title claim group were to indicate that not all the persons in the native title claim group were included  or that it was in fact a sub group of the native title claim group  then the relevant requirement of s  C  would not be met and the Registrar should not accept the claim for registration    It is not suggested that the face of the application in this matter raises such difficulties   at   However while Doepel may be authority that  for the purposes of section  C   the Registrar is not required to look beyond the terms of the application  cf Wakaman People No   v Native Title Registrar   FCA         FCR   at   it does not necessarily follow that the same principle applies to the satisfaction required of the Registrar or his delegate by s  C  b   Indeed in the Wiri   Application  although the delegate was not satisfied as required by s  C  b  after considering each of the requirements of ss   and   the delegate was satisfied that the Application contained all the details and other information required by those sections  and accordingly complied with s  C    With specific reference to the native title claim group  the delegate observed   There is nothing on the face of the description of the persons in the native title claim group to indicate that not all persons in the native title claim group are included in the description or that it is in fact a sub group of the native title claim group for the area of the application  Having said that  I do have regard to information elsewhere before me in relation to this issue in my consideration of the authorisation condition under s   C  b   But with the authority of Doepel in mind  I do not consider this information under this condition     In my view the applicant is incorrect in submitting that Doepel is authority that  once the Registrar is satisfied of those matters under s  C   in the case of an uncertified application the requirements of s  C  b  are met by the Registrar being satisfied that the claim group described in the application authorised the making of the application   In that case an application was made by Mr Quall which stated that the native title claim group were eight  members of the Danggalaba Clan  who were all members of the one family  O Loughlin J held that the delegate had erred in accepting the relevant application for registration  As his Honour pointed out  although the persons who claimed to be the native title claim group also claimed to be members of the Danggalaba Clan  they did not claim to be the only members of that Clan  at    Further  as his Honour noted  it was apparent to the delegate that the family of eight was not the native title claim group   but  at most  only part of the relevant group  at     which comprised approximately     people  His Honour quashed the decision of the delegate on the basis that it should not have been accepted for registration  On reviewing the decision it is clear that his Honour was correct for at least two reasons relevant to the application before me   namely that   i  the description of the native title claim group in the application before his Honour   clearly on its face a sub group of a larger clan   did not comply with s     and hence could not be satisfactory to the delegate for the purposes of s  C   and    ii  because on the material before the delegate it was clear that the delegate could not be satisfied within s  C  b  that the applicant was authorised to make the application by all the other persons in the native title claim group discussedRisk v National Native Title Tribunal   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The submissions of the applicant in relation to grounds   and   can be summarised as follows         The delegate misconstrued the principles set out in Risk   and  as a consequence  erroneously considered that she was required to adjudicate between differing descriptions of a native title claim group  and make a factual determination as to the  correct  description of the group  This function is reserved for the Court in native title proceedings    The delegate  because of her misconstruction of the principles in Risk   failed to appreciate that  in so far as the registration test is concerned  an assessment of the composition of a native title claim group is a function of the duty contained in s  C   not s  C  b  and is limited to an assessment of the description of the claim group as it appears in the application and accompanying material  and    Having been satisfied that the requirements of s  C   were met  the only matter which the delegate was required to be satisfied of in relation to section  C  b  was whether the claimant group  as it was described in the Wiri   Application  had authorised the making of the application   In summary  the Registrar submitted in reply that s  C  b  on its proper construction  required the delegate s satisfaction that the applicant was authorised to make the application by all the other persons in the native title claim group  as that phrase is defined in ss   and     of the Act   and this requirement involved consideration of the composition of the native title claim group  In other words  the Registrar s role goes beyond merely accepting the correctness of an applicant s assertion that the persons who  according to their traditional laws and customs  hold communal rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed are confined to those named or described in the application   The term  native title claim group  for the purposes of the Act is defined by s   which  so far as relevant  reads  native title claim group means        a  in relation to a claim in an application for a determination of native title made to the Federal Court   the native title claim group mentioned in relation to the application in the table in subsection          Finally  I do not accept the applicant s argument that the delegate misconstrued the decision of O Loughlin J in Risk v National Native Title Tribunal   FCA     In that case an application was made by Mr Quall which stated that the native title claim group were eight  members of the Danggalaba Clan  who were all members of the one family  O Loughlin J held that the delegate had erred in accepting the relevant application for registration  As his Honour pointed out  although the persons who claimed to be the native title claim group also claimed to be members of the Danggalaba Clan  they did not claim to be the only members of that Clan  at    Further  as his Honour noted  it was apparent to the delegate that the family of eight was not the native title claim group   but  at most  only part of the relevant group  at     which comprised approximately     people  His Honour quashed the decision of the delegate on the basis that it should not have been accepted for registration  On reviewing the decision it is clear that his Honour was correct for at least two reasons relevant to the application before me   namely that   i  the description of the native title claim group in the application before his Honour   clearly on its face a sub group of a larger clan   did not comply with s     and hence could not be satisfactory to the delegate for the purposes of s  C   and    ii  because on the material before the delegate it was clear that the delegate could not be satisfied within s  C  b  that the applicant was authorised to make the application by all the other persons in the native title claim group   So explained  the finding of the delegate in the matter before me   relying on Risk   that she was satisfied of the Application s compliance with s  C   but not satisfied of its compliance with s  C  b  is correct  Further  I do not agree with the submission of the applicant that it was clear from O Loughlin J s reasons that  notwithstanding the continued existence of the dispute between the relevant parties  if the purported native title claim group in the Quall application had been differently framed  the delegate could  lawfully  have accepted the application for registration  On the contrary   in my view it is clear from his Honour s reasons that not only did the evidence indicate that the applicant was not authorised by all the other persons in the native title claim group  but a reframing of the application by the applicant to so contend  when he was clearly not authorised  would not have allowed the delegate to accept the application for registration  see in particular his Honour s comments at       Accordingly  in my view grounds   and   of the applicant s claim cannot be substantiated   Ground   of the applicant s claim relates to grounds   and   and raises no additional issues  This is clear from the terms of ground   itself  and the submission of the applicant that  had the delegate not misdirected herself regarding the principles in Risk   she would have been satisfied that the requirements of s  C  b  were met   I have already considered the decision of the delegate in relation to her state of satisfaction under s  C  b  and found that no error was made in the delegate s reasons for decision   Like grounds   and   this ground also fails    THE COURT ORDERS THAT     The application be dismissed   I certify that the preceding forty   numbered

an amended application by Len Watson  Vassa Hunter and Nancy Riehl jointly on behalf of the Wiri People  the applicant  to review a decision of a delegate of the first respondent  the Native Title Registrar  the Registrar  not to accept the Wiri People   Claimant Application  QUD   of    the Wiri   Application  for registration under section  A Native Title Act    Cth   the Act    The decision was made by the delegate on   May    The jurisdiction of the Court to review a decision of the Registrar not to accept a claim for registration is enlivened by s  D of the Act   with the Court being seized of broad powers pursuant to that section   Western Australia v Strickland   FCA         FCR   at       The relief sought by the applicant is as follows    A  An order setting aside the decision of the Registrar to not accept the Wiri   Application for registration effective as from   May    B  An order directing the Registrar to accept the Wiri   Application for registration and include in the Register of Native Title claims details of the application with effect from   May    C  Such other orders as the Court thinks just and necessary   The Wiri   Application was first entered on the Native Title Register on   April    The application covered a broad area of country in Central Queensland  the eastern boundary of which abutted and extended to offshore islands beyond the coastline to the north and south of Mackay and the western boundary of which was located well inland of the coastline   Reading together ss  A   and  C  b  the logical conclusion is that  unless the Registrar or his delegate is satisfied that the applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application  and deal with matters arising in relation to it  by all the other persons in the native title claim group  the Registrar or his delegate must not accept the claimant application for registration  The information which the Registrar or his delegate can consider in making a decision as to whether the claimant application should be accepted is defined broadly by s  A   and includes not only information contained in the application and other documents provided by the applicant  s  A  a  but also any information obtained by the Registrar as a result of any searches conducted by the Registrar of registers of interests  s  A  b   The breadth of the information the Registrar can take into account pursuant to s  C  b  was recognised by the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland at   Further  the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland   FCA         FCR   at   in considering the state of satisfaction required under s  C  b  agreed with French J that the decision of the Registrar or his delegate should stand if the decision was reached on material available to the Registrar s delegate  and it was not shown that the delegate had been informed by any error in principle in so doing   In the circumstances of this case the delegate  inter alia         was informed by the Central Queensland Land Council that  pursuant to s  BE of the Act   it had certified another claim of the Wiri People  which overlapped and competed with the Wiri   Application  namely the Wiri Core Application    considered anthropological reports attached to the Wiri Core Application supporting the existence of wider native title claim group than identified in the Wiri   Application    after searching the Tribunal records  noted that the Wiri   Application and the Wiri Core Application were but two of a number of applications that had been made over the years by differently described or differently composed groups of Wiri People  and    noted that the meeting notice for the authorisation meeting for the Wiri   Application invited only the very persons ultimately described as the native title claim group in the Wiri   Application   In these circumstances  it was open to the delegate to find that the relevant native title claim group was larger than the group identified in the Wiri   Application  The finding of the delegate that she was not satisfied that the applicant was authorised to make the application and deal with matters arising in relation to it by all the other persons in the native title claim group was  in my view  available on the material   In relation to grounds   and   of the applicant s claim I consider that the applicant has itself misconstrued the basis of the delegate s decision  and incorrectly described the principles on which the delegate was required to make her decision  I take this view for the following reasons   First  as I have already observed  s  C b  does not confine the Registrar or his delegate to the statements made in the affidavit or the information provided in the application in reaching the relevant state of satisfaction   Western Australia v Strickland at    The existence and nature of  and information in  the Wiri Core Application  which had been before the Native Title Tribunal previously  was both available to the delegate and relevant to her consideration of whether the applicant in the Wiri   Application was authorised to make the application on behalf of all the other persons in the native title claim group   Second  in written submissions the applicant contended that the delegate erroneously considered that she was required to adjudicate between differing descriptions of a native title claim group  and make a factual determination as to the  correct  description of the group  However  it is clear from reading the delegate s Reasons for Decision that the delegate carefully avoided making such a determination  Indeed  the delegate clearly stated that   the identity or composition of the Wiri People native title claim group is an intractable dispute of many years standing     The dispute amongst those who claim to be Wiri is not one that I can decide or resolve in the course of this administrative decision as it is not my role to determine the identity of all the persons who  according to their traditional laws and customs  hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed in the area of this application   While the delegate did consider at some length the fact  and nature  of the Wiri Core Application  there is no indication the delegate was adjudicating between that group and the group identified in the Wiri   Application  As I have already found however  it was open to the delegate  in reaching her decision under s  C  b  to take into consideration  inter alia   the existence of that overlapping and competing application  the fact that the native title claim group it described was broader than the description in the Wiri   Application  and the fact that it had been certified pursuant to s  BE by the Central Queensland Land Council   Fourth  I do not accept the applicant s argument that s  C  b  restricts the Registrar to considering whether he is satisfied that the applicant is authorised to make the application by the persons described in the application as the native title claim group  Indeed  this argument runs contrary to findings in other cases  including that of the Full Court  endorsing the decision of French J  in Western Australia v Strickland   that the Registrar or his delegate is not confined in s  C   to statements made in the affidavit or the information in the relevant application
