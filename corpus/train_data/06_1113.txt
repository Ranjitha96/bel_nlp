Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlTheir Honours went on at   to say that the RRT failed to have regard to  relevant material  which is so fundamental that it goes to jurisdiction  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR       at    This is clear  not only from what the High Court said in Yusuf   but also from other authorities which explain the boundaries between errant fact finding and jurisdictional error  Also  in Rezaei v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     Allsop J observed that Yusuf does not stand for the proposition that a tribunal has failed to take into account a relevant consideration merely because it has not referred to a piece of evidence which the Court thinks relevant  His Honour supported this proposition by reference to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      It is also amply supported by the observations of McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Yusuf at       and    Moreover  it is plain from Yusuf at     that s   of the Migration Act  and its equivalent in s   requires the tribunal to set out only the findings it did make  not the findings it did not make referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

Magistrate Lloyd Jones referred at   of his judgment to the appellant s submission that the MRT did not have regard to all the medical reports and that it ignored relevant evidence  The learned Federal Magistrate observed that  despite this contention  there was no doubt that the MRT was familiar with all the reports  This was because the exchange of correspondence between the MRT and the doctors led to the preparation of the reports  His Honour observed that in those circumstances it was difficult to accept that the MRT did not have regard to all of the reports  He went on to say that the MRT was not required to record in its decision all the material that it had considered  Reference was made to the decision of a Full Court in MZWBW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    The learned Federal Magistrate also observed at   that the appellant knew exactly what he was required to prove and was given the opportunity of obtaining the evidence  His Honour said that Dr Patapanian s clear diagnosis was that there was no substantial medical or clinical basis for any claim of discomfort on the appellant s part  He also said that it was open for the MRT to conclude that the appellant did not have a condition that would prevent him from travelling long distances  Mr Young  counsel for the appellant  conceded that the appellant s grounds of appeal may be reduced to two  The first ground is that the MRT failed to have regard in its reasons to important material going to an essential issue in the case  The second ground is that the MRT failed to take into account relevant considerations  namely the existence of other medical evidence  in particular the report of Dr Dinakar dated   May    The substance of Mr Young s argument was that the MRT fell into error because it failed to have regard to the other medical evidence  in particular Dr Dinakar s report of   May    He drew attention to those parts of the report which stated that the appellant would be unable to travel long distances followedNABE v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

of Allsop J  with whom Heerey J relevantly agreed  in Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     His Honour there observed that whatever the outer boundaries of relevant and irrelevant considerations  they do not encompass a failure expressly to mention part of a competing body of evidence before the tribunal  provided that the elements or integers of the claim are addressed  Here  it is plain that the MRT addressed the appellant s claim that his medical condition prevented him from travelling overseas  The appellant s submission that the MRT was required to expressly grapple with the other medical evidence is outside the boundaries of judicial review  The appeal must be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding forty three

a tribunal has failed to take into account a relevant consideration merely because it has not referred to a piece of evidence which the Court thinks relevant  To this may be added the endorsement of the relevant passage in Rezaei by the Full Court in MZWBW  to which Federal Magistrate Lloyd Jones referred  at   and Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at    referred toThirukkumar v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlTo this may be added the endorsement of the relevant passage in Rezaei by the Full Court in MZWBW  to which Federal Magistrate Lloyd Jones referred  at   and Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at    followedWAEE v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     ALD  Thus  as was said by a Full Court  French  Sackville and Hely JJ  in WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   at   it is not necessary for a tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention of an applicant in its written reasons  there is a distinction between failure to refer to evidence and failure to address a contention which constitutes a claim or an integer of a claim  This passage of WAEE was referred to with approval by the Full Court in MZWBW at    It was also referred to by Federal Magistrate Lloyd Jones in his reference to the relevant paragraph of MZWBW  When the learned Federal Magistrate s reasons are considered in light of these well established statements of principle  they can be seen to be entirely without error  Indeed  his Honour s finding at   that the MRT must have had regard to other medical evidence  including that of Dr Dinakar  though not essential to the correctness of the decision  seems to me to be entirely correct  Given the process which led to the production and submission of Dr Patapanian s report  it is difficult to accept the appellant s submission that the MRT failed to have regard to the earlier reports  What is more  the MRT s failure to refer to Dr Dinakar s report is quite understandable  This is because the last sentence of the report of   May   specifically deferred to the more expert opinion of a specialist  Dr Patapanian was the very specialist to whom Dr Dinakar referred the appellant for an opinion on the question of whether he was able to travel  Notwithstanding this  Dr Patapanian made no mention of that issue  Dr Patapanian s failure to refer to that issue is not supportive of the appellant s claim  As the learned Federal Magistrate said at   given the doctor s diagnosis  it was open for the MRT to make a finding that he did not have the condition he asserted explainedWAFP v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlMr Young submitted that the species of error upon which he relied was not co extensive with errant fact finding  He relied in particular on the decision of a Full Court  Lee  Carr and Tamberlin JJ  in WAFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    In WAFP their Honours set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal stating at   that the RRT had failed to have regard  to important relevant material going to a central consideration  in the case  The language used by their Honours in WAFP was broad  It might  in one sense  be thought to support the appellant s submission in the present case  However  in my view  the Full Court in WAFP   by referring to  important relevant material  did not intend to elevate a failure to refer to evidence to a ground of jurisdictional error  If it did  the decision in WAFP would be contrary to established principles
