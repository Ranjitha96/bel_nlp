Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedSood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd   FCA    http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThis appeal from the making of a sequestration order by Raphael FM   Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd v Sood  No     FMCA   concerns the interplay between the bankruptcy legislation and the Federal proceeds of crime legislation  as did an earlier interlocutory issue   Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd   FCA    The main question in the appeal is whether an order pursuant to s   of the Proceeds of Crime Act    Cth  effectively stays execution on an outstanding judgment against the party subject to that order for the purposes of s  g  and s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   There is also an issue as to whether the learned Federal Magistrate was in error in making a sequestration order in any event  The facts as to the main question are in a short compass  On   July   the Director of Public Prosecutions  Commonwealth  obtained orders against Dr Suman Sood  the debtor  the relevant parts of which are as follows           Pursuant to section   of the Proceeds of Crime Act    the Act   all the property  within the meaning of  property  as defined in section   of the Act   of Suman Sood  the Defendant  including the property described in the First Schedule  but excluding her interest in any business  is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person                 Pursuant to section   of the Act   specified property of another person  namely Suman Medical Pty Limited  being the property described in the Second Schedule is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person        Property is defined as follows     Real or personal property of every description  whether situated in Australia or elsewhere and whether tangible or intangible and includes an interest in any such real or personal property  On   September   Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd  the creditor  obtained judgment in the Local Court against the debtor in the sum of        On   May   a bankruptcy notice was issued by the Official Receiver at the instance of the creditor to the debtor  which notice was served upon the debtor on   May    The bankruptcy notice was not complied with on or before   June   as required relatedDirector of Public Prosecutions v Sood  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Studdert J    February  Section   provides that a court may allow a specified debt incurred in good faith by a person to be met out of property covered by a restraining order but  amongst other conditions  that can only be done if the person whose property is restrained has applied for the order  s  d  s  a   The decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to this very order in Director of Public Prosecutions v Sood  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Studdert J    February   establishes that an unsecured creditor has effectively no status to make an application concerning the effect of a s   order  No application pursuant to s   was made by the debtor prior to the issue and service of the bankruptcy notice  Concurrently with the enactment of the Proceeds of Crime Act     the Proceeds of Crime  Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions  Act    Cth  specifically dealt with the effect of orders pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act   upon the Bankruptcy Act   and introduced other amendments to that Act  Section  A was introduced into the Bankruptcy Act   and modifies the normal operation of s   that vests property in the Official Trustee or registered trustee as appropriate  Section  A  provides that s   does not apply to any property of the bankrupt which is covered by a restraining order at the date of the bankruptcy  Section  A  in its current form was also introduced and provides that an amount payable under a proceeds of crime law is not provable in bankruptcy  It was submitted on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions  who was permitted to appear as amicus  that a restraining order under the Proceeds of Crime Act has the effect of freezing action under the Bankruptcy Act   and prevents property covered by it from being dealt with or distributed under that Act  It is correct that the   amendments give primacy to the proceeds of crime regime over the bankruptcy regime to that extent  However  Parliament did not make any express provision in relation to bankruptcy notices or sequestration orders  Having considered the authorities in the light of the submissions from counsel in this case  I am left with the feeling that this area of the law needs to be sorted out by the High Court or the legislature  The concept of stay of execution has been stretched beyond recognition  It is difficult to find a basis in the words of the statute for the fine distinctions drawn in the cases  However  in the meantime  I must do

cth federal ct  htmlThe relevant authorities were considered in this Court by Mathews J in Commissioner of Taxation v Stuart Jones   FCA         FCR   in a similar context  In that case the Supreme Court of New South Wales had made a restraining order under s   of the Drug Trafficking  Civil Proceedings  Act    NSW  against the debtor  A bankruptcy notice was served some time later whilst the order was still in force  In that case the order pursuant to s   related only to an identified property and not to the whole of the property of the debtor  Section   provided as follows       If a restraining order is in force in respect of an interest of a person in property  the restraining order does not prevent           a  the levying of execution against the property in satisfaction  or partial satisfaction  of the debt arising under a proceeds assessment order in force against the person  or      b  with the consent of the Supreme Court  the sale or other disposition of the interest to enable the proceeds to be applied in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of that debt  or      c  with the consent of the Supreme Court  the application of the interest in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of that debt        A  proceeds assessment order  was an order that the person pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity which took place within the preceding six years  Mathews J indicated that it was at least arguable that a restraining order over the whole of a debtor s property would have the effect of preventing the levying of execution in the relevant sense  However  because of the limited nature of the order in that case  the debtor failed to establish invalidity of the bankruptcy notice  Before considering the authorities  the Proceeds of Crime Act   should be examined a little more closely  The relevant provisions are described as  The confiscation scheme  and are summarised in s   of that Act as follows       Chapter   sets out   processes relating to confiscation           a  restraining orders prohibiting disposal of or dealing with property  see Part     and      b  forfeiture orders under which property is forfeited to the Commonwealth  see Part     and      c  forfeiture of property to the Commonwealth on conviction of a serious offence  see Part     and      d  pecuniary penalty orders requiring payment of amounts based on benefits derived from committing offences  see Part     and      e  literary proceeds orders requiring payment of amounts based on literary proceeds relating to offences  see Part      It is an offence to breach a restraining order  s    It is not clear whether breach of an order would be contempt of court  An order pursuant to s   does not appear to catch after acquired property  The Court may order that the Official Trustee take the custody and control of property covered by a restraining order  s    The Court may set aside
