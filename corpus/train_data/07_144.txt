appeal against his Honour s decision  The appeal grounds challenge his Honour s findings in relation to liability and penalty   Initially  I was concerned that the imposition of a monetary penalty on Edison which was only slightly less than that imposed on the CEPU might not be in accord with the parity principle having regard to the finding of Young J that the CEPU was the instigator of the offending conduct and that the CEPU could not claim the benefit of any discount by reason of any cooperation with the ACCC s investigation or an early willingness to acknowledge liability  However  having heard argument on the point  I was persuaded that the imposition of a penalty of   on Edison would not contravene the parity principle  I have come to this view having regard to a number of factors  The first is that the CEPU was penalised as an accessory rather than a party principal  Moreover it was penalised in respect of a single course of conduct which extended over two weeks  see   FCA   at            Edison  on the other hand  committed two separate contraventions of the Act   one under s  E and the other under s  EA  The contravention of s  E occurred when Edison  in August   entered into the agreement with the CEPU  The contravention of s  EA   which occurred when Edison gave effect to the agreement  involved conduct undertaken over a period of more than two years   August   until   November     The nature of the contravening conduct to which Edison has admitted and the circumstances in which it occurred appear from the passages in the agreed statement of facts extracted above at    The demand  by the CEPU  which led to the making of the offending agreement  was made at a time when Edison was peculiarly susceptible to industrial pressure by reason of pressing commercial imperatives  The principal victim of the agreement was DJN  It was unable to obtain work from Edison at the Loy Yang site for over two years  Edison was deprived of the option of engaging DJN and any other subcontractors who did not have certified agreements with the CEPU  It is not possible to quantify the losses sustained by DJN and Edison which were caused by the agreement  Those losses do not appear to have been significant in monetary terms   It is necessary  in fixing an appropriate penalty  to have regard to the need to deter other companies from engaging in similar conduct  In my view a penalty of the magnitude proposed serves this purpose citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   ATPR     The maximum monetary penalty which may be imposed upon a corporation for a contravention of ss  E and  EA of the Act is  in each case    see s  A  of the Act   Edison s admissions  therefore  render it liable to a maximum aggregate penalty of    m  It was submitted that an appropriate penalty  absent any ameliorative factors  was one tenth of that amount  namely    A discount of   was applied to take account of Edison s cooperation with the ACCC in the course of the ACCC s investigation and Edison s early admission of liability  cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   ATPR
