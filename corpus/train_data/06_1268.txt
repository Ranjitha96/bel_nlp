was any delay on the part of the applicants in the bringing of these proceedings  Indeed  their case was predicated upon the basis that the applicants bought a viable business which was subsequently badly managed and subject to other circumstances which affected the business  viability  In those circumstances  this is not a case of the kind in Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd  No       FCR   where the Court held that the damages should be limited to a point of time when the respondents should have abandoned the business   I do not intend to reduce the applicants  damages by reason of their continuing to conduct the business up until trial   It is the applicants  case that the representations which I have found made  were made in trade or commerce and were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive contrary to and in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act and or s   of the Fair Trading Act   The applicants pleaded that the representations were made by the first respondent through the medium of the second respondent  paragraph   of the statement of claim  The representations relied upon are those in the brochure  paragraph   of the statement of claim  It is not pleaded that the third respondent made the representations  They claim that they relied upon the representations  The first applicant claims that in reliance on the representations it entered into the agreement of   December   with the first respondent and that it paid a deposit  and that it proceeded to settlement on or about   February   and acquired the business  It further claims that in reliance upon the representations it entered into a lease with the first respondent of the premises  It is pleaded that the third applicant  also in reliance upon the representations  gave up her job as a teacher to work full time in the business  There is no separate plea that the second applicant did or did not do anything in reliance upon the representations

Act was considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in State of Western Australia v Wardley     FCR    Section   creates a right and gives a remedy  Section   prescribes a time limitation which has a procedural character  It follows  as was said in State of Western Australia v Wardley at   that s   is  a condition of the remedy rather than an element in the right and a prerequisite to jurisdiction which cannot be waived   The Court said at      It follows that it is for a defendant to assert non compliance  rather than for a plaintiff to assert compliance with s   as an element of the cause of action   More importantly  the Court continued at      The need for compliance with s   may be waived by the defendant and an estoppel may prevent the defendant denying

 html  Section    damages  and s    other orders  make a corporation  as defined in s     liable in damages and to other orders for a contravention of s    Corporations cannot act  of course  except through a human agency  being its directors  servants or agents  Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ  The effect of s  B is to apply the provisions of s   and s   to any person who has been involved in a contravention of those parts of the Trade Practices Act mentioned in s  B  by reason of any of the conduct in paragraphs  a   d  of s  B   Those persons may be the corporation s directors  servants or agents  It is not only directors  servants or agents who may be caught by s  B but  for the purpose of this case  it is enough to consider only that class   In this matter the question is whether s  B applies to either or both of the second respondent and third respondent so as to allow the Court to make an order for damages against one or both of them as persons involved in a contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Section  B  prescribes the particular circumstances where a person who has not himself or herself contravened s   can be made the subject of an award of damages or may be made the subject of other orders  In that sense  it is a procedural section which widens the class of persons who may be the subject of orders under the Trade Practices Act   The section instances four separate ways in which a person may be made subject to orders under ss   or     In this proceeding the applicants have  in their claims against the second and third respondents  only relied on one of those paragraphs  namely s  B c    For the reasons already given  it is my opinion that the second respondent well knew that the brochure contained representations which were  in material respects  false  That having been established  the applicants have established an actual rather than a constructive knowledge of the essential matters that make up the contravention  The applicants have established that there is a close rather than a remote involvement in the contravention  Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   at    The second respondent was an intentional participant in the first respondent s contravention  The second respondent constructed the brochure and included the figures which made up the brochure profit and loss statement for the financial statement  She published the brochure to the second and third applicants  She was directly involved in the contravention by the first respondent of s   of the Trade Practices Act    It follows  therefore  that the applicants have established that the second respondent was knowingly concerned in or a party to a contravention by the first respondent of s   of the Trade Practices Act    In my opinion  the applicants have also established that the second respondent contravened s   of the Fair Trading Act   The second respondent s conduct in publishing to the second and third applicants  and thereby the first applicant  the brochure which contained the false representations means that inevitably a finding must be made that she contravened s   of the Fair Trading Act   It was her action which caused the company to contravene s   of the Trade Practices Act   Necessarily  her action is a contravention of s   of the Fair Trading Act  appliedconsideredYorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section  B was considered by the High Court in Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR    In that case  a corporation sold its business to the appellants  A land agent  which was also a corporation  acted on behalf of the vendor  A director of that land agent acted in the sale of the business  The trial judge found that the vendor had contravened s   of the Trade Practices Act   He also found that the land agent company had contravened s   but unwittingly  He found that a director of the vendor had aided and abetted or  alternatively  was knowingly concerned in the contravention by the vendor and by virtue of s  B was a person involved in the vendor s contravention  However  he found that a director of the land agent company was unaware and had no reason to suspect the information supplied by the director of the vendor and thereby the vendor was incorrect  He dismissed the case against the director of the land agent company on the ground that the appellant had failed to prove that the director was aware or should have been aware of the relevant facts before he could be said to have been involved in the contravention  His decision was upheld by the Full Court of the Federal Court and the purchasers appealed to the High Court  The appellants argued that the respondent was caught by paragraphs  a  and  c  of s  B   They argued that s  B    or at least paragraphs  a  and  c  did not require the appellants to prove any intent on the part of the respondent based upon knowledge of the material facts citedGiorgianni v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In dealing with paragraph  a  of s  B    Mason ACJ  Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ  the majority  applied principles of the criminal law because the words used in s  B a  are taken directly from the criminal law  In particular  they relied upon a previous decision of that Court in Giorgianni v The Queen   HCA         CLR   which had held that in the criminal law where a party is accused of aiding and abetting  the party must have knowledge of the essential matters which go to make up the offence before the party can form the requisite intention even if the party does not know that those matters amount to a crime  The majority said at        If par  a  of s  B imports the requirements of the criminal law  it is clear in the light of Giorgianni v The Queen that Lucas could only be brought within that paragraph if he intentionally aided  abetted  counselled or procured a contravention by the Lucas company of s   of the Trade Practices Act   Upon the findings of the trial judge  however  Lucas lacked the knowledge necessary to form the required intent  A contravention of s   involves conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead and deceive and the conduct relied upon in this case consisted of the making of false representations  Whilst Lucas was aware of the representations indeed they were made by him he had no knowledge of their falsity and could not for that reason be said to have intentionally participated in the contravention   A similar construction was given to s  c   The majority said at      There can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention   The majority concluded at      In our view  the proper construction of par  c  requires a party to a contravention to be an intentional participant  the necessary intent being based upon knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention  citedPereira v Director of Public Prosecutions   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It must be actual knowledge not constructive knowledge that is established  There may be circumstances where knowledge may be inferred  Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions   HCA         ALR   at      But that is still a factual inquiry as to whether the particular person was seized of the actual knowledge  Where knowledge is sought to be inferred it must be the only rational inference available  The person said to be accessorily liable  if s  B c  is relied on  must not only have the necessary knowledge  the person must also be involved in a contravention of the relevant provision of the Act  Therefore  there must be some evidence of a participation in the contravention by the corporation appliedconsideredArktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC     Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd   was a case in the Full Court of the Federal Court mainly concerned with practice and procedure  However  the case is instructive in relation to the ambit of s   of the Fair Trading Act   In that case  the appellant had purchased a business from the first respondent  The primary judge found that the third respondent  who was a director of the first respondent  made misleading precontract representations and held  as a result  that the first respondent had thereby engaged in misleading conduct in trade or commerce contrary to s   of the Trade Practices Act   The misleading representation related to profitability and value of the business  The primary judge considered the third respondent s liability but dismissed the action against him on the ground that  whilst it was pleaded the third respondent had acted within the scope of his actual or apparent authority as a director or agent of the first respondent  the pleading did not allege that the third respondent engaged in conduct in trade or commerce on his own account  He also found that there was no plea that the third respondent was knowingly concerned in the contravention as defined in s  B of the Trade Practices Act or s   of the Fair Trading Act   He concluded at   that therefore no  derivative liability under the Act or the Fair Trading Act   was made out against  the third respondent  in respect of conduct by Idyllic held to contravene s   of the Act or s   of the Fair Trading Act    The appeal was against the primary judge s failure to grant the appellants relief against the third respondent   The primary judge said at   that the researches of Counsel  have not revealed a single authority where an employee has been held personally liable for statements made in the course of his or her employment by an employer who  or which  was concededly engaged in trade or commerce   He then went on to say        The consideration just indicated together with my own analysis in the light of the authorities of the common basis on which liability for deceptive or misleading conduct  in trade or commerce  is erected by both the TPA and the Fair Trading Act has led me to conclude that it does not extend to the conduct of Student or Houghton in the present case  That is not to say that a director or sole shareholder of a company may not attract liability for statements made in the course of the company s business if their making can be characterised as tending to promote the director s or shareholders own trading or commercial interests  See eg Arktos v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC       ATPR      However  no independent trading or commercial interest can be imputed to Student or Houghton in the present case  The application against those respondents must therefore be dismissed   That matter went on appeal  The Full Court of the Federal Court in Arms v Houghton   FCAFC   discussed the decisions in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd  Citibank Ltd v Liu   and Wong v Citibank and concluded at   that there was authority both in the Full Court of this Court and in the Court of Appeal in New South Wales that  an employee can be found to have engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct for actions taken within the scope of his actual authority  that is  not independently of such authority    It will be convenient to address the claim under s   of the Fair Trading Act first  The third respondent was a director of the first respondent  It was submitted that  in those circumstances  he also contravened s   of the Fair Trading Act and he is liable to the applicant  Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd    In my opinion  that submission cannot be accepted  The critical fact in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd which made that director liable under the Fair Trading Act was that the director had acted on behalf of the corporation and made misleading pre contractual representations within the scope of his authority as a director to the purchaser  In those circumstances  the Full Court concluded that he was liable for the reasons it gave at   cited above at     It is not enough for an applicant to merely establish that a corporation has contravened s   of the Trade Practices Act and thereby claim that any director of that corporation is liable under s   of the Fair Trading Act   There must be a contravention by the director himself or herself  That was made clear by Nicholson J in Caple v All Fasteners  WA   A Firm    FCA    In that case  it was alleged that a corporation had contravened s   of the Trade Practices Act   It was pleaded that the appellant  who was a director of the corporation but who had not been party to any of the representations which had been made  was accessorily liable under s  B of the Trade Practices Act and  in the alternative  primary liable under s   of the Fair Trading Act   The Federal Magistrate found the appellant was accessorily liable under s  B of the Trade Practices Act   even though the representations were not made by the appellant  He did not find her liable under s   of the Fair Trading Act   On appeal  the respondent filed a notice of contention contending that  in addition  or in the alternative  to the grounds for liability of the appellant contained in the reasons of his Honour  the appellant is liable to the respondent in relation to her breach  sic  of s   of the Fair Trading Act    WA  as pleaded in the respondent s re amended statement of claim  at    The respondent relied on this Court s decision in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd to support the submission citedCitibank Ltd v Liu   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The Court observed that the appellants had not only sued the company but also the third respondent and that circumstance indicated that the appellants sought relief against the third respondent  The Court said at      The authorities show that a director of a corporation who acts on its behalf in the course of trade or commerce also acts himself or herself in trade or commerce and  if the corporation is liable under a State Fair Trading Act for their conduct  they also attract primary liability under the same statute  Cleary v Australian Co operative Foods Ltd     ACSR   at     Lauriana Pty Ltd v Corfield Food Warehouse Pty Ltd  unreported  Supreme Court of Western Australia  Wallwork J    April   at   and   Citibank Ltd v Liu   NSWSC   at   and the cases there discussed  and Miba Pty Ltd v Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd     ALR   at    That is supported in particular by the provision in s   of the TPA and s   of the FTA that conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate by a director within the scope of actual or apparent authority is deemed  also  to have been engaged in by the body corporate  It is not correct  as the case for the third respondent asserted  that the principle recognized in these authorities is applicable only when there is a finding of  separate conduct  by the director  that is  conduct other than in the capacity of director or agent  It is accepted in J D Heydon  Trade Practices Law  Law Book Company  Sydney    at     that corporate officers acting in the course of their employment  or in the scope of their authority as agents causing the corporation to be liable under s   also have personal liability  It is added there that in normal circumstances such officers will be knowingly concerned in the conduct  s  B c    In Citibank Ltd v Liu   NSWSC     an employee of a corporation  Mr Wong  who was not a director  presented draw down notices to a bank for the purpose of certifying certain matters necessary for a lease to the company  The notices contained false representations which were not known to the employee  In those circumstances  accessorial liability under s  B of the Trade Practices Act did not attach  However  Hamilton J  in the New South Wales Supreme Court  held Mr Wong liable under s   of the Fair Trading Act    NSW  which is the equivalent of s   of the Fair Trading Act  WA    Hamilton J said at      In my view  no difference is made to the application of the principle by the fact that the representor on behalf of a corporation is an employee  The fact that he is an employee does not negative the fact that he is acting as an agent  That the FTA may impose liability on employees acting as such is illustrated by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McCaskey   FCA         FCR    That was a case under the TPA but  as the conduct involved telephone communications  the provisions bound natural persons as well as corporations  The injunctive orders were made by consent  but French J scrutinised them carefully to see that they were authorised by the Act  see at    His Honour made orders against the employee who had engaged in the conduct  In Primcom Pty Ltd v Sgarioto   ATPR  Digest      a case under the Victorian FTA  Eames J held an estate agent liable for misleading conduct although his principals selling their own house could not be held liable because not engaged in trade or commerce  The FTA proscribes conduct by natural persons  If that conduct is in trade or commerce and cannot be said not to be misleading conduct of the person who engages in it by reason that that person is acting merely as a conduit  in my view the person is not removed from the purview of the Act by the fact he is engages  sic  in the conduct as the employee of another   That matter went on appeal  The Full Court of the Federal Court in Arms v Houghton   FCAFC   discussed the decisions in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd  Citibank Ltd v Liu   and Wong v Citibank and concluded at   that there was authority both in the Full Court of this Court and in the Court of Appeal in New South Wales that  an employee can be found to have engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct for actions taken within the scope of his actual authority  that is  not independently of such authority  citedWong  as Executor of the Estate of the Late Casey Wong  v Citibank Limited   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  The matter went on appeal to the Court of Appeal and is reported sub nomine Wong  as Executor of the Estate of the Late Casey Wong  v Citibank Limited   NSWCA     Mr Wong  who died subsequent to the trial  was the general manager of the corporation of which Ms Liu was the principal  His executor appealed against the finding of the trial judge that Mr Wong had breached s   of the Fair Trading Act  NSW   The Court of Appeal said at        In the course of his reasons  the trial judge referred to John G  Glass Real Estate Pty  Limited v  Karawi Constructions Pty  Limited   ATPR     where the Full Court held that an agent  in that case a real estate agent  who had transmitted a false misrepresentation to it by the owner  itself engaged in conduct that was misleading and deceptive  Here  his Honour held that it did not matter that the  agent  was an employee  In support of this proposition  he relied upon the decision of French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v  McCaskey   FCA         FCR   where French J made injunctive orders against an employee who had engaged in the misleading and deceptive conduct      Counsel for the appellant submitted that McCaskey was not binding on this Court and was of little persuasive authority in circumstances where the issue as to whether an employee could be liable under s   had not been fully argued  He submitted therefore that his Honour erred in placing reliance upon it  Although McCaskey is a first instance authority  French J is an experienced Federal Court judge who  in the Full Court system of that court  sits both at first instance and on appeal  His decision commands respect  and  if the appellant wishes this Court not to have regard to it  an attempt should have been made to establish that his Honour was wrong in some respect or that there was some reason why the case had no application or was irrelevant to the issue under consideration  No such attempt was made      But in any event  his Honour s acceptance that relief could be granted against an employee for breach  in that case of s   of the Trade Practices Act   is clearly correct  As a matter of law  an employee acts as agent for the employer  There is no basis in principle why different rules should apply to agents who are appointed in different circumstances  Provided that a party alleging the contravention is able to establish that the agent is liable within the principles state in Yorke v  Lucas   then liability under the section attaches  notwithstanding that the agent in question is an employee acting within authority in the course of employment   That matter went on appeal  The Full Court of the Federal Court in Arms v Houghton   FCAFC   discussed the decisions in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd  Citibank Ltd v Liu   and Wong v Citibank and concluded at   that there was authority both in the Full Court of this Court

set out the appellants contentions        The first is that the conduct of Mr Price  which was the conduct of Idyllic in this matter  was itself in trade or commerce and attracted primary liability under ss       and   of the FTA  because that conduct was misleading        Secondly  the appellants contend that it is no part of a cause of action under those sections that a director or agent engages in misleading conduct  on his own account         Thirdly  the appellants say that the statement of claim adequately raised a cause of action under those sections of the FTA against Mr Price        Finally  the appellants say that  if they do not succeed on their third point  the statement of claim pleaded all the facts found at trial sufficient to sustain a cause of action under ss       and   of the FTA against Mr Price and he would have been afforded procedural fairness had judgment been entered against him   In Arms v WSA Online Limited  ACN         FCA     the primary judge was

Trading Act   On appeal  the respondent filed a notice of contention contending that  in addition  or in the alternative  to the grounds for liability of the appellant contained in the reasons of his Honour  the appellant is liable to the respondent in relation to her breach  sic  of s   of the Fair Trading Act    WA  as pleaded in the respondent s re amended statement of claim  at    The respondent relied on this Court s decision in Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd to support the submission   Nicholson J said at        In Arktos a Mr Price made misleading pre contractual representations on behalf of a company of which he was a director  It was held that such representations were made both on behalf of the company and in his individual capacity  thereby grounding his direct liability pursuant to s   of the Fair Trading Act    WA   sic       However  here the appellant  although a director of the company  did not make any representation nor was it pleaded or put to her that she had done so  Further  it was not pleaded or put to her that she had given any authority for any representation to be made on her behalf beyond negotiation of the lease of the premises  Nor was it pleaded or put to her that any agent who acted on her behalf exceeded the agent s actual ostensible authority in circumstances such as to bind her or render her personally liable      I

In Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd  No       FCR   Lockhart J said at        These decisions support the view that recovery under s   is founded by the applicant s actual reliance upon the misleading or deceptive conduct of the respondent although that conduct was not the only factor in the applicant s decision to enter a particular agreement  and although the applicant did not seek to verify the representations or did so inadequately and so failed to discover their falsity      The circumstances of this case do not support the conclusion that Collins Marrickville did not in fact rely upon the misleading conduct of Mr Saade and Henjo  Their conduct not only played some part in contributing to the purchase of the business but was in fact  the major inducement  It matters not that the solicitor s failure to carry out his client s instructions prevented what may or indeed would  more likely than not  have been a different result  The fact is that reliance was placed by the purchaser upon what it assumed to be the true position as a result of the conduct of the vendor and the absence of knowledge of the true facts   The applicants relied upon the pleaded representations  which I have found to be made out  up to   February   and indeed beyond  The respondents  conduct was the inducement for the applicants entering into the agreement to purchase on   December   and settling on that agreement on   February    It is not the point that Mr Moore did not ascertain the representations were false  His failure to recognise the falsity of the representations was the fault of the respondents who continued to publish the false representations in the Moore     and   profit and loss statements citedHenville v Walker   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my opinion  the applicants were not careless about the way in which they entered into the transaction  Indeed  the evidence is all to the contrary  They employed an accountant and a solicitor to advise  That was appropriate  Even if there was some want of care on their part  which I reject  that would not mean they could not recover  In Henville v Walker   HCA         CLR     Henville v Walker   Gleeson CJ said at      It will commonly be the case that a person who is induced by a misleading or deceptive representation to undertake a course of action will have acted carelessly  or will have been otherwise at fault in responding to the inducement  The purpose of the legislation is not restricted to the protection of the careful or the astute  Negligence on the part of the victim of a contravention is not a bar to an action under s   unless the conduct of the victim is such as to destroy the causal connection between contravention and loss or damage   I have already found that the applicants were not poor managers of the business  They worked hard in the business and  as a result  significantly increased the turnover  They were not able to generate significant profits in the business because the business was not capable of making a profit of the kind represented in the brochure or anything near that  There were no external factors which adversely affected the profitability of the business   I have already dealt with the last matter raised by the first  second and third respondents in their defence relating to accessorial liability   The Court has the task of selecting  a measure of damages which conforms to the remedial purpose of the statute and to the justice and equity of the case  Henville v Walker per Gleeson CJ at     In this case  the representations induced the first applicant to enter into the agreement to purchase the business from the first respondent  to borrow   upon which it agreed to pay interest  to enter into the lease of the premises for the purpose of carrying on the business  and to incur the transactional costs associated with the purchase  borrowing and leasing   The second applicant was induced by the representations to cause the first applicant to purchase the business and enter into the lease of the premises  That  however  did not cause the second applicant any separate loss or damage  He  however  in reliance upon the representations  gave up his time to work in the business acquired by the first applicant for the purpose of generating the profits it was represented the first applicant could make   The third applicant  in reliance upon the same representations  gave up her paid employment as a teacher to work full time in the first applicant s business   The first applicant claimed the transactional costs to which I have referred in    I find that those were costs associated with the transaction and were losses incurred by the first applicant by reason of the contravention citedGEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd     ALR   Usually the Court adopts the rate of interest applied by the Supreme Court in the State or Territory in which this Court is sitting  GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd     ALR   at    I am not aware of that rate and have not been addressed on that issue  I will need to hear the parties  However  the calculation of interest would proceed      x X  x         x X  x      Where     years represents the period over which interest will run for transactional and purchase costs and     years represents the period over which interest will run on the damages awarded for interest paid and X   represents the rate of interest applied in the Supreme Court of Western Australia   If the second and third applicants are granted leave to amend their statement of claim  damages would have accrued over the same period as the interest component over the first applicant s damages  They would be entitled to interest for half the period  In that case  the respective calculations would be      x X  x     and    x X  x     The first applicant seeks an order rescinding the lease of the premises  In his closing address  Mr Mendelow repeated the first applicant s call for rescission citedDemagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky     FCR   The lease was entered into before settlement on   February    However  it was clearly entered into in contemplation of the purchase of the business  But for the representation contained in the brochure  the first applicant would not have entered into the lease  Rescission is available under s   to prevent or reduce loss or damage  Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky     FCR    It is necessary to make such an order to prevent ongoing damage to the first applicant   However  it is necessary to hear the parties as to the precise order to be made because any order as to rescission will mean that the business can no longer be carried on on the premises   The second and third applicants may seek leave to amend  If they do they should provide the first  second and third respondents and the Court with a formal minute of the proposed amendment  The applicants should be heard on the rate of interest that ought to be applied for the purpose of a calculation of interest under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act   They should supply a calculation of the amount of interest applicable to the separate awards of damages
