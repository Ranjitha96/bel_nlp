cases vic VICSC  html  In Advan Investments Pty Ltd v Dean Gleeson Motor Sales Pty Ltd   VSC   Gillard J identified the elements which it is necessary for a complainant to establish in order to make good a charge of civil contempt of court  His Honour said        In order to prove a civil contempt of court involving a breach of an order of the court  the plaintiff has to prove the following                 i  that an order was made by the court                       ii  that the terms of the order are clear  unambiguous and capable of compliance                       iii  that the order was served on the alleged contemnor or excused in the circumstances  or service dispensed with pursuant to the Rules of Court                       iv  that the alleged contemnor has knowledge of the terms of the order  and                      v  that the alleged contemnor has breached the terms of the order              It is necessary for the plaintiff to prove each element beyond reasonable doubt  In accordance with the principles of the criminal law  in proving element  v  it must be proven that the act or omission which constituted the breach of the order was deliberate and voluntary  citedWitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As noted by his Honour  the standard of proof required for each of the elements of a charge of contempt of this Court is proof beyond reasonable doubt  see  Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at     There is no dispute  and I am satisfied that      Paragraph   of the orders I made on   September   was an order of the Court      The Order was clear  unambiguous and capable of compliance      The Order was personally served on Mr Morrison on   October   and was served on the respondent on   October   and     Mr Morrison had knowledge of the terms of the Order citedAustralian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Australian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson and Deane JJ said  at     that        lying behind punishment for a contempt which involves wilful disobedience to a court order  is the very substantial purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court      a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking will constitute such wilful disobedience unless it be casual  accidental or unintentional   It is clear that Mr Morrison s affidavit does not  in terms  comply with the Order  A breach of an order will be considered deliberate if it is not found to be casual  accidental or unintentional  The onus remains on the party seeking to prove the contempt to prove that the alleged contemnor s conduct is not casual  accidental or unintentional citedHamilton v Whitehead   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

of the Order citedTesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass   UKHL       AC   It was not disputed that the respondent had knowledge of the terms of the Order  On the facts of this case  there can be no doubt
