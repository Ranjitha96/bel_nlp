Melbourne Limited     CLR   at    Prior to the sale of share agreement  there was no suggestion that SBC s rights would be abandoned citedSpassked v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The applicant relied on Spassked v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at   where Gyles J said that the parent subsidiary relationship in that case was such that the loans were  purely intra group arrangements with no external aspect  and many of the companies involved had  no external role at all   Thus the requisite connection or relationship between the outgoing and the earning of assessable income  was not to be inferred but must be positively established   However  in the present case SBAF certainly had an external role  It was a trading entity in its own right  albeit an unsuccessful one  and used the borrowed funds for working capital to pay the expenses of its business citedGP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The relevant taxpayer is the applicant  The focus is upon it and the use to which it put the borrowed funds  The Court is not concerned with SBC s purpose in advancing funds  GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       I conclude the answer to Issue   is  yes   Section         provides that a debt is forgiven if the debtor s obligation to pay the debt  is released or waived  or is otherwise extinguished  citedCraine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my opinion  the words of s     cannot be read down so as to require some express forgiveness  Waiver  for example  may be by conduct  it is an intentional act done with knowledge whereby a person abandons a right by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right  Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Grundt v Great Boulder Gold Mines Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    The expression  or otherwise extinguished  is wide and would cover an agreement  enforceable in equity  not to set up the cause of action in debt  McDermott v Black   HCA         CLR    SBAF was of course a party to the sale of shares agreement  After settlement of the sale of shares agreement and SBC s receipt of the purchase price from Tasman Group there is no way in which SBC could have recovered the debts previously owing by SBAF citedGrundt v Great Boulder Gold

could have recovered the debts previously owing by SBAF citedSandell v Porter   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Meredith  correctly in my view  identified the debtor s capacity to pay as a function of the resources which would be available  including assets which the debtor could realise in a reasonable time frame  and taking into account other liabilities  This approach is consistent with the classic definition of solvency in Sandell v Porter   HCA         CLR   at     I would therefore not accept Mr Hodgkinson s going concern basis   Mr Hodgkinson argued that a creditor valuing a debt in its own hands on a going concern basis will apply any payment against its oldest debt first  Therefore  he said  on Mr Meredith s figures  totalling SBC advances outstanding prior to each new advance meant that the distribution would be insufficient to repay any further advance after   January
