Chappell wrote much of the wording of the brochure  He wrote letters to the investors saying that Austcorp was the developer  While he may not have done this with any intention to mislead people  he did it to publicise the fact that Austcorp was the active parent company responsible for the Austcorp group s overall development activities throughout Australia  including that of the resort  Austcorp was prepared to allow a loose and ambiguous representation  connecting Austcorp with the development  to be made in the brochure  In my opinion  this is a case where it is clear that any Austcorp company which in fact had an association with the development could be taken to have published the brochure  Webb v Bloch     CLR   at     per Issacs J  see also Abigail v Lapin   UKPCHCA

Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Thus  s   of the Act states     The object of this Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and

Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Gleeson CJ said of the construction of s        When a court assesses an amount of loss or damage for the purpose of making an order under s     it is not merely engaged in the factual  or historical  exercise of explaining  and calculating the financial consequences of  a sequence of events  of which the contravention forms part  It is attributing legal responsibility  blame  This is not done in a conceptual vacuum  It is done in order to give effect to a statute with a discernible purpose  and that purpose provides a guide as to the requirements of justice and equity in the case  Those requirements are not determined by a visceral response on the part of the judge assessing damages  but by the judge s concept of principle and of the statutory purpose       The upshot in I   L Securities was the holding stated by Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ   I   L Securities   HCA         CLR   at      footnotes omitted    See also at       per Gleeson CJ  at     per McHugh J        T he question presented by s   of  the TP Act  is not what was the  sole  cause of the loss or damage which has allegedly been sustained  It is enough to demonstrate that contravention of a relevant provision of  that  Act was a cause of the loss or damage sustained    Original emphasis  A large number of apartments in the resort were sold after Mustara collapsed  Some were comparable with Ms Tan Bounkeua s apartment  The pattern that emerged after Mustara s collapse until about mid   was that market prices realised for apartments in the resort were generally greater than the purchase prices  In about mid   they became similar  However  considerable difficulty was experienced in achieving sales of quite a number of units  including Mr Owers   And  the number of properties which had been listed for sale  but not sold  had increased markedly since the turn of the market in mid    By mid   the market had turned down and almost all the properties in the resort were sold at a price less  and sometimes up to about   less  than their acquisition cost  Mr Dupont noted that the more recent sales results were in marked contrast to movements in median sale prices of apartments in Wyong Shire during the period between   and    He said that  although sale prices in the resort were slightly erratic  there was a general weighting indicating an increase in value of apartments in the resort of around     from   to the peak of the market in    In comparison  median values of ordinary residential units  without a restriction on use similar to that affecting the resort  in Wyong Shire increased by   in the same period  He said that the reduction in values in recent years was partly a result of over supply in The Entrance unit market  as well as a general softening of the property market due to interest rate rises  affordability and macro economic conditions citedAustralian Breeders Co Operative Society Ltd v Jones     ALR  In Australian Breeders Co operative Society Ltd v Jones     ALR   at     Wilcox and Lindgren JJ  with whom Lee J agreed on this point  at   noted that the trial judge  Davies J  found that taxation benefits  which applicant investors in a horse breeding syndicate had obtained  should be taken into account in reduction of damages for their losses up to the time at which they terminated the breeding partnership  However  in that case  Davies J had refused to make an allowance for those taxation benefits in relation to the years of income after termination and awarded compensation on the basis that those damages not be taxable in the hands of the applicants  There was no issue in the appeal as to the question of taking into account taxation benefits discussedBanco de Portugal v Waterlow   Sons Limited   UKHL       AC  Austcorp argued that it was unreasonable for the applicants not to have sold because the market was apparently rising when they realised that the representations had been falsified on Mustara s collapse  I reject this argument  It seeks to have things both ways  when Austcorp itself created the difficulty for the applicants  In Banco de Portugal v Waterlow   Sons Limited   UKHL       AC   at   Lord Macmillan tellingly observed that it was often easy  after an emergency had passed  to criticise the steps which had been taken to meet it  but that such criticism did not come well from those who themselves had created the emergency  He said     The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures  and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken  Although his Lordship spoke of the principle apposite to an action for damages for a breach of contract  I am of opinion that his remarks also apply to an action to recover loss or damage under s    That principle accords with the statutory purpose  It would be unreal to argue that every purchaser who had been misled  as the present three applicants claim  into buying an apartment in the resort should have put their property on the market in   for sale  The market would have been flooded as it was from   onwards  In my opinion  Mr Owers acted reasonably in his decision to offer the property for sale when he did and the steps he took in the difficult situation in which he found himself      Ms Tan Bounkeua s positionappliedBarton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAustcorp argued that it could not be liable for Mr Walker s or PRD s conduct in distributing the brochure or leaflet or making the representations in the promotional material simply because of its involvement in their preparation or printing  It contended that Saatchi   FCR at       supported this argument  Nothing that Moore and Mansfield JJ said there suggested that a promoter or principal  as opposed to an advertising agency that was an independent contractor  could not be liable in circumstances like the present  Nor does any delay between Austcorp s design of the brochure and leaflet  and their dissemination to the applicants prevent Austcorp being held to have made the representations complained of  Austcorp s conduct  when viewed as a whole  taking account of all the surrounding circumstances  brought about what it wanted  namely that the promotional material would be given to persons in the position of the applicants and that they would be induced to purchase an apartment  Barton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     per Bowen CJ  Beaumont and Wilcox JJ  PRD and Mr Walker  as much as Austcorp s subsidiaries  were intermediaries in Austcorp s marketing plan  Barton   FCR at   discussedBenlist Pty Ltd v Olivetti Australia Pty Limited   ATPR p   It is a question of fact whether a disclaimer or a contractual provision modified the antecedent or other conduct as Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ illustrated in Butcher   CLR at         in discussing what Burchett J had said in Benlist Pty Ltd v Olivetti Australia Pty Limited   ATPR p    at    In both those cases there were disclaimers in marketing material  Burchett J said     It has been held on many occasions that the perpetrator of misleading conduct cannot  by resorting to such a clause  evade the operation of  the Act   Of course  if the clause actually has the effect  of  erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct  the clause will be effective   not by any independent force of its own  but by actually modifying the conduct   However  I should think it would only be in rare cases that a formal disclaimer would have that effect         In the present case  the suggestion of the suitability of the building for strata title conversion might continue to influence the mind of a prospective purchaser notwithstanding his awareness of the existence of a disclaimer clause  which did not single out the particular representation  but purported to apply generally to every detail stated in the investment report  If it were permissible to avoid the operation of  the Act  by such a clause  it would be all too easy to make representations in the confidence that they would be acted upon  and then withdraw them in the confidence  equally important for the securing of the desired business  that the withdrawal would not be acted upon     emphasis in bold added applieddiscussedBlatch v Archer   EngR         Cowp  Austcorp submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the applicants for failing to call their solicitors  Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR     Blatch v Archer   EngR         Cowp    Austcorp argued that the applicants could and should have called the solicitors who acted for them on the transactions and that their failure to do so could be used  not only to support the proposition that the solicitors  evidence would not advance their cases but also to suggest that they had not discharged their onus of proof  It that it was within the applicants  power to call their solicitors and their evidence should be assessed as Lord Mansfield CJ described in Blatch   Cowp at      i t is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was within the power of one side to have produced  and in the power of the other to have contradicted  citedBraverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu

promotion and sale of developments in which it had an interest was a fundamental business activity of Austcorp  That conduct was quintessentially of a trading and commercial character  It included

important to assess whether a misrepresentation was an operative cause of the decision of a person to enter into a contract  Ordinarily  a person who has made a false representation is under a duty to correct it before the representee acts to his or her detriment in reliance upon it  This is so in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation as Lord Reid explained in Briess v Woolley   AC   at    Equally  in cases of unintentional contraventions of s   of the Act  a representee who relies on an uncorrected misleading representation  even where the representor does not know of the facts which make the representation incorrect  is entitled to relief under Pt VI of the Act  Campomar   CLR at      Whether something is a cause of something else is ultimately a question of fact although it can involve considering and applying difficult value judgments  This representation was false too  Mustara  itself  had no qualifications in the conduct or operation of hotels or resorts and was wholly reliant on its connection with Pacific International Hotels  Mustara was a corporate shell and had never traded  It had no financial substance independent of Pacific International Hotels  limited support in cl     and what it might earn in the future from operating the resort  Moreover  Mustara was not a subsidiary of Pacific International when each of the applicants entered into the lease and  with the exception of Ms Tan Bounkeua  when they entered into their contracts to purchase  Austcorp failed in its duty to correct this representation to Ms Tan Bounkeua after it had become falsified on   December   when Mustara was taken over by Mr Wong s group  cf  Briess   AC at    Representation  d  the entity that would lease the apartments in the resort was a leading manager of resort and apartment As I have found Mustara was not a leading manager of resorts and apartments  And  after   December   it was not a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels  Therefore  the representation was false by the time each of Ms Tan Bounkeua and Mr Owers acted on it by completing their contracts  Mr Wong s group were financers  not resort or hotel operators  And cl     significantly limited the financial responsibility of Pacific International Hotels in respect of Mustara  Thus  there was a real separation between the two so that Mustara could not be said to be the same entity as Pacific International Hotels  Had they known the true position created by cl     neither Mr Owers nor Ms Tan Bounkeua would have regarded the two companies  in a lay sense  as the same entity  As I have found  they would not have been troubled  and would have regarded Mustara and Pacific International Hotels as one entity  if there were no limitation of the latter s responsibility for Mustara s financial commitment to them as found in cl     of the lease  Of course  as a matter of law the two companies were different legal persons  Ms Tan Bounkeua was not told of the change of Mustara s relationship to Pacific International Hotels following her entery into the contract  when the representation had been substantively accurate  In fact  at the time Mr Owers entered into his contract and at the time he and Ms Tan Bounkeua completed  Mustara was not a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels  Thus  this representation was also false  Representation  e  the purchase of an apartment in the resort would be an outstanding investment with no hidden risksdiscussedappliedButcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAustcorp was the guiding hand and ultimately benefited from what its subsidiaries did  It argued that its conduct vis a vis its subsidiaries should be viewed as akin to a real estate agent who passes on the vendor s instructions  I reject that argument  Austcorp did not confine itself to communicating what its subsidiary said  did or represented  without adopting or endorsing it  cf  Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at         per Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ  To the contrary  the reality was that the subsidiaries were Austcorp s vehicle for realising its investment in the project  The subsidiaries acted as Austcorp caused them to act  While each of Austcorp and its subsidiaries was a separate legal person  acting through the individuals who were employees of Austcorp  all acted in dual capacities  cf  Hamilton v Whitehead   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Wilson and Toohey JJ  The activities of each member of the Austcorp group involved in the development and marketing of the resort were interlocking and Austcorp controlled each of them  cf  NSW Mutual Real Estate Fund Ltd v Brookhouse   FCA         FLR   at   per Franki J    per St John J    per Deane J  The brochure was a document prepared for distribution to the public  but in circumstances where particular members of the public would read it and  as a consequence  be interested in pursuing the  prime investment opportunity  which it promoted  In Butcher   CLR at         Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ discussed the principles to be applied where an alleged misrepresentation is made to a particular individual  even though the individual is one of a class of other persons to whom the same representation may have been made  They held that even though a representation may have been made to a class of persons  in a case like the present it is the individuals who claim to have been mislead and the person by whom they claim they were mislead whose relationship must be examined  The applicant for relief must establish a causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss that is claimed  They said that this depended on analysing the conduct of the alleged wrongdoer in relation to the applicant alone and continued   Butcher   CLR at          So here  it is necessary to consider the character of the particular conduct of the particular agent in relation to the particular purchasers  bearing in mind what matters of fact each knew about the other as a result of the nature of their dealings and the conversations between them  or which each may be taken to have known  Indeed  counsel for the purchasers conceded that the mere fact that a person had engaged in the conduct of supplying a document containing misleading information did not mean that that person had engaged in misleading conduct  it was crucial to examine the role of the person in question  And  Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ observed that it was relevant to consider the circumstances of the representor  Butcher   CLR at      Here  the claim against Austcorp was not alleged simply to be that it passed on to PRD and Mr Walker or through him to the applicants information from a vendor  Rather  the applicants alleged that Austcorp itself engaged in the conduct of making the representations to them through the promotional material  including what Mr Walker told them   In June   Mr Walker had written to Mr Chappell saying that  the guaranteed return on investment is a prime consideration to prospective purchasers   And  Mr Chappell agreed with that assessment based on his then experience in selling property over nearly three decades  Mr Chappell considered a guaranteed return on an investment was obviously attractive to potential purchasers and sent a message to them that their investment was secure  He said that  based on his experience  he held the view in   that marketing an investment as having a guaranteed return was a very powerful and forceful means of marketing  He acknowledged that one reason why it was attractive to investors to have a guaranteed return was because it told the investor that whatever happened in the market they would get the guaranteed return  even if there were some unforeseen circumstance  I accept that evidence  Before the brochure s wording was settled  Austcorp had used Coudert Bros  solicitors  to discuss with ASIC the use of the word  guarantee  and  net return  p a  guaranteed ten years minimum lease  in an earlier form of marketing of the resort  With Mr Hung s approval  Coudert Bros had told the Commission  in August   that the word  guarantee  was often used colloquially simply to mean  assured   a sure thing   They told the Commission that  in a strict sense  the return was guaranteed  That was because the lease which was accepted from each purchaser would provide the agreed percentage return in the amount of the rent identified by the contract  being   of the purchase price  payable each year   The Commission was told that  the rent  as with all lessee obligations  is guaranteed by Pacific International Hotels Pty Limited  although Coudert Bros did not mention that guarantee was limited to a maximum of   months of the initial rent  Coudert Bros addressed a concern of the Commission about a sticker that asserted a net guaranteed return with a   year minimum lease saying     Further the return is guaranteed  assured  in the colloquial sense  The rent payable is a predetermined amount in no way dependant on the serviced apartment business of others      We suggest there is no sense in which the  sticker  can be seen as making a claim which is not backed up on sale  In Butcher   CLR at     Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ observed that it was a matter of common experience that questions of title to land could be complex  both legally and factually  Dealing with legal complexity was the role of solicitors  acting  where appropriate  on the advice of other specialists  such as surveyors  The question in that case was whether purchasers were entitled to rely upon a diagrammatic plan of the land being sold in a brochure prepared by a real estate agent  The brochure contained an express disclaimer by the agent of any belief in  or guarantee of  the accuracy of the information in it  Their Honours held that the brochure  read as a whole  in effect told the purchasers to rely upon their own enquiries and that it would then be plain to a reasonable purchaser that the agent was not the source of the information alleged to be misleading  They said that the agent there did not purport to do anything more than pass on information supplied by another or others and expressly  as well as implicitly  disclaim any belief in the truth or falsity of that information  Butcher   CLR at          Their Honours also observed that in a situation where a purchaser was intending to make use of statements or representations made in a brochure before entering into an important transaction  it was not inappropriate to look closely at the contents of the brochure before deciding whether a particular representation was made and by whom  Butcher   CLR at      In his dissenting judgment  McHugh J also said that in determining whether a contravention of s   has occurred  the task of the Court is to examine the relevant course of conduct as a whole  by reference to the alleged conduct in the light of the relevant surrounding facts and circumstances  He observed that the Court was not confined to examining a document  relied on as being the conduct or conveying a representation amounting to the conduct alleged to have contravened s     in isolation  saying that the Court      must have regard to all of the conduct of the corporation in relation to the document including the preparation and distribution of the document and any statement  action  silence or inaction in connection with the document  Butcher   CLR at      Austcorp submitted that the effect of Butcher   HCA       CLR   was that whatever had been pleaded as the cause of action by an applicant or plaintiff  the Court nonetheless had to look outside that  at all of the conduct of the respondent or defendant corporation to determine whether or not a contravention of s   had occurred  However  here  this issue does not arise because Austcorp had pleaded expressly the need to do so  It pleaded  in its defence  that the consideration of what was represented or not disclosed to the applicants by the brochure needed to be considered in the context of the applicants  actual knowledge and the knowledge of those acting on their behalf as to the nature and character and investments proposed  including in the particular apartment in the resort  the nature and character of the brochure and the entire course of dealings between the applicants  and their advisors in relation to the nature and characteristics of an investment in an apartment in the resort including the contract of sale and  where relevant  a disclosure statement  Austcorp asserted that when viewed as a whole  assuming that it had been involved in the making of the representations alleged  its conduct could not be described as misleading or deceptive  This was because the applicants could be expected to have a solicitor act for them and advise them as to the terms of the contract for sale  including the lease and the disclosure statement  thus disabusing them of any misconception which may have been generated by reading the brochure by itself  I am of opinion that on the evidence here the mere fact that the contract may have set out the full terms and conditions of the relationship which was to exist between the purchaser and the various parties with whom it was proposed the purchaser would enter into a relationship  the vendor  Landillo  the lessee  Mustara  and guarantor  Pacific International Hotels  cannot  of itself  be enough to break a chain of causation from representations or impressions made by the brochure  Obviously  context is critical  But where the method for inducing persons to enter into consideration of a business proposition is to make assertions and valuations of the proposition in the form in which the brochure was expressed  a person who promotes the sale through the brochure cannot complain if a purchaser takes the promoter at his word  The whole point of having the brochure was to make people interested in the commercial proposition of the purchase of an apartment in the resort  What was the commercial proposition if not a promise or assurance that that the investment would return  p a  net for   years to the purchaser  And  lest the intending purchaser might think otherwise  he or she was assured by the statement that  its hard to imagine a real estate investment offering so much  From day one your return will be a guaranteed  p a    It is a question of fact whether a disclaimer or a contractual provision modified the antecedent or other conduct as Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ illustrated in Butcher   CLR at         in discussing what Burchett J had said in Benlist Pty Ltd v Olivetti Australia Pty Limited   ATPR p    at    In both those cases there were disclaimers in marketing material  Burchett J said     It has been held on many occasions that the perpetrator of misleading conduct cannot  by resorting

have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests  What is reasonable will of course depend on all the circumstances  The issue for consideration is whether any contravention of s   has arisen by the conduct of the promoters in putting forward the brochure and leaflet and authorising Mr Walker to speak as he did consistently with

venture promoted  In Campomar   CLR at     Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Callinan JJ emphasised the need to enquire why any misconception had arisen in the mind of the person claiming have been misled or deceived  A sufficient nexus must exist between the conduct complained of and the misconception or deception  Austcorp argued that the nexus was  in effect  broken because the contract was a legal document which set out with considerable precision and at length the actual relationship that would exist if a person entered into the contract and the lease  For example  it argued that it was not reasonable for a person in the position of Ms Tan Bounkeua not to have had a solicitor advising her and that  had she done so  the solicitor would have broken the chain of causation  even if he or she negligently failed to advise the purchaser of the provisions of cl     or the existence of Mustara  I discuss this specific issue below  See      Gibbs CJ observed in Puxu

austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe significance of this method of doing business  which had a number of practical attractions to Austcorp as Mr Tan explained  is that third parties with whom it dealt may not always have been aware of the underlying web of relationships  Austcorp was the apparent contracting and paying party  The invoices were addressed to and paid by it  But more significantly  the various individuals acting for Austcorp  were in fact its actual officers or employees and gave people with whom they dealt their personalised Austcorp business cards  Hence  Mr

obiter dicta   Cummings   FCR at      Evidence of reasonable grounds may be established by evidence other than that of the persons who are alleged to have made particular representations as to a future matter  Indeed  as in so many other areas  a court may find the overall probabilities to which the circumstances of a given case give rise  the background to it and the conduct of parties prior to conversations taking place as providing better guides to whether or not they had particular states of mind or whether particular factors existed which would establish evidence of something such as reasonable grounds  It was the overall circumstances of the case which enabled his Honour to say  in relation to both Mr Leckie and Mr Lewis  that each genuinely believed the encouraging assertions which his Honour found them to have made  If one changes the exercise to an inquiry  not into genuine or honest belief  but into whether there were reasonable grounds  it is again the overall circumstances of the case which will provide more reliable guidance than would oral evidence on the part of interested parties  I have considered the overall circumstances of what Austcorp did and the information which it had at the time of making the representations  I am satisfied that Austcorp did not have reasonable grounds for making any of the representations as to future matters  As Sheppard

inference may be rebutted  for example  by showing that the representee  before he entered into the contract  either was possessed of actual knowledge of the true facts and knew them to be true or

Downey   QCA   at   per Keane JA  So  the confidence which the brochure exuded could not reasonably have been understood as boundless or applicable in all circumstances  The applicants relied on the analysis by Keane JA in Downey   QCA   at       where he found that a representation that an established hotel operator  Radisson  considered the project was a guaranteed success would have been easily seen as of importance to an investor  The role which a representation can play in the formation of a state of mind is critical  The brochure was designed by Austcorp  with the considerable expertise of Mr Chappell and Mr Hung with a view to attracting investors  Indeed  it was critical for Austcorp s purposes to obtain sales of the remaining   of the units referred to in the brochure to make their project a commercial success  The brochure was not a mere puff intended to be treated by purchasers or potential purchasers as something which could be put to one side when the contract for sale arrived  The brochure  rather  was expressed in unqualified  optimistic and prospective terms  It was intended to lead investors to make a decision to purchase based on the belief that the investment was a sound one  I agree with the observations of Keane JA in Downey   QCA   at        In the ordinary course of commercial behaviour some results are guaranteed and some are not  The concept of  guaranteeing a result  is not something that is usually associated with puffery but with the making of a firm commitment for which responsibility will be taken  The phrase  guaranteed

against anything that might happen in the market  the use of an apparently reputable hotel operator s name  Pacific International Hotels  in connection with the promise of a   p a  return for   years

as organisations  rather than particular identified corporate identities  included the hotel operator  as  Pacific International  and a developer   Austcorp   Ordinarily  a statement which involves the state of mind of the maker will convey the meaning expressly  or by implication  that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when it was made and  commonly  that there was a basis for that state of mind  Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers Limited   FCA         FCR   at   per Bowen CJ  Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ  RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited   FCA         FCR   at     per Beaumont and Spender JJ  with whom Davies J generally agreed at     discussedGluckstein v Barnes   AC  Of course here  I must consider the impression that the words of the brochure made upon each of the applicants  in light of the context  including the fact that there would be a contract sent to them or their solicitor  And  in the ordinary course it could be expected that a solicitor would act  although in Ms Tan Bounkeua s case that did not eventuate  But a solicitor is not a commercial advisor  Having set out to assure people that the guaranteed return would be earned  it ill lies in the mouth of Austcorp to say that they should not have believed that when they entered into the contract because their solicitors should have disabused them of those impressions  I reject that submission  It is reminiscent of Lord Macnaghten s characterisation of a similar argument in Gluckstein v Barnes   AC   at     where he said     But then  says Mr  Gluckstein   there is something in the prospectus about  interim investments  and if you had only distrusted us properly and read the prospectus with the caution with which all prospectuses ought to be read  and sifted the matter to the bottom  you might have found a clue to our meaning  You might have discovered that what we call  interim investments  was really the abatement in price effected by purchasing charges on the property at a discount   My Lords  I decline altogether to take any notice of such an argument  I think the statement in the prospectus as to the price of the property was deliberately intended to mislead the shareholders and to conceal the truth from them  The norm of conduct provided by s   is intended to require corporations to adhere to an appropriate level of behaviour in trade or commerce  Austcorp was prohibited from engaging in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead in this trade or commerce  namely the sale of apartments in the resort  The brochure was not a mere puff  The statements about the resort  the quality of the investment and the prospective earnings to be achieved from it were advanced as serious business propositions  Moreover  it is difficult to see how the brochure could have been read in any other way  If  on examination  the nature of the project or the returns promised in the brochure were overstated or not supported  the investor would not proceed  He or she would then mistrust the promoters  I have had regard to Austcorp s arguments in assessing each applicant s evidence  Of course  each transaction was important to the individual applicants  But Austcorp was asserting that other people  solicitors  or other factors  the full contractual documentation and  where relevant  the disclosure statement when read and properly understood  would undo completely the very state of mind its marketing activities had induced by conveying the representations complained of so as to induce the applicants to proceed  It is not an attractive argument  Marketing messages are simple and powerful  While legal fine print may be contractually decisive  it is usually far less interesting to a lay person  The six lucid pages of the brochure  and the equally lucid other promotional material  had no fine print or qualifications  Austcorp was using the same forensic tactic as Mr Gluckstein did a century ago it was asking the applicants to read  in court in   with distrust and cynicism what it wanted them to read  believe and act on in late   and    Lord Macnaghten s rejection of that approach remains entirely apposite  Gluckstein   AC at      In effect  Austcorp in its defence asserted that it should not have been taken at its word in the representations it made to sell the apartments to the applicants  including Ms Tan Bounkeua  Austcorp s argument is no sounder than the unsuccessful promoter s in Gluckstein   AC at      The argument must fail  A person in Ms Tan Bounkeua s position was entitled to assume  as I find she was  that those who put forward the promotional material she received knew what they were saying in it and were telling her that an investment in an apartment in the resort was a sound one with the characteristics in the representations complained of  Of course  she would realise that the contract  when she received it  was a complex legal document  But there was nothing to alert her that the contract propounded a relationship with the significant differences between the representations complained of and her legal rights if she signed  Ordinarily a solicitor would explain the effect of the contract to his or her client  This might have led to Ms Tan Bounkeua being informed of the true position before she entered into the contract and lease  although  on the evidence before me  some solicitors did not highlight or inform their clients of the existence or effect of cl      The question remains why that true position was not in any of the promotional material discussedappliedGould v Vaggelas     CLR  In Gould v Vaggelas     CLR   at   Wilson J identified four principles which are frequently used as a practical

invested in another long term income producing property had he not been induced to purchase the apartment  I accept that evidence  Instead of borrowing the whole of the purchase price  he used initially   of his cash savings to pay the deposit  Ultimately  he borrowed   from his bank and paid about   of that to pay back into his other bank account  Thus  he borrowed about   of the   price

for apartments in the resort were no longer operative at the time of the more recent sales in evidence  Mr Tew s approach had a number of flaws which were exposed by his attempt to assess comparable properties outside the resort  He chose properties as his comparable sales in established four star holiday destinations  such as Nelson Bay  when they were not reasonably comparable  His principal choices were two resort apartments in the Landmark at Nelson Bay  However  unlike The Entrance as Mr Tew was aware  in   Nelson Bay had both about four or five established   star resorts together with a reputation for that class of accommodation and appropriate local restaurants for such a market  He said that he gave consideration to the income streams of the two Landmark apartments   and   he used as comparators for the two larger apartments of Mr Owers and Luciani Taldarmar  But  he said that he did not refer to their income streams in his reports because he used the direct comparison method  At the hearing  he said these two apartments      are the two most reliable  for his comparable sales analysis  Mr Tew agreed that a sample of two was not ideal to use as basis for a comparable sales analysis appliedHTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe applicants seek damages for their capital loss assessed as the difference between the price paid for their units and their true value at the time of the transaction  This is a common measure of damage in claims under s   of the Act where land has been acquired in consequence of a contravention of s   see HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       However  the rule is not inflexible or rigid and  as Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Heydon JJ went on to point out  the test depends on the difference between price and the real or fair or intrinsic value of the asset  as opposed to its market value  Astonland   CLR at          In Astonland   CLR         the Court indicated that subsequent events could be used to arrive at an assessment of the real value of an asset for the purposes of calculating compensation under s   of the Act in respect of a claim of overpayment at the time of acquisition  Events after the date of acquisition can be taken into account but when that is done care must be taken in distinguishing among possible causes of the decline in value of what had been bought  Thus  there is a fundamental distinction between causes inherent in the property acquired  and independent or extrinsic causes  To the extent that the latter causes have affected the value  then loss flowing from them would not have been caused by the inducement of the misleading or deceptive conduct  But if the value of the property acquired was always going to fall when some inherent cause began to operate  e g  when a competing property  not adverted to by the negligent valuer in performing the valuation for the acquisition  commenced operation  that would be indicative of the true value  Such a loss in the value was  accordingly  inherent in the nature of what was purchased namely  that it would decline in value because of the operation of the competing property in close proximity  Astonland   CLR at      Their Honours said that the rental levels and  therefore the value of  Astonland s property were doomed from the start because  so long as the construction of the neighbouring shopping centre continued to completion  the plaintiff s loss would be inevitable  In such a case the court is not limited to the assessment of risk of loss at the time of purchase      but is entitled to take account of how those risks had evolved into certainties at dates after the date on which the comparison of price and true value was being made  Astonland   CLR at        The Court continued        Figures worked out by analysing what willing but not anxious buyers and willing but not anxious sellers would agree on  without taking account of subsequent events  may correspond with market value  but they do not necessarily correspond with true value because the market can operate under some material mistakes  In particular  some material factor may not be apparent to it  A mistake of this kind  it seems likely  was present here  Though the market value on   April   was   and in July   it was   one matter was not apparent then which was apparent later  The trial judge found that   was  the value of the land more or less since it became apparent that tenants were largely unavailable except at minimal rentals   footnote omitted   That unavailability was an inevitable consequence of the Beach Road Shopping Centre once it was completed  but the perception of the likely effect of that completion was obscure in   and only became clearer from the latter part of   on  Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Heydon JJ considered an alternative approach to the assessment of damages under s    That approach was to allow a plaintiff to recover the purchase price of the asset less whatever was  left in its hands  Astonland   CLR at          They concluded that once the plaintiff had been induced to buy the property      at a time when it was perceived to be valuable  and was forced to retain it because it increasingly became to be perceived as being of declining utility and value  Astonland   CLR at      In such a situation the plaintiff s property was not a readily marketable asset  Austcorp pleaded that the claims were time barred because each applicant entered into the contract more than six years before the commencement of the proceedings  Austcorp also argued that the applicants had become committed to  first  the contracts which they had entered prior to   August   and  secondly prior to that date  to paying legal fees incurred and other costs  However  the applicants did not claim any damages in respect of transaction costs incurred before the registration of the strata plan  Austcorp argued that an applicant will be found to suffer loss immediately upon entering into a contract for the purchase of land if the true value of the land at that time is less than the contract price  Accordingly  it contended that the applicants  causes of action under s   of the Act accrued at that moment relying on Astonland   CLR at       and     per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Heydon JJ  In Astonland the plaintiff had relied on the advice of a valuer before entering into a contract to purchase an income producing shopping arcade  The valuer advised that the construction of a new shopping centre nearby was not likely to affect adversely the arcade s existing retail tenancy levels  But  there was unchallenged evidence that on the date of the contract  and the date of completion  the land was worth less than the price payable or paid under the contract  That was because the valuer on whose valuation the plaintiff had relied advised the plaintiff incorrectly  Astonland   CLR at        Their Honours distinguished that situation from the category of case where a contingency  which might or might not come to pass  was hidden by a representor s conduct  They said that the plaintiff could have found out at once that the market value of the arcade was less than it had agreed to pay  Thus  the risk of the catastrophic effect on rent levels of the plaintiff s land to which the defendant valuer had not alerted the plaintiff  in fact  had already had an impact on the value of the plaintiff s land at the time of the purchase  Austcorp argued that on the applicants  cases  their apartments must have been worth less than the price paid for them at the dates of entry into the contracts for sale  I reject that argument  The applicants were not obliged to complete the contracts until after registration of the strata plan pursuant to cl   of the contract which provided the following        Completion of this contract is conditional on the consent of the Council to  and the registration of  the Strata Plan          If the Strata Plan is not registered by the Registration Date  defined as   December   either party may at any time after the Registration Date until registration rescind this contract by written notice to the other  citedJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA

 Austcorp argued that the applicants could and should have called the solicitors who acted for them on the transactions and that their failure to do so could be used  not only to support the proposition that the solicitors  evidence would not advance their cases but also to suggest that they had not discharged their onus of proof  It that it was within the applicants  power to call their solicitors and their evidence should be assessed as Lord Mansfield CJ described in Blatch   Cowp at      i t is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was within the power of one side to have produced  and in the power of the other to have contradicted  followeddiscussedKaredis Enterprises Pty Ltd v Antoniou     FCR  In Wardley   CLR at   Mason CJ  Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ explained the distinction between detriment  in a general sense  and damage suffered on entry into an agreement induced by a misrepresentation which is  or proves to be  to an applicant s disadvantage  The applicant will sustain a detriment in a general sense because the agreement subjects him  her or it to obligations and liabilities which exceed the value or worth of the benefits which it conferred on that person  But such a detriment will not necessarily amount to more than a contingency of future loss  In general  it is only when the contingency is fulfilled that an applicant will be found to have suffered loss or damage sufficient to infringe his  her or its economic interests for the purposes of an action under s   Wardley   CLR at    It is self evident that the applicants would not have been able to sue for damages in respect of the losses they claim here before they completed or were legally bound to complete their contracts  Risk of loss is not actual loss  The mere entry into the contract did not  of itself  require each applicant to complete it since that obligation would only arise  or be able to be enforced by or against the applicant

J agreed at  C  see too at  E  held that where a lessee had been induced by the lessor s misrepresentations as to takings into entering into a lease  the question for limitation purposes was

Telegraph Limited   AC  After all  the intended market for this investment were people holidaying at The Entrance who were attracted to walk into PRD s office at the site  as each of the applicants here did  These applicants were ordinary members of the public  not professional landlords or real estate investors or developers  They were the very class of persons who were intended to be attracted by the brochure viz  namely the kind of investor who would be looking for a return in something which it was hard to imagine could be offered at that level  In another context  to do with the law of defamation  Lord Devlin once observed tellingly in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Limited   AC   at    and see also Mirror Newspapers Limited v Harrison   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan J     A man who wants to talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also fire  but it can be done  One always gets back to the fundamental question  what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary man  you cannot make a rule about that     emphasis added Just as the ascertainment of whether a particular representation was made to a representee  or any other issue concerning the meaning of words  the task of evaluating whether s  A  applies to a representation requires the Court to ascertain the meaning conveyed by the words in the context  There can be no prescriptive rule that any particular form of expression must be  or not be  a representation with respect to a future matter  cf  Lewis   AC at   per Lord Devlin  And  for the purposes of evaluating the issues arising under s  A   in a case like the present  the understanding of each applicant is crucial  First  the representation objectively must be capable of being characterised as made with respect to a future matter  Secondly  the applicant must have understood it in that way  Thirdly  if the applicant did understand the representation to be with respect to a future matter  he  she or it will need to establish that  understood  in that way  he  she or it suffered loss of damage  by  the contravening conduct under s    Section  A recognises that representations with respect to a future matter can be objectively misleading or deceptive if the prediction turns out in due course to be wrong  If s   operated in that unqualified way  because of the consequence of future error it would create liability for every representation about future matters  however responsibly the representation may have been made at the time  So  s  A ordinarily affords a representor an important protection in making such a wrong prediction if  when making it  the representor had reasonable grounds for doing so citedMaurici v Chief Commissioner of State

course  with which to make his comparisons  even though there was no apparent justification for doing so  He made no allowance in his valuation as at   for actual and pending competing development at The Entrance  I am not prepared to accept his evidence as being reliable  see Maurici v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Callinan JJ  I consider that it indicates that Mr Tew did not select appropriately the properties which he used to arrive at or support his valuations  His approach did not identify properties that reasonably assist in indicating values of a comparable kind to those in the resort  In addition  because the apartments in the resort were purchased for the  or a  purpose of earning investment returns  I am of opinion that Mr Dupont s approach is generally to be preferred  Austcorp criticised Mr Dupont s methodology in his valuation according to known factors  It argued that the method produced a different value depending on when the exercise was done and that he had arbitrarily selected an unspecified date in   and an unreasoned sale price for the purposes of preparing this valuation  I think there is force in these criticisms  Mr Dupont made a calculation of the   net present value of cash flows from each applicant s apartment  But he said that in order to assess the apartments  values based on events that became known after their purchases  it was necessary to take into account both the actual income they guaranteed from   to   and the apartment s  potential value at today s date   Those potential values were  in the case of Mr Owers    as compared to a   purchase price in   Luciani Taldarmar    as compared to a purchase price of   in   and   for Ms Tan Bounkeua  the same as her purchase price in    His valuation was made in March    Mr Dupont gave no basis explaining how he arrived at those potential values for three properties on this assumed basis  Mr Dupont s failure to set out in full his reasoning process for selecting the potential values which he put into his value according to known factors calculation undermined the alternative methodology he adopted  I am not satisfied that this was an appropriately explained or reasoned methodology and I reject it citedMcGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Limited   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au

Naturalcare   FCR at     per Emmett J and        per Allsop J  That throws back onto an applicant the ultimate onus of proof to make good a claim that there were no reasonable grounds for making the representation  The Court then decides in the ordinary way  on the balance of probabilities whether the representee has established that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for making the representation  And  the representor must have had reasonable grounds for a representation as to a future matter at the time he  her or it made the representation  Australian Naturalcare   FCR at     per Allsop J  The quality of the evidence adduced by the representor under s  A  must be sufficient to be capable  if accepted  of amounting to providing the representor with reasonable grounds for making the representation at the time it was made  The Court must determine whether the evidence is  evidence to the contrary  so as to throw onto the representee the onus of proving that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for making the representation  Australian Naturalcare   FCR at         per Allsop J  In the context of a trial  the representee will not need to lead evidence in chief on the issue since he  she or it can rely on the deeming in the provision which is only displaced by the representor adducing evidence to the contrary  That evidence  if adduced  will lead to a case in reply  The Court still has to decide whether the evidence relied on as being  to the contrary  adduced by the representor is capable of amounting to reasonable grounds for making the representation  Then  if it is so capable  the Court assesses whether the representee has proved  on the whole of the evidence  that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for

losses that could be claimed as deductions against their income by the investor tax payers  But Lockhart J held that that was an irrelevant consideration for the purposes of an assessment of damages

applicants who gave evidence before me  the purpose of instilling in them the belief that the rent would be paid as a  sure thing   See    below   However  I am also satisfied that the applicants  were worldly enough to realise that no one would be able to give them a guarantee against the vicissitudes of the marketplace  No one for example could have predicted the shocking events of   September   or other economic events which might affect the Australian or international economies generally  It would be quite unreasonable for anyone to believe that a promoter of a resort hotel project in the Central Coast of New South Wales would be able to predict the outcome of the world economy over the succeeding   years and given assurance that nothing could happen which might so impact on the operations of the hotel that rent would not in any circumstances cease to be paid at the guaranteed rate  As Gibbs CJ said in Puxu   CLR at    see also Campomar     CLR at       per

set out with considerable precision and at length the actual relationship that would exist if a person entered into the contract and the lease  For example  it argued that it was not reasonable for a

previously hidden corporate veils  Mr Zantiotis discussed the guaranteed return and the lease with investors from time to time  In early December   he obtained a letter of advice from Chris Mitchell of Corrrs Chambers Westgarth  solicitors  about the application of Ch  C of the Corporations Law to Austcorp in relation to its involvement with the development of the resort  Mr Zantiotis was then unaware that on   August   the Australian Securities and Investments Commission   ASIC   had granted Landillo an exemption for offers made to investors before   January    Coudert Bros had acted on Mr Hung s instructions to obtain this  Mr Mitchell recommended seeking an exemption from ASIC  Mr Mitchell reviewed a number of documents including the contract  the lease and the brochure  Corrs Chambers Westgarth s letter referred specifically to the statement in the brochure that  your return will be a guaranteed   per annum   Mr Mitchell advised that this      seems inconsistent with the limitation of the guarantee under the Lease   Mr Zantiotis was not concerned by this inconsistency at the time  He took the view that when asked by potential investors about how the   return related to the lease and the guarantee for the   years that      I was always responsible enough to refer the contract and all its contents to their solicitors   I formed the impression that Mr Zantiotis was a fairly straightforward witness and that he chose this response to investors  questions to enable him to avoid giving them the direct answer  exposed in Mr Mitchell s letter  while giving them access

own carelessness in not engaging a solicitor was a cause of Ms Tan Bounkeua s loss  I am not satisfied that it was the only cause  As I have found  a solicitor might  but would not necessarily  have advised her about the existence and effect of cl      Although the representations were made in order to interest investors in purchasing apartments in the development  their message would be undone only if a solicitor in fact advised his or her client of the effect of cl      And the risk to Austcorp  if that happened  was that it might lose the benefit of the sale  Sydney Harbour Casino Properties Pty Ltd v Coluzzi   NSWCA   at       per Mason P  with whom Giles and Heydon JJA agreed on this point at   and    Moreover  had Ms Tan Bounkeua been informed before completion that Mustara had ceased to be a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels since she had entered into the contract  she would not have proceeded because that would have exposed her to risk of loss  The correctness of these representations depended on the nature of the  assurance  of the net rental return of   of the purchase price for   years   Mr Owers did not receive the leaflet so only representation  a  is relevant to his position   At the time of entering into the contracts each of the applicants understood that the way in which they would be paid the return was through their lease of their apartment to Mustara on terms that it pay the rent at the rate of   of the purchase price net of deductions for   years  The  assurance  came from this understanding and  in Mr Owers  and Ms Tan Bounkeua s cases  the connection that Mustara was a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels which guaranteed the performance of Mustara  In other contexts the word  guarantee  can have a range of connotations  but as Mason P observed in Coluzzi   NSWCA   at    Giles and Heydon JJA agreeing on this issue at     it can certainly include a firm assurance as to a state of affairs  Thus  since I have found that  when entering the contract and signing the lease  Mr Owers and Ms Tan Bounkeua were not aware of the nature and effect of cl     of the lease  limiting the guarantee  it was false to represent to them that payment of the rent for the entire term was  assured  in the sense that they understood the representations  That is  it made no difference to either of them that Pacific International Hotels was not the lessee if Mustara were its subsidiary and  in substance  Pacific International Hotels would stand completely behind Mustara  If that were the case then  as a matter of substance  the statements in the promotional material of the  security of a lease to Pacific International Hotels  would have been true  even though the technical legal mechanism of a lease to Mustara with a guarantee by its parent was utilised  They saw themselves dealing with  and receiving assurance from  the involvement of Pacific International Hotels for the lease of their apartments and the operation of the resort  But  that was not the true position  Mustara had ceased to be a subsidiary on   December    And  as they understood the position  if Mustara failed they could still look to Pacific International Hotels to honour the promise for the full   years  Because cl     of the lease qualified their entitlement to look to Pacific International Hotels for payment  one means by which Mr Owers and Ms Tan Bounkeua understood that the return would be assured  namely that Pacific International Hotels would be liable to pay it in full for the whole   year term  was falsified  Additionally  Austcorp s failure to correct the position in relation to Mustara not being a subsidiary of Pacific International also falsified the basis of the assurance  Representation  b  net rental return would be achieved through the lease of apartments to Pacific International Hotels for a term of   years with two   year options That was a key selling point  It worked on Mr Owers and Ms Tan Bounkeua  They understood that from day one for   years they would receive that return  The promise of a guaranteed return was a prime consideration for them  as Austcorp understood it used this as its marketing strategy based on the experts assessment of each of Mr Walker  in his letter of   June   Mr Chappell and Mr Hung  In Coluzzi   NSWCA   at   Mason P observed of a similar representation

because of cl     that the legal structure of the lease to the entity referred to as  Pacific International Hotels  and  Pacific International  in the promotional material would reflect these representations  Last  representation  e  was also predictive of the outcome of the investment  Its verification was dependent on what would transpire after the representation was made  The assessment

sign  the Court may find that he or she will not be bound by the contract or the effect of the signature  Toll   CLR at      One reason for this is that the effect of the misapprehension induced  or caused  by the fraud or misrepresentation may have caused the innocent party either not to advert to a subject matter in the contract  at all  or to understand it in a sense different to that induced

value arrived at by an ill informed market  The test was stated by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Crennan JJ in Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority   HCA         CLR   at       as     Value is determined by forming an opinion as to what a willing purchaser will pay and a not unwilling vendor will receive for the property   Spencer v The Commonwealth     CLR    In determining that value  there must be attributed to the parties a knowledge of all matters that affect its value  Those matters will include the predicted impact of future events as well as the experience of the past and the rates of return on other investments  As Isaacs J pointed out in Spencer v The Commonwealth     CLR   at    We must further suppose both to be perfectly acquainted with the land  and cognisant of all circumstances which might affect its value  either advantageously or prejudicially  including its situation  character  quality  proximity to conveniences or inconveniences  its surrounding features  the then present demand for land  and the likelihood  as then appearing to persons best capable of forming an opinion  of a rise or fall for what reason soever in the amount which one would otherwise be willing to fix as the value of the property   Emphasis added       The market for the property is  therefore  assumed to be an efficient market in which buyers and sellers have access to all currently available information that affects the property     final emphasis added I am of opinion that prior to recent times the market was operating in an inefficient manner  Initially  the market was created and affected  in part  by the misleading and deceptive representations  These attributed to apartments in the resort an aura of being good  solid investments with the prospect of a guaranteed return for many years  After Mustara s collapse  a substantial number of sales occurred at higher price levels which have not been sustained since    Even then  as Mr Dupont s analysis showed  from   to   the rise in sale prices for apartments in the resort was around   to   while the rise of   in Wyong Shire for that period was substantially greater  Thus there was some  but not a full  appreciation that the value of an apartment in the resort was not as good as in the general area  But the subsequent drop of prices to levels generally materially below the original purchase prices off the plan  demonstrates that the market was not operating efficiently before this later time  Mr Dupont concluded that by March   the value of apartments  based on the latest sales  had fallen to around   below their   level while median apartment prices in Wyong Shire had increased   in the same period  I accept that evidence  I am satisfied that the present level of prices reflects the true value now of the apartments  The consequence is stark  The real value of the applicants  original investments in comparison to similar property in the surrounding area has decreased markedly over the eight or more years since they entered into their contracts to purchase  That decrease and its very different direction to the significant increase in value of immediately surrounding properties were not explained by any evidence  I discount the suggestion made to Mr Owers of a concern that some costly remedial work may be needed for the resort  There was no evidence of what that was or of any effect on the value of the apartments  No expert referred to it and I am not satisfied that  whatever the basis of the concern conveyed to Mr Owers was  it affords any explanation of this marked decrease in the market price of apartments in the resort  It is because this extraordinary reduction in prices for apartments in the resort has occurred but has not been otherwise explained on the evidence  that I reject Mr Tew s direct comparison approach between other sales of properties in the resort and the applicants  apartments as an appropriate way of valuing them at an earlier time than the present  Those earlier prices  while genuine market prices  did not reflect the true value of the apartments  I find that the market was not then operating as an efficient market  cf  Walker Corporation   CLR at        It may be that the purchasers who paid increased prices for apartments in the resort from the time of Mustara s demise till the current trend emerged were acting under a misconception that there was a real prospect of capital growth  But  even then those prices were generally significantly less than the increase in median prices in the immediate area  This is a sure indication that the values in the resort were affected by some factor outside ordinary market forces  i e  by factors other than those bearing on the true value of the apartments  Significant  as opposed to normal market  capital growth was not a real possibility for these particular properties  They were in a resort with substantive restrictions on their use  either as a long term residence for their owners or when let short term to other individuals  They had to be part of a resort complex if they were to be likely to earn any shorter term significant investment return  But the actual operations of the resort have been desultory compared to what was necessary in order to support a net return paid by a lessee over   years of   of the purchase price  I am satisfied  having considered the evidence for myself  that the true value of the apartments in the resort at the time each applicant purchased is better reflected by reference to the current and more recent sale prices  Since these are materially less than the purchase prices some seven to eight years later  I am satisfied that each of the applicants acquired on completion of their purchase an apartment which was worth less than what was paid for it  I prefer Mr Dupont s adoption of a capitalisation approach as opposed to Mr Tew s comparable sales approach  However  the methodology each valuer used and his reasoning process do not enable me to adopt either s ultimate valuation using their respective approaches  The market in   and   ascribed values to apartments in the resort that were distorted by the effect of the misrepresentations  including the earlier assurances by Landillo of guaranteed returns of   then      before Austcorp s involvement  and finally  p a citedWalplan

Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhen a person claims to recover loss or damage under s   of the Act  the question of causation is whether he  she or it has suffered that loss or damage      by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of      here  relevantly  s    In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ  Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ said that the word  by  as used in s   clearly expressed the notion of causation without defining or elucidating it  They held that  in general  this required using the common law practical  or common sense  concept of causation unless the provisions of the Act operated to modify or supplement that concept  They said that where the claim under s   was to recover for loss or damage by misleading conduct consisting of misrepresentations done in contravention of s     as at common law       acts done by the representee in reliance on the misrepresentation constitute a sufficient connexion to satisfy the concept of causation  see too Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ          per Gummow and Hayne JJ          per Kirby J          per Callinan J  Until   August   the applicants had only a contingency of suffering loss depending on whether they completed their contracts  The economic interest of the applicants that would be infringed by Austcorp s misleading conduct was their obligation to complete their purchase consequent upon the registration of the strata plan and the loss of their right to rescind  Wardley   CLR at     per Mason CJ  Dawson Gaudron and McHugh JJ  Austcorp contended that this analysis overlooked the liability for legal costs before   August   that the applicants  other than Ms Tan Bounkeua  incurred  I reject that argument  First  Austcorp did not plead those matters as material facts  Secondly  the applicants in any event may have incurred a contingent liability for the legal costs of receiving advice on whether or not to enter into the contract  No solicitor rendered an invoice for those fees before   August   and  thus  the applicants had no legal obligation to pay those fees before that date  Had Mr Owers been advised not to enter into the contract or of the effect of cl     he would have followed the advice  There is no evidence whether he would have been charged by Mr Joseph for the advice  The question was not in issue  Next  Austcorp argued that Luciani Taldarmar had incurred legal fees of   as at   February    However  Shephard   Shephard  in the course of giving their fee estimate on that date advised  them that they would charge that amount for acting on the purchase  Shephard   Shephard only invoiced that sum on   December   being the day when the contract was completed  On   February   Shephard   Shephard had asked only for a sum of   on account of anticipated immediate disbursements  I am not satisfied payment of this sum  if it were paid  would amount to loss or damage  since it was sought to enable the solicitors to investigate and advise upon whether the applicants should go ahead with the purchase by binding themselves to a contract  That is  the expense would have been incurred in investigating whether the applicants could rely on Austcorp s representations  The applicants  claim was for damage caused by their entry into contracts which they became obliged to complete only on   August    That was the first occasion of any relevant infringement of the applicants  economic interests  for they were then legally obliged to pay the price which the wrongdoer  misrepresentor  had misled them to agree to pay  Wardley   CLR at    In Wardley   CLR at   Mason CJ  Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ explained the distinction between detriment  in a general sense  and damage suffered on entry into an agreement induced by a misrepresentation which is  or proves to be  to an applicant s disadvantage  The applicant will sustain a detriment in a general sense because the agreement subjects him  her or it to obligations and liabilities which exceed the value or worth of the benefits which it conferred on that person  But such a detriment will not necessarily amount to more than a contingency of future loss  In general  it is only when the contingency is fulfilled that an applicant will be found to have suffered loss or damage sufficient to infringe his  her or its economic interests for the purposes of an action under s   Wardley   CLR at    It is self evident that the applicants would not have been able to sue for damages in respect of the losses they claim here before they completed or were legally bound to complete their contracts  Risk of loss is not actual loss  The mere entry into the contract did not  of itself  require each applicant to complete it since that obligation would only arise  or be able to be enforced by or against the applicant  once the strata plan was registered  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at             In Karedis Enterprises Pty Ltd v Antoniou     FCR   at  C D Burchett and Hill JJ  Sackville J agreed at  C  see too at  E  held that where a lessee had been induced by the lessor s misrepresentations as to takings into entering into a lease  the question for limitation purposes was       when was it that the loss which the  applicants  ultimately suffered  or a more than negligible part of it   was either ascertained by them or reasonably ascertainable   But  in any event  the relevant loss or damage that the applicants claimed under s   of the Act was that  by  Austcorp s contravention of s   they paid Landillo more for their apartments than they were worth  Wardley   CLR at        I am of opinion that Mr Owers and Ms Tan Bounkeau are not prevented by s   from recovering that loss The parties agreed  by the end of final address  the quantum of damages  before interest  that would be recoverable as expenditures incurred  other than the loss of value on the purchase price which I dealt with under the heading  Valuation  if the applicants succeeded except in two respects concerning Mr Owers  These were   a  whether he made a recoverable loss since  after paying   more than he earned in returns from the apartment  Mr Owers obtained taxation deductions which left him a net   better off   b  whether Mr Owers should recover damages on the   deposit that he paid from his bank account and did not borrow    a  Tax benefits In final address Austcorp accepted that up to   March   Ms Tan Bounkeua and Luciani Taldarmar had incurred agreed amounts that they would not have spent or become liable to pay as a result of their financing the acquisition of their apartments  Those amounts were agreed by the parties  expert accountant witnesses in a joint report  On this basis  Ms Tan Bounkeua had incurred a loss of   and Luciani Taldarmar had incurred a loss of    This recognised that those applicants had incurred these losses before taking account of income tax deductions or benefits which they obtained in consequence of their expenditures included in the total sums  The parties accepted that any taxation consequences for those applicants were not relevant to the amount of damages to which they were entitled  The individual applicants will have to deal with the taxation consequences of any award in due course followedWarwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd v Alpine Holdings Pty Ltd   WASCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  htmlI reject this argument  First  Austcorp was not a party to the contract or disclosure statement even if it were the puppet master behind them  Secondly  a corporation cannot engage in a contravention of s   of the Act and then seek to excuse itself from liability to relief being granted against it under Part VI on the basis that it  or another person  has sought to negate the effect of the contravention by provisions like cl   or the disclosure statement without  at least  making full  intelligible  and frank disclosure of the true position so as to negate its earlier contravention  Thirdly  in honest trade and commerce contractual exclusions like cl   and documents like the disclosure statement may have some effect  The courts have recognised that they may be given effect  depending on all the circumstances  as evidentiary of the complaining party s state of mind having been disabused of any relevant misleading or deceptive conduct  cf  Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd v Alpine Holdings Pty Ltd   WASCA         ALR   at           per Steytler P      per McLure JA and         per Pullin JA followedWatson v Foxman     NSWLR  Inevitably  each of the applicants who gave evidence and Messrs Chappell and Hung were giving an account of events that happened years before and about which they had not given much  if any  thought until recently for the purpose of this litigation  I agree with the caution expressed by McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman     NSWLR   at   concerning evidence of this kind  He said     Furthermore  human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons  and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time  particularly where disputes or litigation intervene  and the processes of memory are overlaid  often subconsciously  by perceptions or self interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said  All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then  again often subconsciously  constructed  All this is a matter of ordinary human experience  Austcorp argued that  to varying degrees  the applicants  oral evidence of their continuing reliance on the representations complained of at the time they executed or completed the contracts and leases should be discounted or rejected  It claimed that the important nature of the transactions and the fact that a solicitor could be expected to explain the contractual documents accurately  so as to dispel any misapprehension or misrepresentation  weighed against a finding that the representations complained of were relied on at all by the time of execution or completion  And  Austcorp argued that the failure of the applicants  other than Ms Tan Bounkeua  who had no solicitor  to call the solicitor acting for them was a powerful factor undermining the reliability of their evidence  Here  however  there is the objective evidence of the contents of the brochure and other promotional material  including the unchallenged  and inherently likely evidence of Mr Walker s repetition and reinforcement of its messages in his discussions with each applicant   There is no doubt that these conveyed the powerful messages of assurance and success of the investment contained in the representations  In general  these factors lend force to the applicants  claims that the representations were relied on by them at the time they entered into their contracts  completed them and executed their leases  I will  of course  consider each applicant s individual circumstances separately below  But  as a matter of ordinary human experience  powerful marketing messages tend to have a sustained effect  Although the representator did not remove the effect of the misrepresentations  I am satisfied that Mr and Mrs Di Giulio and Mr Luciani turned their mind to these questions and considered the advice from each of Mr Dunn and Mr Fullerton carefully before taking a considered but deliberate risk to proceed with the investment based on their own confidence in the outcome  This is a particularly apposite instance of the need for the exercise of caution  expressed by McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman   NSWLR at     in accepting evidence of persons claiming many years later to have been misled by representations in entering into a contract  Mrs Di Giulio was emphatic that she was not aware that the guarantee by Pacific International Hotels was limited to   months worth of rent as opposed to   years  She said     Well  there s a big difference from   years to   months  This was suppose to be a solid future investment  not something that was suppose to be for   months and we weren t told that at the time   It wasn t said here in the brochures or the leaflet  it wasn t told by Warren Walker and  you know  our solicitors reassured us everything would be okay       When you say solicitors reassured you that everything would be OK  what are you referring to      That it would be a solid future investment to  you know  to carry on with that     emphasis added She denied that she was aware of the   months limitation and said     It wouldn t be logical to go into something that  s   months when you re thinking of a future investment  followedWebb v Bloch     CLR  Mr Chappell wrote much of the wording of the brochure  He wrote letters to the investors saying that Austcorp was the developer  While he may not have done this with any intention to mislead people  he did it to publicise the fact that Austcorp was the active parent company responsible for the Austcorp group s overall development activities throughout Australia  including that of the resort  Austcorp was prepared to allow a loose and ambiguous representation  connecting Austcorp with the development  to be made in the brochure  In my opinion  this is a case where it is clear that any Austcorp company which in fact had an association with the development could be taken to have published the brochure  Webb v Bloch     CLR   at     per Issacs J  see also Abigail v Lapin   UKPCHCA         CLR   at     per Lord Wright appliedYorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThus  it appears on the objective material here  that Austcorp was not involved in its dealings with third parties as a mere agent or conduit for a separate and disclosed  or undisclosed  principal  Its chosen method of doing business is likely to have made Austcorp a principal in many transactions it effected for the purposes of the project because it does not appear to have disclosed any intention to contract as an agent  When Mr Chappell or Mr Hung made decisions  wearing their Austcorp hats  their position was distinguishable from that of acting as an agent for an Austcorp subsidiary  In Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR   at   Mason ACJ  Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ said         even though a corporation acts honestly and reasonably  it may nonetheless engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive       That does not  however  mean that a corporation which purports to do no more than pass on information supplied by another must nevertheless be engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct if the information turns out to be false  If the circumstances are such as to make it apparent that the corporation is not the source of the information and that it expressly or impliedly disclaims any belief in its truth or falsity  merely passing it on for what it is worth  we very much doubt that the corporation can properly be said to be itself engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive    references omitted
