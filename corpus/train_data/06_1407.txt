Merck   Co Inc v Genrx Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toGeneral Tyre and Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co   RPC  The other English authority described by Lord Hoffman in Smithkline Beecham plc s  paroxetine methanesulfonate  patent as of unquestionable authority was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in General Tyre and Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co   RPC    A IPR    In that case the prior publications and patent concerned processes  or aspects of processes  for making a compound suitable for tyre treads by mixing synthetic rubber with oil and carbon black  The Court of Appeal indicated that if the prior inventor s publication contained a clear description of  or clear instructions to do or make  something that would infringe the patentee s claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee s patent  the patentee s claim would have been shown to lack the necessary novelty  The prior inventor may have had a different starting point  but if the prior inventor s instructions were carried out and inevitably result in something being made or done which would constitute infringement of the patentee s claim  the patentee s claim would have been anticipated  Australian authorities referred to by the parties  and judgments of Full Courts of this Court in particular  do not  in substance  suggest some other approach  Senior counsel for GenRx referred to passages in the joint judgment of Black CJ and Lehane J in Bristol Myers Squibb Co v F H Faulding and Co Ltd   FCA         FCR   in which their Honours spoke of it being sufficient that the prior publication gave a direction or made a recommendation or suggestion which could be followed by a skilled reader and that the direction  recommendation or suggestion might be implicit  However  those observations were made in the context of quoting with approval the often cited and evocative observations of the Court of Appeal in General Tyre and Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co that the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakable directions to what the patentee claims to have invented  A signpost  however clear  upon the road to the patentee s invention was not sufficient  The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted his flag at the precise destination before the patentee  The joint judgment of Black CJ and Lehane J has since been described in another recent Full Court judgment as deciding that the prior publication must contain  clear and unmistakable directions  Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd     IPR   at    To similar effect is the joint judgment of French and Lindgren JJ in another recent Full Court judgment Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co     ALR   at      In the present case  GenRx relies  in substance  on two aspects of the prior publication embodied in the Rosini patent  The first is that Rosini clearly directs the skilled reader to   amino  alendronic  acid and not   amino acid  I use the shorthand description used in GenRx s submissions which somewhat simplify what the patent says   In a table  Table   the reader is referred to some typical pharmaceutical formulations containing amino butan bisphosphonic acid which included capsules containing   amino acid  sodium salt  That is  a monosodium salt version of the acid  One experiment in Rosini  experiment   instructs the reader to undertake an experiment commencing with a quality of   amino acid to which is added a solution of sodium hydroxide  That is then decolourized  filtered and concentrated and kept in the cold for a period of three days under gentle stirring  This produces a crystalline solid which is washed with a small amount of cold water and then methanol  After this is dried at  deg C  a quantity of the monosodium salt of   amino acid is produced  GenRx led evidence that experiment   provided an illustration of how a monosodium salt of   amino acid might be produced  It also led evidence that if experiment   was followed but commencing with   amino acid rather than   amino acid as instructed  then AMT would be produced  That would come about and the trihydrate  AMT being a trihydrated monosodium salt of alendronic acid  would be created if a drying process as contemplated in experiment   was carried out though  as Merck points out  at a different temperature in different conditions  Merck also responded by pointing out that experiment   commences with   amino   hydroxy pentan     bisphosphonic acid which is not alendronic acid as that compound has an extra carbon atom  The evidence of GenRx  at its highest  was the opinion of Dr McClelland  Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto  that a person skilled in the art would follow the Rosini patent and be led directly and without difficulty to AMT  In addition  as GenRx points out  Merck successfully prosecuted infringement proceedings in the United States in   against a generic drug manufacturer which sought to sell and distribute a generic version of FOSOMAX containing  it appears  AMT  Merck did so relying on the Rosini patent  Judge Farnam of the United States District Court of Delaware concluded  a conclusion upheld on appeal in the Court of Appeals in   that the claim in the Rosini patent for   amino   hydroxybutane     bisphosphonic acid included both its free acid and sodium salt forms  His Honour s ultimate conclusion did not appear to depend on AMT being a monosodium trihydrate which  on evidence of the inventor of AMT  filed in a change of inventorship application in Australia in   is of significance therapeutically  Having regard to the criticisms made by Merck of GenRx s evidence  I doubt that GenRx is  in relation to the contention advanced in this interlocutory hearing that the invention in the patent in suit is not novel  in the territory marked out by the authorities referred to at     above  That is  GenRx s case of invalidity based on lack of novelty does not have strong prospects of success  Indeed it has  in my opinion  limited prospects of success  However  I doubt that it is open to me to proceed on the basis that there is not a serious question to be tried on the alleged invalidity of the patent particularly having regard to the findings of the Federal District Court in the litigation in the United States  I accept there is a serious question to be tried  There appeared to be no real issue about whether Merck would suffer damage as a result of GenRx importing into Australia the generic drugs containing AMT for distribution and sale  It appeared to be accepted  and probably necessarily so  that Merck would lose sales  possibly lose market share and other generics may quickly enter the market to compete with the FOSOMAX line of products  The clear picture of Merck s present significant market share  though already adversely affected by one generic in the market  Alendro  is likely to be quickly and substantially muddied by the entry of not only the generics to be imported by GenRx  but other generics which might be encouraged to follow GenRx s example  It also appeared to not be seriously contested that Merck will lose the commercial advantages of being in the market with the patented products when the patent expires  Changes may be made to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the near future and how they might impact on any loss suffered by Merck would be difficult to gauge  Undertakings are offered by GenRx and Symbion that neither will request a reduction of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme benchmark price until final judgment is given in these proceedings referred toHill v Evans     LJ Ch  NS   The principles to be applied in determining whether an invention was novel are comparatively settled  Courts both in Australia and the United Kingdom continue to view the principles as rooted in the decision of Lord Westbury in Hill v Evans     LJ Ch  NS     A IPR    That decision has recently been described by Lord Hoffman as a judgment of unquestionable authority  Smithkline Beecham plc s  paroxetine methanesulfonate  patent   RPC    Hill v Evans concerned disclosure and a patent for the purification of gas  Lord Westbury described the disclosure required in an earlier publication necessary to destroy a later patent for want of novelty  as involving a statement such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive  understand and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention could be made useful  His Lordship continued by saying that if something remained to be ascertained which was necessary for the useful application of the discovery  that provided sufficient room for another valid patent referred toMartin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd     ALR  During the course of the argument  counsel for GenRx referred to the decision of the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd     CLR   the judgment of Stephen J in Firth Industries Ltd v Polyglas Engineering Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   and observations in the fourth edition   of Meagher  Gummow and Lehane s  Equity  Doctrines and Remedies at    but  compare the commentary at   that  the old rule still obtains that only in the rarest of cases can a plaintiff obtain an interlocutory injunction against the infringement of the patent if the validity of the patent is put in issue   However I think it is clear  particularly having regard to the analysis of Gummow J in Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd     ALR   that Courts are now considerably less reticent about granting interlocutory injunctive relief in infringement proceedings  than may have been the case historically  In my opinion  this is a case warranting the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief  The balance of convenience favours it  Since at least November   when the solicitors acting for GenRx in these proceedings sought in writing  by reference to the same file number that the firm is using for this matter  details of Merck s patent from IP Australia  GenRx has known of Merck s rights under the patent in relation to AMT  A clear inference is available than since then  GenRx has set about making the commercial arrangements to import into Australia for sale and distribution drugs containing an active ingredient protected by Merck s patent in Australia  It has done so for the admitted purpose of gaining the commercial advantage of putting the second generic drug into the market  Those arrangements have included sponsoring the registration of the drugs on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and sponsoring the inclusion of one of them in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  The other branded drugs to be imported have been or are likely to be listed in that scheme on the application of other sponsors  There can be little doubt that GenRx has engaged in this conduct deliberately and with the knowledge that Merck s patent would be infringed unless it was able successfully to impeach its validity  It could have done so by revocation proceedings  It has not and now calls in aid the consequences of not being able to give effect to the arrangements now in place  That includes commercial loss to it and others and potentially  loss of reputation  For my part I give little weight to these complaints or concerns  As just discussed  GenRx has placed itself in this position quite deliberately and knowingly  To use the language of some of the authorities  its  eyes were wide open  referred toSmithkline Beecham plc s  paroxetine methanesulfonate  patent   RPC  The principles to be applied in

paroxetine methanesulfonate  patent as of unquestionable authority was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in General Tyre and Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co   RPC    A IPR    In that case the prior publications and patent concerned processes  or aspects of processes  for making a compound suitable for tyre treads by mixing synthetic rubber with oil and carbon black  The Court of Appeal

case considered by the House of Lords in Smithkline Beecham plc s  paroxetine methanesulfonate  patent concerned a patent for a compound  a crystalline salt  Somewhat simply described  the earlier publication concerned the same compound  though with different characteristics  and contained examples which  if skilfully manipulated in a way not described in the earlier publication  created the compound with the characteristics described in the patent in suit  The trial judge concluded the patent was not valid  This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal but reinstated by the House of Lords  Lord Hoffman gave the leading judgment  As noted in the headnote  the following emerges from his Lordship s judgment  The infringement had to be not merely a possible or even likely consequence of performing the invention disclosed by the prior disclosure  It had to be necessarily entailed  Anticipation necessary to defeat a patent for want of novelty required disclosure of subject matter which  when performed  must necessarily infringe the patented invention  It was the requirement that the performance of an invention disclosed in the prior art must necessarily infringe the patent which distinguished novelty from obviousness  The performance of an invention disclosed by the prior art would not infringe the patent but the prior art would make it obvious to a skilled person how he might make adaptations which resulted in an infringing invention  then the patent might be invalid for lack of inventive step but not for lack of novelty
