FCA  htmlcitedAustralasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Australia Meat Holdings     IR   Before moving to apply these considerations to the facts set out in the Primary Reasons  two further points must be made  First  the Court has a discretion whether or not to impose a penalty  s   of the WR Act and see also Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Australia Meat Holdings     IR   at   and Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union     IR   at    which considered the discretion to impose penalty under s   of the WR Act prior to substantial amendments to the WR Act in    In other words  there is no principle that a Court must  in all cases of proven breach  impose a penalty  Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union     IR   at   citedClothing   Allied Trades Union of Australia v J   J Saggio Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd     IR   Secondly  although there were technically two breaches by Telstra  one of the   Enterprise Agreement and one of the TRA  as the analysis of the facts in the Primary Reasons demonstrate  this is a case where the breaches arose out of substantially the same conduct  being conduct that  impose d  cumulative obligations or obligations that substantially overlap ed  cf Gibbs v The Mayor  Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona     FCR   at   and Clothing   Allied Trades Union of

Telstra Corporation Limited  ACN         FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   October   I concluded that Telstra had breached the   Enterprise Agreement by failing to pay Mr McDonald his previous rate of salary after he was redeployed to  and later accepted a redundancy package from  a lower paying position  see   FCA    the Primary Reasons   The facts resulting in that conclusion are set out in paras   to   of the Primary Reasons  I do not propose to repeat them  These reasons for decision should be read with the Primary Reasons  I adopt the same defined terms in these reasons for decision   The parties accept that as a result of the Primary Reasons  Telstra committed the following two breaches      a breach of cl     of the   Enterprise Agreement  by not paying Mr McDonald at the higher rate of pay after his redeployment in April   and    a breach of cl     of the TRA  by not paying Mr McDonald severance pay at the higher rate of pay after Mr McDonald took voluntary redundancy in October     The CEPU now seeks consequential relief for those breaches in the form of an imposition of a penalty under s   of the Industrial Relations Act    Cth   the IR Act   or s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the WR Act   and additional declaratory relief  The Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  citedCPSU  The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited     IR   The breach of cl     of the TRA is entirely reliant upon  and arises out of  substantially the same course of conduct as the primary breach  Gibbs v The Mayor  Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona     FCR    Accordingly  any penalty would be determined by reference to the  totality principle  CPSU  The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited     IR     Thirdly  in those circumstances  it is appropriate to determine the penalty by reference to the  totality principle  as described by Finkelstein J in CPSU  The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited     IR   at   and Textile Clothing   Footwear Union of Australia v Lotus Cove Pty Ltd   FCA   at     So much was conceded by the CEPU and by Telstra   The Court should not be concerned to reimburse an applicant for costs incurred in bringing the application by the imposition of a penalty under s   of the WR Act   The legislative policy of the WR Act in relation to costs is found in s   of the WR Act   which states that a party should not pay costs except in two prescribed circumstances  In light of this policy  it would be inappropriate to impose a penalty for the purpose of reimbursement  Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     ALR   at

Allied Services Union  No       IR   at   appliedFinance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     ALR   As the Primary Reasons demonstrate  the breaches arose out of a disputed and disputable construction of the   Enterprise Agreement and the TRA  Neither breach was flagrant  wilful or deliberate  Amendments to the WR Act increasing the penalty for breaches of industrial instruments arising out of unlawful industrial conduct indicate a legislative desire to deter and discourage such conduct  These changes in industrial law have led to general deterrence being referred to as the  most significant factor  in determining the applicable penalty  see Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     ALR   at      Where the unlawful conduct arises out of an arguable but erroneous construction of a relevant term  and the subsequent breach cannot be characterised as demonstrating a flagrant or wilful disregard for the agreement  this legislative purpose is not furthered by imposition of a penalty  In these circumstances  neither general nor specific deterrence is a significant factor weighing in favour of imposing a penalty  Moreover  Mr McDonald has been fully compensated for the loss suffered as a result of the breach  I do not consider that the circumstances in which the conduct took place warrant the Court exercising its discretion to impose a penalty on Telstra   The Court should not be concerned to reimburse an applicant for costs incurred in bringing the application by the imposition of a penalty under s   of the WR Act   The legislative policy of the WR Act in relation to costs is found in s   of the WR Act   which states that a party should not pay costs except in two prescribed circumstances  In light of this policy  it would be

CEPU referred to the following additional facts and matters which it described as  significant  in considering the imposition of a penalty      the need to maintain the integrity of the certified agreement      that the amount withheld from Mr McDonald was significant      that there was no contrition demonstrated by Telstra      the fact that the breach was not flagrant or wilful or

must be made  First  the Court has a discretion whether or not to impose a penalty  s   of the WR Act and see also Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Australia Meat Holdings     IR   at   and Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union     IR   at    which considered the discretion to impose penalty under s   of the WR Act prior to substantial amendments to the WR Act in    In other words  there is no principle that a Court must  in all cases of proven breach  impose a penalty  Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union     IR   at     Telstra submitted that no penalty  or alternatively that a  low range penalty  should be imposed  In support of those contentions  Telstra referred to the following facts and matters      there was no element of wilful or deliberate non compliance by Telstra      Mr McDonald s job was redundant and he was to be retrenched unless otherwise redeployed  Instead of retrenching Mr McDonald  Telstra accepted his request to redeploy him to a job more than two pay classification levels below his current employment  Telstra did not have to do so    Telstra accepted the redeployment of Mr McDonald on a genuine but mistaken belief that it was only required to pay Mr McDonald the lower rate of pay    the CEPU did not suggest that Telstra had any relevant  prior convictions   There is nothing to suggest that Telstra is disposed to contravene certified agreements to which it is a party  In those circumstances  no specific deterrence is relevant    Telstra is a very large employer with employees across Australia and has been bound by numerous awards and certified agreements over the years    a penalty would serve no remedial purpose  Mr McDonald will be fully compensated by the order made on   October   in the Primary Reasons    the Court cannot be influenced by any concern to reimburse the applicant or Mr McDonald for costs incurred in prosecuting the application  Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union     IR   at     finally  although a penalty acts as a general deterrence  such deterrence is relevant where the obligations are clear  even if the employer was ignorant of the obligation  In the present case  the position adopted by Telstra was arguable but erroneous   The Court should not be concerned to reimburse an applicant for costs incurred in bringing the application by the imposition of a penalty under s   of the WR Act   The legislative policy of the WR Act in relation to costs is found in s   of the WR Act   which states
