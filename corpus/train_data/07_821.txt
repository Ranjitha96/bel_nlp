General  NT  v Kearney and Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It was put on behalf of Devereaux to the AAT that there was a reasonable suspicion that the relevant tax official had made a finding of tax avoidance by evasion for the improper purpose of seeking to extend the time limits imposed by s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  and that the legal advices were procured for the purpose of  or utilised in the course of  effecting that improper purpose  although it was not suggested that counsel were complicit  Devereaux has a formidable task to establish this ground  The AAT referred to the relevant authority Attorney General  NT  v Kearney and Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR   and then went on to reject the argument  giving detailed reasons for that conclusion  What is more  the AAT considered in detail the evidence given by the tax official said to have been motivated by the improper purpose and accepted his evidence  that being inconsistent with any finding of the alleged improper purpose   The written submissions for Devereaux pointed to a number of features of the facts and circumstances which  it was contended  showed that the AAT was wrong  Counsel for Devereaux went through the facts in great detail during the hearing  Indeed  he unsuccessfully sought to tender further evidence  If accepted  the written and oral submissions for Devereaux might establish that the AAT was wrong in its conclusion that the exception did not apply  That is essentially a question of fact  In my opinion  the arguments advanced on this point would be appropriate if there were a full appeal from the AAT to the Court but there is not  I could detect no question of law in relation to which the AAT erred on this aspect of the case  The correct principle was identified and sought to be applied  There is no merit in the suggestion that the correct standard of proof was not applied  The appropriate standard was laid down in Kearney   HCA       CLR   the authority applied by the AAT  There is no reason why a party charged with improper conduct cannot confront that charge and defeat it  as occurred here   The appeal will be upheld and the decision of the AAT that the Commissioner must give Devereaux access to the withheld documents  or  where relevant  parts thereof  in accordance with Part Q of the reasons for decision  is set aside  As I have held that there is only one reasonable conclusion  there is no point in remitting the matter to the AAT  In lieu of the AAT s decision  access to the withheld documents should be refused  The cross appeal is to be dismissed  Devereaux is to pay the Commissioner s costs of the application and cross appeal   I certify that the preceding

statements are illuminated by the decision in Benecke v National Australia Bank     NSWLR   that was used as an example in the joint judgment in Mann   HCA       CLR    In that case the client  on whose behalf a case was settled by counsel  brought proceedings to set aside the settlement claiming that instructions to settle had not been given  She gave evidence to that effect  It was held that  in those circumstances  the client had waived her legal professional privilege and there could be no objection on the ground of privilege to the evidence of counsel or the other legal representatives

and parts of documents that were ordered to be released  and those sought by way of cross appeal  were entitled to the benefit of legal professional privilege  being either legal advices themselves or documents extracting or summarising legal advice  The basis of the AAT s decision  seeking to apply the principle discussed by the High Court in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   was that certain other documents  which were produced pursuant to the Freedom of Information request  disclosed the substance of the advices reflected in the nine documents not produced thereby waiving legal professional privilege in the underlying advices  The issue has been argued before the AAT and in this proceeding on the basis of the application of the common law rather than the Evidence Act    Cth   That approach is consistent with the decision in Mann   HCA       CLR   and with the approach of the Full Court in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer  Australian Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR    The AAT identified parts of five particular documents which it held disclosed the substance of the advices in question  One of those documents notes taken as to what occurred at a without prejudice meeting between Australian Taxation Office representatives and taxpayers  representatives including the counsel in question was taken into account on the basis that disclosure of the document waived the without prejudice privilege and so was held to be available to be utilised in relation to waiver by disclosure   The Commissioner contends that the AAT was wrong in finding that the documents upon which it relied disclosed the gist of the advices in the necessary sense  The mere reference to legal advice does not disclose the gist or substance of it  However  the manner of reference to it may do so  The difference may be illustrated by the decision of Rolfe J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company  Canberra  Ltd     NSWLR   albeit in the context of the Evidence Act    see also Kirby J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company  Canberra  Ltd   HCA         ALR   at     HCA       ALJR   at    Devereaux submits that the question as to whether or not there has been a disclosure of the substance of advice is a matter of fact and degree rather than a question of law and that any error involved would not be an error of law  In my opinion  that is generally correct although  if the wrong test is applied  there can be an error on a question of law  cf Bennett   FCAFC       FCR   at      It is unnecessary to pursue detailed examination of this issue as  in my opinion  there are more fundamental questions to be addressed   Another typical application of the principle is exemplified in Bennett   FCAFC       FCR   and the authorities considered in that decision where a party quotes the substance of legal advice in support of a position that it is taking  either in relation to another party or the public generally  As was said in that case   FCR   at          it is well established that for a client to deploy the substance or effect of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that attracts legal professional privilege   In my opinion  the Commissioner is correct in submitting that the AAT fell into error on a question of law in not considering whether such disclosure as took place was conduct inconsistent with maintenance of the confidentiality of the underlying advices  Whilst many of the relevant authorities  including Mann   HCA       CLR   and Bennett   FCAFC       FCR   were referred to by the AAT  the correct question is not to be found in the dispositive parts of its decision  If the question had been asked  in my opinion  it could only properly have been answered in the negative  I cannot see any basis upon which it could be said that the production of the documents relied upon for waiver pursuant to a request under the FOI Act could be said to amount to conduct by the Commissioner inconsistent with maintenance of the confidentiality of the underlying advices  That is reinforced by the evidence  accepted by the AAT  that the failure to mask  even if relevant  was inadvertent citedBoensch v Pacoe   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlcitedCommissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Limited   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Devereaux relies upon issue waiver both to support its notice of contention that the AAT was correct in relation to the release of nine documents and in relation to its notice of cross appeal against the refusal to release other documents  That concept is dealt with in Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Limited   FCAFC         FCR   and goes back  at least  to Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council     SR  NSW     In my opinion  it has no application to compliance with a request pursuant to the FOI Act  It only relates to a true forensic situation  No issue in the relevant sense exists in cases such as this citedHooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority     NSWLR   The production of documents by the Commissioner pursuant to the FOI request was under the control of a Mr Robinson  His evidence  accepted by the AAT  was that the documents were put together and furnished under pressure and that he had intended to claim legal professional privilege where appropriate  but that the press of events was such that he was unable to satisfactorily do so  The failure to claim privilege in relation to the relevant parts of the documents that were produced was inadvertent  There are situations in which a privileged document is inadvertently disclosed  but privilege might be maintained  cf Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority     NSWLR   Boensch v Pascoe   FCA   at     discussedLombe v Pollak   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  One question is whether there was voluntary disclosure of the documents ordered to be produced  Devereaux has not seen and does not have a copy of them  Furthermore  the documents said to waive legal professional privilege in the underlying documents were not produced voluntarily but  rather  pursuant to a compulsory process under the FOI Act  Devereaux submits that the Commissioner could have masked the relevant portion of the documents pursuant to s   and the failure to do so amounts to waiver of any privilege attaching  referring to Lombe v Pollak   FCA    However  the question here is not waiver of privilege in relation to the documents which were produced  The Commissioner is not seeking to assert privilege in relation to any part of those documents  They can be utilised by Devereaux in any way it sees fit   In Lombe   FCA   the other party had a copy of the legal advice  At an examination  the party was shown the advice and taken through it paragraph by paragraph and questioned about its contents without objection  There was no claim that the failure to object was inadvertent  Jacobson J applied dicta of Cole J in Spedley Securities Ltd  In Liq  v Bank of New Zealand     NSWLR   at   and  not surprisingly  found privilege waived  Spedley   NSWLR   was a similar case  in that a former officer of the bank was examined without objection on a draft witness statement which had been prepared by the bank s solicitor and provided to the liquidator in answer to a summons under s   of the Companies  New South Wales  Code  appliedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Both parties accepted

document waived the without prejudice privilege and so was held to be available to be utilised in relation to waiver by disclosure   Even if there were  there was no use of the material that was disclosed that was inconsistent with maintaining confidentiality in the underlying advices within the principles enunciated in Mann   HCA       CLR    Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Callinan JJ said   CLR   at        Legal professional privilege exists to protect the confidentiality of communications between lawyer and client  It is the client who is entitled to the benefit of such confidentiality  and who may relinquish that entitlement  It is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege          Waiver may be express or implied  Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect      What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of fairness  perceive  between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large   Those well known general statements are illuminated by the decision in Benecke v National Australia Bank     NSWLR   that was used as an example in the joint judgment in Mann   HCA       CLR    In that case the client  on whose behalf a case was settled by counsel  brought proceedings to set aside the settlement claiming that instructions to settle had not been given  She gave evidence to that effect  It was held that  in those circumstances  the client had waived her legal professional privilege and there could be no objection on the ground of privilege to the evidence of counsel or the other legal representatives being given   Similarly  the majority in Mann   CLR   at   said     Disclosure by a client of confidential legal advice received by the client  which may be for the purpose of explaining or justifying the client s actions  or for some other purpose  will waive privilege if such disclosure is inconsistent with the confidentiality which the privilege serves to protect   In my opinion  the Commissioner is correct in submitting that the AAT fell into error on a question of law in not considering whether such disclosure as took place was conduct inconsistent with maintenance of the confidentiality of the underlying advices  Whilst many of the relevant

for waiver pursuant to a request under the FOI Act could be said to amount to conduct by the Commissioner inconsistent with maintenance of the confidentiality of the underlying advices  That is reinforced by the evidence  accepted by the AAT  that the failure to mask  even if relevant  was inadvertent   Consideration needs to be given to the decision of Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd   ALR       ATR    It was held that legal professional privilege had been waived in relation to certain documents by reason of what was described as  issue waiver    ALR   at      Sundberg J went on to discuss  obiter  whether disclosure waiver had occurred by reason of reference to advice in a document that was produced and said that he would have so held  His Honour sought to apply the principles laid down in Mann   HCA       CLR    One of the issues discussed was whether or not the respondent voluntarily produced the documents said to waive privilege in the underlying advices  The document had been produced to the other side twice the first pursuant to an application under the FOI Act where no privilege was claimed  the second was in answer to a notice to produce within the course of the litigation before the Court without a claim of privilege  Sundberg J took the view that the document was produced voluntarily and held that it was not relevant that the respondent did not seek to deploy it for any commercial or forensic purpose  With all respect  that reasoning might be applicable if the underlying advice had been produced but  in my opinion  is not applicable to circumstances such as the present  I am  thus  not inclined to follow Sundberg J s dicta  It was  in any event  a particular factual application of the principle and does not purport to lay down any new law  Furthermore  the inadvertent nature of the present disclosure would distinguish this case from the facts before Sundberg J distinguishedRio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR       ATR
