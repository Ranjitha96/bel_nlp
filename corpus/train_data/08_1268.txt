regard to the federal nature of the Constitution   it is difficult to suppose that the powers conferred by pars  xix  and  xx  were intended to extend to the enactment of a complete code of laws  on all subjects  applicable to the persons named in those paragraphs      I n the case of the corporations described in s    xx  extraordinary consequences would result if the Parliament had power to make any kind of law on any subject affecting such corporations     Other difficulties in relation to s    xx  are caused by the need to construe the Constitution as a whole  and thus to reconcile par  xx  with other parts of s         Although Gibbs CJ concluded   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at   that it was both unnecessary and undesirable to attempt to define the outer limits of s  xx    he did say   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at   that      The words of par  xx  suggest that the nature of the corporation to which the laws relate must be significant as an element in the nature or character of the laws  if they are to be valid     In other words  in the case of trading and financial corporations  laws which relate to their trading and financial activities will be within the power      As to foreign corporations  he added   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at     that  the fact that the corporation is a foreign corporation should be significant in the way in which the law relates to it    The majority noted in       the statements made by Gibbs CJ about laws relating to the trading and financial activities of trading and financial corporations being within power are to be understood as responding to the arguments advanced in that case  They are not to be read as attempting an exhaustive statement of the ambit of the power  Gibbs CJ explicitly denied   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at   any intention of doing that  That said  it must be recognised that Gibbs CJ emphasised the importance of giving due weight to the words  foreign   trading  and  financial  in considering the application of s  xx    The majority said  at   The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s  xx   It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the

Court delivered judgment in New South Wales v Commonwealth     CLR       HCA     Work Choices Case   concerning the validity of the Workplace Relations Amendment  Work Choices  Act    Cth   the Work Choices Act  as enacted in December    The Work Choices Act changed the constitutional basis for the WRA  As a consequence of the Work Choices Act  the WRA is now substantially an exercise of the corporations power under s  xx  of the Constitution   rather than an exercise of the conciliation and arbitration power under s  xxxv    The WRA  as amended  defines  employee  in s   as an individual so far as he or she is employed  or usually employed  by an employer as defined in s      Employer  is defined in s   as meaning       a  a constitutional corporation  so far as it employs  or usually employs  an individual  or   b  the Commonwealth  so far as it employs  or usually employs  an individual  or   c  a Commonwealth authority  so far as it employs  or usually employs  an individual  or   d  a person or entity  which may be an unincorporated club  so far as the person or entity  in connection with constitutional trade or commerce  employs  or usually employs  an individual as   i  a flight crew officer  or   ii  a maritime worker  or   iii  a waterside workers  or   e  a body corporate incorporated in a Territory  so far as the body employs  or usually employs  an individual  or   f  a person or entity  which may be an unincorporated club  that carries on an activity  whether of a commercial  governmental or other nature  in a Territory in Australia  so far as the person or entity employs  or usually employs  an individual in connection with the activity carried on in the Territory   The High Court in the Work Choices Case   by a majority of five to two  held that the Work Choices Act was valid  The majority concluded that the understanding of the power conferred by s  xx  as explained by Mason CJ  Deane and Gaudron JJ in Re Dingjan  Ex parte Wagner     CLR       ALR       HCA     Re Dingjan  and amplified by Gaudron J in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd  Ex parte Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     CLR       ALR       HCA     Pacific Coal   should be adopted   The majority in the Work Choices Case   in seeking to determine the ambit of laws which apply to constitutional corporations  referred to the dissenting members of the Court in Re Dingjan   HCA         CLR    The majority said  at       Particular reference need now be made only to the reasons of Gaudron J  with which Deane J agreed   Her Honour s reasoning proceeded by the following steps    HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at    First  the business activities of corporations formed within Australia signify whether they are trading or financial corporations  and the main purpose of the power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations must be directed to their business activities in Australia  Second  it follows that the power conferred by s  xx  extends  at the very least    HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at   to the business functions and activities of constitutional corporations and to their business relationships  Third  once the second step is accepted  it follows that the power  also extends to the persons by and through whom they carry out those functions and activities and with whom they enter into those relationships     HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at     If it is  the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s  xx  as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal   would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities  functions  relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council  the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council  the imposition of obligations on it  and  in respect of those matters  the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts  its employees  and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities  functions  relationships or business   The constitutional framework erected by the Constitution referred to in the majority judgment in the Work Choices Case set out at para   above  including the observation from the Melbourne Corporation case  emphatically denies that possibility   In the Work Choices Case   the majority of the High Court noted  at     The term  constitutional corporation  is defined in s   to mean a corporation to which s  xx  of the Constitution applies  That paragraph refers to foreign corporations  and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth  No doubt there may be room for dispute  in relation to some corporations  about whether they are constitutional corporations within the meaning of the new Act  However  in the application of para  a  of the basic definition of employer  and the corresponding definition of employee  to a given corporation  the hypothesis is that it is a constitutional corporation   Subsequent to the judgment of the High Court in the Work Choices Case   the Australian Workers Union of Employees  Queensland  the applicant  filed an application in this Court on   December    Subsequently  an amended application  which included the Queensland Services  Industrial Union of Employees as the second applicant  was filed on   December    That application sought  declaratory orders pursuant to s   of The Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  declaring      the respective rights of the parties regarding a purported Workplace Agreement lodged by the First Respondent with the Second Respondent  purportedly in reliance upon sections       and   of the Workplace Relations Act   on the  st October   and described as  Etheridge Shire Council Australia  Employee Collective  Workplace Agreement    hereinafter called  the Etheridge Agreement    The applicants sought that    It be declared       i  that the First Respondent is not an  employer  within the meaning of section   of the Workplace Relations Act            ii  that the First Respondent was not lawfully entitled to lodge the Etheridge Agreement with the Second Respondent on   st October   or at any time thereafter  under Part   of the Workplace Relations Act              iii  that the Etheridge Agreement did not come into operation as a workplace agreement in accordance with section   of the Workplace Relations Act   on   st October   nor any time thereafter           iv  that the Etheridge Agreement has no force and effect as a workplace

Case   at   and   set out in     above  contrasts the view of the majority in St George City Council that the question of characterisation is to be determined by the purpose for which the corporation is formed  with the dissenting view of Barwick CJ that the  activities test  determines the character of a corporation  and that  a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services  was a trading corporation   The comment by the majority in the Work Choices Case that the view of Barwick CJ  did not then command the assent of the majority of the Court  is to be understood as indicating that the  activities test  propounded by Barwick CJ was later accepted by the High Court in Adamson as the applicable test  and is the proper test to apply   Mason J

au cases cth HCA  html  There are further observations in the judgment of the majority which have a relevance to the present controversy  The majority said at     By the time Fontana Films came to be decided  there had been controversy about what are  trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth   In particular  in R v Trade Practices Tribunal  Ex parte St George County Council   HCA         CLR       ALR     the court had held that a county council  established under the Local Government Act    NSW  for  local government purposes  empowered to sell electricity and sell and install electrical fittings and appliances  and pursuing only those activities  was not a trading corporation  In his dissenting opinion  Barwick CJ had said   HCA         CLR   at   that  a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services  was a trading corporation  But this view did not then command the assent of a majority of the court   The majority continued at   In R v Federal Court of Australia  Ex parte WA National Football League   HCA         CLR       ALR    Adamson  St George County Council was distinguished  Associations incorporated under associations incorporation legislation  whose principal objects were the promotion  control and management of Australian Rules football matches  were held to be trading corporations  Mason J said   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at          Trading corporation  is not and never has been a term of art or one having a special legal meaning  Nor  as the Chief Justice pointed out  in St George County Council   was there a generally accepted definition of the expression in the nineteenth century  Essentially it is a description or label given to a corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation   The High Court decision of The Queen v Trade Practices Tribunal  Ex Parte St George County Council   HCA         CLR     St George County Council   is not directly on point  but  in my opinion  is of assistance on the question of characterisation  when one contrasts the powers and activities the subject of consideration in that case  with the powers and activities of the Etheridge Shire Council in the present case   In that case  the St George County Council was established under the Local Government Act    NSW  for  local government purposes   It was empowered within its district to supply electricity and to supply and install electrical fitting and appliances  and these were its only activities   The Act provided that the county council should  endeavour so to conduct each trading undertaking that without any loss being incurred the service  product  or commodity of the undertaking may be supplied to the consumer as cheaply as possible    The High Court  by a majority  McTiernan  Menzies and Gibbs JJ  with Barwick CJ and Stephen J dissenting  held that the St George County Council was not a  trading corporation  within s   of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act      Cth   The majority accepted that the St George County Council was not a  trading corporation  notwithstanding that it carried on trading activities   It was submitted on behalf of the State of New South Wales  intervening  that a  trading corporation  connotes more than a corporation which trades  It was submitted that  trading  describes the nature or quality of the corporation itself rather than its actual activities  For the Commonwealth of Australia  it was submitted that the St George County Council was set up to sell electrical fittings and appliances  and that to do that was to trade  It was therefore a  trading corporation   It was submitted that  I ts actual activities characterize it   Barwick CJ said  at   The question raised by the case involves the construction of the expression  trading corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth  as it appears in the Act through the definition for the purposes of the Act of a  corporation   Because of identity of language and the fact that the statutory formula is designed to keep the Act within constitutional power  that construction would be applicable to the words of the Constitution   a circumstance which must influence the construction placed on the statutory formula  I ought to point out at the outset that the ultimate question in the case is to be answered in relation to the applicant and not as to all county councils  The powers and functions which under the Act may be transferred to a county council are diverse  cf   e g  s    and    Consequently  considerations which  in my opinion  are definitive in this case may not be so in the case of other county councils with different powers and activities   Emphasis added    Importantly  Barwick CJ noted  at       the description  trading corporation  in my opinion  refers not to the purpose of incorporation but to the activities of the corporation at the relevant time  So far then the applicant is evidently a corporation which has been formed within the Commonwealth  It trades in the supply of electricity  of electrical appliances and of electrical services  It has no other purpose or activity   Barwick CJ suggested that there did not appear to have been any generally accepted definition of a trading corporation  He said  at   It was assumed  I think  that such a corporation could be identified by its activities  If its nature was being sought  it was to be found in what it did   Barwick CJ said  at   To say that a corporation s description for relevant purposes will be determined by its activities does not mean  of course  that a corporation which to any extent engages in trade is a trading corporation  It is evident that the legislative power given by s   xx   is not a power to legislate with respect to trading  It is a legislative power with respect to some corporations  But a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services will  in my opinion  satisfy the description   and a corporation which does nothing but trade and  if it matters  was incorporated so that it could trade  i e  exercise the trading powers of the constituent local government councils  is  in my opinion  properly described as a trading corporation within the constitutional power  It seems to me that the reason why a corporation trades as its sole or predominant and characteristic activity is irrelevant to the description of the corporation for present purposes  that is to say  the ends which such a corporation seeks to serve by trading are irrelevant to its description  As I have indicated  the purpose of the grant of legislative power includes the control of the corporate activities of the corporation   it is not so concerned with the motives which prompt those activities  nor the ultimate ends which those activities hope to achieve  If  upon that consideration  the corporation can fairly be described by reason of those activities  their extent and relative significance in the affairs of the corporation as a  trading corporation  it will  in my opinion  be nothing to the point that it is also a government or State or municipal corporation  The effect of the trading activities of such a corporation upon and in the community will not be lessened or necessarily affected by the fact that it is a State or municipal instrumentality   Emphasis added    The first and fourth sentences of this passage identify the basis for his conclusion that  in that case  St George County Council was a trading corporation   Relevant to the contention of the union applicants in QUD   of   that the Etheridge Shire Council is a municipal corporation  a tier of State government in its own right  and therefore cannot be also a constitutional corporation  Barwick CJ said  at     It may be granted that the applicant may properly be styled a  municipal  corporation  it is both the creature and servant of  local government  but it is  none the less  in my opinion  a trading corporation within the statutory definition  It is easily demonstrated that the purpose of the applicant s incorporation and of its activities is the performance of what has come to be regarded as a local government function  its charter being to provide electricity at low cost to the ratepayer  But it is to achieve and satisfy this purpose by trading  both in electricity and in electrical goods and services  It buys and sells an activity recognized by the Act itself as  a trading undertaking   s   and    To say that it is a  municipal  corporation is  in my opinion  to say no more than that it is a government  or local government  agency  or  put another way  that it is a municipal trading corporation   Menzies J in the majority said  at   The submission of the Solicitor General for the Commonwealth  who appeared for the respondents  was that the Council is and has always been a trading corporation  He relied exclusively upon the contention that this Council had been established for no purpose other than to trade and he refrained from submitting  in these proceedings  that a local government corporation which has local government purposes other than trading purposes is a  trading corporation  within the meaning of s      Emphasis added    Later  at   Menzies J said  It is because trading of a council is subordinate to its governmental purposes that the Act contains a section such as s     It is this subordination of trading to community purposes that is  to my mind  the real importance of s    in this case  It reveals the very nature of a council to which it applies   Menzies J said  at   It seems to me that trading corporations were in   a well recognized classification of companies   Gibbs J  as he then was  said  at   The question     is whether the County Council is a trading corporation  In my opinion  the words  trading corporation  in s   xx   do not mean  a corporation which is trading   The word  trading  forms part of a composite expression and indicates the essential attribute of the kind of corporation to which it refers  It is common to describe corporations according to their nature  and to speak  for example  of ecclesiastical  eleemosynary or municipal corporations  There can be no doubt that the words  foreign corporations  and  financial corporations  in pl   xx   describe corporations of a particular kind rather than corporations of any kind which happen to act in a particular way  The same is true of the words  trading corporations  which  in their natural meaning  as well as in the context of the placitum  refer to corporations of a particular kind   At   his Honour said  A trading corporation is one formed for the purpose of trading  However  as I have indicated  the mere fact that a corporation is trading does not mean that it is a trading corporation  It is necessary to determine the true character of the corporation  upon a consideration of all the circumstances that throw light on the purpose for which it was formed  Thus there is no difficulty in holding that the fact that a corporation carries on some trade which is merely incidental or ancillary to the fulfilment of its main purpose does not give it the character of a trading corporation   Gibbs J said    When all these facts are considered  the proper conclusion in my opinion is that the County Council is a corporation constituted for the purposes of local government to provide an essential service to the inhabitants of an aggregation of local authority areas  under conditions thought most likely to prove beneficial to them  It is properly described as a municipal corporation  The description to the corporations to which the powers of s     xx   extend does not include municipal corporations   Gibbs J went on to say  at   It seems to me that the purpose of specifically mentioning the corporations intended to be within the power given by s     xx   was to exclude from the scope of the power at least those corporations which could properly be characterized as municipal and charitable corporations      The purpose of its  the County Council s  formation is more properly described as that of fulfilling a function of local government   Stephen J  who formed a minority with Barwick CJ in St George County Council   was of the view that   at         when a corporation is formed for the sole purpose of undertaking that  trading  function and undertakes none of the functions of local government which typify the activities of a municipal corporation it is     inappropriate to describe it as a municipal corporation   The High Court in Adamson   which was differently constituted from the High Court in St George County Council  departed from the purposive reasoning of the majority in St George County Council and favoured the reasoning of Barwick CJ in that case   In Adamson   Barwick CJ said  at   The only sure guide to the nature of the company is a purview of its current activities  a judgment as to its nature being made after an overview of all those activities   Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until   saying  at   The last few years have seen several decisions  particularly by the High Court  in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined  It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case     The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation  R v Trade Practices

Council at     Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse   FCA         FCR   at       ATPR     at       The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations  nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive  State Superannuation Board at     What his Honour referred to in paragraph    above may have an important relevance to a  fully fledged  municipal corporation  like the Etheridge Shire Council  as opposed to what might be described as an ersatz municipal corporation that was the subject of consideration in the St George County Council case   As a practical matter  his Honour concluded that the WACA was a trading corporation  but reached a different conclusion in relation to the Cricket Clubs  At   he highlighted some difficulties    Where all activities are income producing  it may not be hard to single out some as trading activities and quantify their significance  even if only in a broad way  But where some activities are income producing and others are not  the exercise is not so straightforward     A trading activity may represent a significant part of a club s income but be relatively insignificant in an overall consideration of the club s activities   This observation has a particular resonance in the present case  as will appear later  Such trading activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is quite insignificant in relation to the overall consideration of the activities of the Etheridge Shire Council  which  as a local government  exercises extensive legislative and executive functions in the local government area  and is its raison d tre   With respect  there is an element of circularity in this observation  but it is not consistent with the view of Barwick CJ in the St George County Council case  set out in   above   It is to be noted that Gibbs J in the St George County Council case  said  at   The word  trading  forms part of a composite expression and indicates the essential attribute of the kind of corporation to which it refers  It is common to describe corporations according to their nature      And later  in the same paragraph      the words  trading corporations      in their natural meaning  as well as in the context of the placitum  refer to corporations of a particular kind   Both Barwick CJ  at   and Gibbs J  at   thoroughly rejected the contention that a corporation which to any extent engages in trade is a trading corporation   I therefore proceed to enquire whether the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation or a financial corporation  by considering whether  on the evidence   the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is trading  whether in goods or services  or whether  the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is in finance   In that enquiry  it is necessary to have regard not only to whether the predominant and characteristic activity of the Council is trading or finance  but also  as Barwick CJ indicated in St George County Council at   the extent of that activity and its relative significance in the affairs of the Etheridge Shire Council   The Etheridge Shire Council is established by the LGA  and the powers and activities of the Etheridge Shire Council are governed by that Act   The Etheridge Shire Council was established as a body corporate  in the name Einasleigh Shire Council  in accordance with the Local Government  Divisional Boards  Act    Qld  by proclamation notice of which was published in the Queensland Government Gazette dated   November     Menzies J in St George County Council   said  at   In Halsbury s Laws of England     the distinction between trading and non trading corporations is conveniently drawn and corporations having statutory powers of local government are included in the classification there appearing of non trading corporations  It may also be observed that in   James Grant in his Treatise on the Law of Corporations classified  Municipal Corporation  separately from trading bodies and devoted   pages of his book to the consideration of municipal corporations   His Honour concluded  at   It is not my purpose to attempt to define all that falls within the limits of the classification of  trading corporation   Rather  I am concerned to indicate that the classification has limits and those limits are not to be ascertained simply by asking the question  Does the corporation trade  As I have indicated  many corporations which do trade are clearly outside the limits of the classification and one group of corporations that is not comprehended is  in my view  corporations of an essentially different character  namely corporations for local government purposes   Mr Herbert of Counsel for the applicants in QUD   of   drew attention to the record of the constitutional debates on   April   at   where Mr Symon said   In the original Act corporations simply are mentioned  Why this difference  To which Mr Barton  later an original judge of the High Court  said  The reason of making the difference was this  It having been seen that the word  corporations  as it existed  covered municipal corporations  the term was changed to  trade corporations   In   in the Constitutional debates on whether the corporations power should extend to the registration or incorporation of companies  Sir Samuel Griffiths said  at   I do not think we should  There are a great number of different corporations  For instance  there are municipal  trading  and charitable corporations  and these are all incorporated in different ways according to the law pertaining in different states      It is sometimes difficult to say what is a trading corporation  What is important  however  is that there should be uniform law for the recognition of corporations   In the light of the observations by the High Court in Adamson and the later cases  in the characterisation of a corporation as a trading corporation  or a financial corporation  the primary focus has to be on the activities of the corporation   I am of the view that all five judges in the St George County Council case would have determined that the Etheridge Shire Council is not a trading corporation   Accepting that the  activities test  is the appropriate test to apply in determining whether local governments are trading corporations  the application of that test points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the Etheridge Shire Council is not a trading corporation   Equally  it is not a financial corporation  The only financial activities which  on the evidence  it engages  is maintaining interest bearing deposits of funds prior to their utilisation for the purposes of the shire council appliedR v Federal

majority said  at       Particular reference need now be made only to the reasons of Gaudron J  with which Deane J agreed   Her Honour s reasoning proceeded by the following steps    HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at    First  the business activities of corporations formed within Australia signify whether they are trading or financial corporations  and the main purpose of the power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations must be directed to their business activities in Australia  Second  it follows that the power conferred by s  xx  extends  at the very least    HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at   to the business functions and activities of constitutional corporations and to their business relationships  Third  once the second step is accepted  it follows

power conferred by s  xx  of the Constitution extends to the regulation of the activities  functions  relationships and the business of a corporation described in that sub section  the creation of rights  and privileges belonging to such a corporation  the imposition of obligations on it and  in respect of those matters  to the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts  its employees and shareholders and  also  the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities  functions  relationships or business   footnote omitted     This understanding of the power should be adopted  It follows  as Gaudron J said    HCA         CLR   at         HCA       ALR   at     HCA   that the legislative power conferred by s  xx   extends to laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations    The majority concluded  in       A law which prescribes norms regulating the relationship between constitutional corporations and their employees  or affecting constitutional corporations in the manner considered and upheld in Fontana Films or  as Gaudron J said in Re Pacific Coal    HCA         CLR   at         HCA       ALR   at    laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of  constitutional  corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations  are laws with respect to constitutional corporations   In essence  the High Court  by a majority  concluded that the Work Choices Act was valid in its application to constitutional corporations  The central question in these two proceedings is whether the Etheridge Shire Council is such a corporation   If it is  the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s  xx  as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal   would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities  functions  relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council  the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council  the imposition of obligations on it  and  in respect of those matters  the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts  its employees  and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its

The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s  xx   It does not call

up until   saying  at   The last few years have seen several decisions  particularly by the High Court  in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined  It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case     The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation  R v Trade Practices Tribunal  Ex parte St George County Council   HCA         CLR   at      St George County Council  R v Federal

Superannuation Board      But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation  Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade  its character may be found in its constitution  Even when there are current activities  the corporation s constitution is not completely irrelevant  Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   at     ATPR     at

nonetheless  that in the State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR     Mason  Murphy and Deane JJ said  at        T he decision in Adamson is of importance for two reasons  First  the majority of the Court  Barwick CJ  Mason  Jacobs and Murphy JJ  rejecting the argument that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is the sole or principal criterion of its character as a trading corporation   This passage indicates that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is not the  sole  or  principal  criterion for the purposes of characterisation  The passage suggests  however  that the purpose of the formation of a corporation is not irrelevant in that process   The contention for the applicant in both proceedings in this case is that when one looks at the totality of the evidence  including the historical evidence concerning the function of the Etheridge Shire Council  in particular  the fundamental functions of the shire council  being the legislative and administrative responsibility as a local government for the local government area  it is impossible to conclude that the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation   I have set out in detail the evidence in relation to what is said to be the trading activities of the council   All of them  in my opinion  including even the road works aspect of the activity of the council  after close analysis  entirely lack the essential quality of trade  Almost all of them run at a loss  They are all directed  in my view  to public benefit objectives within the shire  Their scale  even in monetary terms  putting to one side the non monetary significance of the legislative and executive activity of the shire council  are so inconsequential and incidental to the primary activity and function of the Council as to the deny to the Council the characterisation of a  trading corporation  or a  financial corporation  citedUnited Firefighters  Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire

Shire Council ask the question   How is the significance or substantiality of the trading activities to be assessed     a  It is undoubtedly a fact of fact and degree  Adamson at        b  A measurement of what is received from the alleged trading activities against total receipts as an indication of substantiality and significance has been accepted and adopted in a number of cases including     i  E v Red Cross   FCA         FCR   at              ii  United Firefighters Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board     FCR   at              iii  Orion Pet

HCA  html  The High Court  in Widgee Shire Council v Bonney   HCA         CLR     upheld the validity of a power granted to the Widgee Shire Council  which was a local authority in a country district  to make by laws made for the protection of roads under their control  In doing so  Griffith CJ said  at   In my opinion  the legislature has deliberately and intentionally made the local authority  subject to the approval of the Governor in Council  the sole judge of such matters  subject only to this qualification  that  if a by law is such that no reasonable man  exercising in good faith the powers conferred by the Statute  could under any circumstances pass such a by law  it might be held invalid on that ground as being an abuse of the power  and therefore not within it   The Etheridge Shire Council has numerous other powers and responsibilities under the LGA  including making a local law which creates an offence constituted by contravening a local law and fixing a penalty for an offence against a local law  s   of the LGA   Having regard to the submissions of counsel for all the parties  it is plain that if the Etheridge Shire Council is not a constitutional corporation  then each of the applicants is entitled to the relief which it seeks consideredWingadee Shire Council v Willis   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Of these powers conferred by the LGA  it is worth noting that in Wingadee Shire Council v Willis   HCA         CLR     Barton J  at   cited with approval the following passage of the judgment of Field J in the United States Supreme Court case of Meriwether v Garrett   USSC       US    at   Municipal corporations are mere instrumentalities of the State for the more convenient administration of local government  Their powers are such as the legislature may confer  and these may be enlarged  abridged or entirely withdrawn at its pleasure
