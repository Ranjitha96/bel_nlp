Orrcon Operations Pty Ltd v Capital Steel   Pipe Pty Ltd  No     FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Australian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd   FCA   Sackville J considered it appropriate to award costs against an unsuccessful applicant for an interlocutory injunction where the applicant had failed  not only on the balance of convenience ground  but also on the serious question to be tried ground   Orrcon submits that it succeeded on a substantial matter involved in its interlocutory application in that it succeeded in establishing that there was a serious question to be tried in relation to the allegation that the pipe was defective   See     of my previous reasons   However  the fact is that in terms of the interlocutory relief it sought  Orrcon failed to establish a serious question to be tried and  in any event  the balance of convenience favoured the refusal of relief  In addition  my decision means that Orrcon s claim for final relief in relation to the Westpac letter of credit is otiose  In those circumstances  I think it is appropriate to order that Orrcon pay Capital Steel s costs of the application for interlocutory relief   Orrcon submits that if  contrary to its primary submission  I award costs in favour of Capital Steel  then I should reflect in any such order the fact that it succeeded in establishing a serious question to be tried in relation to the allegation that the pipe was defective  Three experts who gave evidence in support of that allegation were cross examined by counsel for Capital Steel and the issue occupied some time  I could reflect Orrcon s success on that particular matter by making different costs orders with respect to different issues  or I could reduce the costs otherwise payable to Capital Steel by Orrcon   In Australian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd   FCA     Sackville J held that the case before him came within the first and third categories  His Honour said  at       In the present case  I think the application for an interlocutory injunction can fairly be regarded as a self contained part of the proceedings  The failure of the application for an injunction effectively means that the claim for this form of relief has been finally disposed of  While it is open to AACo to pursue other relief against AMP  such as its claim for damages  the overwhelming likelihood is that the Stanbroke Shares have now been transferred to Nebo as the purchaser  Moreover  there is nothing in the proceedings to indicate that AACo intends to seek relief against Nebo in these proceedings     In addition  if AACo does pursue claims against AMP  it would seem that the litigation will take a considerable period of time to resolve  Unless an order is made for the payment of costs forthwith  AMP is unlikely  in the ordinary course of events  to recover its costs in respect of the interlocutory proceedings for a lengthy period     I think that each of these factors justifies making an order in terms of FCR  O   r    In my opinion  the demands of justice require that there be a departure from the general practice that an order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding should not entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings have been concluded  Accordingly  I propose to order that AACo pay AMP s costs of the interlocutory proceedings forthwith and that AMP be entitled to have its bill of costs taxed forthwith   Capital Steel s success on the application for interlocutory relief means that Orrcon s claim for final relief in relation to the Westpac letter of credit is otiose  That is a significant factor in favour of the order sought by Capital Steel  Capital Steel submits that Orrcon s conduct was unreasonable in the following ways       The refusal  or at least failure  by Orrcon to particularise its plea of unconscionable conduct     Orrcon s failure to establish a serious question to be tried       The fact that the orders sought by Orrcon would have involved a substantial interference in the commercial relationship between Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank  see   of my previous reasons     The fact  so it is said by Capital Steel  that Orrcon has not quantified its claim against it  see   of my previous reasons  and     The fact  so it is said by Capital Steel  that Orrcon has unlawfully refused to make payment of a separate amount due by it to Capital Steel  see   of my previous reasons    I do not think that any of these matters constitute unreasonable conduct in the relevant sense referred toBailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Capital Steel submits that there is no case in which an order that costs be paid forthwith has been refused on the ground that the unsuccessful party may thereby lose a right of set off  Whether that be so or not  there is no doubt that the effect on a possible right of set off is a relevant matter  the precise weight to be placed on it is to be determined having regard to the circumstances of the case  In Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   the Full Court of this Court said  at       The applicants must pay the respondents  costs  We also think this an appropriate case for an order under O   r   that these costs be paid forthwith  The policy behind O   r   is that  in the ordinary course of litigation  costs awarded in interlocutory proceedings need not be paid until the conclusion of the proceedings when set offs can be made in the light of the ultimate orders for costs  There is an access to justice aspect in this  Impecunious litigants who have a meritorious claim or defence should not be forced out of court because of inability to meet interlocutory costs orders  However  applications for leave to appeal in interlocutory matters of practice and procedure stand on a different footing  There is a strong public policy against the proliferation of such applications  for the reasons given by Jordan CJ and endorsed by the High Court in   Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc   HCA         CLR    The applicants in the present case having failed in this application  the respondents should not have to wait for a year or more before being paid   In my opinion  weighing up the relevant considerations  I do not think an order that the costs be taxed and paid forthwith should be made   I turn now to consider Capital Steel s application that there be an order that the costs be taxed on an indemnity basis referred toColgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   The principles by which a court proceeds in determining whether costs should be awarded on a basis other than a party and party basis are well known and I will not repeat them  Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at

decision of Barrett J in Fiduciary Limited v Morning Star Research Pty Ltd   NSWSC         NSWLR    In that case  Barrett J identified three categories of case in which the court might order that costs be paid forthwith under Pt  A  r   of the Supreme Court Rules    NSW  namely       where the decision on the application determines a separately identifiable matter or the completion of a discrete aspect     where there has been unreasonable conduct on the part of the unsuccessful party  or       where there is likely to be a considerable lapse of time between the application and the

Fisher J referred toNews Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited     FCR   A person ought to have been joined under this rule if a judgment of the Court will have a direct affect on the rights and liabilities of that person  This is to be contrasted with a judgment which will have an effect which is no more than indirect or inconsequential  News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited     FCR   at       I have no doubt that having regard to the reformulated orders and the matters referred to in my previous reasons  the Commonwealth Bank fell within the terms of this rule  I did not understand Orrcon to suggest the contrary  Orrcon s submission was that the Commonwealth Bank was not required to be present at the hearing and that all submissions which were properly made in opposition to its application for interlocutory relief either were or could have been made by Capital Steel  Orrcon submits that the Commonwealth Bank provided no assistance to the Court   I reject this submission  The evidence filed by the Commonwealth Bank was of considerable assistance as my previous reasons indicate  and in my opinion  it would be a counsel of perfection to say that the Commonwealth should have provided this information to Capital Steel who could have presented it on its behalf  Furthermore  the Commonwealth Bank was entitled to be at the hearing to protect its interests  particularly as the orders sought by Orrcon were reformulated as the hearing proceeded  In my opinion  it cannot be said that it was not appropriate for the Commonwealth Bank to appear and to be heard  In my opinion  it follows that an order should be made that the applicant pay the fourth respondent s costs of and incidental to the application for interlocutory relief  In view of that conclusion  it is not necessary for me to address the rival submissions made by Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank regarding Capital Steel s application for a declaration as against the Commonwealth Bank in the event that I did not order that Orrcon pay the costs of the Commonwealth Bank  In that event  Capital Steel sought a declaration that the Commonwealth Bank was not entitled to recover the costs of the application for interlocutory relief under the securities it holds from Capital Steel referred toNMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii

categories or circumstances in which a court will make a special order are not closed   Capital Steel submits that Orrcon s case was hopeless and it should have known that  In this context  I am mindful of the following observations of Lindgren J in NMFM at         In Fountain Selected Meats  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd     ALR   Woodward J stated in an oft cited passage  at          I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding  solicitor and client  or  indemnity  costs  whenever it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant  properly advised  should have known that he had no chance of success  In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive  or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law  Such cases are  fortunately  rare  But when they occur  the court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion         The expression  where the applicant  properly advised  should have known that he had no chance of success  should not be allowed to give rise to difficulty  It might be suggested  with the benefit of hindsight  that in every case  proper advice  would be advice in accordance with the reasons for judgment delivered by the Court  Accordingly  it might be suggested in the present case that NM  properly advised  would have been advised in accordance with Reasons for Judgment  No    Clearly  this is not what Woodward J had in mind  On the other hand  his Honour s expression  properly advised  was intended to introduce an objective notion  it would  set the bar too high  to insist that the party have actually known that there was no chance of success  Of course  questions will arise in relation to sets of circumstances falling between the two extremes  What assumed knowledge of the facts is the party s litigious conduct to be measured against  What factual inquiries is the party  deemed  to have made  What level of legal advice is the party  assumed  to have had    I do not attempt to answer these general questions   I would not put Orrcon s application in the category of a hopeless case  The application came on quickly and it was complex  both legally and factually  It has to be said that views may reasonably differ as to the precise scope of the doctrine of unconscionable conduct  I realise there is an element of impression here  but I would not characterise Orrcon s case as a hopeless one for the purposes of a special order as
