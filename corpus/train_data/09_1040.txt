Union   FCA         IR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere are various considerations that may be relevant in determining an appropriate penalty for a contravention of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   They include   a  the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place   b  the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches  including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate disregard of the applicable law     c  the consequences of the contravening conduct  including the nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result   d  where more than one contravention of the Act is involved  whether the contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct   e  whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in similar unlawful conduct  and   f  the need for specific and general deterrence    See Stuart Mahoney v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA         IR     at     per Tracey J and Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd  No     FCA         IR   at       per Branson J  both of which have been cited with approval  These factors are relevant in this case  In Stuart Mahoney   Tracey J also included a number of other factors  such as the size of the business enterprise involved  whether senior management was involved in the breaches  whether the party committing the breach had exhibited contrition  whether the party committing the breach had taken corrective action  whether the party committing the breach had cooperated with the enforcement authorities  and the need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements  As appears in the following discussion  some of these factors have some bearing on the appropriate penalties in this case  It is convenient to consider the question of penalties  having regard to the various factors falling for consideration  Similar unlawful conduct in the past is relevant and may justify a heavier penalty than might otherwise be imposed  although not a penalty that is disproportionate to the contravention in question  see Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd  No     IR at       per Branson J  As Tracey J observed in Stuart Mahoney   IR at      s imilar previous conduct demonstrates that the respondent has a history of engaging in the particular conduct in question  that the penalties previously imposed were insufficient to deter the respondent from re engaging in that conduct and that the respondent has failed to take adequate steps to prevent further contraventions   Also  as his Honour went on to say      Conduct which is of a different character does not assist this assessment  see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   WASC         IR   at       Similar conduct which has been found to contravene other legislative provisions will have potential relevance  In this case  any previous contraventions by the respondents of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act will be relevant  The applicant submitted that the Union had previously been found to have contravened s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act in Stuart Mahoney   IR    In Stuart Mahoney   IR   the respondent Union admitted  on   April   that  in October   it had contravened ss   and   of that Act  On   September   the Court made declarations to that effect and imposed penalties  The respondents noted  correctly in my view  that this contravention of s   is not properly treated as a prior contravention  the conduct in question preceded the first contravention here  on   February   but was not the subject of judicial decision  or admission  until last year  Stuart Mahoney shows  however  that the Union did in fact engage in similar conduct prior to   February   a fact that may be taken into account although accorded less significance than if the matter had been dealt with by the Court before   February    In Stuart Mahoney   IR at     Tracey J held that the Union was a very large national organisation  On the basis of Mr Gregor s affidavit  I would reach the same conclusion  Its financial report for the year ending   December   stated that  as at   December   the Union had   members and net assets of    Mr Mates stands in a very different position to the Union  He is an individual employed as a worker on a building site  There was in this case no evidence that any senior official or members of the governing bodies of the Union were involved in the contravening conduct  Accordingly  the present case is distinguishable from the situation in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA         ALR     where Merkel J found  at     that CBA acted through senior executives in its contravening conduct  The case is also distinguishable from Stuart Mahoney   IR   where  at     Tracey J noted that the contraventions in that case took place with the knowledge and consent of senior Union officials  This is not an aggravating circumstance in this case  Section   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act specifically states that the main object of the Act is  to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly  efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole   The imposition of penalties for contraventions of provisions such as s   is one way in which this is achieved  As already noted  the contraventions under consideration were clear  Bearing these factors in mind  the need for general deterrence is plain enough  with the result that penalties should be imposed at what has been termed a  meaningful level  to serve as a general deterrence to others who may be disposed to engage in the conduct in question  see Stuart Mahoney   IR   at     citing Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at     Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   ALR at     and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission   Distribution Ltd   FCA       ATPR     at     The respondents argued for lower penalties  bearing in mind Stuart Mahoney   IR   which they noted involved the imposition of an overtime ban over a period of six days for all employees  in response to the builder s refusal to engage apprentices  The trial judge held that the ban was designed to disrupt work  and senior management of the Union knew of and consented to its imposition  The respondents submitted that  in all the relevant circumstances  the appropriate level of penalty that should be imposed on the Union was   and on Mr Mates     The respondents argued that such a level of penalty was consistent with the fact that what was involved in this case was significantly less serious than the contravening conduct found in Stuart Mahoney   IR    also a s   breach   The applicant replied that this case warranted a significantly higher penalty than in Stuart Mahoney   noting other alleged features of the respective cases  Ultimately  whilst consideration of Stuart Mahoney is helpful  the fact remains that each case must be considered  having regard to its own facts  Unsurprisingly  Stuart Mahoney was different from

see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   WASC         IR   at       Similar conduct which has been found to contravene other legislative provisions will have potential relevance  In support of this proposition  the respondents relied on Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   WASC         IR   at   and Temple v Powell   IR   at      In Leighton Contractors   the Supreme Court of Western Australia was called to fix a penalty for contravention of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act

    One matter her Honour considered was whether the respondent had previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of that Act  In my view  that is the correct approach  It is not appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation by any Branch of the first defendant anywhere in Australia  The first defendant is a very large organisation that operates throughout Australia  Branches  Divisions  officers and representatives of the first defendant are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day  It is inappropriate to take account of the conduct of the first defendant through various Branches  Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in questions and are contraventions of different legislation citedWilliams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No       FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI agree with his Honour s observations  compare Williams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No       FCA   at   per Jessup J and Temple v Powell   FCA         IR   at     per Dowsett J  Further  on   March   in Williams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA     Jessup J found that  on   July   Mr Mates and the Union had committed two breaches of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act by organising a stoppage of work on a building site and threatening to organise a further stoppage unless the employer engaged a labourer  On   May   Jessup J dealt with the matter of penalties  see Williams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No     FCA     With the consent of the applicant  the respondents advised me that this last mentioned judgment was the subject of an appeal  Plainly enough  Williams is not to be treated as a prior contravention on the part of Mr Mates or the Union since the conduct in question post dated the   February   contravention in this case and had not been the subject of any judicial decision until this year  Always bearing this in mind  the findings of contravention of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act are not necessarily irrelevant to the assessment of penalty and may be taken into appropriate account  In addition to these matters  the applicant relied on various other decisions as indicative of a prior history on the Union s part  In particular  the applicant argued that the Union had a substantial history of engaging in similar conduct because it had been found to have engaged in unlawful coercion on numerous previous occasions contrary to A lengthier list of judicially determined contraventions of industrial legislation was set out in exhibit MG   to Mr Gregor s affidavit  and  as the respondents noted  included matters that were not properly to be treated as prior contraventions  I would not regard this evidence as inadmissible but the matters mentioned are to be accorded substantially less weight than those contraventions specifically mentioned above and  in some instances  virtually no weight at all  Various other judicial statements have been made concerning the significance of a prior contravention in a different state or territory  see A   L Silvestri v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA   at   and Williams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No     FCA   at       per Jessup J  Nothing to which I have been referred dissuades me from the view that  whilst prior contraventions in any state and territories may be relevant to fixing the penalty to be imposed on the Union  it will be for the Court in each case to consider the question of weight  having regard to all the relevant circumstances  Until Jessup J s decision in Williams   FCA     Mr Mates had not been found to have contravened s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act or any other industrial legislation  The applicant referred to Duffy v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   in which  on   November   Marshall J found that  in October   the Union had contravened s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   Although the report of the case indicates that Mr Mates was involved in the events resulting in the contravention finding against the Union  there was no finding of contravention against Mr Mates  Further  for present purposes  I accept that s   involves consideration of facts of a different kind to that involved in a s   contravention  Jessup J s judgment in Williams   FCA   was delivered on   March   and involved findings that  on   July   Mr Mates and the Union had each committed two breaches of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   Whilst these breaches cannot be treated as prior contraventions  they can be taken into account in imposing penalties in this case  I note  of course  that they involve judicial findings made earlier this year in respect of conduct five months after   February    These considerations affect the weight to be given Williams in imposing penalties here  The applicant submitted that the three contraventions in question here were distinct  although they all related to the respondents  purpose of coercing Hardcorp to meet their demands regarding the re employment of Messrs Deans and O Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and the allocation of particular responsibilities and duties  Much the same must also be said of Williams   FCA   and Williams  No     FCA    Consideration of them is helpful  but ultimately the factors relevant to the imposition of penalties differ discussedTemple v Powell   FCA         IR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI agree with his Honour s observations  compare Williams v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No       FCA   at   per Jessup J and Temple v Powell   FCA         IR   at     per Dowsett J  In support of this proposition  the respondents relied on Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   WASC         IR   at   and Temple v Powell   IR   at      In Leighton Contractors   the Supreme Court of Western Australia was called to fix a penalty for contravention of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   In connection with the Union s prior contraventions  after citing with approval the comments of Branson J in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd  No     IR    see   above  Le Miere J said  at     that      One matter her Honour considered was whether the respondent had previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of that Act  In my view  that is the correct approach  It is not appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation by any Branch of the first defendant anywhere in Australia  The first defendant is a very large organisation that operates throughout Australia  Branches  Divisions  officers and representatives of the first defendant are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day  It is inappropriate to take account of the conduct of the first defendant through various Branches  Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in questions and are contraventions of different legislation  In imposing penalties in respect of admitted breaches of ss  MN and   of the Workplace Relations Act and s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   Dowsett J said in Temple v Powell   IR   at         The respondents submitted that in a large organisation such as the CFMEU  with autonomous state branches  it is not necessarily appropriate to treat conduct by all branches throughout the country as relevant past conduct for the purpose of fixing a penalty in connection with the unlawful conduct of one branch  There is substance in that submission  Whether previous misconduct is relevant to fixing a penalty is a question of logic  In some cases a pattern of conduct across the country may suggest a nationwide plan of action or a national culture of misconduct  In other cases it may appear that a particular branch or geographical region has acted alone in adopting a plan of action or has developed a particular culture  It was also submitted that past conduct cannot operate so as to increase the penalty beyond that which is appropriate to the misconduct in question  That proposition mat be correct  but it should not be taken as implying that past misconduct is irrelevant to the fixing of penalty  In neither of these passages was the Court laying down a hard and fast rule that prior contraventions of another autonomous division or branch of the Union should never be taken into account  Whether or not prior contraventions will be relevant and  if relevant  accorded any and what weight will necessarily depend on the nature and circumstances  as disclosed in the record of the prior contraventions  In this context  if it appeared that a series of prior contraventions were part of any nationwide campaign  then this would plainly militate against an offending union  Plainly too  a union  considered as a single entity  cannot shrug off responsibility for prior contraventions just because they were geographically widespread  I accept that  as the relevant legislation provides  an organisation that organises itself into national and state division or branches is accountable for how its representatives operate  whether at divisional or branch level  This does not precisely answer the point at issue  however  because the place where a prior contravention occurred  the status of the Union representative through whom liability arose  and the nature of the organisation  here  including the structure of the Union  are  just like the date and precise nature of the conduct in question  a part of the circumstances to be considered when the weight to be given a prior contravention falls for determination  Prior contraventions may be indicative of a pattern of misconduct on the Union s part or a culture of disregard for the law  Or the circumstances may indicate that care should be taken in giving too much weight to these possibilities  particularly when it is apparent that the liability of the Union has come about through the actions of a site delegate or other local representative or member who may well be more affected by matters close at hand than any shared national interest  culture or concern  In many cases  these may be matters of impression that are not capable of too close analysis referred toAlfred v Walter Construction Group Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlConduct engaged in prior to   February    when the first contravention occurred  and for which no contravention was recorded until after   February   is not treated as a prior contravention  see Alfred v Walter Construction Group Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Branson J  However  similar conduct engaged in prior to   February   and for which a contravention was recorded after that date can be taken into account   Alfred   FCA   at     although will usually be given less weight than a prior contravention as judicially determined  see R v McInerney     SASR   at   per King CJ and   per Cox J  Further  similar conduct subsequently found to have been done after the relevant date  here   February   is not irrelevant to the assessment of appropriate penalty  As the applicant noted  there have been cases involving s  NC that have  in substance  involved judicial findings of similar unlawful conduct by the Union s representatives prior to   February   see Alfred v Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union   District Court of New South Wales    March   and Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited   FCA    Although involving different conduct  these two s  NC cases may be said to demonstrate a similar modus operandi on the Union s part to this case in which coercion is used to secure control of employees on building site  I would regard both these prior contraventions as relevant to the imposition of penalties  although I note that in both cases the conduct in question took place in New South Wales  rather than in Victoria  For reasons explained below  this affects the weight I would attach to them  As noted below  the question of weight is an unavoidable one when considering the significance of prior contraventions  Each of the other s  NC cases relied on by the applicant is in a different class referred toR v McInerney     SASR  Conduct engaged in prior to   February

contraventions on     and   February   had the same purpose  namely  to coerce Hardcorp to re employ Messrs Deans and O Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and  amongst other things  to have Ms Singleton appointed as OH S officer on the Mount Street site  This was the common thread running through the offending conduct of     and   February    To this extent  the comparison with Hamberger v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA   is justified  Further  the fact of this common thread should be taken into account in fixing penalties  but  in my view  the contravening conduct is not  for this reason  properly seen as one course of conduct  This is because the conduct comprising each of the contraventions was separate and distinct in time and place  and in the coercion that the Union exerted  The conduct on   February   involved demands and threats to cause trouble at the Mount Street site if the demands were not met  The conduct on   February   involved similar demands and threats but on a different day and place  and in a different context with different participants in the occasion of the contravention  The conduct on   February   involved Mr Mates coming on to the site and shutting down the crane  Therefore  these are three separate and distinct contraventions  compare Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan   FCAFC         FCR   at               FCAFC   at       per Stone and Buchanan JJ  As noted above  where  as here  penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions  it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case  As Tracey J said in Stuart Mohoney   IR at           Another factor to be considered is the totality principle  This principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing see  Kelly v Fitzpatrick   FCA         IR   at   referred to with approval by Buchanan J in Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary Smith   FCAFC         FCR   at     The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct  The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question see  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd     FCR       ALR   at   and Ponzio at   per Jessup J       Penalties must also be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent s contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct  Neither respondent has expressed any contrition referred toMill v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe totality principle must  however  apply  see Mill v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at      Where penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions  it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case  Penalties must be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent s contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct  Penalties must also be sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and others who might be tempted to engage in contravening conduct  Deterrence is a primary objective of penalties  In argument  the parties referred to some considerations beyond those mentioned at paragraph   above  I discuss each of these additional matters seriatim before turning to the major issue of deterrence  The first such matter was the size and financial position of the Union citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v

contravening conduct  and there was no apology  The respondents replied  and I accept  that this was not an aggravating circumstance that justified an increase in the level of the penalty  compare BHP Steel  AIS  Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA   at   per Kiefel J  The applicant further noted that there was no evidence of any corrective action taken by the Union or Mr Mates in relation to the contraventions  Again this is not an aggravating circumstance that would justify a higher penalty  The applicant submitted that the respondents had chosen not to cooperate with him or the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner  The applicant further contended that the respondents  lack of cooperation  and failure to make admissions of liability whilst making only limited admissions of facts  necessitated the preparation of a great deal of evidence and led to a lengthy trial  This placed a burden on the limited resources of the Court and the applicant  The applicant further submitted that the respondents  conduct during the proceeding deserved censure  The applicant commented adversely on the respondents  failure to call witnesses after

cases cth FCA  htmlAs the respondents submitted  the proceedings themselves might reasonably be thought to have some deterrent effect in respect of the Union and Mr Mates  It has sometimes been

noted above  where  as here  penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions  it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case  As Tracey J said in Stuart Mohoney   IR at           Another factor to be considered is the totality principle  This principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing see  Kelly v Fitzpatrick   FCA         IR   at   referred to with approval by Buchanan J in Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary Smith   FCAFC         FCR   at     The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct  The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question see  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd     FCR       ALR   at   and Ponzio at   per Jessup J       Penalties must also be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent s contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct  Neither respondent has expressed any contrition citedFurlong v Maxim Electrical Services  Aust  Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs the respondents submitted

of penalties for contraventions of provisions such as s   is one way in which this is achieved  As already noted  the contraventions under consideration were clear  Bearing these factors in mind  the need for general deterrence is plain enough  with the result that penalties should be imposed at what has been termed a  meaningful level  to serve as a general deterrence to others who may be disposed to engage in the conduct in question  see Stuart Mahoney   IR   at     citing Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at

Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere was in this case no evidence that any senior official or members of the governing bodies of the Union were involved in the contravening conduct  Accordingly  the present case is distinguishable from the situation in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA

 ALR at     and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission   Distribution Ltd   FCA       ATPR     at    referred toRuddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR  The usual practice is that costs follow the event  with the result that the Court will order the recovery of costs by a successful party on a party and party basis  The matter of costs is  however  in the general discretion of the Court  although the discretion must be exercised judicially  that is  in a principled way by reference to the litigation  see Ruddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR   at        In some circumstances  the usual rule will be found wanting and success on a portion only of a claim may make it reasonable for the litigant to bear the expense of the portion in which the litigant failed  Sometimes too  an otherwise successful litigant may be ordered to pay the costs of the other party in respect of the issues on which that litigant failed  As Black CJ and French J said in Ruddock v Vadarlis  No     FCR   at      u sually the circumstances in which a successful party is denied all or part of its costs have to do with its conduct of the proceedings   Their Honour continued       and       Within the general discretion to award costs  costs may be refused where  for example  the applicant has made an exaggerated claim which has occupied a significant proportion of the proceedings and has succeeded only on a minor aspect of its original claim  Costs may be apportioned according to success or failure on particular distinct or severable issues     And a trial judge may award only a proportion of the successful party s costs if the conduct of that party at trial was such as to unreasonably prolong the proceedings                         That a proceeding was brought otherwise than for the personal or financial gain of the applicant  and in that sense in the public interest  does not detract from the general proposition that ordinarily costs follow the event and that the primary factor in deciding on the award of costs is the outcome of the litigation citedCretazzo v Lombardi     SASR  Bearing in mind matters of the kind referred to by Jacobs J in Cretazzo v Lombardi     SASR   at   courts ordinarily exercise some care before making an apportionment of costs of the kind the respondents seek  Thus  the Full Court in Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel   FCA   at   declined to make such an order  upon the basis that      The appellant succeeded completely in terms of the final orders it secured  The issues it raised in argument on the appeal were not unreasonably raised  The somewhat complex factual background was a matter which had to be considered in relation to all issues  None of the issues raised can be characterised in terms of the time and work involved as distinct and severable from the other issues to the extent that an apportionment would be warranted     The applicant and the respondents all relied on this passage  pointing to different factors in their favour  In the present case  the key factor is that the applicant has not acted unreasonably in raising any issues in the context of the facts as they understood them referred toAustralian Trade

Holdings Ltd  No     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlSo far as the law permits and is practicable  however  fairness should govern the disposition of costs  compare Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd  No     FCAFC   at   per as Finkelstein and Gordon JJ  The critical factor in support of a departure from the usual order as to costs is that the applicant has failed in respect of his allegations concerning events after the crane incident on   February   and following  which turned on additional and different evidence to the earlier events  These allegations were that    on   February   Mr Mates telephoned the office of the crane company and said that its crew were not to work on the project at Mount Street    on   February   Mr Mates telephoned the Union s offices or a representative of the Union and instructed the person he contacted to instruct Maurie Hill  the Union organiser responsible for mobile cranes in Victoria  FEDFA division  to ring Sergi Cranes and other crane operators to warn them off working at the Mount Street site  and   on   February   and following  Mr Mates organised a picket line at the Mount Street site  The applicant further alleged that the Union and or Mr Mates had contravened s   of the Act in that Mr Mates  alleged conduct on   February   and in organising a picket line at the Mount Street site between   February   and   March   constituted  building industrial action  within the meaning of paragraphs  b  and  c  of the definition in s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   Plainly enough  some significant amount of time and effort was devoted to that part of the applicant s unsuccessful case  although it is difficult to quantify this precisely  In all the circumstances  it would be reasonable to deprive the applicant of a percentage of his trial costs  Having regard to these circumstances  I consider that it would be fair and just to deprive the applicant of   per cent of his trial costs  It would be inappropriate to order the applicant to pay any portion of the respondents  costs
