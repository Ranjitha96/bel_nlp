floating charge  on the other hand  is ambulatory and shifting in its nature  hovering over and so to speak floating with the property which it is intended to affect until some event occurs or some act is done which causes it to settle and fasten on the subject of the charge within its reach and grasp  In the United Builders  case  two companies carried on a business in partnership  One of the companies charged all of its right  title and interest in the partnership in favour of the other in order to secure a loan made for extraneous purposes  The company later borrowed other moneys from another lender and gave as security a debenture mortgage which created a floating charge  In the winding up of the debtor company a question arose concerning the priority of the two securities  The majority held  with Stephen J dissenting  that the charge over the debtor s interest in the partnership was a fixed not a floating charge  In the course of his judgment Mason J said  at       the subject of the present charge was the property and undertaking of  the debtor company  there would be no doubt that the charge was of the floating variety  Otherwise  the debtor company  would be unable to dispose of its assets in the ordinary course of its business and  the creditor company  would not have the benefit of a charge on future assets      the problem here is that the property over which the charge has been given is not the undertaking  or any part of the general assets  of  the debtor company  but its interest in the partnership      His Honour went on to hold that what the charge did was to confer an entitlement in the holder on dissolution of the partnership in relation to the partner s share of the partnership assets  As may be seen  the point upon which the decision turned in that case was to do with the nature of an interest in a partnership rather than the point with which the Court is concerned in the present case  It is perhaps a matter of some significance that the ING Charge is not expressed to be  in its fixed component  a charge over the whole of the undertaking of Westpoint Corporation  The fact that the application of the fixed charge is expressed distributively over specifically identified categories of property  supports the construction that the intention was to create a charge of the kind that it is expressed to be

alia  any interest of the Westpoint Corporation in      land          Encumbrances over any property      benefit of any contract to which the Chargor is a party  including any insurance policy Counsel for Bowesco also referred to recent decisions of the Privy Council and the House of Lords  In Agnew v Commissioner of Inland Revenue   UKPC         AC   the Privy Council  on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand  was concerned with the character of a charge over book debts  At   their Lordships said      question is not merely one of construction  In deciding whether a charge is a fixed charge or a floating charge  the court is engaged in a two stage process  At the first stage it must construe the instrument of charge and seek to gather the intentions of the parties from the language they have used  But the object at this stage of the process is not to discover whether the parties intended to create a fixed or a floating charge  It is to ascertain the nature of the rights and obligations which the parties intended to grant each other in respect of the charged assets  Once these have been ascertained  the court can then embark on the second stage of the process  which is one of categorisation  This is a matter of law  It does not depend on the intention of the parties  If their intention  properly gathered from the language of the instrument  is to grant the company rights in respect of the charged assets which are inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge  then the charge cannot be a fixed charge however they may have chosen to describe it  citedRe Spectrum Plus Limited   UKHL         AC  In Re Spectrum Plus Limited   UKHL         AC   the House of Lords considered the characterisation of a charge over book debts  Lord Hope acknowledged at   that there are a number of ways to ensure that a charge over book debts is fixed  He referred to Professor Sarah Worthington s article An  Unsatisfactory Area of the Law  Fixed and Floating Charges Yet Again      International Corporate Rescue    at    Lord Hope set out ways to fix a charge over book debts  They were to          prevent all dealings with the book debts so they are preserved for the benefit of the chargee s security      Another is to prevent all dealings with the book debts other than their collection  and to require the proceeds when collected to be paid to the chargee in reduction of the chargor s outstanding debt     A third is to prevent all dealings with the debts other than their collection  and to require the collected proceeds to be paid into an account with the chargee bank      A fourth is to prevent all dealings with the debts other than their collection and to require the collected proceeds to be paid into a separate account with a third party bank  Lord Scott said  at       my opinion  the essential characteristic of a floating charge  the characteristic that distinguishes it from a fixed charge  is that the asset subject to the charge is not finally appropriated as a security for the payment of the debt until the occurrence of some future event  In the meantime the chargor is left free to use the charged asset and to remove it from the security  At   Lord Walker referred to what he called      the essential difference between a fixed charge and a floating charge   He said      a fixed charge the assets charged as security are permanently appropriated to the payment of the sum charged  in such a way as to give the chargee a proprietary interest in the assets  So long as the charge remains unredeemed  the assets can be released from the charge only with the active concurrence of the chargee  The chargee may have good commercial reasons for agreeing to a partial release  If for instance a bank has a fixed charge over a large area of land which is being developed in phases as a housing estate  another example of a fixed charge on what might be regarded as trading stock  it might be short sighted of the bank not to agree to take only a fraction of the proceeds of sale of houses in the first phase  so enabling the remainder of the development to be funded  But under a fixed charge that will be a matter for the chargee to decide for itself  citedWaters v Widdows   VR  Counsel also referred to Waters v Widdows   VR   another case concerning a charge over book debts  Nicholson J  after citing re Yorkshire Woolcombers found an inescapable inference that it was intended that the chargor company in that case should continue to carry on its business in the ordinary way so far as its book debts and stock in trade were concerned citedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v LAI Corporation Pty Ltd  Receivers and Managers Appointed    WAR  In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v LAI Corporation Pty Ltd  Receivers and Managers Appointed    WAR   the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia was concerned with the application of a statutory garnishee under the Sales Tax Assessment Act  No      Cth  on a taxpayer s book debts and whether a pre existing charge over those book debts was fixed or floating  Burt CJ said  at       nature of the security must depend upon the terms of the instrument creating it      But the nature of the charge is not finally determined by what the parties call it  It depends upon the terms of the agreement  In this case it was central to the agreement that  the debtor company  should continue to carry on its business and  with the consent of the Bank which in my opinion was given  that it could in the ordinary course of its business receive its book debts and deal with the proceeds in carrying on that business  In that context I think that  notwithstanding the statement that the charge given over future book debts was  specific  it should be held that for so long as the Bank consented to  the debtor company  receiving its book debts and using the proceeds to carry on its business  the Bank s security over the book debts was a floating security  The debenture contains no assignment of the book debts  Had it done so  the case for holding that the charge was a fixed charge would  I think  be considerably stronger  citedBoambee Bay Pty Ltd  In liq  v Equus Financial Services Ltd     ACSR  In Boambee Bay Pty Ltd  In liq  v Equus Financial Services Ltd     ACSR   the Court of Appeal of New South Wales considered a charge over a company s  right  title and interest in any property either held by  the company  at the date hereof or acquired by  the company  during the term of this Agreement   Mahoney JA said  at   that the fact that the charge attached not merely to property then held by the company but also to property acquired by it during the term of the agreement did not lead to the conclusion that the clause did not impose an immediate charge upon property then held  Despite that he held that the charge created was a floating charge  This was on the basis that the nature of the business of the company was such that if the charge was an immediate and fixed charge on all assets  the carrying on of its business would be difficult if not impossible citedHanson Construction Materials v Vimwise Civil Engineering   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlIn Hanson Construction Materials v Vimwise Civil Engineering   NSWSC     Campbell J said  at        The fundamental exercise which the Court is engaged in in deciding whether a charge is a fixed charge or a floating charge is a matter of the ascertainment of the intention of the parties  That intention can be ascertained both from the words which they used  and from surrounding circumstances known to both parties  In substance  what Mahoney JA decided in Boambee Bay Pty Ltd v Equus Financial Services Ltd     was that  even though the words creating the charge were ones which were well able to refer to a fixed charge  so far as concerned property already owned by the chargor at the date of the grant  the surrounding circumstances were such that that could not have been what the parties intended  It is noteworthy that most of the cases concerning the characterisation of company charges are concerned with their effects upon book debts  The drafter of the ING Charge was plainly alert to the difficulties which that class of property could create in characterisation of the charge  In cl     of the ING Charge  paragraph  a xiii  subjects  Charged Debt  to the fixed charge  The term  Charged Debt  is defined in cl     of the ING Charge as      actual or contingent debt or other monetary obligation from time to time forming part of the Secured Property      There is however a specific provision in cl     for the collection of Charged Debts  The lender is required to permit the chargor to collect the Charged Debts  This is a matter of some significance as indicative of an intention to provide specifically for that class of Westpoint Corporation s property which it necessarily had to be able to deal with on an ongoing basis  Clause   of the ING Charge prohibited Westpoint Corporation from transferring  leasing or otherwise disposing of or dealing with any part of the Secured Property for the time being subject to the fixed charge or to allow any person to acquire any interest  except a Permitted Encumbrance in any such secured property  The prohibition was subject to the qualification in cl    b  that      chargor  subject to clause    c  may in the ordinary course of its ordinary trading business dispose of any estate or interest in that part of the secured property which is for the time being subject to the floating charge      The prohibition so far as it is applicable to the Option would prevent it from being transferred or otherwise disposed of or dealt with  It would not prevent its exercise  Such is not a dealing in the Option  It is the exercise of the rights conferred by it  So with land which is the subject of the charge  the development of the land itself would not be prohibited under cl    Its sale or further encumbering is a different matter  It follows  in my opinion  that the creation of a fixed charge over the Option was not inconsistent with the ordinary course of Westpoint s business  I do not accept Mr Carey s description that the procedure of finding a special purpose vehicle for land development in particular cases negatives that construction  That was not a necessary aspect of the conduct of its business  In order to raise very substantial funds late in   when it faced a considerable need for refinancing  Westpoint Corporation chose to grant a fixed charge in terms which were distributed over specified classes of assets  An option to purchase land fell within those classes  The express provision in the charge for Charged Debts indicates an alertness on the part of the drafter to the difficulties associated with creating fixed charges over book debts  It indicates an intention  by way of contrast  that the charge in respect of interests in land was to be fixed  To the extent that external circumstances might have any bearing on the nature of the Option property and whether it falls within the class attracting a fixed charge  it is notable that there was an offer for   million to acquire the Option  The Option was assigned to Bowesco for    The Option is a valuable property  I do not accept that the parties to the ING Charge are to be taken as having contemplated that property in that class could be disposed of for what appears to have been a mere bagatelle  in the course of business  within the Westpoint Property Group
