Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Ozone Theatres  Aust   Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Ozone Theatres  Aust   Ltd   HCA         CLR   the High Court pointed out that the writ of mandamus is not a writ of right and that there are well recognised grounds upon which the Court may  in its discretion  withhold the remedy  By way of example  the Court stated  at   that the writ may be withheld if the relevant party has been guilty of unwarrantable delay citedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   McHugh J said  at       The issuing of writs under s  v  of the Constitution and s  B of the Judiciary Act is discretionary  Discretionary relief may be refused under s  B if the conduct of the party is inconsistent with the application for relief  It may be inconsistent  for example  if there is delay on the part of the applicant or the applicant has waived or acquiesced in the invalidity of the decision or does not come with clean hands     Citations omitted    See also at   per Hayne J  with whom Kirby J agreed on this issue   The difficulty with the approach of the Magistrate is that he did not ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified the withholding of relief in the event that the appellant established that the RRT had committed a jurisdictional error  Rather  the cases upon which he relied suggest that he required the appellant to satisfy the Court that a discretion should be exercised in his favour  having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded one year   On any view  the appellant was guilty of long delay and no satisfactory excuse was or could be proffered for that delay  But the question asked by the Magistrate  in my view  was not the correct one and this led to his discretion miscarrying on this issue citedChan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The notion of  systematic conduct  was referred to in Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J  As McHugh J observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ibrahim   HCA         CLR   at   the use of this expression proved somewhat unfortunate in that some RRT decisions read it as meaning that there can be no persecution for the purposes of the Convention unless there has been a systematic course of conduct by the oppressor  McHugh J made it clear in Ibrahim that that had not been his meaning  Rather  he intended the expression to be a synonym for  non random   McHugh J also said this  at       It is an error to suggest that the use of the expression  systematic conduct  in     Chan was intended to require  as a matter of law  that an applicant had to fear organised or methodical conduct  akin to the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the Second World War  Selective harassment  which discriminates against a person for a Convention reason  is inherent in the notion of persecution  Unsystematic or random acts are non selective  It is therefore not a prerequisite to obtaining refugee status that a person fears being persecuted on a number of occasions or  must show a series of co ordinated acts directed at him or her which can be said to be not isolated but systematic   The fear of a single act of harm done for a Convention reason will satisfy the Convention definition of persecution if it is so oppressive that the individual cannot be expected to tolerate it so that refusal to return to the country of the applicant s nationality is the understandable choice of that person     Citations omitted   In the present case  the RRT used the expression  a course of systematic conduct  or its equivalent  on three separate occasions  On each occasion  the RRT cited the observations of McHugh J in Chan   Of course  the RRT s decision in the present case was handed down long
