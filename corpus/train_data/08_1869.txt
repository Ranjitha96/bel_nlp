Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Trade Commission v Disktravel   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  While New South Wales Dairy Corporation     IPR   is helpful I do not think it is on all fours with the case before me  It is true that the applicant in these proceedings has obtained an injunction  however looking more closely at the application it is clear that the applicant did not achieve all that it sought in its application or indeed the injunction it sought  This is not a case where  to paraphrase the language of the Full Court in Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel   FCA   at     the applicant succeeded completely in terms of the final orders it secured  I am not persuaded on the basis of New South Wales Dairy Corporation     IPR   that this is not a case where some apportionment of costs may be warranted relatedBing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   November   I gave judgment in the primary proceedings in this matter   Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA   and also in relation to a notice of motion filed   May     Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA    In summary  I found that the conduct of the first and second respondents had infringed the applicant s registered trade mark  but that the effect of compliance with an oral undertaking given by the first respondent during the hearing of the primary proceedings was that the infringement of the applicant s registered trade mark by the respondents ceased  Notwithstanding that undertaking however  I allowed the application in part because I considered that the applicant was entitled to an injunction based upon the oral undertaking  Upon giving judgment I directed the parties to make submissions as to the terms of the injunction in light of the reasons given in my judgment  I also directed that the parties make submissions as to costs   In considering the form of the injunctive relief I give little weight to the possibility of a hypothetical purchaser of the applicant s business commencing litigation against the first respondent in ignorance of the reasons for judgment in Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA    However on balance  and after considering the submissions of the parties  I consider it appropriate to make an order in terms of the alternative wording of the injunction proposed by the applicant  I have formed this view because    I found in Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA   that compliance by the first respondent with its undertaking meant a cessation of conduct infringing the applicant s trade mark  and that injunctive relief in terms of that undertaking was appropriate  In my view the alternative wording of the injunction more accurately reflects that undertaking than the applicant s preferred wording of the injunction     The alternative wording of the injunction addresses the applicant s concerns with respect to such products as BING  mailroom     In relation to the applicant s concerns relating to statements on the first respondent s website such as  bing can handle any documents  even PDF s from any software platform     I do not consider that such a statement would breach either the first respondent s undertaking or the injunction I propose to make provided that it was clear that in doing so the first respondent was using the word  bing  to describe itself rather than software it supplies as part of its service      I do not consider that it is necessary to make reference in the order to  or any other sign that is deceptively similar to Trade Mark    As the applicant submitted  and as I found in my judgment  the applicant has an exclusive statutory monopoly to the trade mark  BING  in relation to the goods and services in respect of which the trade mark is registered  The judgment dealt exclusively with the fact that the first respondent used the word  bing  and found that in doing so it had infringed the applicant s trade mark  Whether any other sign of the first respondent  or anyone else  for that matter  is  deceptively similar  to Trade Mark   for the purposes of s   and s   of the Act would require a separate determination by the Court     In relation to the applicant s concern that not all references by the first respondent to software as  bing  have ceased  in my view the applicant is in no stronger position as to enforcement of an injunction should the injunction be in the terms preferred by the applicant than if the injunction were to be crafted in the alternative wording proposed by the applicant  If conduct of the respondents breaches the injunction  appropriate remedies are available to the applicant     While as a general proposition I accept that injunctive relief framed in the language of the Act is desirable  I do not consider that the applicant is in any way prejudiced by the drafting of the injunction in the alternative manner it proposes   The respondents have also submitted that  to avoid the potential for any further dispute as to the width of the injunction  it could be accompanied by the following declarations  It is declared that the use by the first respondent of the word  bing  to describe  name or refer to software utilised by it or its customers was an infringement of the applicant s trade mark no    It is declared that the first respondent s conduct trading under and by reference to a name which includes the word  bing  does not infringe the said trade mark   These declarations accord with my reasons for judgment and I accept the respondents  submission that they would avoid the potential for further dispute  Accordingly I consider it appropriate that these declarations also be made relatedBing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   November   I gave judgment in the primary proceedings in this matter   Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA   and also in relation to a notice of motion filed   May     Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA    In summary  I

dismissed   Bing  Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited  No     FCA     there was no reason why the normal rule should not apply  and that costs should follow the event  The respondents made no submissions specifically referable to this notice of motion citedDodds Family Investment Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd     IPR   As the Full Court observed in Dodds Family Investment Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings  the question of apportionment is very much a matter of discretion for the trial judge  Mathematical precision is illusory and the exercise of the discretion will often depend upon matters of impression and evaluation   In summary  this case represents a mixed outcome in which the applicant has been  to a degree  successful  That the applicant was obliged to institute legal proceedings to obtain an injunction and its success in obtaining a limited injunction are significant factors in relation to the exercise of the Court s discretion under s   Federal Court of Australia Act   No separate evidence was lead in respect of the TPA and passing off claims and there was extensive commonality of issues raised in relation to the successful trade mark infringement claims and the applicant s unsuccessful claims  In relation to the undertaking  it was offered two days into the trial after several months of directions and an unsuccessful mediation  and was loosely worded with no reference to costs  I do not think this is a case where the applicant should be liable for any of the respondents  costs  However detailed submissions were made in respect of the failed TPA and passing off claims as well as the failed claims for pecuniary and ancillary relief  Further  a small amount of time was taken up at the trial in relation to the failed claims  and more time in relation to the relief in respect of which the applicant was unsuccessful and which was clearly an important aspect of the applicant s case  On balance I consider the applicant is entitled to its costs  subject to a discount to reflect the only limited success of the applicant in relation to both its claims and relief  In the circumstances of this case I consider justice will be done as between the parties if I order the respondents to pay   of the applicant s costs of the proceedings   I certify that the preceding

full extent of relief sought  nonetheless as a general proposition the applicant succeeded in establishing that it was entitled to injunctive relief to protect its statutory monopoly in its registered trade mark  However advancing this matter further  Mr Franklin SC submitted that the case before me is on all fours with New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co operative Company     IPR    Mr Franklin SC directed my attention to comments of Gummow J in that case as follows  That brings me to the question of costs  As is apparent both from the reasons for judgment and these reasons  the case presented a number of issues and neither the applicant nor the first respondent succeeded on all of them  Much of the evidence was directed to several issues  Thus  the body of evidence as to whether MOO was substantially identical to or deceptively similar with MOOVE  trade mark issues upon which the applicant succeeded  was used also upon the different legal issues arising upon the first respondent s claims for contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    the TP Act   and passing off  issues upon which the applicant failed   The first respondent also pointed to the substantial body of evidence going to the issues discussed in the reasons for judgment under the heading  The Conduct of the First Respondent  issues upon which the first respondent succeeded  Given the outcome of circumstances of this complex litigation in which varied relief was sought by the applicant and by the first respondent  upon a range of grounds  the first respondent submitted that the applicant should be entitled only to a proportion of its costs  The applicant submitted that costs should follow the  event  in the sense that the  event  in a commercial sense had been the effort by the applicant to stop further use by the first respondent of  MOO  upon its flavoured milk product  That is an objective the applicant will have achieved by this litigation  upon the coming into effect of the rectification of the Register  and the consequent operation of the injunction to restrain trade mark infringement  In all the circumstances  in my view  the appropriate order should be that the first respondent should pay the costs of the applicant   at   While New South Wales Dairy Corporation     IPR   is helpful I do not think it is on all fours with the case before me  It is
