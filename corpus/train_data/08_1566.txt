Collard v The State of Western Australia   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedGudjala People     v Native Title Registrar   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In these circumstances the Court of its own motion listed the matter for a directions hearing on   April    At that directions hearing the Court directed the parties to file and serve submissions in relation to the disposition of the application pursuant to s  F  of the Native Title Act on or before   May    Subsequent to this date and in light of the Full Court s decision in the matter of Gudjala People     v Native Title Registrar   FCAFC   delivered on   August   parties were invited by the Court to file and serve any further submissions prior to the hearing of the application   On   May   the applicant filed submissions in relation to all the Collard applications currently before the Court today  the Collard Submissions  pursuant to the Order of the Court made on   April     The effect of the Collard submissions across the applications appears to be to the effect that the Court should not dismiss them under s  F  of the Native Title Act because they are likely to be withdrawn in exchange for some form of recognition by the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council  It is not said in what way that is to be achieved or the terms in which it might be achieved  Somehow  it is said  it would recognise the status of Mr and Mrs Collard who are the Applicants
