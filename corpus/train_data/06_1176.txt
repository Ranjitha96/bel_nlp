www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe validity of reg     was considered by Lindgren J in H Lundbeck A S v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         FCR    His Honour held that reg     is not invalid  Pfizer makes a   formal submission   that reg     is invalid but limits its submissions to that contention  Pfizer relies upon the submissions presented by the applicant in Lundbeck as reflected in his Honour s reasons but does not repeat them or otherwise explain why reg     is invalid  It is accepted by all parties that  for the purposes of this appeal  I will follow the Lundbeck decision that reg     is valid  prior to any determination to the contrary by the Full Court  Section   provides that  as a condition for extension  goods containing at least one of the claimed pharmaceutical substances must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods  the ARTG  and the period beginning on the date of the patent and ending on   the first regulatory approval date   for the substance must be at least   years  Section   provides for the calculation of the term of extension by reference to the period beginning on the date of the Patent and ending on the earliest   first regulatory approval date   as defined in s   reduced by   years appliedNewcastle City Council v GIO General Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe words   first inclusion in  the ARTG  themselves are neither ambiguous nor obscure  see       above   This is acknowledged by Pfizer s submission that uncertainty arises   not so much from the terms of s   itself but from the nature of the ARTG    Accordingly  s  AB b i  has no application   Newcastle City Council v GIO General Limited   HCA         CLR   at    Use of the extrinsic materials to confirm the ordinary meaning of the words does not assist Pfizer  s  AB a   Indeed  Pfizer did not rely on the extrinsic materials for this purpose  Section  AB b ii  is also not applicable  The ordinary meaning conveyed by the words   first inclusion in  the ARTG  taking into account their context and the purpose or object underlying the Act  does not lead to a   manifestly absurd   or   unreasonable   result       below   Pfizer submits that  independent of s  AB of the Acts Interpretation Act   the extrinsic materials are part of the legal and historical context of the Act  For this reason  it submits that it is appropriate to consider the extrinsic materials at the outset to ascertain and give effect to the purpose of the Act  or   the mischief which the statute was intended to cure     Newcastle City Council at        In Newcastle City Council   the relevant Law Reform Commission Report on insurance contracts made the legislative objective plain  at    In the present case  it is difficult to detect any clear legislative purpose or intention with respect to the relevant entry in the ARTG  Although Pfizer points to the use of the words   marketing in Australia     the Australian market   and   first registration as a therapeutic good   the extrinsic materials also refer to the time available to   exploit   the invention  the period during which patentees can   earn a return   and   first inclusion in  the ARTG   To the extent that the policy of the IP Amendment Act is discussed  the discussion is equivocal as to whether the intention was to grant an extension from the date of an approval enabling marketing in Australia rather than the date of approval for a more limited form of exploitation such as manufacture for export  This is not a case where a   strained construction   is necessary to give effect to the legislative purpose   Newcastle City Council at    To the contrary  the extrinsic materials tend to confirm the clear  ordinary meaning of  first inclusion in the ARTG   Pfizer applies for an order that the Commissioner of Patents be restrained from amending the Patents Register to reflect the shorter extended term of the Pfizer patents  the stay order   The Commonwealth filed a motion on   November   seeking to intervene in relation to the stay order  The Commonwealth submits that  unless Pfizer can establish that no person could potentially suffer damage by the stay in rectification of the Patents Register  an undertaking as to damages should be required before a stay is granted  The undertaking is only sought in respect of one of the Pfizer patents  Australian Patent No   in respect of the product NORVASC  Such potential damage would include  but not be limited to  damage to generic pharmaceutical companies which may wish to market NORVASC and damage to the Commonwealth in respect of the costs of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme citedPfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents     IPR  Spirit Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited is an Australian pharmaceutical company with a commercial interest in the expiry date of at least one of the Pfizer patents  Spirit was joined as a respondent to this proceeding on   March     Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents     IPR    Spirit seeks to adduce evidence of Dr Walters  a person experienced in matters relating to the ARTG  to establish the regulatory requirements of Listed Goods and the extent to which a patentee with an export only listing can exploit a patent  The evidence is said to answer Pfizer s contention that there is no requirement to lodge extensive data in support of an application for inclusion in the ARTG as Listed Goods  which is a requirement for goods to be Registered Goods  Spirit also wishes to respond to any suggestion that an export only listing does not allow exploitation of the patent which compensates for regulatory and product development delays  Such evidence was tendered by Pfizer before the Commissioner and was referred to in the decision  Pfizer now contends that the issue is one of statutory construction to which this evidence is not relevant  Pfizer submits that all parties now accept that there can be different inclusions in the ARTG  Pfizer accepts that it is necessary to provide data in support of an application for Listed Goods and that an export only listing enables the patentee to exploit the invention  albeit on a less than  fully effective  basis  The point that Pfizer wishes to make is that the provision of data for Registered Goods is more onerous and extensive  This itself is said to result in regulatory delay before there can be marketing in Australia and full exploitation of the patent affirmedRe Pfizer Corporation     IPR  The Commissioner of Patents  by her delegate the Deputy Commissioner of Patents  decided that an amendment should be made to the Register of Patents  the Patents Register  to correct the extension of term of four patents  the Pfizer patents  in the name of the applicants  collectively  Pfizer    Re Pfizer Corporation     IPR    This appeal by Pfizer from that decision raises two issues  which arise with respect to all four patents        The validity of reg     of the Patents Regulations    Cth   the Patents Regulations       The date from which an extension of term of a pharmaceutical patent is calculated citedStevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhile no particular theory or rule of statutory interpretation obviates the need for close attention to the text and structure of the provision in question   Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment   HCA         ALR   at     the extrinsic materials are part of the context of the Act and relevant in interpreting the meaning of   first inclusion in  the ARTG   The extrinsic materials  for whatever reason  do not give any clear indication of how the IP Amendment Act took its final form  That makes it difficult  if not impossible  to fix upon the references to   marketing approval in Australia   and   bend   the language of the Act to meet that purpose   Stevens at    What is clear from the Response  which is given effect in the IP Amendment Act  is that the extension of term scheme was introduced in recognition of the need to compensate for the time before which a patentee of a pharmaceutical substance can exploit the invention  Pfizer s submission that the relevant approval must be one which allows marketing in Australia in order to give effect to the policy of the IP Amendment Act ignores the fact that inclusion in the ARTG as Listed Goods permits the patentee to exploit the patent  This may not extend to marketing in Australia but it does enable a commercial return to the patentee  The consequence that this is less than full exploitation of the product in Australia is not contrary to the policy of the Act or the purpose of an extension to extend the  effective life  of the patent  The patentee s decision to obtain an early export only listing and thereby a shorter extended term is its choice and may have sound commercial reasons
