Australian Consumer   Competition Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Securities Commission v Aust Home Investments Limited     FCR   Mr Spencer submitted that he had sought on a number of occasions to suggest a reasonable basis upon which this proceeding could be settled  and that the ACCC had acted unreasonably in refusing to engage with him  He referred to Australian Securities Commission v Aust Home Investments Limited     FCR   at   where Hill J summarised the principles that would ordinarily apply with regard to costs when a proceeding has not gone to trial  His Honour said     These cases seem to me support the following propositions being made            Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order  Stratford   J T Stratford   Son Ltd v Lindley  No       WLR   and the SEQEB case   South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission  unreported  Federal Court    February   Pincus J        It will rarely  if ever  be appropriate  where there has been no trial on the merits or  for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial  Stratford   This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue      In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate  however  for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them   SEQEB        In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation  cf Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd v McIntosh     SR  NSW         Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted  the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted  cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at   a case which  however  depended upon the specific working of the statute under consideration  referred toRe Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  Ex parte Lai Qin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Spencer also drew attention to a similar statement of principle by McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  Ex parte Lai Qin   HCA         CLR   at     Mr Spencer argued that he had at all times acted reasonably in relation to the complaint brought against him by the ACCC  When the matter was first drawn to his attention  by a letter dated   April   setting out the ACCC s concerns  he had caused his solicitors to reply to that letter  on   May   responding in detail to the allegations  On   June   the ACCC had written to his solicitors  thanking them for his response  That letter went on to say     This office is currently assessing the information provided by you on behalf of your client  However  it is apparent a number of issues remain  therefore as soon as this office has completed its assessment of your response I will contact you to arrange a mutually suitable time to meet with you and your client to discuss this matter further   It appears from the correspondence that was tendered before me that  despite the suggestion that there would be a meeting between the ACCC and Mr Spencer to discuss the matter further  no such meeting took place  Instead  on   August   Deacons  acting on behalf of the ACCC  wrote to Mr Spencer s solicitors informing them that the matter had now been  fully investigated  and that the ACCC had determined to pursue it further  The letter went on to say that a proceeding had been instituted in the Federal Court that day  and enclosed a copy of the application and statement of claim referred toOne Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The ACCC submitted that the principles governing the award of costs in cases where a matter does not proceed to a final hearing were correctly expounded by Burchett J in One Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at      In my opinion  it is important to draw a distinction between cases in which one party  after litigating for some time  effectively surrenders to the other  and cases where some supervening event or settlement so removes or modifies the subject of the dispute that  although it could not be said that one side has simply won  no issue remains between the parties except that of costs  In the former type of case  there will commonly be lacking any basis for an exercise of the Court s discretion otherwise than by an award of costs to the successful party  It is the latter type of case which more often creates problems  since there may be difficulty in discerning a clear reason why one party  rather than the other  should bear the costs    The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J  Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   her Honour s discussion at     under the heading  Futility  deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified   In my view  this case falls squarely within the first category of case articulated by Burchett J in One Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   The appropriate order is that the second respondent pay the applicant s costs  any such costs to be taxed in default of agreement      I certify that the preceding thirty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSmith v Airservices Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In broad terms  the Federal Court Rules provide that where a party discontinues proceedings without the leave of the Court  the discontinuing party is liable to pay costs  unless the Court orders otherwise  see O   r   and   and O   r    No such rule is provided for where a proceeding is discontinued with the leave of the Court  although the starting point in principle is that the discontinuing party should meet the costs of the respondent  see Smith v Airservices Australia   FCA         FCR   per Stone J at     However  the starting point in resolving the issue is this case  namely who should bear the costs when a proceeding has been resolved by the making of consent orders  must be to consider the extent to which the ACCC succeeded in obtaining the relief that was initially sought  In that regard  the position is clear  Mr Spencer consented to the making of declarations by the Court that a series of agreements entered into by Contact Plus constituted  franchise agreements  within the meaning of clause   of the Code  He also consented to the making of declarations that Contact Plus had contravened the Code and therefore s  AD of the Act   by failing to provide disclosure documents  and by failing to receive written and signed statements by the franchisees  as required  In addition  he consented to the making of directions regarding the termination of these franchise agreements  and other breaches of the Code   The Court also declared  by consent  that Contact Plus had engaged in conduct that contravened ss   and    g  of the Act regarding the representations made concerning the licence fee of   and the right of a franchisee to an area that was exclusive to that franchisee  Mr Spencer was declared to have aided  abetted  counselled or procured these contraventions of the Act   and to have been directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in  or party to  those contraventions   A statement of agreed facts was appended to the consent orders that were sought  That statement contains findings of fact for the purposes of s   of the Act    Finally  Mr Spencer agreed to injunctions in the terms sought  which would run for a period of three years from the date of the order made  He accepted orders that required him to provide each person with whom Contact Plus had entered into an agreement similar in terms to those of the franchise agreements that were the subject of this proceeding with a disclosure document that complied with the requirements of the Code  and a copy of the orders of the Court   The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J  Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   her Honour s discussion at     under the heading  Futility  deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified
