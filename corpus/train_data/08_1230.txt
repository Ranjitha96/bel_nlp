these reasons and those outlined in     above  the findings of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate s Court reveal no error citedSathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The notice of appeal filed on   May   contains four grounds of appeal  As was the case in the court below  the grounds of appeal do not appear to relate to the Tribunal s decision  The grounds are cast in very general terms and lack particulars  Moreover  apart from the first ground  they fail to identify any error in the judgment of his Honour below which is properly the subject of the appeal  Instead  they invite this Court to re consider the reasons of the Tribunal  Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at      The Minister filed written submissions dealing with each of the grounds of appeal in the terms set out in     below   The first ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in failing to find that the Tribunal erred when it  wrongly applied the law to the facts as found in relation to the seriousness of harm that constitutes persecution as a member of a particular social group or religious persecution   As his Honour noted  this allegation appeared to relate to another case  as the appellant did not make claims to fear persecution on the basis of his religion or membership of a particular social group  Further  the Tribunal did not make any findings as to the seriousness of the harm the appellant claimed to fear  because it could not be satisfied  on the limited evidence before it that the claimed harm had in fact occurred  The Minister submitted that it was for the appellant to make out his case to the Tribunal  but he failed to do so   The second ground of appeal appears to raise three complaints  First  the appellant claims that the Tribunal failed to provide  more opportunity to respond   The appellants did not appear at the scheduled Tribunal hearing on   August   and did not request that the hearing be adjourned or re scheduled  In any event  the Tribunal complied with the statutory requirements and was entitled to determine the matter pursuant to s  A of the Act   The second ground of appeal also alleges that the Tribunal generalised the appellant s claims and failed to carry out the  real chance  test  The essential basis of the Tribunal s decision was the inability of the Tribunal to reach the state of satisfaction to grant the appellant a protection visa as required by s   and s   of the Act  The Minister submitted that the Tribunal clearly set out and considered the claims advanced by the appellant and ultimately rejected them because it was unable to reach the requisite state of satisfaction required by the Act citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The second ground could also be seen as an allegation that the Tribunal failed to comply with the requirements of s  A of the Act  As was the case before his Honour below  the Minister submitted that the appellant has failed to identify any  information  for the purposes of s  A  The reason for the Tribunal s decision was simply the general nature of the appellant s claims and lack of details identifying that the appellant had suffered any harassment  persecution or harm for a Convention related reason  Such matters are thought processes and not within the scope of s  A l  SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA         ALR   at     SZEFM v Minister for Immigration
