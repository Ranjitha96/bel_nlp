relevant original jurisdiction consideredMinister for Immigration v Eshetu   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I have emphasised the words  is satisfied  in the definition of  spouse  because they indicate that one of the  facts  upon the existence of which the Minister s power to grant this type of visa is conditioned is a state of Ministerial  satisfaction  in respect of specified criteria  The following observations of Gummow J in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu   HCA         CLR   at         are therefore apposite   The  jurisdictional fact  upon the presence of which jurisdiction is conditioned  need not be a  fact  in the ordinary meaning of that term  The precondition or criterion may consist of various elements and whilst the phrase  jurisdictional fact  is an awkward one in such circumstances it will  for convenience  be retained in what follows  In Bankstown Municipal Council v Fripp  Isaacs and Rich JJ pointed out that  with the object of preventing litigation on questions of jurisdictional fact  the legislature may introduce into the criterion elements of opinion or belief by the decision maker      A determination that the decision maker is not  satisfied  that an applicant answers a statutory criterion which must be met before the decision maker is empowered or obliged to confer a statutory privilege or immunity goes to the jurisdiction of the decision maker and is reviewable under s  v  of the Constitution     internal footnote references omitted  To this Gummow J added in Eshetu   supra at      This passage is consistent with the proposition that  where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ  it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at the decision in question  It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies  or  with other matters  goes to establish or to deny  that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way   Later in his judgement in Eshetu   supra at       Gummow J stated   Where the issue whether a statutory power was enlivened turns upon the further question of whether the requisite satisfaction of the decision maker was arrived at reasonably  I would not adopt the criterion advanced by Lord Wilberforce  I would prefer the scrutiny of the written statement provided under s   by a criterion of  reasonableness review   This would reflect the significance attached earlier in these reasons to the passage extracted from the judgment of Gibbs J in Buck v Bavone  It would permit review in cases where the satisfaction of the decision maker was based on findings or inferences of fact which were not supported by some probative material or logical grounds  consideredBuck v Bavone   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A  satisfaction  based administrative decision is amenable to judicial review on one or more of the bases described by Gibbs J  as his Honour then was  in Buck v Bavone   HCA         CLR   at      In all such cases the authority must act in good faith  it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously  Moreover  a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account  Even if none of these things can be established  the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it  However  where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways  or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached   Later in his judgement in Eshetu   supra at       Gummow J stated   Where the issue whether a statutory power was enlivened turns upon the further question of whether the requisite satisfaction of the decision maker was arrived at reasonably  I would not adopt the criterion advanced by Lord Wilberforce  I would prefer the scrutiny of the written statement provided under s   by a criterion of  reasonableness review

Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There is no want of logicality in the Tribunal s reasons  Those reasons discharge the statutory obligation with respect to reasons cast on the tribunal by s   of the Migration Act   as the learned Magistrate correctly concluded  The Tribunal s absence of  satisfaction  was based on evidence  not  as the Appellant contended  suspicion

HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Appellant contends that the Tribunal should have referred in its reasons to receipts  letters  statutory declarations made by the Appellant  his spouse and their friends  utility bills  photographs and two home videos  The law does not require this  The Tribunal is not obliged  to give a line by line refutation of the evidence for the claimant either generally or in those respects where there is evidence that is contrary to findings of material fact made by the Tribunal  Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA         ALJR   at       Appeal ground   fails   Prior to reaching its decision the Tribunal sent to the Appellant a letter dated   August   in which attention was drawn to and comment invited upon there being little substantive evidence in   of a then continuing relationship  to the notes of field visits  copies of which were enclosed  to the claimed matrimonial residence which it was said raised doubts as to whether the Appellant and his wife resided together or were in a spousal relationship  to the Appellant s inconsistencies in response at interview as mentioned in the Ministerial delegate s reasons  to an absence of spousal identification on tax returns  to the Appellant s having bills sent to his aunt s address  to his wife s having purchased a house in her own name and to the Appellant s residing regularly at his aunt s house   The delegate had noted  inter alia  of the Appellant s responses at interview   the sponsor was emphatic that she did not want children  whereas  in the record of a previous hearing in the Tribunal  she had been recorded as saying that she and the Appellant   love each other and plan to have children
