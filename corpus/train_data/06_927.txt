SZEXQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appellant submits that the above conclusion is partly derived from information contained in the statement accompanying the appellant s application for a protection visa relating to the political activities of the appellant s family  The appellant s application for a protection visa was not provided to the Tribunal by the applicant and accordingly  s  A  applied to that statement  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry   FCA         FCR      The respondent submits that the reasons for decision suggest that the appellant provided this information to the Tribunal  The respondent points in particular to the Tribunal s comments that     At the hearing before me the Applicant repeated that all his family had been involved in the PPP   The respondent also refers to the following paragraph     The Applicant said that as a member of the students  union and the PPP he had been engaged in welfare work  helping poor people and poor students with books and money  He said that he had campaigned for the PPP in the general election which the PPP had won  in   although the Applicant could not remember the year  and in the general election in   which the PPP lost to the PML  He said that his local MNA had been from the PPP between   and   but that at the election in   the PML candidate had been elected  The Applicant said that he himself had stood in the election for local bodies in the late  s  which he said had been held on a non party basis  He said  however  that he had not been elected because the PML was in power  consideredMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam and Ors   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appellant submits that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider that elections were to be held in October   in which the PML might have been successful  in which case the appellant may have faced a real chance of future persecution  The appellant submits that the word  suggest  in Tribunal s statement that   the Applicant did not leave Pakistan until the late  s  which does not suggest that he was being persecuted by reason of his involvement in the intervening period   is indicative of a tentative finding by the Tribunal  The appellant relies upon a passage in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam and Ors   FCA         FCR   at       in which Sackville J states     It can be seen from this passage that if the RRT finds that it is only slightly more probable than not that an alleged relevant event had not occurred  it must take into account the chance that it did occur when determining whether there was a well founded fear of persecution         If  on the other hand  it appears that the RRT had no  real doubt  that its findings were correct  it is not bound to consider whether those findings might be wrong    original emphasis  The appellant says that since the Tribunal observed that the PML had been ousted in a coup in   in determining that there was no real chance that the appellant would be persecuted if he were to return to Pakistan now or in the reasonably foreseeable future  it was obliged to consider the possible changed circumstances following the election   I do not consider that the word   suggest   in its context  shows that the Tribunal was ambivalent in its conclusion that the appellant had been persecuted between   and the time when he left Pakistan by reason of his involvement in the PPP  I am satisfied that its finding was not attended by any significant doubt  Accordingly  I reject the submission of the appellant that the Tribunal should have adopted the approach referred to in Rajalingam    With respect to the second ground  the Rajalingam argument  I am not satisfied that leave should be granted  The law relating to this ground was not uncertain at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court  and the appellant was represented at that hearing  This point should have been taken before the Federal Magistrates Court if the appellant wished to challenge the Tribunal s finding on this ground  Further  for the reasons expressed above  I do not consider there is any merit in this ground of appeal  Accordingly  I refuse leave to rely upon the second ground in the amended notice of appeal   It follows from the above that the appellant succeeds on the first ground of the amended notice of appeal  Accordingly I will remit the matter to the Tribunal for reconsideration  and award costs to the appellant in these proceedings     I certify that the preceding forty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The respondent says that the appellant did not argue before the Tribunal that the result of the election might lead to a greater risk of persecution in the future and that it would be an unreasonable standard to require the Tribunal to consider this claim in the absence of argument  The respondent refers to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         ALR   at       which sets out the extent of the obligation upon a Tribunal to consider unarticulated claims  At   the Court observed that     It has been suggested that the unarticulated claim must be raised  squarely  on the material available to the tribunal before it has a statutory duty to consider it  SDAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     FCR     ALR     FCAFC   at   per Cooper J  The use of the adverb  squarely  does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the tribunal  Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the tribunal    The respondent says that the significance of the forthcoming election was not raised squarely as an issue by the material before the Tribunal distinguishedNAOA v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  This raises the question whether  in these circumstances  the appellant was required to prove conclusively  by tendering the transcript  that he did not provide information orally to the Tribunal from which it could have gleaned his approximate departure date  The respondent says that  in the absence of a transcript  the Court cannot conclude that such information was not provided by the appellant to the Tribunal at the hearing  The respondent says that the onus lies upon the appellant to provide the transcript as proof that the information was not provided to the Tribunal orally  and in the absence of the transcript  it is not open to the Court to infer that the information was not provided  see NAOA v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Beaumont  Merkel and Hely JJ   The Full Court in NAOA was dealing with a claim of procedural unfairness  based upon the fact that certain matters had not been put to the appellant at the Tribunal hearing  The Full Court observed at        For one thing  as the respondent submitted  the appellant s case is premised upon an assumption  that was also made by the learned Magistrate  albeit on a tentative basis  namely  that the Tribunal had not raised the issue of the authenticity of certain documents with the appellant at the hearing  However  his Honour did not make a finding in relation to this matter  Driver FM observed that this  appeared  to be the case  from the record of the  Tribunal  decision   On the evidence before his Honour  it was not open to him to have made a finding that this issue had not been canvassed  His Honour had no transcript   As mentioned  the tape is before us and we refer to it below   The appellant had not given any evidence  in affidavit form or orally  to the effect that this issue had not been raised  There was simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding  His reasons should not be read as if he did so  In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing  the appellant has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise  thus he has not  in our opinion  established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice   The situation in the present case is different from the position in NAOA   In NAOA   the Court found that there was no evidence which indicated whether the matter had been raised with the appellant by the Tribunal  In the present case  however  the Tribunal s reasons for decision clearly record that the appellant was questioned with respect to his departure date but was unable to provide that information to the Tribunal orally  The reasons specifically refer to information contained in the application form  The Tribunal s reasons themselves are evidence which suggests that the Tribunal did not receive the evidence orally from the appellant  but instead relied upon a document to which obligations under s  A  and   applied   I consider that the appellant was entitled to rely upon the reasons as evidence that the information had not been provided under s  A b   The reasons directly touched upon the subject under dispute  If the transcript indicated a different position  then it was open to the respondent to tender it  However  in the absence of the transcript  the reasons of the Tribunal themselves provide  in my opinion  sufficient evidence for me to arrive at a conclusion that the information had not been provided to the Tribunal by the appellant as contemplated by s  A b    This is not to say that in all  or even most cases  it will be sufficient for the appellant to rely upon the reasons for the Tribunal alone  It is not the obligation of the Tribunal to refer in its reasons to the source of each part of the information upon which it relies  The present appeal is a rare case in which the Tribunal has specifically referred in its reasons to the very source of the information under consideration  Where the Court is unable directly to draw a conclusion from a Tribunal s reasons as to the source of the Tribunal s information  it is ultimately the responsibility of an appellant to ensure the transcript is provided if he or she wishes to argue that the information could only have been sourced from documents to which obligations under s  A  and   applied   Nonetheless  the Tribunal s reasons for decision themselves should not be ignored as evidence of the source of the Tribunal s information  The Full Court in NAOA   in noting that the appellant had not provided oral or affidavit evidence on the issue  explicitly recognised that there were forms of evidence other than the transcript which might enable a conclusion to be drawn about the oral evidence given at the Tribunal hearing  Since it may not always be clear when a conclusion can be reached upon the reasons alone  I consider it would be prudent to tender the transcript in all cases where a breach of s  A is relied upon  or to incorporate the transcript into the appeal book where such a ground is raised followedSAAP and Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant acknowledges that he was represented by Counsel in the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court  and that the points now sought to be raised by the amended notice of appeal were not raised before that Court  However  the appellant argues that the effect of s  A of the Migration Act was uncertain at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court  The appellant says when the Federal Magistrates Court hearing took place  no decision of the Federal Court had been given which upheld a challenge under s  A based upon the combined effects of the decision in SAAP and Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   and the decision in Al Shamry   Further  the appellant says that leave was granted in a similar situation in each of the five appeals under consideration in SZEEU   Counsel for the respondent says that the law was not uncertain at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court  Al Shamry was handed down in July   and SAAP was handed down in May   well before the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court in August    He submits that the Court is limited under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  to hear appeals on the ground of errors in a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court followedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In this case  however  the reasons themselves directly point to the conclusion that the Tribunal relied upon information from the application form  in circumstances where that information had not been provided by the appellant orally at the hearing  The Tribunal did not provide this information to the appellant in writing as required by s  A a  and s  A of the Migration Act   It follows that  in accordance with the decision in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     the Tribunal did not comply with the requirements of s  A   The appellant acknowledges that he was represented by Counsel in the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court  and that the points now sought to be raised by the amended notice of appeal were not raised before that Court  However  the appellant argues that the effect of s  A of the Migration Act was uncertain at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court  The appellant says when the Federal Magistrates Court hearing took place  no decision of the Federal Court had been given which upheld a challenge under s  A based upon the combined effects of the decision in SAAP and Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   and the decision in Al Shamry   Further  the appellant says that leave was granted in a similar situation in each of the five appeals under consideration in SZEEU   I am satisfied that the law relating to s  A of the Migration Act had not been settled when the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court took place  Since the hearing  the law has been clarified by the decision in SZEEU   The first issue relied upon by the appellant in the amended notice of appeal relies specifically upon the law as decided in SZEEU   I accept there would be some prejudice to the respondent by reason of the continuation of the proceedings if leave were granted  However if leave were not granted  the prejudice to the appellant  who would face removal to Pakistan without having had his application for asylum determined according to correct legal principles  would be greater   For the reasons given above  I consider that one aspect of the appellant s claim under s  A would succeed if leave were granted  Accordingly  I consider that leave with respect to the first ground of appeal in the amended notice of appeal should be granted
