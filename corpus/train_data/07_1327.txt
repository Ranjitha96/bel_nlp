Re MetLife Insurance Limited   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedRe MetLife Insurance Limited and Challenger Life No    Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section   and s   and reg   impose requirements as to the giving notice of the Scheme and other procedural matters  On   June   dispensation with certain requirements was granted pursuant to s   of the Act   Re MetLife Insurance Limited and Challenger Life No    Limited   FCA    I was carefully taken through the evidence by senior counsel for each of the applicants and was satisfied that there had been compliance with all requirements  The only debatable issue concerned typographical errors in the Scheme s summary  I was also satisfied that the Scheme complies with s   and that there was no issue with the mechanics of it   The requirements of the giving of notice and some other steps taken such as telephone hotlines  websites  and so on generated a modest level of inquiry and express or implied objection from a relatively small number of policy holders  including some beneficiaries of the MetLife Retirement Fund  Some objections were misconceived and can be ignored  The only objections of substance related to the position of the affected MetLife policy holders  They were summarised as follows           Concern that the Standard   Poor s rating is dropping from  AA   with MetLife to  A  with Challenger        Policyholder looking for security for a bulk of their retirement money concerned that Challenger is a third tier institution            Concern about the quality of the underlying instruments of Challenger             Concern that the security of Challenger is not as good as that of Metlife             Concern about Challenger s asset allocation being too risky             Concern that unlike Metlife  Challenger invests funds in the stock market                 Concern that having started with the largest bank in the world  Citigroup  the policy is about to be transferred to Challenger which had a loss of   billion   years ago         Concern that the Joint Actuarial Report only concludes that policyholders  benefit security will remain  adequate          Policyholder looking to diversify placed a portion of their funds with Metlife and the remainder with Challenger  Concern that the transfer will result in the whole amount being placed with the one company         Concern that Challenger may be a takeover target following newspaper speculations         Concern that   return reflected a secure investment and policyholders are now being asked to assume a greater risk    One objector appeared on the hearing  The essence of his position was as follows       I served   years continuous service with the one organisation  In February   upon advice from a senior Westpac financial adviser  I entered into a contract with Citicorp at the time for a capital guarantee type of investment  very low yield and very high security  I chose to accept this low yield  because that was the overriding my overriding decision was security of investment  At the time  I could have invested with Challenger at a higher yield          MetLife is higher rated than Challenger with the standard  claims  rating as double A minus for MetLife  and A or A plus for Challenger  Now  I don t understand the details of any of that other than one is higher rated than the other and  as an investor  that s all I need to know  It is unreasonable  in my view  and unethical that I should be forced into a lower rated financial institution  I see that as security being taken away from me  Throughout this morning  the counsels for MetLife repeatedly emphasise that there is no disadvantage to policyholders affected by this transfer  In my view  that s not correct  How can that be when there is a greater risk to policyholders  investments at no greater return  So there is a disadvantage  as I see it      He also drew attention to the fact that he could only redeem at a significant discount  It is relevant to note that some policies may be redeemed without discount appliedMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko
