W     Farquharson v Morgan     QB         consideredColac Otway Workforce Pty Ltd v Dwyer   VSCA  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  html  The transfer order was a mistake  When a plaintiff claims a sum by way of damages which is greater than the sum which a court of inferior jurisdiction is entitled to award  the case should not be transferred to the inferior court unless  perhaps  it is quite clear that the amount claimed will not be recovered  Indeed  where an action is commenced in an inferior court and it appears to that court that the damages which a plaintiff seeks exceed the limit which the inferior court is able to award  it is the duty of that court to transfer the case to a court of competent jurisdiction  Here it is true that the prosecutrix had not stated definitely that her claim exceeded    It was  I suppose  possible that she may have limited her claim to one that could be entertained by the Federal Magistrates Court  But that possibility was so remote that the action should not have been transferred  Nothing said in Colac Otway Workforce Pty Ltd v Dwyer   VSCA   is inconsistent with this view citedDerrick v Williams     TLR   When the action was
