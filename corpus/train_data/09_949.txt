Medrad Inc v Alpine Medical Pty Ltd   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe principles governing the grant of interlocutory relief are settled  On application for an interlocutory injunction  the applicants must show that   a  there is a serious question to be tried in respect of the actual or threatened infringement of the patent in suit  and   b  the balance of convenience favours the grant of an interlocutory injunction  including that an award of damages would not be an adequate remedy for the irreparable harm the applicants would suffer if an interlocutory injunction were not granted  In order to demonstrate that there is a serious question to be tried  the applicants must make out a prima facie case in the sense that  if the evidence remains the same  then there is a probability that at trial they will be found entitled to relief  As Gummow and Hayne JJ explained in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at              it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial   Their Honours added at      the governing consideration  is  that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought   Gyles J rejected a submission to the effect that the decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   had restored the authority of Beecham in this regard  His Honour noted  correctly in my view  that the reaffirmation of Beecham by the High Court in O Neill concerned the elucidation of what is required for a prima facie case  or serious question to be tried  discussedBeecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe respondent s submission that  in a patent infringement case such as this  where the validity of the patent is challenged  the practice of the court is to refuse an interlocutory injunction depended on Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      In Beecham   Kitto  Taylor  Menzies and Owen JJ referred  at   to  the special considerations which generally arise in a patent action where there is a substantial issue to be tried as to the validity of the patent   Their Honours  at     said     T he plaintiff s prima facie case must be a strong one so far as the question of validity is concerned  for he asserts a monopoly and must give more proof of the right he claims than is afforded by the mere granting of the patent     The general practice in that kind of case has long been to refuse an interlocutory injunction unless either the patent has already been judicially held to be valid or it has stood unchallenged for a long period     In Genrx   IPR at         Gyles J again considered the ongoing significance of Beecham for the grant of interlocutory injunctions in cases of alleged patent infringement  As his Honour observed  after American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd   UKHL       AC     there was a good deal of discussion about the importance of apparent differences between American Cyanamid and Beecham   His Honour continued  at       The most influential consideration of the issue in relation to patents was that by Gummow J in Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR    In the course of that judgment his Honour pointed out that the authorities referred to by the High Court in Beecham Group for not attributing great significance to the grant of a patent were old cases from England based upon a different system for grant than that which had developed in Australia by that time  The system of examination of patents prior to grant in Australia was more stringent than had been the case in England the century before  The practical effect of this decision was to give greater weight to the grant of a patent thereafter than might have been deduced from Beecham Group   Gyles J rejected a submission to the effect that the decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   had restored the authority of Beecham in this regard  His Honour noted  correctly in my view  that the reaffirmation of Beecham by the High Court in O Neill concerned the elucidation of what is required for a prima facie case  or serious question to be tried   The applicants submitted that the respondent got itself into this situation with its eyes wide open  As noted above  Ms Evans  evidence was that representatives of Shenzhen Ant had said that there were no patents that would cause any issue for the respondent in selling syringes in Australia  The applicants argued that the respondent ought to have checked the position for itself  That is  the respondent has offered for sale or sold the syringes in the knowledge that they were the subject of a patent  or in circumstances where the respondent should have known of the patent  A consideration of this kind has been weighed in the balance of convenience from time to time  see Beecham   CLR at   Tidy Tea

Ltd v Sanofi Aventis   FCA         IPR     and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         IPR    The reason for the change in practice is that the legislative requirements for grant of a patent are more exacting than they once were and include provision for opposition proceedings before the grant  In AB Hassle   IPR at     Ashley J specifically rejected a submission similar to that made by the respondent in this case and held that  where the defendant challenged the validity of the patent  it was for the defendant to establish a triable question in respect of validity  If a strong case for invalidity was provisionally made out  then  as his Honour said  this factor would be relevant to the exercise of discretion referred toGenrx Pty Ltd v Sanofi Aventis   FCA         IPR

had been the case in England the century before  The practical effect of this decision was to give greater weight to the grant of a patent thereafter than might have been deduced from Beecham Group   Further  Mr Reynolds  evidence is that  if the respondent is permitted to sell the syringes in issue  there will be what Gyles J called  interference with     trade patterns  see Genrx at     and Interpharma at      That is  If the respondent is permitted to continue supplying its syringes at a price that is approximately   less than Imaxeon s price  then Imaxeon would probably be compelled to lower the price for its equivalent syringes or lose its customer base  There is a real risk that if it held to its higher price  this would damage its reputation and have ramifications when a customer came to purchase or upgrade their injector system  If Imaxeon is compelled to lower the price for its syringes  the price reduction would probably be permanent  even if Imaxeon succeeded at trial  and result in a significant overall loss of revenue which would be very difficult to quantify  Any price increase would compromise Imaxeon s reputation and goodwill and the chances of securing new customers in a market where prices are either stable or declining  By regularly supplying their customers with replacement syringes  Imaxeon retains regular contact with the applicants  customers  This confers various advantages  including that Imaxeon is foremost in the customer s mind when the time arrives to replace an injector system  Imaxeon would likely suffer a loss of reputation if there were defects in the respondent s syringes because the defects would affect the operation of the injector system   I note that  in argument  the applicants did not invite the court to give this consideration a great deal of weight since there was no evidence of defects in the respondent s syringes  The respondent noted that the applicants had presented little detailed evidence on pricing and the effects of competition  The respondent noted that Mr Reynolds  affidavit established that  in any event  the major suppliers of injector systems compete against one another on the cost of the injector systems and consumables and that the prices for the applicants  syringes broadly reflect the pricing for other CT contrast injector systems  It followed  so the respondent said  that price competition was a feature of the market and that the applicants were already competing with the respondent  which was supplying syringes to competing systems  The respondent noted that the applicants had not yet lowered their prices as a result of the respondent s entry into the market  Further  the respondent challenged Mr Reynolds  evidence that any price reduction would be permanent and  in this regard  referred to Ms Evans  evidence that this had not been her experience in the business of Jacobs Medical Australia Pty Ltd  The respondent observed that  in elaborating on the harm likely to befall their business  the applicants had engaged in a degree of speculation  I accept that evidence about the nature of the competition in the medical injector systems and associated consumables market and the effect of new entrants might well be complex  Obtaining complete evidence of this kind would be expensive and probably unjustified for this application  It is undisputed that the applicants occupy a large proportion of the present market  and derive a large proportion of their revenue from the sales of consumables for the contrast injector systems  particularly KLIKFIT
