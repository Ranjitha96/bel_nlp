Etl v Kliger Partners   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedDecor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The principles are well established  A Court which is asked to grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision must first determine whether  in all the circumstances  the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered  Secondly  it must consider whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision to be wrong  see Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR    Mr Etl has advanced no argument at all which suggests that his Honour made any error in the exercise of his discretion to refuse the adjournment sought on   December     Even if the draft notice of appeal is to be understood as an attempt to commence an appeal from the whole of his Honour s judgment which includes the affirmation of the sequestration order  no error is established  given that the making of those orders was not opposed and no argument was directed to his Honour designed to persuade him that the Registrar had erred in making the sequestration order  Accordingly  I am not persuaded that his Honour s decision is attended by any doubt and there is  therefore  no occasion for it to be reconsidered on appeal   Moreover  no substantial injustice will result for Mr Etl in the event that leave is refused because he will remain free to pursue the inquiries which he has been undertaking with a view to obtaining fresh evidence which  if it is obtained  may enable him to make application to the Court for the sequestration order to be set aside  That is a matter for the future   There is  therefore  nothing to be gained by enlarging time for the filing and serving of a notice of appeal   The application should be dismissed  I will hear the parties on costs   I certify that the preceding thirteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY    Associate Dated    May   Counsel for Applicant  Applicant appeared in person Counsel for Respondent  Mr M Barrett Solicitor for Respondent  Kliger Partners Counsel for Trustee in Bankruptcy   Mr A Cox Solicitor for Trustee in Bankruptcy  Pointon Partners   Date of Hearing    April       Date of Judgment    April             AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
