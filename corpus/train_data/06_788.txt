the submissions of counsel for the first respondent  The Tribunal afforded the applicant a merits review and it was not  therefore  required to address any alleged denial of procedural fairness before the delegate   Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at    Humayun      Counsel for the applicant said that the Tribunal had received the response dated   May   from the University referring to the applicant s  semester weighted average  as being unsatisfactory for semester   of   but that response had also stated that the applicant was no longer terminated and was granted a  reprieve  of conditional status  Counsel submitted that the Tribunal treated the applicant s conditional status as of no significance and relied only on the reference in the response to the applicant s  semester weighted average  as being conclusive that the University had not certified the applicant s academic result to be satisfactory   In Humayun at   Wilcox J  with whom Conti and Stone JJ agreed  confirmed that the education provider has a  measure of discretion  as to what level of academic performance is satisfactory for the purposes of providing a certificate in respect of Condition    However  Wilcox J  with whom Conti J agreed  drew a distinction between a decision made by the education provider in relation to whether an academic result was at least satisfactory and a decision made in relation to the status of a student  At   Wilcox J  with whom Conti J agreed  said     I see no inconsistency in an educational institution saying to a student  whether simultaneously or at different times         i   we will allow you to continue your course       ii   your academic results to date are unsatisfactory         On   January   the University made the first statement to the appellant  on   February   it made the second   In that case  the majority found that the University s letter of   January   did not constitute a certification by the provider which met the requirements of Condition     The case which the applicant put to the Tribunal was that he accepted that his academic result was unsatisfactory  but that after having given the matter some consideration he had decided to appeal against his terminated status on the grounds that he had only three subjects left to do for his degree  It is apparent that the Tribunal was conscious of the requirement to consider only the question of whether the education provider had certified that the applicant had achieved an academic result that was at least satisfactory  as opposed to any decision of the University in relation to the academic status of the applicant  It cannot be said that  in so doing  the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question  The Tribunal had considerable sympathy for the plight of the applicant but came to the view that the letter from the University of   April   and the email response of   May   from the University did not comprise a certificate to the effect that the academic result was  at least satisfactory   It cannot be said that in coming to that view  the Tribunal misconceived the material from the University  The letter of   April   refers only to the student s academic status  The email response from the University of   May   itself draws a distinction between the applicant s academic result and his academic status  The email does not certify that the applicant s appeal has led to the  academic result  being reclassified as  at least satisfactory   The email records that the  semester weighted average  result was  unsatisfactory  and says that the appeal resulted in a  reprieve  in the academic status to  conditional  citedBaidakova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for the applicant submitted that the cases of Baidakova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   and Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   support the contention that an education provider can take into account discretionary factors when determining whether an applicant s academic result has been  at least satisfactory  citedWeerasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for the applicant submitted that the cases of Baidakova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   and Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   support the contention that an education provider can take into account discretionary factors when determining whether an applicant s academic result has been  at least satisfactory  citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  I also reject the contention of the applicant that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to make inquiries as to whether or not the University s letter and email response meant that the University was thereby certifying that the academic result was  at least satisfactory   There is no absolute obligation on the Tribunal to make inquiry   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu   FCAFC         FCR    Once it is recognised that a distinction is to be drawn between a student achieving an academic result that is certified to be  at least satisfactory  and the academic status accorded to a student  there was no ambiguity in relation to the material from the University and  therefore  no reason for the Tribunal to embark upon any inquiry of the University   I find  therefore  that the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error  It follows that the application must be dismissed with costs     I certify that the preceding forty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
