current information available   I reject that argument  The report failed to identify why  or give any reason for finding that  the non injurious price was set at the level it was for Siam  In essence  the Report simply assumed that once it had found dumping  material injury was either caused or threatened by the dumping  That appears from the statements in the Report referring to the fact that Dow and Siam made a submission for revocation on   January     days later than the   days allowed for submissions after the initial advertisement in s  ZC d   After this  Customs visited Siam in Thailand in February   and obtained all information from it that was required  Yet the Report said the following in relation to what was in the statement of essential facts   However  Customs notes that dumping is another relevant factor  Customs found that exports to Australia by  Siam  over the review period were at dumped prices  As the issue of revocation was only raised when the review was significantly advanced  Customs was unable to evaluate and form a view on all other factors relevant to whether the measures should be revoked     emphasis added Similarly  the final assessment in the Report asserted that Customs   examination of the factors relevant to revocation would have been more extensive  had Dow and Siam indicated earlier that this was sought appliedFoster v Minister for

am of opinion that the consideration of the essential matters of material injury  threat recurrence and causation had to be considered on a review in order to determine  among other things  how to set a non injurious price  whether or not an affected person argued for revocation  Where the Australian industry has suffered  or is likely to suffer  detriment from a number of causes  the Minister must first quantitatively  but as part of a practical exercise  separate the detriment caused or threatened by factors other than the dumping of the exported goods  Only then can the Minister determine whether he or she is satisfied that the dumping itself has caused  is causing or is threatening to cause material injury to the Australian industry  ICI Australia   FCR at         per Black CJ  Neaves

Australia by Siam was not addressed by the respondents  argument  The selection of the figures for these variable factors in the confidential sections of Report   had not been explained  Rather those figures were mere assertions that appeared to be contrary to the express findings in the Report of the operation of the market and the increasing strength of Qenos  The aim of Art     of the implementation agreement is to ensure that anti dumping duty      shall remain in force only so long as and to the extent necessary to counteract dumping which is causing injury   That aim is reflected in s  TACA a s requirements for setting a non injurious price  The necessity for such a price to be set for Siam at the level it was by the Minister s declaration was not explained in the

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhen the declaration is made under s  ZDB  the Minister must consider  or have regard to  the most up to date information available  The Act requires the Minister to form a judgment about the current circumstances and future consequences of the importation of the relevant goods  This is so for the following reasons  First  the review is intended to consider the impact of changed circumstances in a market affected by the operation of a notice under s  TG   whether in its original or a varied form   s  SM   That requires consideration of the current circumstances that formed the basis for the review identified by ss  ZA b  and  ZC b  namely a change in a variable factor or the current absence of justification for the Minister to take any

the Minister s  approach to  or the test that was applied in  making the determination under s  ZDB a   That is  the Minister did not make a positive decision that if the measures were revoked the dumping found  first  would occur in circumstances where Qenos would  or would be likely  to suffer any material injury or  secondly  that the dumping would  or would be likely  to cause that material injury  Here  all the prices for the product had increased so that the previous calculations and bases upon which anti dumping duty had been fixed had no relevance to the current trading of the product in Australia  In addition  Report   found Qenos  business relating to the product had performed strongly in the review period and the volume of dumped goods was small relative to total imports and the Australian market as a whole  The CEO had concluded that all the dumped goods  of which Siam s were only a part       had a limited effect on Australian industry selling prices in the review period   This must be read in light of the express admission in the respondents  defence that there was no evidence or other material before either of them of any injury to Qenos caused by Siam s eports  The Correct Test Yet  under s  ZDB a  the Minister s discretion as to what information  in addition to the report of the CEO  is relevant to making a declaration  is not absolute  First  in

the test applied by the CEO and the Minister that they be satisfied  that dumping would not cause material injury if the measures were revoked  was not open to them  That was a jurisdictional error  In Report   the CEO asserted that Customs had examined the Australian market for the product to test whether the Australian industry s selling prices were affected by dumping  Its conclusion was that      the dumped goods had a limited effect on Australian industry selling prices in the review period   The Report selected those selling prices as the unsuppressed selling price  It then used that unsuppressed selling price to calculate the non injurious price  It is not enough for a decision maker to give cursory consideration only to put to one side matters which the statute requires him or

the causal link between injury and dumped imports  If  in the context of a review of such a causal link  the only injury under examination is injury that may recur following revocation   i e    future rather than present injury  an investigating authority must necessarily be examining whether that future injury would be caused by dumping with a commensurately prospective timeframe     Construction of Div   of Pt XVB of the Act s requirements on a review In s  SM  the Parliament identified that Pt XVB dealt with the taking of anti dumping measures in respect of goods whose importation into Australia involved a dumping of those goods      that injures  or threatens to injure  Australian industry   The Dumping Duty Act   likewise  imposed a duty  once a notice had been published under s  TG  equal to the difference between the normal value of the dumped goods and their export price  Evidently  the purpose of that rate of duty was to increase the price in Australia of the imported goods to a level where that importation did not injure or threaten to injure the Australian industry  And ss  SM   ZA   ZC  and   provided that Div   of Pt XVB gave a right to review that was conditioned on a demonstration by an applicant for review that there appeared to be reasonable grounds for asserting a change in circumstances that was material enough  if made out  to warrant a change  including revocation  of an existing notice  The filter provided in ss  ZA b  and  ZC  and   was that an applicant for review must  first  put forward a case for a review satisfying the statutory criteria and  secondly  the CEO must consider whether there are currently reasonable grounds for the assertion of changes to a relevant variable factor or that  had the existing anti dumping measures not been taken  the Minister would not be entitled to take such measures  The level of satisfaction of the CEO  at this point  was directed to there being sufficient in the application to justify investigation  The WTO Appellate Body decisions recognised that in a review  no single prescriptive test or methodology necessarily would apply  The considerations in each review will need to address the facts and circumstances of the particular anti dumping measures that are in place in the context of the current market and other factors  Oil Country Tubular Goods  AB     at     US

Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina  AB    The respondents argued that the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organisation had rejected Siam s construction of the relevant test on a review as requiring the Minister to be satisfied positively that  in the absence of measures  there would be dumping and that the dumping was causing or had caused material injury or that such injury was threatened in United States Sunset Reviews of Anti Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina  AB     at      The respondents argued that read fairly  the wrong test had not been applied and that  in terms  Customs had applied the correct test in its statement  quoted above    Customs interprets the test for revocation as whether  in the hypothetical situation of measures not being in place  there would now be grounds to impose the measures  In other words  if the measures were removed  is it likely that the exporter or exporters would cause material injury to the Australian industry The respondents also argued that because a notice is intended to remain in force for five years pursuant to s  TM  it would not be appropriate to construe the power to make a declaration on a review as turning merely on the absence of the material injury or dumping  since  in the proceeding   months  exporters may have been inhibited in their behaviour or taken action to remove the appearance of the threat  In Oil Country Tubular Goods  AB     at       the WTO Appellate Body analysed the differing processes applicable in the initial decision to impose measures and the issues involved  at that stage  in determining whether there was an injury  including a threatened injury  under Art   and the subsequent decision in a  sunset review  to continue measures at the end of the initial five year period contemplated in Art     and in ss  TM  and Div  A of Pt XVB  Siam s related case involves a  sunset review  Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs  No     FCA    The WTO Appellate Body concluded that in a sunset review Art     did not require that injury and likelihood of injury be determined again in accordance with Art    It found that for the purpose of determining that there was a likelihood of injury on a review  a decision maker did not have to undertake all of the analyses required by Art   in order for the decision maker to have a  sufficient factual basis  to arrive at a  reasoned conclusion  permitting a decision to continue measures at the end of the five year period  Oil Country Tubular Goods  AB     at      The WTO Appellate Body continued    This is not to say  however  that in a sunset review determination  an investigating authority is never required to examine any of the factors listed in the paragraphs of Article    Certain of the analyses mandated by Article   and necessarily relevant in an original investigation may prove to be probative  or possibly even required  in order for an investigating authority in a sunset review to arrive at a  reasoned conclusion   In this respect  we are of the view that the fundamental requirement of Article     that an injury determination be based on  positive evidence  and an  objective examination  would be equally relevant to likelihood determinations under Article       It seems to us that factors such as the volume  price effects  and the impact on the domestic industry of dumped imports  taking into account the conditions of competition  may be relevant to varying degrees in a given likelihood of injury determination  An investigating authority may also  in its own judgement  consider other factors contained in Article   when making a likelihood of injury determination  But the necessity of conducting such an analysis in a given case results from the requirement imposed by Article      not Article  that a likelihood of injury determination rest on a  sufficient factual basis  that allows the agency to draw  reasoned and adequate conclusions     emphasis added The WTO Appellate Body decided that it is necessary for a decision maker  on a review under Art     of the implementation agreement  to make a determination

Report   made no finding of any actual or threatened injury caused or likely to be caused by Siam s dumping  Instead  it simply asserted that on the available evidence the CEO could not be satisfied that dumping by Siam would not cause material injury if the measures were revoked  These concepts are reflected in ss  TG b  and  TAE A  and  B  and in the WTO Appellate Body s analysis of the

continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury  In drawing conclusions from that examination  the investigating authority must arrive at a reasoned determination resting on a sufficient factual basis  it may not rely on assumptions or conjecture  The CEO and the Minister had to consider whether any material injury to Qenos had been  or was being caused  or threatened by the dumping in determining whether to declare that s   of the Dumping Duty Act applied to Siam s exports of the product pursuant to the power to issue a notice under s  TG  or vary an existing declaration under s  ZDB  Because the three factors are necessary to be considered  dumping  injury and causation  the latter two cannot be presupposed merely by establishing the existence of the practice of dumping  Indeed  s  TAE A  prohibits such presupposition  And  Customs identified the very difficulty which this process of presupposition entailed  It noted that Qenos had performed strongly in a market where some dumping was observed but the volume of dumped goods was small relative to both total imports  bearing in mind that Qenos had been found by Customs to have had a larger market share than all of the imports combined
