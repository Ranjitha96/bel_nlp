Australian Securities   Investment Commission v Somerville   NSWSC   at       Dean Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at   Main Road Property Group Pty Ltd v Pelligra   Sons Pty Ltd at   Jendas Pty Ltd v Jolly     VR   at    In Australian Securities   Investment Commission v Somerville   Austin J observed that ASIC could  with the Court s encouragement  conduct its case in such a way that the days upon which the eighth defendant in that matter would need to be represented in court would be limited  Cost  delay and the efficient use of the resources of the parties and the Court The various factors which led Austin J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to recently allow a joinder of defendants by ASIC in Australian Securities   Investment Commission v Somerville are absent in the matter  There  Austin J  granted ASIC leave to join ten defendants in the one action  The first defendant was a Mr Somerville  The second defendant was the incorporated legal practice of which Mr Somerville had become a legal practitioner director  ASIC had contended that Mr Somerville had provided legal advice as a solicitor to each of the eight director defendants to the effect that they should sell the business or assets of a certain company to another purchaser company which each would control  The liability of Mr Somerville and his incorporated legal practice would only have arisen if contraventions by one or more of the other defendants were proved  It was the common participation of Mr Somerville as legal adviser that linked the transactions  Accordingly and most importantly  the cases against each of the eight director defendants were components of ASIC s case against Mr Somerville and his incorporated law firm for involvement in the contraventions by each director  It was  as his Honour found  an important part of ASIC s evidentiary case against Mr Somerville and his incorporated legal practice to show that  in respect of the eight transactions  there was a pattern and similarity devised by Mr Somerville    Accordingly  ASIC and Mr Somerville were common parties to all claims  There was considered to be a likely saving of costs to ASIC and Mr Somerville by one proceeding  constituted with all ten defendants  going to trial  There was likely to have been a very substantial repetition of evidence should there have been a separation of the case against one of the defendants as Mr Somerville would have had to give evidence in the trial of that case as well as the case against the balance of the defendants  It was  accordingly  concluded that as a primary factor in refusing a separation order that the benefits to ASIC and Mr Somerville of a single proceeding in which the evidence of his involvement in the eight transactions was received once and for all was considered as of great significance  In this case  however  the common thread passing through the cases against each of the corporate defendants and indeed the personal defendants is that each of these cases concerns transactions involving Firepower BVI shares  There is  otherwise  no relationship between the corporate defendants nor any between Sattvic and either Mr Ward or Mr Johnston  the sixth and seventh defendants respectively  I am satisfied that it would be inconvenient to Mr Stein  particularly professionally  for the case against him to be tried together with the cases against the other defendants  More importantly  given the already adverse effect of these proceedings upon his reputation I think that the inevitable delay of a trial as against his company  Sattvic  would of itself render an injustice to him  I would expect such delay to be considerable in the circumstances  In my opinion  for these reasons  the motion should be granted with costs  I will invite the parties to bring in a minute of order reflecting these reasons    I certify that the preceding thirty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

be represented in court would be limited  Cost  delay and the efficient use of the resources of the parties and the Court ASIC submits that it is in the public interest for a regulatory authority such as ASIC to be able to seek public relief in the most expeditious and cost effective way possible  by analogy  Dean Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at   where Austin J considered the public interest in a liquidator being able to recover unfair preferences expeditiously to be relevant  As I have said  I am not persuaded that a joint trial involving Sattvic is necessarily the most expeditious and cost effective way of disposing of this litigation  In any event  any possible public interest must be balanced against the legitimate private interests of Sattvic  Common Questions and Similar Issues ASIC submits that there are similarities between the way the share application form was used in the course of three of the offers alleged against Sattvic  at paras  A to  O of the plaintiff s amended statement of claim  and the way those forms were used in respect of certain offers alleged to have been made by other defendants  at paras             and     of the statement of claim   It then submits  without specificity  that much of the evidence and submissions on these issues are likely to be the same or substantially similar in respect of all defendants  I have considered the pleadings  In the end  as I have identified above  the issues for trial between ASIC and Sattvic are very limited  There is little or no dispute about factual matters which are substantially similar in the actions against the other defendants  In addition  ASIC submits that common questions of statutory interpretation affecting important provisions of the Corporations Act    Cth  are likely to arise in respect of all defendants  in particular s   and    It says that the purpose test in s   is relied on against all defendants and there will be common questions concerning the application of that test affecting all defendants  However  there is no live issue as to this between Sattvic and ASIC as the contentions of ASIC in this respect are admitted  Accordingly  no question of inconsistent judgments on this question arises citedDean Willcocks v Commissioner of Taxation     ACSR  Factors which have been held to militate against making such an order include     a
