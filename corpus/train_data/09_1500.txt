whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial  This seems to be the approach of Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR   and of Gordon J in the same case  as to

grounds of opposition under ss       and     Health World must be an aggrieved person  The expression  an aggrieved person  is to be given a wide interpretation  see In the Matter of Powell s Trade Mark     RPC   at    CA UK      RPC   at      HL  see also Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein   Bro Inc   HCA         CLR   at    An aggrieved person is one who has a real interest in having a trade mark removed from the register  or one who would be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the trade mark remained on the register  Continental Liqueurs at   Ritz Hotel Ltd

that an applicant for rectification of the register is in the same trade as the registered owner of the mark  what is required is that the applicant have a desire to use the mark  or be likely to be hampered in some other way by the registration of the mark that the applicant seeks to have expunged  Shanahan at      I do not consider that Health World has any genuine desire to use the HEALTH PLUS mark  It is true that Health World has filed an application No   for the series trade mark HEALTH PLUS including a number of variations  That application was filed on   June   approximately   months after Health World commenced the rectification proceeding  and   days after it commenced the Health World non use proceeding  Applying the test explained by Jacobson J  Anying Auburn appears to me at the moment to be an aggrieved person within the meaning of s   of the Trade Marks Act   Andrew Chen may also be such a person  as may An Ying NZ  I am not prepared to hold for the purposes of the applicants  summary judgment application that none of the respondents is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s   of the Trade Marks Act   In my opinion  there is every reason to think that  at the conclusion of a trial  each of Anying Auburn  Andrew Chen and probably An Ying NZ will be held to be aggrieved persons within the meaning of that section  That being so  it seems to me that the respondents have some prospect of having the Registered Trade Mark cancelled pursuant to s   by reason of the operation of s    Harry Wang not being the true owner  s  b   registration procured upon the basis of false representations  s  A  application for registration made in bad faith  and s  e   entry made as a result of false suggestion or misrepresentation   It is apparent from the brief summary of the respondents  case at which I have given at     above  that there is material before me at the moment which suggests that Harry Wang applied for and procured the registration of the Registered Trade Mark in circumstances where he well understood that the owner of that mark was either An Ying NZ or Andrew Chen and that he did so in breach of duties owed to them or one or other of them and in breach of duties owed to An Ying Melbourne appliedJames North  Aust  Pty Ltd v Blundstone Pty Ltd     AOJP        b IPR  But the respondents challenge Harry Wang s entitlement to be and to remain the registered proprietor of the Registered Trade Mark  As I have already mentioned in   and   above  the gateway to that challenge is s   and s  a  of the Trade Marks Act   In order to bring themselves within that section  the respondents  or one or more of them  must be an aggrieved person within the meaning of that expression as used in s    The respondents seemed to suggest that the owner at common law of the Anying mark was An Ying NZ although  at times  they seemed to be submitting that the owner was either An Ying NZ or Andrew Chen personally  An Ying NZ is not a party to the proceedings at the present time  The argument at trial  no doubt  will be that Andrew Chen is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s   as is Anying Auburn  This argument will focus on Andrew Chen s involvement in the creation of the Anying mark and its use in New Zealand and arguably in Australia for some years prior to February   and contentions on the part of Anying Auburn that  because it is using the Anying mark currently and has done so for almost two years  Anying Auburn itself is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s    see Radio   Records Inc v Dahlke     IPR    A person who

Furniture Ltd v Acoustic   Felts Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn that assumption  I will now consider the questions of whether damages would be an adequate remedy  the balance of convenience and the balance of justice  In Sebel Furniture Ltd v Acoustic   Felts Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR   at      pp     I explained these concepts as follows  The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine require Sebel to show that         a  it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted  and   b  the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction        The first of these matters involves an assessment by the court as to whether the claimant would  in all material respects  be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy  as he would be in if an injunction were granted  see the discussion of this aspect in ICF Spry  The principles of equitable remedies  specific performance  injunctions  rectification and equitable damages   th ed  Lawbook  Pyrmont    pp         and      The second of these matters requires the court to exercise a discretion  In exercising that discretion  the court is required to assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by the defendant  third persons and the public generally if an injunction is granted  with that which is likely to be suffered by the claimant if no injunction is granted  In determining this question  the court must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief  if granted  will adequately compensate the claimant for the continuing breaches which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted  In order to address the irreparable injury question  the balance of convenience and the balance of justice in the present case  it is necessary to consider the nature and strength of Sebel s case and the circumstances in which the respondent decided to compete with Sebel by importing the Titan chair into Australia and by promoting and selling that chair in this country  It is also necessary to consider and evaluate the impact that the grant or refusal of an injunction will have or is likely to have on third persons and the public generally  In Patrick Stevedores Operations No   Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia  No       CLR       ALR       ACSR       HCA   at   and   Brennan CJ and McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  in a joint judgment  expressly adopted a passage from Spry    pp     which may be summarised as follows         a  In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application  the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances   b  Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case  and   c  Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive  I propose to apply those principles here  The applicants first learned of the existence and trading activities of Anying Auburn in December    They made their initial demand for a cessation of those activities by email dated   January    A more formal demand was sent on   January    These demands were answered in detail by the respondents on   January   and again on   February    The respondents refused to give the undertakings sought by the applicants and asserted their rights to use the Anying mark
