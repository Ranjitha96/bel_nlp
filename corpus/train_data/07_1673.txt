costs order              In those circumstances I cannot see how the principle in Grant v John Grant   Sons Pty Ltd applies   Having regard to the plain language of the Deed of Release  and the surrounding circumstances  I am of the view that the principles expressed in Grant v John Grant cannot be invoked to exclude any of the Smolles  claims in relation to the Bond from the settlement   It was on this basis that I indicated that I would summarily dismiss the Smolles  claim against the bank  and provide reasons at a later date  However  I made it plain that I would do so solely on the basis of the Deed of Release  and not by reason of any of the other matters upon which Ms Loughnan relied referred toLondon   South Western Railway Co v Blackmore   LR   HL   In Grant v John Grant

Williams  submission also seemed to me to be inconsistent with the  surrounding circumstances   The bank clearly intended that any settlement should apply to all claims made by the Smolles  including their claims in relation to the Bond  Notably it had rejected the amended version of the Deed of Release  executed by the Smolles on   August   which sought to exclude certain transaction costs in relation to the switch from the balanced trust to the Bond  Reynolds Lawyers  letter of   March   stated that the variations to the Deed of Release were  unacceptable  to the bank  As finally executed on   March   the Deed of Release dealt specifically with the Smolles  claim against the bank for  compensation in relation to  their investment in the balanced trust and the Bond   I also indicated  on   October   that I would not dismiss the Smolles  claim against Reynolds Lawyers on the basis of want of prosecution  despite the many failures on their part to comply with directions and orders of the Court  In part  I did so in reliance upon the principles laid down by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    The Smolles had been required to pay indemnity costs for each earlier breach of my orders  and that seemed to me to ameliorate to some degree any prejudice that Reynolds Lawyers had suffered  Bearing in mind the difficulties under which the Smolles laboured  having regard to their particular circumstances  and also taking into account the fact that they were now competently represented  I concluded that it would not be appropriate to prevent them from prosecuting their case   That leaves the position as follows  The claim against the bank is dismissed  However  Reynolds Lawyers still face claims for failure to carry out instructions  breach of retainer  negligence and misleading or deceptive conduct  Reynolds Lawyers have cross claimed against the bank  in the event that they are found liable to the Smolles  The status of that cross claim will need to be considered at some future time   On any view  if the Smolles are to succeed against their former solicitors they will have to prove not merely that the breaches alleged occurred  but also that they suffered loss or damage as a consequence referred toTorrens Aloha Pty Ltd v Citibank NA     FCR   More recently in Commonwealth Development Bank of
