responded that  given that Mrs Lobo had attended the first Tribunal hearing  their situation is no different from one in which the Tribunal  having conducted a hearing at which the applicant was present  proceeds to make a decision based upon information adverse to an applicant  not provided by the applicant and not put to him or her by the Tribunal at any stage  Counsel for the appellants referred to observations of Hayne J in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at   that  it is not right to see  an  applicant s appearance before the tribunal pursuant to s       as the focus or culmination of the review process  It is no more than one step in what otherwise is a predominantly documentary process    The appellants also claimed that the Tribunal had breached s  A of the Act  They rely on VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at   in which Finn and Stone JJ said that  under s  A of the Act  a provision applicable to the Refugee Review Tribunal  RRT  which is similarly worded to s  A  information which is integral to the reasoning process rejecting the applicant s claim  as a matter of fairness  must be disclosed to the applicant and the applicant must be told of its relevance to the review  The appellants submitted that the AIRC information fell within this category  The appellants further argued that the decision in SAAP  which also concerned s  A  established that the duty in s  A is strict  Therefore  unlike the procedural fairness claim  the appellants submitted that Mrs Lobo is not burdened with showing that she could have answered the material  and the issue of  practical injustice  is irrelevant to the question of jurisdictional error   I assume that the
