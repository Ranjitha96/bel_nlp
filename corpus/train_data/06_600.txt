appliedNASB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Ms Henderson pointed out that no objection had been made in that court to the appellant making the unsworn statements and no such objection was raised on the appeal  To the extent that the proposed evidence might add to what was said to the Federal Magistrate  Ms Henderson objected that the conditions stated in NASB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   had not been met  Those conditions  as set out at   are     first  the party seeking to adduce the evidence must show that it could not  with reasonable diligence  have been adduced at the trial  and  secondly  the evidence must be such that very probably the result would have been different       In my view neither of these conditions was met and I therefore refused to admit the additional evidence   For the reasons given above the appeal must be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone   Associate Dated    May   Counsel for the

au cases cth FMCA  html  His Honour s decision was grounded in practical considerations  in particular the risk that the Tribunal s process would be  unreasonably thwarted  by delays caused by a strict requirement that an applicant be given   days  notice of each rescheduled hearing  regardless of the reason for that rescheduling  Quite apart from such practical considerations however  it seems to me that there is a substantial difference between an initial invitation to a hearing which names a date and correspondence in which the date of such a hearing is rescheduled  The latter is a variation of the initial invitation and not a new invitation  Hence this is not a case of  partial compliance  with a statutory obligation  see the comments of McHugh J in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALJR   at     The section may reasonably be interpreted as applying to an initial invitation and not to a notification of a date that is rescheduled at the applicant s request  It may be  as Barnes FM observed in SZBAZ v Minister for Immigration   FMCA     that the s  A notice requirements may apply to a hearing rescheduled on the Tribunal s initiative but that is not the case here and I do not need to consider the point referred toSZBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The question was not answered in SZDQO which dealt with the more specific question of the application of s  A    The answer depends on the extent of the  matters  with which Division   of Part   of the Act deals an issue on which there is some difference of opinion in this Court  see Branson J s analysis in SZBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at         The view I have formed about the notice of the rescheduled hearing that was given to the appellant is such that I do not need to explore this difference of opinion or what limits might be imposed in Division    This is because I am satisfied that  once it is accepted that s  A  does not apply  the highest that the Tribunal s obligation to give notice of the rescheduled hearing date can be put is that the notice must  in all the circumstances  be reasonable  I am satisfied that the notice given to the appellant met this standard appliedSZDQO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In SZDQO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR    SZDQO  at   Conti J held that         in circumstances where the Tribunal decides to reschedule a contemplated hearing at the behest  explicitly or implicitly  of an applicant  s  A does not apply in relation to the notice of a rescheduled hearing  at least insofar as concerns the period of the reviewed notice  The sanction on the Tribunal in those circumstances would be the operation of the general law as to natural justice     I do not accept the appellant s contention that Conti J s construction of s  A may create injustice where no notification of the effect of s  A is included in a notification of a rescheduled hearing  Such notification would have been given in any valid notice of the original hearing date and  in any event  his Honour s holding was made in respect s  A  his Honour did not address the other requirements of s  A   Anticipating a submission from the respondent  not in fact made  that s  B prevented an applicant from complaining of procedural unfairness in relation to insufficient notice or a defective notice of a rescheduled hearing  the appellant submitted that  if this position was correct  it was a reason for adopting a construction of s  A that the section applies in these circumstances  The argument is that the Act discloses an intention to regulate the content of procedural fairness so as not to deprive an applicant of all such rights in particular circumstances  If the notification periods mandated by s  A of the Act do not apply in relation to a rescheduled hearing  and s  B prevents an applicant from relying on common law grounds of procedural fairness  it would appear that the applicant had little protection from the unreasonable rescheduling of hearing times  While there is a superficial attraction in this submission I am not prepared to accept that s  B has this effect  Section  B is discussed below   I respectfully agree with Conti J s conclusion but  even if I did not  I would need to be satisfied that the decision was  plainly wrong  before I would be prepared to depart from it  Takapana Investments Pty Ltd v Teco Information Systems Co Ltd     FCR   at    The learned Federal Magistrate correctly applied SZDQO in finding that s  A  did not apply in relation to a rescheduled hearing   Accepting that the Tribunal does not have to give notice of a rescheduled hearing requested by the applicant s  A  the question arises whether the limitation of the natural justice hearing rule imposed by s  B of the Act applies to a rescheduled hearing requested by the applicant  Section  B  which is found in Part   Division   of the Act  provides     This Division is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with       emphasis added   The question was not answered in SZDQO which dealt with the more specific question of the application of s  A    The answer depends on the extent of the  matters  with which Division   of Part   of the Act deals an issue on which there is some difference of opinion in this Court  see Branson J s analysis in SZBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at         The view I have formed about the notice of the rescheduled hearing that was given to the appellant is such that I

appellant met this standard
