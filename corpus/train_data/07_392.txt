 http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR   Kirby J said  at   speaking of the functions of the Tribunal     The tribunal acts in a generally inquisitorial way  This does not mean that a party before it can simply present the facts and leave it to the tribunal to search out  and find  any available basis which theoretically the Act provides for relief  This Court has rejected that approach to the tribunal s duties  The function of the Tribunal  as of the delegate  is to respond to the case that the applicant advances    Footnotes omitted referred toSCAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In SCAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     von Doussa J said that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider claims that have not been made citedNABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Tribunal s duty in respect of claims of this kind was further considered by the Full Court of this Court in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR     NABE    In that case the Full Court at   approved a statement by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   where his Honour said that        The question  ultimately  is whether the case put by the appellant before the Tribunal has sufficiently raised a relevant issue that the Tribunal should have dealt with   The Full Court in NABE went on to say at      This does not mean that the Tribunal is only required to deal with claims expressly articulated by the applicant  It is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not clearly arise from the materials before it   The appellants  case was based upon a claim of political persecution  Whilst the Tribunal found that a number of threats had been made by particular persons  some of whom were politicians  it found that the motivation for the persecution was a desire to protect  their own business interests from competition   There was evidence to support that finding   In any event  the Tribunal found that the threats did not amount to serious harm within the meaning of s  R of the Act  In view of the fact that the Tribunal rejected the appellants  claim that the senior political figure visited his home and carried out the threats and the attack on his father in law  such a finding was open to the Tribunal referred toAbebe v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA
