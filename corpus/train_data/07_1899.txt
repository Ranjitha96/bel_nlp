au au cases cth FMCA  html  This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court   SZKEJ v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA   dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the second respondent  the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  not to grant the appellant a protection visa pursuant to s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act    The appellant  a citizen of Pakistan  arrived in Australia on   August   and lodged an application for a protection visa on   October    He claimed to fear persecution for political reasons because of his involvement with the Pakistan Muslim League of which he was the local Area President   On   October   a delegate of the first respondent  the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  refused the application  The Tribunal affirmed that decision  An application to the Federal Magistrates Court resulted in orders by consent remitting the matter to the Tribunal  A differently constituted Tribunal heard further evidence from the appellant and again affirmed the decision to refuse a protection visa   The essence of the Tribunal s decision was that  as a result of a number of inconsistencies between the evidence contained in his protection visa application  the evidence he supplied at the first Tribunal hearing and the evidence he supplied at the second Tribunal hearing  the appellant was not a credible witness  As a result  the Tribunal did not accept the appellant s claims to have suffered persecution in Pakistan  nor was it satisfied that he faced a real chance of persecution were he to return there  Accordingly  the Tribunal determined that the application did not satisfy the criterion for a protection visa   The grounds of the application for review in the Federal Magistrates Court were as follows        The Tribunal relied on the previous RRT decision with much information without giving the applicant opportunity to comment upon the information given to the Tribunal before and during the interview which give rise to breach of s   of the Migration Act       Whilst the Tribunal has leeway as to how the provided information is interpreted  the decision involves jurisdictional error affecting the decision as the Tribunal has erroneously adopted the approach that generally documents obtained from Pakistan are fake  The Tribunal could have checked the authenticity of the documents from the issuing agencies through Australian overseas post      The Tribunal has erred in failing to make enquiry to the adequacy of the applicant s claim that he was arrested  detained and gaold  sic jailed  for considerable period of time      The Tribunal has erred in making findings that the documentary evidence provided is fake and fail to take into account matters within jurisdictional facts and erroneously failing to consider such facts          Turner FM considered and rejected each of those grounds and dismissed the application citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   The Tribunal s decision not to accept the appellant s documents as a reliable corroboration of his claims was based in part on an inconsistency between those documents and his oral evidence  There is no evidence that the Tribunal alerted the appellant to this issue  Although not relied upon by the appellant  I raised that point with counsel for the respondent  I accept the submission that the Tribunal s reasoning cannot be characterised as constituting  information  within the meaning of s  A a    SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   at    It was not obliged to notify the appellant in advance of its doubts arising from the inconsistencies   The appeal is dismissed and the appellant is to pay the costs of the first respondent   I certify that the preceding twelve   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December     The
