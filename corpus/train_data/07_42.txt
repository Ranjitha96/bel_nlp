Registrar of the District Court of South Australia v Nicholas David Cooper as Official Liquidator of JM Properties Pty Ltd  in liquidation   ACN         FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toJM Properties v Strata Corporation No   Inc  No     SADC  http www austlii edu au au cases sa SADC  html  On   April   her Honour Judge Simpson of the District Court of South Australia directed the Registrar of that Court to issue a summons against the company JM Properties Pty Ltd  ACN       and Jack Balalis and Marina Balalis in their capacity as its directors and in their personal capacity  to answer a charge of contempt of court in that they failed to comply with the orders of the District Court made on   August   and amended on   November   see JM Properties v Strata Corporation No   Inc  No     SADC     The reason for the present application is that on   November   JM Properties was ordered to be wound up in insolvency under the provisions of the Corporations Act    Cth   the Act   and Nicholas David Cooper was appointed liquidator of the company  Section  B of the Act provides that while a company is being wound up in insolvency a person cannot begin or proceed with a proceeding in a Court against the company except with the leave of the Court and in accordance with such terms  if any  as the Court imposes  The Registrar has applied under that provision for such leave   The contempt proceedings against JM Properties are proceedings to which s  B applies  That proceedings  as also parallel proceedings against Mr and Mrs Balalis  were founded on alleged breaches of Mareva orders made against them by Judge Simpson in relation to dealings with a number of the assets of JM Properties and of another company  I need not enlarge upon the orders and their breach as it is clear  as her Honour found  at   of her reasons for judgment  that the transactions entered into by Mr and Mrs Balalis in encumbering and otherwise dealing with properties of JM Properties constituted a wilful and therefore contumacious breach of the orders  Mr and Mrs Balalis were directors of the company at the time   The immediate reason for the leave application is occasioned by provisions of the District Court Rules    SA   Rule     provides that     A judgment or order against a body corporate which has been wilfully disobeyed may  by leave of the Court  be enforced by sequestration against the property of the body corporate or by attachment against the directors or other officers thereof or by sequestration of their property  referred toIberian Trust Ltd v Founders Trust and Investment Co Ltd     KB   The view taken by the Registrar s legal advisers in reliance upon a commentary in Lunn s Civil Procedure on r     is that no order could be made against Mr and Mrs Balalis as directors of JM Properties unless the applicant could also proceed against JM Properties  Lunn s commentary relies upon the decision of Luxmoore J in Iberian Trust Ltd v Founders Trust and Investment Co Ltd     KB   where it was said of a rule in relevantly identical terms  that as the remedy given against the directors was an alternative one  the rule was not applicable unless the party seeking to enforce the order was in a position to pursue the original remedy against the company  at     While there may be a question whether the legislative bar to proceedings against a company in insolvency ought be taken to have the consequence suggested by Luxmoore J when a party seeks to rely upon r     it is unnecessary for me to consider that matter as the Registrar is seeking  even if only as an abundance of caution  to proceed against the company as well as the directors   The Registrar s lawyers wrote to the liquidator  Mr Cooper  on   January advising him that they had received instructions to make this leave application  They indicated in that letter that  while the Registrar wished to continue the contempt proceedings against JM Properties   the principal reason for this is to pursue the Directors  Mr and Mrs Balalis  for attachment pursuant to r     of the District Court Rules   in relation to the alleged breaches of the Mareva Injunction Order by JM Properties   The letter to Mr Cooper went on to note that  subject to our receiving final instructions  we are likely to give an undertaking to the Federal Court that we will not pursue any financial penalty against JM Properties in relation to the alleged contempt of court    On   January   Mr Cooper indicated to the Registrar s lawyers that he had no objection to the application being made and he confirmed he would not be making any submissions in relation to the matter
