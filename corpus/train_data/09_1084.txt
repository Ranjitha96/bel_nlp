Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd  ACN       v Thomas  No     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBanque Commerciale SA  in liq  v Akhil Holdings Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Banque Commerciale SA  in liq  v Akhil Holdings Ltd   HCA         CLR   Mason CJ and Gaudron J said  at         The function of pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met  Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd  in liq    HCA         CLR   at   per Isaacs and Rich JJ  In this way  pleadings serve to ensure the basic requirement of procedural fairness that a party should have the opportunity of meeting the case against him or her and  incidentally  to define the issues for decision  The rule that  in general  relief is confined to that available on the pleadings secures a party s right to this basic requirement of procedural fairness  Accordingly  the circumstances in which a case may be decided on a basis different from that disclosed by the pleadings are limited to those in which the parties have deliberately chosen some different basis for the determination of their respective rights and liabilities  see  for example  Browne v Dunn     R   at   Mount Oxide Mines     CLR at     citedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe consequences of contempt proceedings are grave  and potentially include fining and imprisonment  In considering the application of the civil standard of proof  Dixon J observed in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR         in summary  that In determining whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that HFAT has proven the facts it needs to prove  I take into consideration the matters required by s   of the Evidence Act as well as Dixon J s comments in Briginshaw   HCA         CLR    What are the booking records the subject of HFAT s claim I understand that it is not seriously in dispute that booking records for HFAT existed or that HFAT had booking records  The dispute in this case is as to the composition and nature of the booking records the subject of this claim  Background I understand that the general position and practice in relation to taking bookings for HFAT tours was as follows  Because of the onset of the  build up  and the monsoon season in northern Australia  the period from approximately November until March each year was off peak season for tourists  HFAT did not conduct regular tours during this period  However tour bookings were able to be taken at this time in respect of tours for the   tourist season  scheduled to begin around April   by employees of the HFAT business  including Ms Chaloner  A number of tours bookings were recorded by Ms Chaloner and  apparently  Ms Shelley Ratcliffe between October   and the end of January   when Ms Chaloner left HFAT  As I have already noted  no evidence was given by Ms Ratcliffe in these proceedings  Bookings were made with HFAT for tours by tour desks around Australia  in particular Broome and the Kimberley Holidays  on behalf of clients and by individuals directly  Bookings were made by email and telephone  Ms Cummins gave evidence that when individuals made bookings directly with HFAT  they were required to make immediate payment in order for their booking to be confirmed  TS   June   p   ll      I have already noted Ms Chaloner s evidence that when an individual customer booked and paid for a tour she would send the customer a confirmation email in respect of the booking and the day of travel  Usually  telephone bookings for HFAT tours were recorded in a hard copy diary acquired by the HFAT business  and an Excel spreadsheet on a computer  operated by Ms Chaloner   The relevant diaries were yearly calendar diaries  Both the hard copy diary and the computer with the Excel spreadsheet were kept at the HFAT office  located at Hangar   Broome Airport  Identification of booking records Part A para  a i  of the Application identifies the booking records sought by the applicant as  the originals and all copies  whether in hard or soft copy  of all and any booking records for forward bookings of tours made by persons who booked tours to Horizontal Falls with the Applicant   During the proceedings however HFAT s definition of the booking records narrowed  In HFAT s written submissions the booking records were more specifically identified as However in determining an issue on the balance of probabilities  as Dixon J observed in Briginshaw   HCA         CLR    reasonable satisfaction  should not be produced by inexact proofs  indefinite testimony  or indirect inferences  at    As I have already observed  potentially many other people had an opportunity over several months to remove the booking records perhaps inadvertently  perhaps deliberately  There is absolutely no direct evidence before the Court that Mr Rhys Thomas took the booking records from the HFAT office in Hangar   at Broome Airport  only hearsay from Ms Bishop as to alleged comments by Ms Chaloner  which Ms Chaloner denies having made  The only basis on which I could find that Mr Rhys Thomas had taken the booking records would be on the grounds of speculation  conjecture  and inference  I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities  particularly taking into account the material before the Court which I have already discussed  the seriousness of HFAT s allegations  and the gravity of the consequences should Mr Rhys Thomas fail to  or be unable to  comply with an order as sought by HFAT  that Mr Rhys Thomas removed the relevant booking records  Form of Order On the facts of this case HFAT has not substantiated its claims against Mr Rhys Thomas in respect of his alleged removal of HFAT booking records from the HFAT office  It follows that the Application against him so far as concerns Pt A para   should be dismissed  While HFAT conceded that there was no basis for an order against Mr Troy Thomas in relation to the relief sought by HFAT pursuant to Pt A para   of the Application  HFAT also submitted that In my view however there is no basis for adjourning the case against Mr Troy Thomas  because Accordingly  it follows that the appropriate order is to dismiss HFAT s claim against Mr Troy Thomas so far as concerns Pt A para   of the Application  Concluding commentscitedHorizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd  ACN       v Thomas   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIndeed  Ms Chaloner produced evidence that she was suffering severe depression as well as anxiety attacks arising from her concerns about giving evidence in the proceedings  I reject the applicant s submission that her medical condition was  pure poppycock   However as my ruling earlier in these proceedings demonstrated   Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd  ACN       v Thomas   FCA   I was of the view that  despite these medical conditions  Ms Chaloner would be able to answer questions under cross examination  and indeed she did so in a direct  detailed and honest manner  Further  I accept Ms Chaloner s evidence as to the mode of taking bookings between October   and January   because it was  and always had been  her job to take bookings for the HFAT business  Indeed commenting in relation to the booking records and Ms Chaloner s practice of entering bookings into an Excel spreadsheet  Ms Cummins conceded      It was her  that is  Ms Chaloner s  system  nobody else really understood it    TS   June   p   l  I make this observation  noting again the curious absence of any evidence from Ms Shelley Ratcliffe citedHumphries v Halifax Vogel Group Proprietary Limited   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn its Outline of Submissions in Reply  the respondents protested that to decide the application on one or more of the grounds raised by HFAT in its written submissions would  in the circumstances of the way in which HFAT conducted its case  constitute procedural unfairness as described by the High Court in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at      In light of the parties  detailed submissions with respect to possible grounds for decision in this case  I make the following observations  I consider that the respondents  submissions in this respect have merit  Nowhere in the application does HFAT plead the tort of detinue  the Income Tax Assessment Act   the Corporations Act or specific restitution  Not once during the course of the hearing were any of these causes of action raised by the solicitor for HFAT  The proceedings were not conducted on the basis that the respondents were required to meet a case in detinue  specific
