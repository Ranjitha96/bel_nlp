Glueck v Stang   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBarto v GPR Management Services Pty Ltd     FCR   The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novapharm to the APO and to the USPTO were not made in trade or commerce  They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novapharm on the one hand  and either the APO or USPTO on the other hand  Novapharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO or the USPTO  Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts  cf Barto v GPR Management Services Pty Ltd     FCR    The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation citedThe British South Africa Company v The Companhia de Mo ambique   AC   In The British South Africa Company v The Companhia de Mo ambique   AC     Mo ambique   the House of Lords held that the Supreme Court of Judicature had no jurisdiction to entertain an action to recover damages for a trespass to land situate abroad  Mo ambique recognised a distinction between  transitory  and  local  actions  The English courts would exercise jurisdiction in respect of the former but not the latter  Actions in which title to land or infringement of rights and interest in real property were in issue were prime examples of local actions   The   Mo ambique rule  has been held to apply to intellectual property rights  In Potter v The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd   HCA         CLR     Potter   the High Court held that a cause of action for infringement in New South Wales by a Victorian company carrying on mining operations in New South Wales  of the plaintiff s patent issued under the Patents Act    NSW  was not justiciable in Victoria   In Tritech Technology Pty Ltd v Gordon     IPR   Finkelstein J recognised that the Mo ambique rule was subject to exceptions   In Potter the High Court described one exception to the Mo ambique rule  at     per Griffith CJ    The Courts will no doubt entertain such a question of title if it arises merely

Constructions  NSW  Pty Limited v Nelson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondents refer to the authoritative construction of the expression  in trade or commerce  in s   of the TP Act given by the High Court in Concrete Constructions  NSW  Pty Ltd v Nelson   HCA         CLR     Concrete Constructions    In support of their submission that representations to government authorities pursuant to the requirements of legislation lie outside the notion of conduct in trade or commerce  the respondents cite Village Building Co Ltd v Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR     Village Building  at     affirmed on appeal at Village Building Co Ltd v Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at         and my own decision in RGC Mineral Sands Ltd v Wimmera Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd  No     FCA     RGC v Wimmera     In Concrete Constructions   the High Court held that an internal communication from one employee to another in their ordinary activities in building work was not conduct engaged in by their employer company in trade or commerce  at    The High Court held that what is required is that the relationship between the corporation and the representee be of a trading or commercial character  and that the conduct of the corporation have taken place in the course of that relationship   In their join judgment in Concrete Constructions   Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ said  at           the words  in trade or commerce  refer to  the central conception  of trade or commerce and not to the  immense field of activities  in which corporations may engage in the course of  or for the purposes of  carrying on some overall trading or commercial business   Their Honours also said  at     What the section  s   of the TP Act   is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons  be they consumers or not  with whom it  or those whose interests it represents or is seeking to promote  has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which  of their nature  bear a trading or commercial character   In some areas  the dividing line between what is or what is not conduct  in trade or commerce  may be less clear and may require the identification of what imports a trading or commercial character to an activity which is not  without more  of that character   In Village Building   representations made in the nature of forecasts of aircraft traffic noise levels in the vicinity of Canberra International Airport were provided by the Airport s lessee and operator  Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd  CIA  to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services pursuant to the Airports Act    Cth   As well  the forecasts were published on the company s website and were used in public debate concerning  inter alia  an application to rezone land south of the airport and under the flight path as residential   The applicant for relief was a developer of land in the area south of the airport   Finn J held that the conduct alleged against CIA was not conduct in trade or commerce for the purposes of the TP Act   and an appeal against his Honour s decision was dismissed by the Full Court   No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novapharm in trade or commerce in a broad non s   sense  However  in Concrete Constructions the High Court  at   rejected the view that the expression  in trade or commerce  in s   referred to  the  immense field of activities  in which corporations may engage in the course of  or for the purposes of  carrying on some overall trading or commercial business  and held that it bears the narrower meaning to which I referred above   Mr Glueck responded to Novapharm s first ground of attack by submitting that Novapharm did not make representations in trade or commerce to the APO or to the USPTO because all representations made to them were made by Novapharm s Australian and US patent attorneys respectively  His submission must be that the representations that were made by those patent attorneys were not in law representations by Novapharm  In making this submission  Mr Glueck was accepting  in effect  that in suing Novapharm for having made the representations  he had sued the wrong entity  since it was the patent attorneys alone who were responsible for the alleged misrepresentations  It is necessary for Mr Glueck to appreciate that it is possible for a company to make a representation through its agent  In any event  allegations that Novapharm had made the representations in trade or commerce permeate the proposed amended statement of claim and lie at the heart of Mr Glueck s claims   In the result  the proposed amended application and the proposed amended statement of claim should not be allowed to be filed because the former would claim relief  including accessorial relief  based on alleged contraventions of s   of the TP Act   and the latter would plead claims for such relief citedPetrotimor Companhia de Petroleos SARL v Commonwealth of Australia   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It may be that Mr
