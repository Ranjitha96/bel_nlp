limited grant of original jurisdiction under that provision   This proceeding is an appeal from a decision of the FMC under s  AA  of the FCA  The appeal is in the nature of a rehearing and not an appeal in the strict sense  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   CLR    The question on appeal is whether the FMC decision is affected by some legal  factual or other error

 explained the test for apprehended bias in administrative proceedings in the following terms         The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided  That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public  There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of  a fair minded lay observer  when  as is the case with the Tribunal  proceedings are held in private     Perhaps it would be better  in the case of administrative proceedings held in private  to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings  the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias  Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation  there is  in our view  no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility  as distinct from probability  as to what will be done or what might have been done  To do otherwise  would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof     Though the test in administrative proceedings  as in curial proceedings  is  in our view  one of objective possibility  the non curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must  as already indicated  be taken into account  In the present case  a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the Tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented  whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and
