North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd  No     FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toBeaton v Moore Acceptance Corporation Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Beaton v Moore Acceptance Corporation Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Dixon CJ  Taylor and Windeyer JJ considered a case involving a purchaser who had entered into a contract with a vendor for the sale of goods  being a bulldozer  Before that contract was completed  the purchaser entered into a hire purchase contract with a financier  and the financier in turn entered into a contract with the original vendor to acquire the bulldozer from it so as to make it available to the purchaser  The bulldozer was defective when delivered to the purchaser  Dixon CJ  Taylor and Windeyer JJ said that the purchaser s claim against the original vendor was for breach of a contract      which  by common consent  was superseded by the hire purchase agreement in question and which  therefore  was never carried into effect  Beaton   CLR at   see too Hellyer Drilling Co v MacDonald Hamilton   Co Pty Ltd     ALR   at   per Fitzgerald J   The assignment was made as a contract  Each of North East Equity and Proud Machinery agreed with the bank in December   that all North East Equity s rights in relation to the new line would be either assigned by it to  or taken as being enforceable directly by  the bank  Under that agreement  North East Equity s contractual rights against Proud Machinery passed to the bank in accordance with  or were superseded by  the terms of the notice executed by Proud Machinery on   December   Beaton   CLR at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that North East Equity had no title to sue Proud Machinery for breach of contract   North East Equity pleaded that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud owed it a duty      in designing  procuring and installing the  n ew  l ine to exercise reasonable care and skill so as to avoid  North East Equity  suffering loss and damage by any act or omission on the part of  Mr  Proud or Proud Machinery   I have found that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud did not design the new line

cases cth UKPCHCA  html  North East Equity alleged that the contract was a contract for the sale of goods within the meaning of one of the Sale of Goods Act   of Western Australia or South Australia  but it did not identify which Act applied  Both Acts were written on the template devised by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers in    The proper law of the contract for the supply of the new plant is the system of law by reference to which the contract was made  or that with which the transaction has its closest and most real connection  Bonython v The Commonwealth   UKPCHCA         CLR   at   per Lord Simonds  Their Lordships stated there that   Bonython   CLR at      W hat is the proper law of the contract  and therefore what is the substance of the obligation created by it  it is a factor and sometimes a decisive one that a particular place is chosen for performance   Here  the contract for the supply and installation of the new plant and equipment had to be substantially performed in Western Australia  The only connection with the law of South Australia was the location of Proud Machinery s head office there  A condition of the letters of credit was payment of   of the purchase price for the particular goods upon delivery to Perth  Effectively  performance of the contract had to occur either in Western Australia  or overseas in the various parts of the world from which Proud Machinery was sourcing supplies of items of plant and equipment to be installed   The substantial obligation created by the contract was for Proud Machinery to supply and install  at Wattleup in Western Australia  the plant and equipment for which it was charging   million  That obligation  together with a consideration of the whole of the circumstances  leads to the conclusion that the proper law of the contract was the law of Western Australia  The transaction had its closest and most real connection with that State  Accordingly  I find that the Sale of Goods Act    WA  applied to

conformity with the contract  and a reasonable course to adopt   Reasonableness  in that context  can be seen to be what the owner could require having regard to the terms of the contract and the nature of the departure from them in the performance proffered by the other party  That is  of course  a factual enquiry   The new line was a working asset used by North East Equity in its business from March   to at least October    On the hypothesis that I ought to have found that the new line was defective because it did not always pack out carrots with a core temperature of  deg C or less  such an event had no pecuniary consequence  And  the carrots were still packed chilled but perhaps not as low as exactly  deg C or less  The performance offered by the new line as installed was not productive of any relevant determent to North East Equity  It saw no need to reinstate  supplement or replace the refrigeration system  And it suffered no commercial detriment as a result  I am of opinion that North East Equity has not established that the cost of bringing the new line into conformity with the contractual term or representation relating to the  deg C requirement would be reasonable to award as damages  see Bowen Investments   FCR at           In final address  counsel for North East Equity suggested that its reliance damages should be calculated on the basis set out below  It argued that it would not have entered into the contract and subsequent lease agreement with the bank  had it not acted in reliance on Proud Machinery s and Mr Proud s misleading representations  or if they had not been negligent  North East Equity s methodology used a number of approximations in claiming that it had suffered a loss of    In the calculations below  I have attempted to remove those approximations so that the result  using North East Equity s methodology  can be compared with other calculations  which I explain below        Negative values are in parenthesis  Exact calculation North East Equity s approximation in its submissions  a  Total cost to North East Equity of new line  Based on North East Equity making all lease payments to the bank for   years to   May    This figure was agreed by the parties            b  Add the current value of the new line  Based on Mr Gregson s evidence that at May   the new line had an auction value of between   to              c  Add North East Equity s savings on labour costs    based on a period of   years    assuming savings per carton reduced by  cents to  cents per carton for   cartons p a   based on Mr Langridge s analysis that   kg p a  were produced        x       p a  labour savings    subtract from this figure additional power costs of   p a  that North East Equity claimed were incurred    net saving of           p a   approximated by North East Equity to a net saving of   p a   or a total net saving of    approximately   million  over   years           e  Net expenditure by North East Equity         approx     million  The above calculation mixed the costs in  a  for a   year lease  with only   years worth of savings in  c   The new line had been retained beyond the   year period and there was no evidence that North East Equity intended to bring the lease to an end before the expiry of the   year term  In that situation  I consider that credit should be given for the savings over the whole   year term of the lease not for only   years  I have rejected the claim that any representation was made to the effect that North East Equity s power costs would be less if the new line were acquired appliedBritish Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways of London Co Ltd   AC   If such a small loss were incurred  it would not accord with commonsense for North East Equity not to have gone ahead with acquiring the new line  In assessing what Mr Tana  as the controlling mind of North East Equity  would have done  it is important to exclude from consideration the subsequent impacts of the fall in the market and the production problems with the farms  Mr Tana was optimistic in   that demand for carrots would increase  so that the labour savings he expected would have been greater  the more carrots were processed  A reasonable business person in the position of Mr Tana and  I infer he too  would have replaced the inefficient old plant with the more efficient new line which gave the actual savings referred to above with the prospect of even greater ones in light of the expectation of greater demand and the significant reduction in future labour costs  Gull v Saunders   Stuart   HCA         CLR   at   per Barton ACJ  Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ approving British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways of London Co Ltd   AC   cf at     per Viscount Haldane LC esp at   where the Lord Chancellor referred to replacing obsolete machines with up to date ones   In my opinion  the value of the new line at March   was likely to be substantially more than    So  this last calculation understates the net benefit which North East Equity would have obtained  notwithstanding the assumption that it had proved all of its claims of misrepresentations and breaches of duty under the Trade Practices Act and in tort  The fact that North East Equity chose to move most of its packing operations in October   from Wattleup is not relevant to the application of the methodology suggested by it  since it has claimed the cost of leasing up until May    Had it continued to use the new line  it would not have been worse off  Its decision to change its operations should be viewed in the same way that the decision to buy new turbines in British Westinghouse   AC at   was viewed  namely  that the decision to centre operations at Lancelin was commercially sensible and would enable North East Equity to eliminate unnecessary road transport costs  including for transport of rejects and waste   I am not satisfied that North East Equity has established what the new line was  in fact  worth in the condition in which it was installed  Thus  I am not satisfied that it has suffered any loss in receiving something worth less than what it agreed to pay  or what the bank actually paid  for it  other than in the limited respects that I have found  for the flume elevators and disruption   As I have understood the pleadings  these aspects were not the subject of any claim   In conclusion  I find that  in substance  North East Equity s claims for damages for about     million in wasted expenditure and     million in economic loss have not been established  I will allow the parties to consider these reasons and address the question of the final orders which ought to be made     I certify that the preceding three hundred and ninety six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares    Associate Dated

being asked to pay for the replacement flumes  had he done so by early   when it was clear that Proud Machinery and Bruynooghe would not  this problem would have been resolved  I am not persuaded that it was reasonable for North East Equity not to have replaced them by June   if there were production difficulties of any substance caused by the flume elevators  Burns v MAN Automotive  Aust  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ  at   per Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ  at     per Brennan J  Accordingly  I am of opinion that the general damages for this problem should be awarded only for the period to June   when the new flumes should have been installed  had a decision to replace them been made within a reasonable time   It was not reasonably foreseeable  at the time the contract was entered into  that North East Equity would continue to operate a defective flume system which disrupted its business by affecting the orderly and efficient operation of the new line  Any damage it suffered beyond the time when what needed to be done became clear and that Proud Machinery would not replace the flume elevators  was not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties as flowing from the breach  Burns   CLR at   per Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ   I am of opinion that the cost of replacing the flume elevators was    There is no evidence of the freight or installation costs but  doing the best I can from reviewing the general costs of installing the new line I consider that an allowance of   should be made  making a total of     It is difficult to dissect particular losses of time or costs as having been occasioned by one or more of the deficiencies in the new line which I have found  These were the defective flume elevators and the original location of the touch screen in the office  rather than above the tanks where it was moved later in   at no cost to North East Equity  The task of making an assessment of any loss is more difficult because of the deficiencies I have found in North East Equity s management  or lack of it  of the new line citedButcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Often when a person passes on what another has said  he or she gives his or her own imprimatur to the original statement  Thus  at common law  a person who passes on a rumour or statement made by another is treated as having the same responsibility as the source  And  in cases involving s   of the Trade Practices Act   the representor s conduct must be considered as a whole  Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at         per Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ  Once the contract was made  what Mr North had said  which Proud passed on to North East Equity  assumed a different character because Proud Machinery then accepted responsibility for achieving that level of performance   North East Equity also alleged that  between about late   and September   Proud made the following representations to Mr Tana orally  either on the telephone or in person   viii  Mr Proud repeated the various written representations alleged        ix  Proud Machinery and Mr Proud were possessed with sufficient knowledge  skill and experience to design  procure and install the new plant    x  The new plant would utilise electric power more efficiently than the existing Sumich line    xi  The new plant would comfortably handle a capacity of   tonnes per day packed out in cartons and in doing so it would be operating at  idle    While it is likely that Mr Proud repeated the written representations that I have found were made in the course of either discussions or republishing his own letters  I do not consider that such repetition adds anything  I do not propose to deal with the instances of those repetitions because it is not necessary to do so citedCampomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In a commercial setting between experienced business people  the express words of the contract  even if contained in exchanges of correspondence  will often be an authoritative guide as to the matters on which each party relied in entering the contract  They will know that often events will have moved on from earlier communications  Courts will be mindful that representations made early in a negotiation process  can be potent and can continue to influence a party s understanding of what is being discussed  or what becomes the subject matter of a contract  Nonetheless  courts must also be realistic about how negotiations progress  they are not static and when the context evolves  so does the understanding of each party as to what  at the later point of time  is being discussed  Gibbs CJ noted in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    in a passage approved by Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Callinan JJ in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       that s   of the Trade Practices Act did not impose burdens which operated for the benefit of persons who failed to take reasonable care of their own interests  Gibbs CJ was discussing representations made to the public  as opposed to particular individuals  However  the judgment in Campomar   CLR at         also discussed the need to consider all of the circumstances of the particular case  And  as McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson   NSWLR at     noted  recollections of pre contractual conversations relied on as the source of an allegedly misleading or deceive representation can be affected by later events and the lapse of time citedCEPU v ACCC   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC

CEPU v ACCC   FCAFC         FCR   at           per Weinberg  Bennett JJ and myself   The process of construction of a contract is undertaken objectively  In Toll  FGCT  Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ said     It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations  What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe  References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement  The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean  That  normally  requires consideration not only of the text  but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties  and the purpose and object of the transaction    citations omitted   And in CEPU   FCR at       Weinberg  Bennett and I said      In the construction of a contract  the court places itself in the commercial matrix in which the parties were at the time that the contract was made  This is so that the court can construe correctly both the express terms used by the parties and those which are included by implication in order to give effect to their presumed intention  In Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council   FCA         ALJR       ALR   at     Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ said that it was appropriate to have regard to more than internal linguistic considerations and to consider the circumstances with reference to which the words in question in a contract were used and  from those circumstances  to discern the objective which the parties had in view  They applied what Lord Wilberforce had said  namely that an appreciation of the commercial purpose of the contract      presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction  the background  the context  the market in which the parties are operating    Reardon Smith Line v Hansen Tangen     WLR   at          And  in Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   approving Lord Hoffmann in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society  No       WLR   at   Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ said that interpretation of a written contract involved       the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract      See also International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Limited   HCA         ALR   at       per Gleeson CJ  at     per Gummow  Hayne  Heydon  Crennan and Kiefel JJ referred toCodelfa Construction Pty Limited v State Rail Authority of NSW   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  During the course of pre contractual negotiations  many things are said or written which convey  expressly or impliedly  one or more representations about matters under consideration by the parties  In Codelfa Construction Pty Limited v State Rail Authority of NSW   HCA         CLR   at   Mason J  in his seminal judgment  said     It is here that a difficulty arises with respect to the evidence of prior negotiations  Obviously the prior negotiations will tend to establish objective background facts which were known to both parties and the subject matter of the contract  To the extent to which they have this tendency they are admissible  But in so far as they consist of statements and actions of the parties which are reflective of their actual intentions and expectations they are not receivable  The point is that such statements and actions reveal the terms of the contract which the parties intended or hoped to make  They are superseded by  and merged in  the contract itself  The object of the parol evidence rule is to exclude them  the prior oral agreement of the parties being inadmissible in aid of construction  though admissible in an action for rectification   His Honour said that the reason that the actual intentions of the parties were not taken into account in determining construction to be given to a contractual provision was         for the very good reason that an investigation of those matters would not only be time consuming but it would also be unrewarding as it would tend to give too much weight to these factors at the expense of the actual language of the written contract   Here  of course  there was no written contract complete in itself  But the policy reasons lying behind the parol evidence rule and the objective theory of contract are recognitions of the tendency of parties to negotiations to attribute to some particular matter a significance that did not exist at the time of the conclusion of the contract  In an evolving negotiation ultimately leading to the conclusion of the contract  different positions are taken with respect to different subject matters  To attribute significance in the final expression of the parties  contractual relationship to something said earlier may create an unreal and inaccurate appreciation of the subject matter of the relationship actually entered into at the later time  Of course  many things are said and written to induce the entry of a person into a contract  Even the common law recognised that misrepresentations  innocent  negligent or fraudulent  provided grounds in particular circumstances entitling parties to relief from the consequences of entry into a contract   Any statement or representation made during pre contractual negotiations is apt to be misconstrued if taken out of context  or treated as if it were a contractual term simply because it was said or written  Negotiations to arrive at a contract are not themselves part of the contract  Sometimes  however  they may set the scene in which the contract is to be understood  on other occasions they may contain  or be the source of contractual terms  But  it is often not realistic to treat a pre contractual statement in isolation as if it were made outside the context of an evolving negotiation  which the parties recognise is a process  That process will culminate when they finalise matters in a contract citedFountain v Alexander     CLR   As a matter of ordinary English  the assignment by North East Equity of  all of its rights in relation to  the new line was plenary  The expression  in relation to  is of wide and general import  cp its width when used in a statute  Fountain v Alexander     CLR   at   per Mason J   And  in Loxton v Moir     CLR   at   Rich J said     The phrase  chose in action  is used in different senses  but its primary sense is that of a right enforceable by an action  It may also be used to describe the right of action itself  when considered as part of the property of the person entitled to sue  A right to sue for a sum of money is a chose in action  and it is a proprietary right  appliedGull v Saunders   Stuart   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA

opinion that nothing turns on whether the contract for the supply of the new line was  on its true characterisation  a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for work and materials  In the former case  s  i  of the Sale of Goods Act ordinarily would operate to imply a condition that the goods be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required  as made known by the purchaser  In the absence of special circumstances  a contract to do work and supply materials will carry with it two implied warranties  first  that the materials are of good quality and free from latent defects  and secondly  that the materials are reasonably fit for their intended purpose  Helicopter Sales  Australia  Pty Limited v Rotor Work Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Menzies J  at   per Stephen J  Barwick CJ agreeing with their Honours at   and Mason J agreed with Stephen J at   Young   Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd     AC    I am of opinion that because  not only was Proud Machinery to supply the goods  it was also to erect and install them  the contract was not merely a contract for the sale of goods  but was in substance a contract for the provision of work and materials  cf Hewett v Court   HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs CJ    per Murphy J    per Wilson and Dawson JJ    per Deane J  As Gibbs CJ noted  the distinction between a contract for the sale of goods and one for the provision of work and materials is frequently a fine one and the tests for distinguishing them are unsatisfactory and imprecise  Hewett   CLR at   see too Sutton KCT  Sales and Consumer Law   th ed  Lawbook Co    at         Benjamin s Sale of Goods   th ed  Sweet   Maxwell    at           I summarise below the contractual terms and representations which I have found Proud Machinery made to North East Equity and my findings on them  In analysing whether the new line  as installed  conformed with the purposes and terms referred to in  a   e  above  I have had regard to the implication that the new line would be reasonably fit for those purposes   Helicopter Sales   CLR at         see     above      Pack out rate per hour       I have not found that terms or representations were made exactly corresponding to those pleaded and set out at  a  and  g  above  Rather I have found  at   above  that  at the time of entry into the contract  the processing capacity was contained in a term and representation that            the new line would have the capacity to process and pack at a rate of production per operating hour of     tonnes final pack out on the pallet  later reduced to     tonnes             For the reasons given above  I am not satisfied that this was incorrect or misleading or deceptive  The new line had that capacity  And  by operating a split shift  the new line had the capacity to achieve a pack out in excess of   or  later  after the handline was deleted      tonnes in eight working hours        Temperature       I have found that terms and representations were made which corresponded to those pleaded and set out at  b   c  and  h  and  iii  and  v  namely that the new line would  first  be designed so as to be reasonably fit to achieve             b  the ability to process farm fresh carrots at field temperatures   c  the core temperature of packed carrots to be not more than  deg C  and secondly       h  achieve a guaranteed maximum of  deg C core temperature for North East Equity s carrots         iii  have hydro cooling tanks capable of producing constant product output  and   v  be capable of controlling the temperature of the carrots            I have found that I am not satisfied that the new line did not have these capacities if operated correctly        Grading       I have found terms and representations were made that corresponded to those pleaded and set out at  d  and    ii  and  iv  namely that the new line would  first  be designed so as to be reasonably fit to achieve             d  the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight distinct streams of size and length grades  and secondly   ii  have nine hydro cooling tanks which would allow one of those tanks for each length or size grade and provide the opportunity to have a spare tank  and   iv  provide quality length sizing for three separate lengths            I have found that I am not satisfied that the length graders  there being no complaint about the width or girth graders  were not reasonably fit for the purpose of providing quality length sizing in accordance with what both parties understood were their inherent limitations  I am not satisfied that the new line was not reasonably fit for the purpose of having the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight different streams of length and size  I am satisfied that the hydro cooling tanks conformed with representation  ii         Efficiency       I have found that terms and representations were made that corresponded to those pleaded and set out at  e  and  vii  namely that the new line would first  be designed so as to be reasonably fit to             e  achieve an increase in efficiency of labour usage compared to the existing Sumich line    and secondly   vii  increase production while reducing the man hours required to achieve that production compared to the existing at the Wattleup plant line            I am satisfied that these were correct  As Mr Tana admitted in the meeting of   November   labour costs per carton had reduced by   or more        Reduction in damage to carrots       I have found that a representation was made that corresponded to that pleaded and set out in  vi  namely that the new line would greatly reduce damage to carrots and wastage   I am not satisfied that this was incorrect  misleading or deceptive  In any event there were no records of waste or damage to carrots so as to enable any finding to be made as to the position before or after the new line was installed  And  the quality of carrots delivered for processing after the new line was installed was very different from  and worse than  their earlier quality  North East Equity has not established that this representation was not met   North East Equity also pleaded that the representations were made by Proud Machinery and Mr Proud       a  as to the performance characteristics  uses or benefits of the new line and because they were incorrect there were contraventions of s  c  of the Trade Practices Act    b  as to future matters  thus engaging s  A of the Trade Practices Act      On the findings I have made  it is not necessary to consider these claims   Proud Machinery and Mr Proud argued that the contractual measure of damages was not appropriate or available to North East Equity because it had assigned all of its contractual rights to the Bank of Western Australia Ltd in November    North East Equity had entered a master lease agreement with the bank in August    The master lease agreement contemplated that in the future North East Equity would seek to lease goods from the bank and set out the general terms which would apply once goods were nominated and acquired by North East Equity  On   November   the bank and North East Equity sent to Proud Machinery a  novation notice to and acknowledgment from supplier   This recited that North East Equity had         novate d  to the bank all of its rights under the contract that it had with Proud Machinery relating to the construction of the new line under which the bank would receive title to it and become its owner  cl      assign ed  to  the bank  the  new line  and all of its rights in relation to the  new line   cl     Nonetheless the contract contained an implied promise that Proud Machinery would exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of its services  including the selection of goods or work and materials that were reasonably fit for the purposes for which North East Equity had  expressly or by implication  indicated they were required  Astley v Austrust Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  Helicopter Sales   HCA       CLR     In the relationship between North East Equity and Proud Machinery  that implied promise was parallel and concurrent with a co extensive duty in tort on the part of Proud Machinery and Mr Proud to exercise the same reasonable skill and care  Astley   CLR at       per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ   The pleading of Proud Machinery s and Mr Proud s alleged negligence and the way in which North East Equity argued this claim reflected  in substance  its complaints of failures in the design  procurement and installation of the new line  which gave rise to the shortcomings in its operation as installed  The duty of care in this matter arose because and in the context of the contractual relationship  Proud Machinery had parallel and concurrent obligations in tort and contract to exercise reasonable care and skill in performing professional tasks owed to North East Equity under the contract  Mr Proud had a parallel and congruent obligation in tort  Astley   CLR at      There is no circumstance pleaded in the present case which would justify extending those obligations in tort beyond a parallel and concurrent liability of Proud Machinery and Mr Proud  co extensive with the contractual obligations of Proud Machinery to exercise reasonable skill and care   The contract was negotiated at arms length between two experienced and capable business people  Mr Tana and Mr Proud  Its express and implied terms reflected the commercial relationship agreed on by the parties for the procurement and installation of the new line  That relationship is a commonplace in commerce  a vendor who is the distributor of plant and equipment and a purchaser who  after negotiating with the vendor  agrees on terms for the purchase and installation of the equipment  The common law and statutory obligations  such as in Part V of the Trade Practices Act and the Sales of Goods Act   which govern such a relationship do not need extension or modification on the facts of this matter or merely because one party was unhappy  after the event  with the result arrived at by the performance of the contract   On the basis of my findings in respect of the contractual terms and representations  the claim in negligence  must also fail   I have rejected the claims for damages for economic loss and loss of a chance to earn further profits as being without foundation  I have also found that  in substance  North East Equity has not established that the new line failed to operate in accordance with the pleaded contractual terms and representations  or that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud breached the duties of care they owed  There are still some subsidiary matters which I will address below citedHellyer Drilling Co v MacDonald Hamilton   Co Pty Ltd     ALR   In Beaton v

to acquire the bulldozer from it so as to make it available to the purchaser  The bulldozer was defective when delivered to the purchaser  Dixon CJ  Taylor and Windeyer JJ said that the purchaser s

 In the former case  s  i  of the Sale of Goods Act ordinarily would operate to imply a condition that the goods be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required  as made known by the purchaser  In the absence of special circumstances  a contract to do work and supply materials will carry with it two implied warranties  first  that the materials are of good quality and free from

difficulty with North East Equity s analysis because it relied  as the value of the new line  on the figure of   given by Jonathan Gregson  Mr Gregson had no formal qualifications as a valuer  but was a very experienced auctioneer  He had no experience in selling equipment of the kind in new line  other than selling other equipment belonging to North East Equity  First  Mr Gregson gave that figure in respect of the new line as at May   not at the time of its acquisition or installation four years earlier  The figure affords no proper basis on which to compare the amount paid in early   with the true value at that time of what was acquired  HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd     CLR   at         per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Heydon JJ  Secondly  Mr Gregson was not able to offer an opinion in his expert report on the new line s value when it was acquired  saying only that this assessment was  difficult   He had tried to enquire of Mr Proud and Bruynooghe about a value which he could consider for his report  but desisted after he learned of their involvement in the proceedings  Nor did another equipment dealer of whom he enquired give him any assistance in placing a value on the new line   Here  the subsequent fall in the carrot market may have been an independent or extrinsic cause affecting Mr Gregson s perception in   of what the new line might then realise at auction based on his experience with selling North East Equity s equipment subsequent to early   HTW Valuers   CLR at      If the market for carrots were higher  rather than lower  a processing plant offering substantial savings in labour costs would be likely to be more attractive to potential purchasers  Instead  by   the market falls had driven some of North East Equity s competitors out of business   This analysis shows that  even if North East Equity had proved that Proud Machinery and or Mr Proud had contravened ss   and or    c  of the Trade Practices Act and or been negligent in one  or even all  of the respects it had alleged  it would not have established that the contravention s  or breach es  of duty had caused it to suffer any loss or damage  This is because  first  there is no evidence that the new line  as installed  was worth less than was paid for it  except  perhaps the   I have found it would have cost to replace the flume elevators and   for the disruption caused  and  secondly  even if it were  that difference was greater than the savings North East Equity achieved by operating the new line   I do not accept that Mr Gregson s appraisal of the auction price realisable for the new line in May   provides any reasonable basis on which to arrive at its value in March   when it was brand new  A willing but not anxious purchaser  and a willing but not anxious vendor  would agree on a different and substantially higher price for brand new plant and equipment than for plant and equipment which had been used to process about four years worth of production at the levels shown on the evidence  The wear and tear of four years  use would create a substantial difference between the value when new  even if it were less than the price paid to Proud Machinery  and the value of the plant and equipment as seen by Mr Gregson citedInternational Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Limited   HCA         ALR  http

to the matters on which each party relied in entering the contract  They will know that often events will have moved on from earlier communications  Courts will be mindful that representations made early in a negotiation process  can be potent and can continue to influence a party s understanding of what is being discussed  or what becomes the subject matter of a contract  Nonetheless  courts must also be realistic about how negotiations progress  they are not static and when the context evolves  so does the understanding of each party as to what  at the later point of time  is being discussed  Gibbs CJ noted in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    in a passage approved by Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Callinan JJ in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       that s   of the Trade Practices Act did not impose burdens which operated for the benefit of persons who failed to take reasonable care of their own interests  Gibbs CJ was discussing representations made to the public  as opposed to particular individuals  However  the judgment in Campomar   CLR at         also discussed the need to consider all of the circumstances of the particular case  And  as McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson   NSWLR at     noted  recollections of pre contractual conversations relied on as the source of an allegedly misleading or deceive representation can be affected by later events and the lapse of time   Additionally  it is important to be mindful of the particular relations between the parties  Here  two experienced commercial men were discussing a proposed transaction over many months  The discussions involved a considerable degree of planning and reworking in the course of arriving at a final  evolved concept  That concept was the subject of their contract  It is important  in that context  to evaluate what effect any representation conveyed at an earlier point in the negotiations  had at the time of entry into the contract  and how  at that time  any such representation was understood  Also  as Gibbs CJ identified in Puxu   CLR at   it is important to evaluate whether  at the time the contract was made  the representee had taken reasonable care to protect his or her own interests  The context  including subsequent events  statements or writings which cast a different light upon an earlier representation may be all important in determining whether it continued to have any operative effect or the effect alleged   The letter of   July   commenced by stating that it set out an outline of a system which Mr Proud believed would fulfil Mr Tana s desire to pack   tonnes of carrots over an   hour working day  and that it would include a number of specific items  Subsequently  the discussions evolved the concepts until these were crystallised in the contractual correspondence commencing with the letter of   September   and ending with the letter of   October    Both parties knew that the design and the drawings for the proposed line under discussion had changed on a number of occasions in the period between   July and   September     I have already explained what I find to be the contractual terms that emerged from the negotiations in relation to the tonnage per hour that the new line was warranted to process  It is not reasonable to read either of the two letters in isolation from the context in which they were communicated  That context included the background of what preceded each letter  The   September   letter replaced and updated what had been said and written earlier in relation to the tonnage per hour figure  I find that the only representation  relating to the capacity of the new plant to produce any tonnage of carrots per hour  on which Mr Tana and North East Equity acted in relation to  was embodied in the contractual term I have found at   above  arising from sub pars  a  and  g    Thus  I am satisfied that at the time of the entry into the contract  the representation made originally in the letter of   July   continued  namely that the nine cooling tanks would allow one tank for each length size grade and provide the opportunity to have a spare tank  However  it was understood by Mr Tana and North East Equity  through him  in the context of the intervening events  including his visit to Belgium  see Puxu   CLR at   per Gibbs CJ   The letter of   July   said that  when a desired grade was selected to be sent to a packing position  the pumps and blower were activated in a manner appropriate to obtain a constant product output  North East Equity alleged that this representation was not fulfilled when the plant was commissioned and in operation  That was because the outflow system was said to rely on a combination of water pressure and compressed air to force carrots onto the discharge conveyor  That method of removing carrots from the tank was said to cause product surges  and then droughts  for the sorting tables  resulting in delays and inefficiencies in the continuous operation of the line  The letter of   July   said that there was a  PID control loop  which would calculate the speed of the pump and blower motor to ensure a controlled feed  The letter also indicated that it was possible to bypass that program and operate the tank manually   I am satisfied that a representation was made  which continued to the time of contract  that the chilling tanks could be controlled in a way that would make them capable of producing a constant product output for

mutually known facts forming the background in which the parties contracted  Additionally  where terms are alleged to have been made orally  it is necessary to identify what  if any  oral terms were agreed  In Watson v Foxman     NSWLR   at     McLelland CJ in Eq explained that  where a party alleged in civil proceedings that conduct of another was misleading or deceptive  or likely to mislead or deceive  ordinarily it was necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Court first  what the alleged conduct was  and secondly  the circumstances which rendered it misleading  He continued  in terms  which in my opinion are apposite to the identification of oral terms of a contract agreed to have been made in the course of negotiations  as follows     Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation  it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances  In many cases  but not all  the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what  if examined at the time  may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word  phrase or grammatical construction rather than another  or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase  or condition  Furthermore  human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons  and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time  particularly where disputes or litigation intervene  and the processes of memory are overlaid  often subconsciously  by perceptions or self interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said  All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then  again often subconsciously  constructed  All this is a matter of ordinary human experience   McLelland CJ in Eq said that each element of the cause of action had to be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Court  Watson   NSWLR at   see also s   of

Watson   NSWLR at     noted  recollections of pre contractual conversations relied on as the source of an allegedly misleading or deceive representation can be affected by later events and the lapse of time   In making the second finding  I have not overlooked Mr Proud s evidence  which North East Equity relied on as supporting its case  in relation to the starting point for measuring the   rejects  In his written evidence  Mr Proud referred on three separate occasions to the agreed initial tonnage   tonnes per   hour working shift or     tonnes per operating hour  being fed into the new line commencing after the brush washers  In cross examination Mr Proud said that this was wrong  I do not consider that Mr Proud was always reliable in his evidence  On this point  the contemporaneous documents are a surer guide to what the parties agreed and discussed than their recollections four or five years later  Those recollections have been coloured by the subsequent history of the dispute and the desires of both witnesses to justify in their own minds  what they thought they had done  Their evidence was prone to being assertive and unreliable  see too Watson   NSWLR at       While North East Equity was entitled to rely on these statements by Mr Proud as admissions against interest  I do not consider them to be reliable  They made no commercial sense  since neither party measured the weight at that point  or had any objective means of calculating this  The new equipment had to work with what was to be retained  including the initial part of the plant  A mix of production targets was discussed in    The key inputs were the initial quantity of carrots delivered and the pack out tonnage per hour  As I have found above  it made no sense for the parties to measure or consider the production of the new equipment in isolation  Ultimately  in   Mr Tana agreed with Mr Proud that Proud Machinery would provide new equipment to be combined with some old for the plant  working as a whole  which could pack out     tonnes per operating hour  or     tonnes without the handline  with a maximum of   total rejects  The new equipment  obviously  had to have the capacity to operate in a way which enabled the final pack out rate to be achieved  But  as Mr Webster  s   August   memorandum showed  the overall capacity of the line  consisting of both the old and new equipment  was what mattered  The new equipment could not process more than the amount of carrots fed into it from the old system s brush washers  I do not accept Mr Proud s written evidence on the starting point for measuring the   rejects   In any event  I must approach the identification of the terms and the construction of the agreement objectively  rather than from the subjective points of view of the parties  For the reasons I have given  I am satisfied based on the mutually known facts  the evidence of discussions and contemporaneous written material that the parties agreed that the   rejects related to the processing operation as a whole  commencing from the point where the carrots were tipped into the wet hoppers  And  given the nature of the negotiations and the parties here  it is appropriate to assess whether any representation complained of was made by Proud Machinery or Mr Proud on the same basis citedYoung   Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd     AC   I am of opinion that nothing turns on whether the contract for the supply of the new line was  on its true characterisation  a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for work and materials  In the former case  s  i  of the Sale of Goods Act ordinarily would operate to imply a condition that the goods be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required  as made known by the purchaser  In the absence of special circumstances  a contract to do work and supply materials will carry with it two implied warranties  first  that the materials are of good quality and free from latent defects  and secondly  that the materials are reasonably fit for their intended purpose  Helicopter Sales  Australia  Pty Limited v Rotor Work Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Menzies J  at   per Stephen J  Barwick CJ agreeing with their Honours at   and Mason J agreed with Stephen J at   Young   Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd     AC    I am of opinion that because  not only was Proud Machinery to supply the goods  it was also to erect and install them  the contract was not merely a contract for the sale of goods  but was in substance a contract for the provision of work and materials  cf Hewett v Court   HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs CJ    per Murphy J    per Wilson and Dawson JJ    per Deane J  As Gibbs CJ noted  the distinction between a contract for the sale of goods and one for the provision of work and materials is frequently a fine one and the tests for distinguishing them are unsatisfactory and imprecise  Hewett   CLR at   see too Sutton KCT  Sales and Consumer Law   th ed  Lawbook Co    at         Benjamin s Sale of Goods   th ed  Sweet   Maxwell    at         citedZhu v Treasurer of NSW   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Secondly  in any event cl    g  was consistent with the plenary construction of the earlier assignment  It provided for North East Equity  as assignor  to make its name available  were that necessary  to enforce performance of the contract  That would only be where rights had not been passed to the bank by the earlier assignment  Since the bank was paying for the purchase and installation of the new line  it is not apparent  as a matter of commercial commonsense why it would leave causes of action for breach of contract by the vendor in the hands of the bank s customer  The bank would be conscious of the risk to it of its customer  North East Equity  becoming insolvent  If that occurred  the bank would have purchased  and would own the new line  but could only prove in its customer s insolvency for the damages needed to bring the new line into conformity with the contract  That would work commercial inconvenience and is not a commercially sensible construction in absence of clear words  Zhu v Treasurer of NSW   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Callinan and Heydon JJ   Thirdly  cl    g  protected the interests of the bank where  for some legal or other reason  it could not sue  e g  in respect of a claim for unliquidated damages which accrued before the assignment   Fourthly  the protection of the bank s interest in the goods referred to in cl    g  is not a right of North East Equity  in relation to  the new line as contemplated in the notice  it is a distinct right of the bank   North East Equity also argued that the assignment was of a bare right to damages  It was not  the assignment was of a legal chose in action for the reasons I have given
