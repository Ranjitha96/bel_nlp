Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services  with Corrigendum dated   March     FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredDuncan v Fayle   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This is an appeal from the whole of the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal  constituted by a single Member of the Tribunal given on   July   whereby the Tribunal decided to dismiss two Applications by Solon Theo  the applicant  for review on the basis that  under s  B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   the AAT Act  they were frivolous or vexatious     The Tribunal  in its Reasons for Decision    AATA     at par   also ordered that     Solon Theo by himself  his employees  agents or independent contractors or other persons must not  without leave of this Tribunal  make an application for review by this Tribunal of any decision relating to age pension or disability support pension made by the Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services       S  B  of the AAT Act provides     Where an application is made to the Tribunal for the review of a decision  the Tribunal may  at any stage of the proceeding  if it is satisfied that the application is frivolous or vexatious         a  dismiss the application  and    b  if the Tribunal considers it appropriate  on the application of a party to the proceedings  direct that the person who made the application must not  without leave of the Tribunal  make a subsequent application to the Tribunal of a kind or kinds specified in the direction          The application before the Tribunal concerned two separate applications to the Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services  the respondent  by the applicant  The first was an application for review of a decision of the respondent in the matter of an Age Pension application made on   July    The second was an application for review of a further decision of the respondent in the matter of an application for a Disability Support Pension made on   July        Both applications  and the decision by the AAT on them  have to be considered in the context of many acrimonious disputes between the applicant and Centrelink  and the respondent Department and some of its officers  As will appear  that history has clouded a dispassionate view of the entitlement of the applicant to an Age Pension      The decision by the AAT in respect of the application for an Age Pension has involved a significant error of law  and a serious misunderstanding of its role  and of the extent to which other decisions on other applications by the applicant had utility in disposing of the applications then before it     In respect of the application for Age Pension  Centrelink  by a letter dated   July   requested the applicant provide certain information in order that his claim could be assessed  The letter said in part     You must complete the enclosed forms  Private Trust module  Separation details form  Accommodation details form  and Real Estate details form  If you are no longer involved in the Solon Theo Family Trust  you must provide the original stamped amended trust deed showing you have relinquished control of the trust      This is an information notice given under the social security law         Centrelink received a number of completed forms from the applicant on   July   which provided limited information  For instance  on the form headed  Separation Details  the applicant stated   Your records have such information    and in answer to the question   Address where you and your wife were living prior to your separation    the applicant again stated   Your records have such information    In relation to a document   MODPT Private Trust   a diagonal line with the words   N A   was submitted  and similarly in a document   MODR Real estate details        By letter dated   August   the applicant was advised that his claim had been rejected due to his failure to provide enough information in order for a proper assessment of the claim to be carried out  The letter said    After careful consideration your claim for Age Pension has been rejected because you have not provided enough information for an assessment to be made  In particular  with regard to your involvement in the Solon Theo Family Trust        The applicant sought an internal review of the decision and on review the Authorised Review Officer affirmed the original decision  That letter  on   September   said in part       My decision  not to change the decision to reject your new claim for Age Pension lodged on   was based on the following findings          you have been the trustee and controller of the Solon Theo Family Trust      you have now advised that you have relinquished control of this trust and that this occurred prior to       in order to decide whether you have any entitlement to age pension  Centrelink needs to be able to assess your income and assets      to do so  we require proper original evidence of the legal date of transfer of control of the trust and of who is now in control of the trust  a completed  Private Trust  form and full financial documents for the trust detailing income and assets held          I interpolate to say that while it is clear that in order to decide whether a person has an entitlement to Age Pension  an assessment of income and assets has to be made  it is by no means clear  and seems to me to reflect an imperfect understanding of the difference between any entitlement to income and assets of a trust  and the status of controller of trust property  that  in order to be able to assess income and assets  Centrelink   require  s  proper original evidence of the legal date of transfer of control of the trust and of who is now in control of the trust  a completed  Private Trust  form and full financial documents for the trust dealing income and assets held       In respect of the application for a Disability Support Pension made on   July   Centrelink advised the applicant by letter dated   July   that his claim was rejected as such a pension   can not be assessed for a person whom  sic  is of age pension age    The applicant sought an internal review of that decision which was ultimately affirmed on review     The applicant appealed both decisions to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal  the SSAT   On   October   the SSAT affirmed each decision under review and on   October   the applicant commenced proceedings in the Tribunal seeking to have  in effect  the SSAT s decisions set aside     The applicant appealed to the AAT on   October    The AAT handed down its decision on   July   and made the Orders earlier referred to     The Tribunal expressed its conclusion regarding the application for an age pension in par          The defects in the Applicant s age pension claim and supporting documents in this case are the same as those carefully rehearsed by the Federal Court Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA     Little purpose would be served by elaborating these in any detail in these Reasons for Decision  As noted by the Federal Court in Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA   at   and   the Applicant s written responses to the requests of the Respondent for further information relating to the family trust structure in which the Applicant apparently has a present interest or entitlement  a claim disputed by the Applicant  were   combative   as was also at least one of his oral communications with the Respondent concerning the same matter  In short  the Applicant has not adduced any fresh evidence in this set of proceedings that advances his case for proper merits based consideration of his age pension claim that goes beyond evidence adduced before the Tribunal in Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA   and the subsequent Federal Court appeal in Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA         emphasis added      It expressed its conclusion regarding the application for a Disability Support Pension in par                At the time of his application for disability support pension  made   July   the Applicant was   years of age  Under section   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     a person cannot make a claim for a disability support pension unless that person is under the pension age on the day on which the claim was lodged  This provision must be read side by side with section   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     which states that a man reaches pension age when he turns        The combined operation of sections   and   of the Social Security  Administration  Act   preclude the Respondent from paying disability support pension to the Applicant               the application for review in relation to the disability support pension application     is utterly hopeless  is futile  is without foundation in point of fact or in point of law  and should be dismissed as frivolous or vexatious     under section  B        S   of the AAT Act relevantly provides        A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia  on a question of law  from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding        It is convenient to deal first with the applicant s appeal from the decision of the Tribunal concerning his application for a Disability Support Pension  The reasoning of the Tribunal appears in par   of its Reasons for Decision     The Applicant s disability support pension claim was rejected by the Respondent on   July   on the basis that the Applicant is of age pension age  At the time of his application for disability support pension  made on   July   the Applicant was   years of age  Under section   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     a person cannot make a claim for a disability support pension unless that person is under the pension age on the day on which the claim was lodged  This provision must be read side by side with section   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     which states that a man reaches pension age when he turns    This Tribunal has found as a fact that on the date of his application  the Applicant was of   years of age  and   years of age as at the date of decision   The combined operation of sections   and   of the Social Security  Administration  Act   preclude the Respondent from paying disability support pension to the Applicant  The Tribunal is prepared to infer that the Applicant s application for disability support pension was made to outflank his lack of success on his age pension claim  at the same time the Tribunal notes that the Applicant does have some poor health and the documents admitted into evidence as Exhibit   did demonstrate that point to some extent   The reasoning of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in paragraphs   to   of its decision made   October   in disposing of the application for review to that Tribunal of the disability support claim rejection decision made by the Respondent is correct and unimpeachable       No error of law attends the conclusions of the Tribunal expressed in this paragraph  It follows that the application for review of this decision of the Tribunal must be dismissed    In respect of the Application to review the decision to refuse Mr Theo an Age Pension  the Tribunal properly set out its role  and then in its Reasons for Decision failed utterly in the discharge of that role      The Tribunal said at par      The role of the Tribunal is to review the merits of the decision before it  section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   and Secretary  Department of Social Security v Murphy     FCA Drummond J   The Tribunal is guided by the norm that it should reach the correct and preferable decision on the basis of the material before it  Ajka Pty Ltd v Australian Fisheries Management Authority   FCA   at     The Tribunal is required to stand in the shoes of the original decision maker and consider all evidence anew  bearing in mind statutory provisions and any significant legal precedent   Bantick and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA   at     The Tribunal proceeds de novo   Bramwell v Repatriation Commission     ALD   at   per Weinberg J  The Tribunal must base its decision upon the material that is logically probative of the existence of facts that emerge from the evidence before it  Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at         The Tribunal had earlier said under the heading   Jurisdiction   at par      In a procedural sense  the Tribunal has jurisdiction in these appeals by virtue of Part     Division   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     In a substantive sense  the merits of these appeals are governed by the Social Security Act     For reasons that will become apparent later in these Reasons for Decision  section  B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   is also decisive in the resolution of these appeals       On   March   the respondent filed its Statement of Facts and Contentions  This Statement was  so the material before this Court indicates  given to the applicant on the morning of the hearing at the Tribunal    March   shortly before the hearing commenced  In the Statement of Facts and Contentions the respondent contended  amongst other things  that the applicant be declared vexatious and further applications only be made with the leave of the Tribunal  The Tribunal indicated at the hearing that it would deal with the s  B issue first      The Tribunal appears to have given no attention to the question of whether the application by the respondent contained in its Statement of Facts and Contentions was made in circumstances which accorded with the principles of natural justice  including the right properly to be heard      The Tribunal in its Reasons given on   July   contains an extensive  and it has to be said  precious analysis  of legislation concerning frivolous or vexatious applications  including the provisions in the High Court Rules  the Federal Court Rules   the Federal Magistrates Court Rules  the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules   made under the Supreme Court of Queensland Act    Qld  and the Supreme Court Act    NSW   Moreover the elaborate  Review of the Jurisprudence on section  B  undertaken in the Reasons for Decision reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the operation of s  B      The Tribunal referred to the judgment of French J in Duncan v Fayle   FCA     but failed to understand the Reasons for Judgment of French J  His Honour said at par    A decision dismissing an application as frivolous or vexatious under s  B  is a decision which finally disposes of the application  It has necessarily involved a consideration of the merits in the sense that it requires a finding that the application cannot succeed     emphasis added    The Tribunal  at par   referred to passages from Re Williams and Australian Electoral Commission     AAR   preciously noting the case to be   the fons et origo  or alternatively  the locus classicus  of section  B jurisprudence   The Tribunal referred to what it considered the critical passage    that the situation    falls within the provisions of s  B   not only because of the futility of the proceedings  but also because they are being pursued by the applicant for a collateral purpose a purpose which is irrelevant to any issue which could legitimately be raised in these proceedings  Moreover that collateral purpose is itself a futile one   As that passage demonstrates  the Tribunal in re Williams held that s  B applied because the proceedings were futile  and the collateral purpose of the applicant was irrelevant to any issue in the proceedings  and was itself futile     The decision of the Tribunal to conclude that the proceedings  being the application to the Tribunal  was frivolous or vexatious  seems to have been based  in part  on its conclusion expressed in par   of its Reasons         in this case  the Applicant conceded in cross examination that his objective in pursing his claims through Centrelink  the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and this Tribunal  and from this juncture  the Federal Court  was to pressure  or coerce  Centrelink to grant him his age pension by dint of his successive applications  Re examination by the Applicant did not repair this damaging concession elicited during cross examination       Moreover  the Tribunal said in par   of its Reasons concerning the claim for the Age Pension before it          This age pension claim suffers from the same defects in content that were identified by McCabe SM in Theo and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA   and which were the subject of an unsuccessful appeal to the Federal Court in the proceedings determined against the Applicant as Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA    The Tribunal notes that the Federal Court carefully reviewed the factual history and applicable law of the Applicant s previous unsuccessful claim for age pension made in October    refer in particular to paragraphs     and      The Tribunal took into consideration that the Applicant initiated the previous application for merits based review from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to this Tribunal that culminated in the decision of McCabe SM in Theo and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA     as well as the subsequent appeal to the Federal Court which culminated in the decision in Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA       emphasis added    and later gave the reasons in par   set out above at par    Paragraph   of the Tribunal s reasons concluded      Proceeding by analogy  this Tribunal can employ the doctrine of res judicata   Re Irving and Repatriation Commission     AA   at     in dealing with successive claims by applicants for income support benefits  The Tribunal stresses that reliance upon res judicata in this case is simply by way of analogy in connection with the section  B application  not by way of direct application       As the Tribunal noted in par   of its Reasons  the role of the Tribunal is to reach the correct and preferable decision on the basis of the material before it   The Tribunal proceeds de novo   The Tribunal must base its decision upon the material that is logically probative of the existence of facts that emerge from the evidence before it       The applicant has made many applications concerning his entitlement to an Age Pension  In those applications  he had filed much material concerning the Solon Theo Trust  It may be that the terseness of his reply to the request for information and the paucity of it before the rejection of his application for Age Pension on   August   was a consequence of this fact      Before the AAT he was expressly asked   Do you want me to take note of the T documents from those previous hearings  The AAT noted   I think Mr Ffrench  the departmental advocate  is actually trying to help you out   Importantly  the AAT asked   Do you want the Tribunal to have regard to the previous Tribunal documents from earlier hearings    to which Mr Theo answered    Yes   The Tribunal said  I m happy to take them on board and Mr Ffrench has offered or undertaken to provide those and I m happy to consider them       The documents that were thus before the Tribunal on the application for review of the decision concerning Mr Theo s entitlement to an Age Pension were much more extensive than the replies the applicant gave to the request for information by Centrelink in the letter of   July    They included an affidavit dated   March   in which Mr Theo  amongst other things  swears        Since the       I am not involved in any Trusts   It is hereby further reiterated that I will not exert any control over or benefit directly or indirectly in any way or form from any trust           A further affidavit dated   June   by Sol Theo concerning the absence of any question of control  any question of interest  any question of being a beneficiary in any trust  was sworn to by him  The declaration in part says      I was the Trustee of the Family Trust known as SOLON THEO FAMILY TRUST  and relinquished all formal roles and control in respect of the trust as well as relinquished all interest in the trust  which were none                I had resolved to retire from the office of Trustee of the said Trust Fund      And I declare that neither my partner nor now myself are in any shape or form in a position with the Trust  to have any authority and to exert any control over the benefit in any way from the trust  which have been non existent  nor are we in a position to influence      Such status is irrevocable       The stamped  certified true copy of the  Solon Theo Family Trust  the subject of those statutory declarations was before the Tribunal  The Deed was made on   September   and while the applicant was the trustee of that trust  he had no interest in the trust as a possible beneficiary of it  and in particular as possible entitlement to any or trust assets of trust income  Apart from the statutory declarations of the applicant which the Tribunal said it would consider there are also statutory declarations from his then wife indicating that she no longer had any interest or connection with the trust  In particular  there was before the Tribunal an affidavit of Athena Theo dated   March   to that effect      It is plain that the Tribunal failed to consider the previous Tribunal documents from earlier hearings  as it had indicated during the hearing before it that it would  The written contentions filed shortly before the hearing before the AAT  as noted in par   of the Reasons for Decision  alleged     The applicant has now requested that this Tribunal review matters relating to the cancellation or rejection of claims for social security payments on a number of occasions  Each hearing has involved a number of decisions and have  in the main  concerned the same issue  the failure of the applicant to provide full and satisfactory details of his involvement in the Solon Theo Family Trust       However  in the course of the hearing  Mr Theo indicated  and the Tribunal said that it would have regard to  previous Tribunal documents from earlier hearings  In particular  the AAT said  So if you want to take me to particular pages or folios in this document now is a great opportunity to do so    to which Mr Theo directed the Tribunal to Page   of document T     Mr Theo advised that he had relinquished control of the trust and that that occurred prior to   April       and you have a bundle of documents Exhibit   which substantiate this statement       In the light of the material that was before the Tribunal it is simply untrue to say  as the AAT said  in par  D   Nothing of an evidentiary nature concerning the age pension claim in this proceeding differs from that considered by this Tribunal in Theo and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA   and the subsequent Federal Court appeal in Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA          In any event  the proceedings in the Tribunal fall to be determined on the material before it  and not on the basis of whether that material was the same as  or different to  the material before other decision makers in other applications  Generally  there can be an estoppel against the terms of a statute     The decision before the Tribunal was the decision made on   August   to reject the applicant s claim for Age Pension on the basis that he had not provided requested information  The application for review by Mr Theo by the AAT of that decision required the Tribunal to reach the correct and preferable decision on the material that was before it  that material  it seems to me  amply satisfied the request for information about the position of the applicant in relation to the Solon Theo Trust  namely that he had no interest  either legally or beneficially in any of the trust assets  or any income of the trust  The Tribunal ignored this material  contrary to its promise  and thus failed in its central duty  to reach the correct or preferable decision on the material before it      In short  the material before the AAT was much more extensive and comprehensive than the material that was before the decision maker on   August    The proceedings  insofar as they involve an application for review of the decision concerning the Age Pension  could not possibly have been the subject of a s  B dismissal  because as French J pointed out in Duncan v Fayle   FCA   at par      A decision dismissing an application as frivolous or vexatious under s  B      necessarily involved a consideration of the merits in the sense that it requires a finding that the application cannot succeed       The material that was before the Tribunal does not satisfy this essential requirement  On the contrary  notwithstanding the applicant s dealings with the Department and the various Tribunals have been acrimonious and frequently conducted by the applicant in a belligerent way  and in a way which is contrary to his own best interests  the material that was before the Tribunal on this occasion  dealing with the requirements of the Act for an Age Pension seem  on that material  to have been satisfied  While it is a matter for the Tribunal  the totality of the information and material before the Tribunal seems plainly to establish that there is no disqualification by virtue of any interest that the applicant may have in any trust and in particular the Solon Theo Trust      For the above reasons the Orders made by the AAT on   July   must be set aside and the application Q  should be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be considered by it according to law     Having regard to the fact that the applicant is unsuccessful in his appeal to this Court concerning the decision of the Tribunal in proceedings Q  it is appropriate that there be no Orders to costs in respect of the appeal to this Court       I certify that the preceding forty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender   Associate Dated    March   Counsel for

Applicant s disability support pension claim was rejected by the Respondent on   July   on the basis that the Applicant is of age pension age  At the time of his application for disability support pension  made on   July   the Applicant was   years of age  Under section   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     a person cannot make a claim for a disability support pension unless that person is under the pension age on the day on which the claim was lodged  This provision must be read side by side with section   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     which states that a man reaches pension age when he turns    This Tribunal has found as a fact that on the date of his application  the Applicant was of   years of age  and   years of age as at the date of decision   The combined operation of sections   and   of the Social Security  Administration  Act   preclude the Respondent from paying disability support pension to the Applicant  The Tribunal is prepared to infer that the Applicant s application for disability support pension was made to outflank his lack of success on his age pension claim  at the same time the Tribunal notes that the Applicant does have some poor health and the documents admitted into evidence as Exhibit   did demonstrate that point to some extent   The reasoning of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in paragraphs   to   of its decision made   October   in disposing of the application for review to that Tribunal of the disability support claim rejection decision made by the Respondent is correct and unimpeachable       No error of law attends the conclusions of the Tribunal expressed in this paragraph  It follows that the application for review of this decision of the Tribunal must be dismissed    In respect of the Application to review the decision to refuse Mr Theo an Age Pension  the Tribunal properly set out its role  and then in its Reasons for Decision failed utterly in the discharge of that role      The Tribunal said at par      The role of the Tribunal is to review the merits of the decision before it  section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   and Secretary  Department of Social Security v Murphy     FCA Drummond J   The Tribunal is guided by the norm that it should reach the correct and preferable decision on the basis of the material before it  Ajka Pty Ltd v Australian Fisheries Management Authority   FCA   at     The Tribunal is required to stand in the shoes of the original decision maker and consider all evidence anew  bearing in mind statutory provisions and any significant legal precedent   Bantick and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA   at     The Tribunal proceeds de novo   Bramwell v Repatriation Commission     ALD   at   per Weinberg J  The Tribunal must base its decision upon the material that is logically probative of the existence of facts that emerge from the evidence before it  Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at         The Tribunal had earlier said under the heading   Jurisdiction   at par      In a procedural sense  the Tribunal has jurisdiction in these appeals by virtue of Part     Division   of the Social Security  Administration  Act     In a substantive sense  the merits of these appeals are governed by the Social Security Act     For reasons that will become apparent later in these Reasons for Decision  section  B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   is also decisive in the resolution of these appeals       On   March   the respondent filed its Statement of Facts and Contentions  This Statement was  so the material before this Court indicates  given to the applicant on the morning of the hearing at the Tribunal    March   shortly before the hearing commenced  In the Statement of Facts and Contentions the respondent contended  amongst other things  that the applicant be declared vexatious and further applications only be made with the leave of the Tribunal  The Tribunal indicated at the hearing that it would deal with the s  B issue first      The Tribunal appears to have given no attention to the question of whether the application by the respondent contained in its Statement of Facts and Contentions was made in circumstances which accorded with the principles of natural justice  including the right properly to be heard      The Tribunal in its Reasons given on   July   contains an extensive  and it has to be said  precious analysis  of legislation concerning frivolous or vexatious applications  including the provisions in the High Court Rules  the Federal Court Rules   the Federal Magistrates Court Rules  the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules   made under the Supreme Court of Queensland Act    Qld  and the Supreme Court Act    NSW   Moreover the elaborate  Review of the Jurisprudence on section  B  undertaken in the Reasons for Decision reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the operation of s  B      The Tribunal referred to the judgment of French J in Duncan v Fayle   FCA     but failed to understand the Reasons for Judgment of French J  His Honour said at par    A decision dismissing an application as frivolous or vexatious under s  B  is a decision which finally disposes of the application  It has necessarily involved a consideration of the merits in the sense that it requires a finding that the application cannot succeed     emphasis added    The Tribunal  at par   referred to passages from Re Williams and Australian Electoral Commission     AAR   preciously noting the case to be   the fons et origo  or alternatively  the locus classicus  of section  B jurisprudence   The Tribunal referred to what it considered the critical passage    that the situation    falls within the provisions of s  B   not only because of the futility of the proceedings  but also because they are being pursued by the applicant for a collateral purpose a purpose which is irrelevant to any issue which could legitimately be raised in these proceedings  Moreover that collateral purpose is itself a futile one   As that passage demonstrates  the Tribunal in re Williams held that s  B applied because the proceedings were futile  and the collateral purpose of the applicant was irrelevant to any issue in the proceedings  and was itself futile     The decision of the Tribunal to conclude that the proceedings  being the application to the Tribunal  was frivolous or vexatious  seems to have been based  in part  on its conclusion expressed in par   of its Reasons         in this case  the Applicant conceded in cross examination that his objective in pursing his claims through Centrelink  the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and this Tribunal  and from this juncture  the Federal Court  was to pressure  or coerce  Centrelink to grant him his age pension by dint of his successive applications  Re examination by the Applicant did not repair this damaging concession elicited during cross examination       Moreover  the Tribunal said in par   of its Reasons concerning the claim for the Age Pension before it          This age pension claim suffers from the same defects in content that were identified by McCabe SM in Theo and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA   and which were the subject of an unsuccessful appeal to the Federal Court in the proceedings determined against the Applicant as Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA    The Tribunal notes that the Federal Court carefully reviewed the factual history and applicable law of the Applicant s previous unsuccessful claim for age pension made in October    refer in particular to paragraphs     and      The Tribunal took into consideration that the Applicant initiated the previous application for merits based review from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to this Tribunal that culminated in the decision of McCabe SM in Theo and Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   AATA     as well as the subsequent appeal to the Federal Court which culminated in the decision in Theo v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA       emphasis added    and later gave the reasons in par   set out above at par    Paragraph   of the Tribunal s reasons concluded      Proceeding by analogy  this Tribunal can employ the doctrine of res judicata   Re Irving and Repatriation Commission     AA   at     in dealing with successive claims by applicants for income support benefits  The Tribunal stresses that reliance upon res judicata in this case is simply by way of analogy in connection with the section  B application  not by way of direct application       As the Tribunal noted in par   of its Reasons  the role of the Tribunal is to reach the correct and preferable decision on the basis of the material before it   The Tribunal proceeds de novo   The Tribunal must base its decision upon the material that is logically probative of the existence of facts that emerge from the evidence before it       The applicant has made many applications concerning his entitlement to an Age Pension  In those applications  he had filed much material concerning the Solon Theo Trust  It may be that the terseness of his reply to the request for information and the paucity of it before the rejection of his application for Age Pension on   August   was a consequence of this fact      Before the AAT he was expressly asked   Do you want me to take note of the T documents from those previous hearings  The AAT noted   I think Mr Ffrench  the departmental advocate  is actually trying to help you out   Importantly  the AAT asked   Do you want the Tribunal to have regard to the previous Tribunal documents from earlier hearings    to which Mr Theo answered    Yes   The Tribunal said  I m happy to take them on board and Mr Ffrench has offered or undertaken to provide those and I m happy to consider them       The documents that were thus before the Tribunal on the application for review of the decision concerning Mr Theo s entitlement to an Age Pension were much more extensive than the replies the applicant gave to the request for information by Centrelink in the letter of   July    They included an affidavit dated   March   in which Mr Theo  amongst other things  swears        Since the       I am not involved in any Trusts
