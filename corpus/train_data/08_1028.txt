html  Order   r   and  e  provide as follows  Setting aside   The Court may vary or set aside a judgment or order before it has been entered    The Court  where it is not exercising its appellate or related jurisdiction under Division   of Part III of the Act  may if it thinks fit vary or set aside a judgment or order after the order has been entered where       e  the order does not reflect the intention of the Court  or      In addition to such power as is conferred by Rule   the Court also has an implied power to vary an order  Owston Nominees No   Pty Ltd v Branir Pty Ltd   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at     per Allsop J   Within the constraints imposed by that Rule  it is considered that Orders   and   as made on   November   should be varied  Order   r   relevantly confers power where  as in respect to these orders  they have been entered and where an order   does not reflect the intention of the Court    The intention of the Court was that the then form of the Statement of Claim should be struck out  The reasons for decision then given expressed reservation as to the utility of the Respondents  Notice of Motion being heard in advance of further amendments being made  as contemplated by the Applicants  But the intent of the Court was that the Applicants were to file any Amended Statement of Claim in the same proceeding within the time then specified  The reservation expressed arose because the Applicants had not previously amended their pleadings and could do so unless the proceeding itself was dismissed  Federal Court Rules  O   r    The intention was not to foreclose the opportunity to be extended to the Applicants to amend the then existing Statement of Claim    Order   as made on   November   contemplated an   Amended Application   also being filed  None was in fact filed    but the intention of the Court was to permit such an amendment to be made should the Applicants so have wished  That order reflected the intention of the Court and should thus not now be varied followedTodorovic v Moussa   NSWCA       NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  In varying and setting aside these orders it must be acknowledged that there has been both an imprecision in the language previously employed in the reasons for decisions and the orders made  The reasons previously provided could also have been expressed in greater detail  But an application made pursuant to O   r   to vary or set aside orders previously made is not considered to be the occasion to supplement reasons previously provided or to make findings which could more conveniently have been made on earlier occasions  In a civil action there is a limited ability to alter reasons previously given  provided that the alteration is not one of substance  cf  Todorovic v Moussa   NSWCA       NSWLR   at     per Beazley JA  Powell JA and Sperling J agreeing   To supplement the reasons previously provided would not fall within that limited exception   The orders of the Court are     Order   as made on   November   be varied as follows     The Statement of Claim as filed on   August   as against the First Respondent  be struck out      Order   as made on   November

v Commonwealth  No     FCA   citedVon Reisner v Commonwealth  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Two previous decisions have been given in this matter    the first on   November     Von Reisner v Commonwealth   FCA   and the second on   March     Von Reisner v Commonwealth  No     FCA     Insofar as the orders as made on   March   are concerned  it was the intention of the Court to resolve   the proceedings generally     FCA   at     On that occasion there had been non compliance with a previous order that any Amended Statement of Claim was to be filed by   February    There was  however  before the Court on   March   a draft document which the First Applicant accepted   reflected the principles which she wished to agitate     FCA   at     An order was made that the   proceedings be dismissed    This order has not been entered and may be varied or set aside pursuant to O   r    This order should be varied    but only to the extent of referring to a singular   proceeding    In seeking such an order  reliance was properly placed by the Respondents upon either s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  or O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   Both of those provisions refer to an order being made in a   proceeding    Order   r   was the power invoked  It was considered appropriate to dismiss the proceeding   Order   as made on that occasion  the Court has been told  has been the subject of leave being granted to appeal to the Full Court  It is thus inappropriate to revisit either the form of that order or whether such an order should have been made given the dismissal of the proceeding   The orders made on both occasions should be varied to reflect that which was intended  Whether such orders as now varied have been properly made remains a matter for the Full Court
