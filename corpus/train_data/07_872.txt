federal ct  html  This ground of appeal proceeds upon a misunderstanding of the nature of the review provided for in s   of the FM Act   The review is a hearing de novo  Section   of the FM Act provides that upon the hearing  the Court   may make any order or orders it thinks fit in relation to the matter in respect of which the power was exercised    Consistent with it being a hearing de novo  the appropriate form of order is to affirm the Registrar s orders  see Cottrell v Nicholls  as trustee in the estate of Cottrell    FCA   at    per Allsop J  citing Meehan v Alfaro   FCA         FCR   at   and Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     ALR   at   ref toGuss v Johnstone   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Secondly  consistent with the decision of the Full Court in Guss v Johnstone   FCA   at   to   even if the trial judge s discretion miscarried  which it did not  the loss of any advantage to the appellant in the trial judge hearing the Petition  or her failure to adjourn the hearing of the Petition  did not amount to an injustice in the relevant sense  That there was no injustice is made clear from the terms on which the High Court dismissed the appellant s application for special leave to appeal    HCATrans     February    The disposition was in the following terms       The respondent obtained a bankruptcy notice against the  appellant  on   September    The  appellant  sought in the Federal Magistrates Court an order that a bankruptcy notice based on a taxation of costs be set aside  He argued that the costs in question had been paid by promissory note  that he had a valid cross claim for an amount far in excess of the amount claimed in the bankruptcy notice  and that the issuing of the bankruptcy notice was an abuse of court process              Phipps FM ruled that the promissory note did not constitute payment of the debt  there was no genuine prospect of success on the cross claim  and no abuse of process had occurred  In the Federal Court  Sundberg J upheld the decision of Phipps FM  and dismissed the appeal  His Honour gave comprehensive reasons for judgment  Before this Court  the  appellant  seeks to challenge the validity of Sundberg J s exercise of appellate jurisdiction  and to press his contentions regarding the promissory note      The  appellant s  case before this Court discloses no error on the part of Sundberg J  and his contentions regarding jurisdiction are without substance  No question of law has been raised that would justify a grant of special leave  There would be no prospects of success on any appeal to this Court from the Federal Court  and consequently special leave is refused   This ground of appeal should be dismissed   Ground  f  is that   Riley FM  by claiming jurisdiction and hearing the matter  was committing an Indictable Offense  sic   ref toGuss v Johnstone   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  An act of bankruptcy is committed at the end of the day on which a court determines that it is not satisfied of the matter referred to in s   of the Bankruptcy Act where        the bankruptcy notice had not otherwise been complied with within the requisite time   The requirements involved either paying the debt or securing its payment to the satisfaction of the Court or the respondent or compounding the debt to the satisfaction of the respondent  and     no extension of time had been sought or obtained under s  A  of the Bankruptcy Act         See Guss v Johnstone   HCA         ALJR   at   to     In the present case  Riley FM set out the law  at paras   and   and concluded that   an act of bankruptcy was committed by the appellant on   October   when Phipps FM dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice and   that   act of bankruptcy was sufficient to found a valid creditor s petition    There is no error   This ground of appeal should be dismissed   Grounds  l  to  r  concern ground of opposition   which was that   I was within the time prescribed by the rules to appeal the decision upon which the petition was based     This ground of appeal raises the same or substantially the same matters as grounds  e  and  k   It should be dismissed on the same bases citedMacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Secondly  the fact that the Registrar granted leave for the Petition to be amended was consistent with s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act   In MacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR   at     the Full Court stated       There is extensive authority for the proposition that the power of amendment in s  b  extends to authorising the amendment of petitions to cure omissions of allegations made mandatory by the various provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and Bankruptcy Rules  that is  to cure what can be accepted to be more serious deficiencies in petitions than  formal defects or irregularities  within s     The date of the commission of the act of bankruptcy is an allegation made mandatory in a petition  s  A  of the Bankruptcy Act and Form   in Sch   to the Federal Court Rules    Cth   The discretion to amend in s  b  is exercisable in all cases according to the circumstances of the particular case  MacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR   at     In the present case  the appellant could not have been left in any doubt by what was stated in the Petition   the appellant had committed an act of bankruptcy within six months before presentation of the Petition by failing to comply with a bankruptcy notice dated   September    personally served on him on   September   by failing to pay or secure the amount specified in the bankruptcy notice or by failing to satisfy the court that there was a valid ground for dismissing the notice  MacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR   at    Unsurprisingly  the appellant did not suggest that he was left in any doubt that he had committed an act of bankruptcy and the Petition had been issued on that basis   This ground of appeal should be dismissed   Ground  c  is that    a s a hearing De novo  Riley FM failed to rule that re verification and re service be dispensed with    This ground of appeal substantially overlaps with ground  b  and should be dismissed on those bases citedMartin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     ALR   This ground of appeal proceeds upon a misunderstanding of the nature of the review provided for in s   of the FM Act   The review is a hearing de novo  Section   of the FM Act provides that upon the hearing  the Court   may make any order or orders it thinks fit in relation to the matter in respect of which the power was exercised    Consistent with it being a hearing

reasons for decision are to be found in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd  previously Cuthberts Nominees Pty Ltd    FMCA    After setting out the affidavit material filed in support of the Petition  Riley FM described the course the Review Application took before her in the following terms       The present application for review was filed on   July   and was supported with an affidavit affirmed by Mr Moran on that date  a further affidavit affirmed by Mr Moran on   July   and a notice of the grounds of opposition to the petition dated   July    When the application for review was being heard  Mr Moran indicated that he had mistakenly understood that an affidavit that he had filed in relation to his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was before the court  He was given leave to file in this proceeding an affidavit dealing with the material that he had understood was already before the court  as well as material indicating that he was a beneficiary of his mother s estate  That material was included in an affidavit affirmed by Mr Moran on   August           Mr Moran also handed up late in the hearing a photocopy of an order of the District Court of Queensland dated   December   which provided that a debt of   owing to Mr Moran s uncle s estate by Mr Moran s mother  Mrs Moran  be transferred to Mr Moran  Mrs Moran and two other relatives in equal shares  The provenance of that document was not established before this court   Nor  was any evidence given about whether the debt mentioned in the order had been discharged in the   years or so since the order was apparently made  Mr Moran did not satisfactorily explain how the order had a bearing on the present review  Accordingly  I am unable to take it into account   On   November   the appellant filed this appeal against the orders made by Riley FM dismissing the Review Application   Finally  on   February   the High Court dismissed the appellant s application for special leave to
