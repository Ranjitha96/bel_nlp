will infer the degree of annexation from the surrounding circumstances including the nature of the object and the nature of the interest held in the land by the owner of the object  The test is objective  namely  what a reasonable person would consider to be the reason for attaching the object to the land   Further the proper formulation of the test is not whether damages are an adequate remedy but whether it is just in all the circumstances that the plaintiff should be confined to his remedy in damages  The courts have recognised there may be cases in which it is unjust to confine a plaintiff to its remedy in damages because of  for example  the difficulty in estimating damages and damages which cannot be taken into monetary account such as loss of goodwill and trade reputation

notwithstanding that the defendant has not previously engaged in the prohibited conduct or does not intend to engage in it again or to continue to engage in it or there is no imminent danger of substantial damage  Yet these are the traditional requirements for equitable injunctive relief        In my opinion subss   and   are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied  ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pts IV or V of the Act  the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers  devoid of traditional constraints  though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly        This does not mean that the traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant  For example  it must be relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct or whether it has ever occurred before or whether imminent substantial damage is likely  but the absence of any one or more of these elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction under s    That is the effect of subss   and    subs   in relation to the prevention of conduct and subs   in relation to a mandatory injunction   Their presence is not an indication of a new statutory house  rather an old house with some modern extensions   Gummow J at   came to essentially the same conclusion   Section   and   of the BCII Act empower the Court to grant injunctions  including interim injunctions  in relation to a person who has contravened a civil penalty provision  Subsection   defines an eligible person to make an application under s   and   to include a person affected by the contravention  The applicant is a person affected by the alleged contraventions  Section   is a civil penalty provision as defined in s    Thus  s   and s  a  empower this Court on the present application  to make an interim injunction in relation to a person who has contravened s   referred toJohn Holland Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   In John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   the defendant submitted that because the industrial action had stopped the plaintiff needed to show that there was a  strong probability  that the defendants  conduct would be the cause of serious damage  the threat of injury was immediate and substantial  and damages would not be a sufficient or adequate remedy if the damage did occur  In rejecting that submission and granting an interlocutory injunction  Le Miere J said at   The degree of probability of future injury is not an absolute standard  What is to be aimed at is justice between the parties  having regard to all the relevant circumstances  Hooper v Rogers at   per Russell LJ followed by the Full Federal Court in Magic Menu Systems Pty Ltd v AFA Facilitation Pty Ltd at      Provided that there is a real risk of wrongful conduct which would cause injury which is more than trivial  there may be no good reason to refuse

As Lord Reid observed in delivering the judgement of the Board in The Wagon Mound  No        AC   at pp          It is used with various shades of meaning  Sometimes it appears to mean more probable than not  sometimes it appears to include events likely but not very likely to occur  sometimes it has a still wider meaning and refers to events the chance of which is anything more than a bare possibility   In R v Thomson     Qd R   Fitzgerald P said at      probable  is another word of variable import which takes its meaning from the context in which it is used       In Johns v  R   HCA         CLR     Stephen J seemed to accept at   that  probable  might sometimes be satisfied by  anything more than a bare possibility  while  as will be seen below  sometimes the degree of probability required must be  overwhelming  however  the more usual debate is whether  probable  requires more than a  real or substantial possibility          To complete the circle  just as the meaning of  likely  is sometimes expressed by reference to what is  probable  the meaning of  probable  is sometimes related to whether an event or consequence is  more likely than not        Sometimes  probable

particularly at     and     In Kestrel Coal Chesterman J said at   This is not a case of idle threats  The defendants have in the past acted unlawfully in violation of the plaintiffs  rights  This factor makes the case different from those in which an injunction is sought because of conduct which is only apprehended  The principles applicable to quia timet injunctions are not entirely applicable  The fact that unlawful conduct has occurred makes the court more disposed towards ordering relief  See Dean and Chapter of Chester v Smelting Corporation Limited     LT   at   and Attorney General v Beck     NSWLR   at       This also is not a case of idle threats  The respondents have made good their threat to engage in a week of industrial action and  on   October  threatened further industrial action if the Demand is not met  Further  the respondents have shown a preparedness to engage in industrial action in contravention of the AIRC Order  In all the circumstances  and having regard to the main object of the BCII Act  it is just that the respondents should be restrained from engaging in further industrial action until the application can be heard or further order     I
