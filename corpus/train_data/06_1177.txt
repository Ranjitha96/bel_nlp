FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In proceeding V   of   Mr Spalla contested the appointment of Messrs Beck and Home as receivers and managers of the property of Irlmond and APS  Finkelstein J held that their appointment was lawful  see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd   FCA     Spalla  No      In his reasons  his Honour addressed the question of whether Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed  Mr Spalla contended that the companies were not insolvent at that time  His Honour held  however  that  the fact that the companies were insolvent is an inescapable conclusion from the evidence  see Spalla  No   at     Mr Spalla appealed against the decision of Finkelstein J to the Full Court  The Full Court  which was constituted by Heerey  Sundberg and Weinberg JJ  upheld his Honour s decision  see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd   FCA     Spalla  No      The Full Court held  amongst other things  that the primary judge was correct to find that Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed  see Spalla  No   at       In proceeding V   of   St George Wholesale Finance unsuccessfully petitioned for a sequestration order against Mr Spalla based on an alleged failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice  The notice claimed that Mr Spalla owed a debt pursuant to the judgment obtained in proceeding V   of   before Finkelstein J  Mr Spalla contested the sum specified  In St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla   FCA   at         Heerey J concluded that  St George is not sure itself what is really owing under the judgment  and that  this proceeding amounts to an abuse of the procedures provided by the Act    The primary proceeding began on   October   when Still   Co filed the original application and statement of claim on behalf of the then applicants  Those applicants were Mr Spalla and his wife  Stella  Mr Still  and Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd  Anstella  as the holder of all shares in Irlmond and APS  Irlmond was not one of the original parties to the primary proceeding  The original respondents included St George Motor Finance  St George Wholesale Finance  Messrs Beck and Home  and Deloittes  By their original statement of claim  the applicants alleged that the respondents had given false evidence in the proceeding before Finkelstein J and raised various claims relating to the receivership of Irlmond and APS  The applicants also claimed that the respondents had conspired wrongly to subject Mr Spalla and Mr Still to criminal conspiracy charges   Prior to May   Mr Rambaldi retained the firm of Darrer Muir Fleiter to advise him with respect to the primary proceeding and  in particular  as to Irlmond s prospects if it were to join in the proceeding  On   November   Mr Rambaldi sought quotations for insurance litigation funding  In a facsimile dated   February   Mr Rambaldi s solicitors subsequently wrote to Mr Spalla s solicitors stating that  as liquidator of Irlmond  Mr Rambaldi was not in a position to join in the primary proceeding  or institute his own proceeding  until he had entered into an acceptable funding arrangement  although Mr Rambaldi had  his own legal advice that various claims against the Respondents  or a combination of them are likely to be successful    Throughout February and March   Mr Rambaldi  assisted by Mr Vasudevan negotiated with IMF  Australia  Ltd  IMF  represented by Mr Clive Bowman  to secure litigation funding and  in particular  concerning the terms of a litigation funding agreement  which Mr Rambaldi required before agreeing to Irlmond becoming an applicant in the primary proceeding  The contemporaneous correspondence shows that control of the litigation was an important issue  By a letter dated   March   IMF specifically noted that it wanted to avoid  Spalla attempting to block  or interfere with  a settlement which Irlmond wishes to pursue   It reiterated this concern in an email of   April    Ultimately  a funding agreement was reached with Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd  ILF  a wholly owned subsidiary of IMF  Before concluding the funding agreement  Mr Spalla retained the services of Mr Borden to act on his behalf in place of Still   Co   At the hearing of the motion on   May   Finkelstein J allowed Mr Iain Jones  as counsel for two of the St George parties in their capacity as creditors of Irlmond  to appear and make submissions  Mr Jones argued that the agreement  as then drafted  improperly limited the liquidator s discretion to settle claims on behalf of Irlmond  Mr Jones noted that clauses   and   of the proposed funding agreement allowed the Spalla Interests to object to the liquidator accepting a settlement offer made only to Irlmond and  in the event of such an objection  delegated to an arbitrator the decision whether to accept such an offer  Mr Jones claimed that this arrangement was an unlawful restraint on the liquidator s discretion  His Honour said that it appeared that Mr Jones was correct on this point  Mr Jones also argued that the proposed funding agreement which allowed ILF to withdraw at any time on seven days  notice but still take part in a distribution of any recovery gave ILF a potential windfall if it withdrew shortly after executing the agreement   After the hearing of   May   the parties to the proposed funding agreement negotiated further  in order to amend it so as to meet the concerns expressed by Finkelstein J  In particular  as part of these further negotiations  the parties considered the issue of control over any settlement offer to Irlmond and the issue of ILF getting a  windfall  if it withdrew its indemnity shortly after executing the agreement  They prepared a new draft funding agreement  On   May   Mr Rambaldi filed this new draft in the Court  together with counsel s supplementary submission in support of the new agreement   This supplementary submission stated that the amendments to the proposed funding agreement  address the criticisms made by Mr Jones   It continued   The effect of the amendments is to         a  remove any restriction on the power of the liquidator to accept a settlement offer made to the company  No limitations are imposed upon the liquidator at all in this regard     b  in the event that ILF terminates its indemnity pursuant to clause     to restrict the entitlement of ILF to the  Recovery  to simply a reimbursement of monies it has paid pursuant to clause       The new agreement deleted the former clauses   and   from the earlier draft  Clause   relating to control of the proceedings  was unchanged except  clause   was substituted for the words  clause   in clause      A new clause   dealt with  Recoveries   A new clause   relevantly read       DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE           If at any time  a dispute or difference arises in connection with this Agreement and that dispute or difference has not been able to be resolved by negotiations between the parties then a party may provide the other parties with a written notice addressed to the other parties outlining the dispute or difference  and if capable of remedy  requiring remedy on the expiry of   Business Days from receipt of the written notice                  If the dispute or difference communicated to the other parties by written notice is not remedied or is not capable of remedy  then the parties agree to submit to mediation prior to the institution of Court proceedings utilising the following procedure              a  The parties shall jointly appoint a mediator  If the parties cannot agree on a mediator within   Business Days of receipt of the written notice by the other parties  the parties agree that any one or more of the parties may request the President for the time being of the Law Institute of Victoria to nominate a mediator       b  The costs and expenses plus any GST payable to the mediator and the costs and expenses of the mediation shall be paid by Anstella       c  If a settlement is reached at the mediation  written terms of settlement shall be entered into immediately upon conclusion of the mediation and shall  unless Court approval of the terms of settlement is required  override the terms and conditions of this Agreement      referred toSpalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd   FCA  http

upheld his Honour s decision  see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd   FCA     Spalla  No      The Full Court held  amongst other things  that the primary judge was correct to find that

notice claimed that Mr Spalla owed a debt pursuant to the judgment obtained in proceeding V   of   before Finkelstein J  Mr Spalla contested the sum specified  In St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla   FCA   at         Heerey J concluded that  St George is not sure itself what is really owing under the judgment  and that  this proceeding amounts to an abuse of the procedures provided by the Act  referred toAnstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   May   Finkelstein J delivered reasons for judgment giving approval to Mr Rambaldi as liquidator of Irlmond to enter into the funding agreement in the form attached to his counsel s supplementary submission of   May   see Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd   FCA     Anstella    His Honour wrote  at      The initial version of the draft agreement required the liquidator to surrender his power to control the destiny of the action in the event of disagreement between the liquidator and the other applicants concerning the settlement or discontinuance of the action  The draft agreement provided that the liquidator could not instruct his solicitors to settle or discontinue the proceeding without obtaining the consent of the other applicants  If there was a dispute  the matter had to go to arbitration        It seemed to me     that the proposal gave rise to a     difficulty  namely whether there are any circumstances under which a liquidator can lawfully give up his statutory powers or duties  There is a view that  while a liquidator may listen to the opinion of others on what steps he should take in a particular situation  in the end he must exercise his own judgment on what is or is not in the best interests of the creditors or contributories  For this reason he cannot give up control of litigation in which his company is a party  This is the view taken by Lightman J in Grovewood Holdings Plc v James Capel   Co Ltd   Ch          Recognising the potential difficulty he was in  the liquidator sought time to see whether Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd  ILF   the company providing the funding  could be persuaded to change the terms  This is in fact what occurred  The liquidator was able to negotiate the removal of the restriction on his ability to settle or discontinue the proceeding if Irlmond became a party to the action   On   May   the litigation funding agreement  hereafter referred to as  the LFA  was executed by Mr and Mrs Spalla  Mr Still  Anstella  Mr Rambaldi  Irlmond  and ILF  Other significant provisions of the LFA include    Clause  a iv  provided that the  Spalla Interests shall pay and shall at all times remain liable to pay all Legal Costs charged by the Solicitors  Senior Counsel and Junior Counsel in respect to     Irlmond and the Liquidator s participation in and conduct of the Proceeding   Clause     required the Spalla Interests to provide the liquidator with a letter confirming that the Spalla Interests have sufficient funds to settle these costs      Pursuant to Clause     the Spalla Interests agreed to indemnify Irlmond and the liquidator in respect of legal costs claimed by their joint representatives in the proceeding     Clause     provided that ILF would indemnify the liquidator for any costs for which he becomes personally liable in relation to his and Irlmond s participation in the primary proceeding  Pursuant to Clause      t he indemnity provided by ILF to the Liquidator in respect of any Costs Order will not be a continuing indemnity  but may be terminated by ILF  in its absolute discretion by giving   days written notice to the Liquidator   This right of termination was subject to a proviso that ILF would remain liable for any personal costs orders against the liquidator up to the time of termination     Clause   related to the appointment of solicitors and counsel and provided that solicitors and junior and senior counsel would be retained to act for the liquidator  Irlmond and the Spalla Interests  In accordance with clause     the solicitors were to be HWL  or such other firm of solicitors retained to act for the Liquidator and Irlmond from time to time  and senior counsel was to be Peter Hayes QC  or such other lead Counsel retained to act for the Liquidator and Irlmond from time to time      Clause   contained certain warranties  including that the  Spalla Interests warrants  sic  that it  sic  has sufficient financial resources to carry out its  sic  obligations under this Agreement and shall continue to have such financial resources   HWL and the Spalla Interests entered into a costs agreement with respect to the primary proceeding in May    Mr Spalla s original retainer with HWL required Mr Spalla to pay   upfront with the balance to be at HWL s prevailing hourly rates  plus a   uplift fee to be paid on the successful outcome of the matter  Mr Spalla was to meet all HWL s disbursements and counsel fees  Mr Spalla reached a similar  no win  no fee  arrangement with Mr Hayes QC  Mr Spalla paid the initial amount of   to HWL and funded the litigation in accordance with these agreements  He did not  however  have sufficient funds to meet the costs of the litigation had all of the lawyers  costs been due at the time they were incurred referred toSpalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   September   French J struck out the applicants  further amended statement of claim but gave liberty to file and serve  by   October   a substituted application and statement of claim  see Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA     Spalla  No      His Honour also ordered that the applicants pay the respondents  costs of their respective motions  Amongst other things  his Honour held that many of the allegations in the further amended statement of claim involved allegations of fact that contradicted the factual findings made by Finkelstein J in proceeding V   of    In these respects  the further amended statement of claim could not stand  against the res judicata estoppel and the issue estoppels generated by the judgment in the first proceedings  see Spalla  No   at     and     The primary proceeding was originally fixed for trial beginning on   July    As a result of the various strike out motions  that date was vacated and the matter was re listed for hearing in February    On   October   HWL advised Mr Spalla  by a letter  which was also copied to Mr Rambaldi  that they would terminate their retainer with Mr Spalla if the February   hearing date were vacated for any reason  Amongst other things  the letter said   w hilst we regret having to take this position  we simply cannot afford the ongoing burden of the case and the impact it is having on the firm overall    Some days later  on   October   HWL wrote to Mr Spalla that   In line with our obligation to keep you apprised of the costs incurred thus far  we advise that as at   October   the total time recorded on this matter is     of which     has been paid leaving an unpaid work in progress of      This does not include any uplifting fee which was outlined in our costs agreement    HWL copied this letter to Mr Rambaldi   Also on   October   Mr Beck sent Mr Bowman a facsimile on Deloittes  letterhead  In this facsimile  Mr Beck referred  amongst other things  to the order for costs that French J had made on   September   against the applicants and in favour of the Deloitte parties  He stated that his solicitors had informed him that the Deloitte parties  costs were about   on a party and party basis and that the Deloitte parties sought these costs from ILF  in its capacity as a non party   He also wrote that if  the matter proceeds and Irlmond is unsuccessful  we will look to ILF for its entire costs of the matter and we reserve all our rights to seek those costs from ILF  not only on a party and party basis but on an indemnity basis    The next day  on   October   Mr Beck sent a facsimile to Mr Rambaldi in similar terms to that sent to Mr Bowman  Mr Beck again referred to the order for costs that French J had made in favour of the Deloitte parties and to the Deloitte parties  solicitors  estimate of the amount of these costs  He wrote that the Deloitte parties sought these costs from Mr Rambaldi personally and added that  should the matter proceed and Irlmond fail  the Deloitte parties  will look to you personally for  their  entire costs of the matter     not only on a party and party basis but on an indemnity basis    Pursuant to French J s orders of   September   a third further amended application and a third further amended statement of claim were filed in the primary proceeding on   October    This statement of claim named Mr Spalla  Mr Still and Irlmond as the first  second and third applicants  No other applicants were named  The first to fifth and seventh and eighth respondents were the same as those in the present proceeding  The sixth respondent was the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  ASIC    By the third further amended statement of claim  Irlmond brought numerous claims against the St George parties and the Deloitte parties arising out of the receivership of Irlmond  Against the St George parties  Irlmond claimed breach of mortgagee s duties  conversion and contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Against the Deloitte parties  Irlmond claimed breach of receiver s duties and conversion and sought restitution of the receiver s fees  Irlmond claimed restitution of the sum of     million together with other payments against St George Motor Wholesale   Also by the third further amended statement of claim  Mr Spalla and Mr Still brought claims against Messrs Beck and Home for malicious prosecution and injurious falsehood  Mr Spalla and Mr Still also brought a claim for malicious prosecution against ASIC referred toSpalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No       FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   December   French J ordered that most of the statement of claim in the primary proceeding be struck out  see Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No       FCA     Spalla  No      In essence  his Honour held that most of the statement of claim was an abuse of process because it sought to relitigate issues that had been determined by Finkelstein J in proceeding V   of   see Spalla  No   at          His Honour struck out all of Irlmond s claims for conversion and breach of duties against the St George and the Deloitte parties   The only claim of Irlmond that was not struck out was the claim for     million against St George Motor Wholesale  That claim related to the application of proceeds of the sale of Essendon Mitsubishi which was a discrete event that post dated the judgment of Finkelstein J  For this reason  his Honour concluded  at     that the claim should not be struck out as an attempt to relitigate a matter already determined by Finkelstein J  At   however  his Honour expressed doubt as to whether  the impugned payment of     million  would be shown  to be anything other than a continuation  of practices already approved by Finkelstein J  His Honour did not strike out Mr Spalla s and Mr Still s claims for malicious prosecution and injurious falsehood  see Spalla  No   at       On   December   Messrs Beck and Home filed a notice of motion seeking leave to appeal from the interlocutory orders of French J allowing Mr Spalla and Mr Still liberty to continue their claims for malicious prosecution and injurious falsehood  This application was given proceeding number VID   of    On   January   Irlmond also sought leave to appeal from the orders of French J that were unfavourable to it  This application was given proceeding number VID   of    These two proceedings  hereafter  the appeals  were to be heard together   With the judgment of French J in December   and the institution of the appeals in January   the primary proceeding entered a new stage and  so far as ILF  Irlmond  Mr Rambaldi and HWL were concerned  led to their reappraisal of the litigation   On   January   prior to Irlmond filing its appeal  Mr Vasudevan  Mr Bowman and Mr Stephen Foale from ILF  and Mr Borden and Ms April Arslan met at the offices of Pitcher Partners  in order to discuss French J s judgment  Mr Rambaldi did not attend although  as copies of Mr Vasudevan s emails of   and   January   attest  Mr Vasudevan kept him informed  In these emails  Mr Vasudevan reported to Mr Rambaldi that Mr Bowman was concerned about ILF s exposure to any personal costs liability incurred by Mr Rambaldi or its own liability for costs as a  third party  beneficiary of the action  Mr Vasudevan also reported to Mr Rambaldi that HWL estimated that solicitor client costs for the respondents would be between   million and   million  Significantly for present purposes  Mr Vasudevan notified Mr Rambaldi that   There may be a possibility that Delloites  sic  may entertain the possibility of settling the matter or ending the matter where each party bears  its  own costs  and in that regard  Borden was prepared to help with the appeal  Spalla will not be a factor in settlement negotiations as if he does not come to the party  then IMF  HWL and the liquidator will drop this matter       Mr Vasudevan advised Mr Rambaldi that  after HWL left  Mr Bowman told Mr Vasudevan  that ILF was considering withdrawing its indemnity  although it would not do so until after the appeal was lodged and  if settlement negotiations do not go well  referred toBeck v Spalla   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As already noted  the applications for leave to appeal and the appeals were listed for hearing on   and   May    The mediation was scheduled for   April    A Full Court  which was constituted by Hill  Finn and Kenny JJ  heard argument in proceeding VID   of   on   May   and  on   May   granted leave to appeal and dismissed the appeal  see Beck v Spalla   FCAFC    On account of what happened at the mediation on   April   proceeding VID   of   did not proceed before the Full Court on   May     On   April   two days prior to the mediation  Mr Rambaldi and Mr Vasudevan  Mr Foale  Mr Borden and Ms Arslan  and Mr Spalla and Mr Ian Still attended a meeting  to discuss the forthcoming mediation  I accept that a file note of that meeting  which Mr Borden had prepared the following day  accurately records the discussions at that meeting   At the meeting of   April   Mr Rambaldi repeated that ILF was considering withdrawing its litigation support and that he would be unable to continue with the litigation if it did so  He also said that  if ILF withdrew after the mediation  he would take whatever offer was made  including a walk away offer  Mr Borden s file note of the meeting specifically recorded that   Gess  Rambaldi  reported that he had been informed that ILF was considering withdrawing its support  He reported that if ILF withdrew its support  he would not be able to proceed any further with the litigation  He requested ILF to advise whether they would continue support past Friday  as he will need to know this when taking on board any offers that might be made  If the support is withdrawn after Friday  Gess advised that he would take whatever offer was made including a walk away if that was available       Mr Rambaldi also asked the solicitors what they thought the Irlmond claim was worth  Mr Borden s file note records that Ms Arslan  advised that the bottom line was somewhere between    million  and    million  plus interest and costs  referred toRambaldi v Spalla   VSC  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSC  html  The application was heard by Hansen J on   May    Mr Randall appeared for Mr Rambaldi  Mr Spalla appeared in person  Mr Randall said that  although Mr Rambaldi had come to Court to put the option of allowing the officers of Irlmond to take over the litigation   his preference is that the court declines to make the orders   Mr Spalla spoke also  He expressed disapproval of how Mr Rambaldi had acted in signing the Deed and said that he wished to take control of the litigation  At the conclusion of the hearing  his Honour declined to make the orders sought and gave reasons  see Rambaldi v Spalla   VSC     Rambaldi     Hansen J found that he had insufficient information to form a view on the likelihood of success of Irlmond on appeal or at trial  Rambaldi at    Therefore  he was unable to determine if it was in the best interests of the company to continue with the litigation  He noted that Mr Spalla had not made any  proposal by which the position of the company in relation to the adverse costs orders which are to be released under the settlement could be secured  that is to say if authority was given to Mr Spalla to continue with the proceeding  that the company would be no worse off than it would be in that respect under the settlement  Rambaldi at    Similarly  his Honour noted that he had no  assurance beyond that stated by Mr Spalla  as to how the company s ongoing costs are to be paid  Rambaldi at     Later that day  but before     pm  Mr Rambaldi procured the consent of his partners to the Deed   Before turning to the parties  submissions  I note that Mr Borden properly conceded that he could not recollect the precise words used at the mediation or in pre mediation conferences and that  in general  his file notes are likely to be more reliable than his present recollection  I accept this and further I accept that Mr Borden s handwritten notes  which were made at the time of the mediation  are even more reliable than his typed notes of the mediation   On legal advice  Mr Spalla did not make an application to take over the carriage of the primary proceeding for Irlmond  Having sought his own independent legal advice  Mr Rambaldi did apply to the Supreme Court  Mr Spalla claims that the application to the Supreme Court was not made in good faith because Mr Rambaldi did not support it  Mr Rambaldi explained that he did not support the orders sought by the application because he did not believe that Mr Spalla was an appropriate person to have conduct of the Irlmond claim in the primary proceeding  He explained that  in his view  Mr Spalla was too emotionally involved with the litigation and might not be able to bring sufficient objectivity to the commercial decisions associated with managing litigation on behalf of a company in liquidation  This does not show that Mr Rambaldi brought the application in bad faith  As liquidator of Irlmond  Mr Rambaldi was required to advise the Court of his position in relation to the application  Although he did not support the application  by bringing it he gave Mr Spalla the opportunity to seek an order giving him authority to conduct the litigation  As Hansen J explain in Rambaldi at      D  oubtless out of some thought for the other interests involved   Mr Rambaldi  has brought this application which may be thought to have been designed to draw Mr Spalla to seek authority to conduct the litigation under the guise of the originating process  As I have said  Mr Spalla takes the opportunity to seek that authority  He wishes to be able to conduct the litigation and  as discussed with counsel  I could make such an order under s  b  of the Act if  in my view  it was otherwise appropriate to do so     Similarly  I do not find that the application was brought in bad faith  I find that it was filed in a good faith attempt to seek the guidance of the Court and to allow Mr Spalla an opportunity to put his case to the Court  Overall  I find no reason to conclude that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in the week before the Deed was ratified referred toWestpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell     ACSR   Mr Spalla relied on s   of the Corporations Act    Cth   the Act   as a basis for his application  That section allows a  person aggrieved by any act     or decision  of a liquidator to appeal to the Court in respect of the act or decision  The Court can  confirm  reverse or modify the act or decision   Citing Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell     ACSR     Westpac v Totterdell     Mr Spalla submitted that he had standing to bring an appeal under this section as a creditor of Irlmond  of which he was also the sole director  Mr Spalla also maintained that he had standing as an applicant and the funder in the primary proceeding  He also pointed out that he and his wife were the owners and controllers of Anstella  which in turn held all the issued shares in Irlmond  Mr Spalla identified  the decision of Mr Rambaldi to execute the Deed of Settlement on   April   and subsequently seek and obtain the ratification of the Deed by his partners on   May   as the subject of the appeal   Under r     of the Federal Court  Corporations  Rules  the Rules  any appeal under s   of an act  omission or decision of a liquidator must be filed within   days after the date of the act  omission or decision appealed against   Mr Spalla argued that his appeal was not out of time because  even though his initial notice of motion did not refer to s   of the Act   this proceeding was initiated within   days of the execution of the Deed  In the alternative  Mr Spalla sought an extension of time to bring an appeal under s    He argued that an extension of time was appropriate because his initial notice of motion put Mr Rambaldi and other interested parties on notice of the nature of Mr Spalla s complaints against him   Mr Spalla also sought to rely on s   and s   of the Act   As I accept that s   is an appropriate vehicle for Mr Spalla s challenge to the Deed  it is unnecessary to discuss these sections of the Act further   In the context of this case  two considerations must be borne steadily in mind  First  s   of the Act provides that a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property  Secondly  by way of reiteration  the courts are generally  loath to enter into the area where the professional liquidator has made a commercial decision which he considers benefits the stakeholders whom he represents  at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision  see Star v Silvia  No       ACLC   at   per Young J  Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd     ACLC   at   per Young J  Northbourne at   Westpac v Totterdell at     per Ipp J  with whom Pidgeon and White JJ agreed  and Cook v Northoak Holdings Pty Ltd     ACSR   referred toRe Jay O Bees Pty Ltd  In Liquidation  Rosseau Pty Ltd  In Liquidation  v Jay O Bees Pty Ltd  In Liquidation      ACSR   Mr Spalla conceded that  where an appeal under s   of the Act is against a liquidator s discretionary decision or a decision involving business judgment  the Court would not reverse the liquidator s decision unless it was satisfied that the liquidator acted unreasonably or in bad faith  see Re Jay O Bees Pty Ltd  In Liquidation  Rosseau Pty Ltd  In Liquidation  v Jay O Bees Pty Ltd  In Liquidation      ACSR     Jay O Bees   at   per Campbell J  Mr Spalla submitted that there were many grounds for concluding that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith by executing the Deed  As he raised so many grounds  Mr Spalla s submissions were somewhat diffuse  In what follows  I attempt to outline his main arguments   Perhaps foremost among Mr Spalla s arguments is his claim that Mr Rambaldi acted in breach of the LFA  Additionally  he argues that  by his conduct  Mr Rambaldi breached his obligations under the Act   including under s    In particular  in breach of the LFA  Mr Spalla alleges that Mr Rambaldi breached clauses           and   of the LFA  Under clause     HWL were to  conduct the Proceeding on behalf of the Liquidator and the Spalla Interests   In Mr Spalla s view  Mr Rambaldi breached clause     by negotiating the terms of the Deed without consulting his solicitors   Under clause     the Liquidator was not permitted to instruct the solicitors to settle the  proceedings as a whole  or to  settle  amend  vary  abandon or discontinue any claim made or the relief sought by the Spalla Interests  without consent of the Spalla Interests  Mr Spalla argued that the words  any claim made  included the claim made on behalf of and in the name of Irlmond   The decision to accept a settlement on behalf of Irlmond  and the preliminary decision to sign the Deed  were clearly discretionary decisions of the liquidator  They also involved matters of business judgment  It is well settled that where an appeal is brought against such a decision  the court will reverse the liquidator s decision only when it is satisfied that he was acting unreasonably or in bad faith  see Jay O Bees at   and the authorities referred to  This is in contrast to an appeal against a rejection of a proof of debt where the

 It is unnecessary to discuss it further referred toWatson v Foxman     NSWLR   Although Mr Rambaldi asked the Court to prefer his evidence to that of Mr Spalla in so far as their evidence conflicted  he did not ask the Court to make a negative credibility finding with respect to Mr Spalla  Rather  Mr Rambaldi relied on the principles referred to by McLelland CJ in Watson v Foxman     NSWLR   at        H  uman memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons  and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time  particularly where disputes or litigation intervene  and the processes of memory are overlaid  often subconsciously  by perceptions or self interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said  All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then  again often subconsciously  constructed  All this is a matter of ordinary human experience     Mr Rambaldi said that these considerations were especially apposite in this case where Mr Spalla has a very high degree of personal involvement in the proceedings  Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Spalla has been caught up in litigation including the failed criminal prosecution for many years now  Mr Rambaldi submitted that these difficult circumstances have impacted on Mr Spalla s ability to consider the issues and events relating to this case in a dispassionate manner  According to Mr Rambaldi  this has lead to Mr Spalla misremembering some conversations such as the meeting at the conclusion of the mediation   Mr Rambaldi submitted that  as Mr Spalla alleged bad faith  the Court is not being asked to decide whether Mr Rambaldi achieved the best settlement possible  Mr Rambaldi sought to distinguish bad faith from negligence  With bad faith  he submitted  the enquiry is directed to the actual state of mind of the decision maker against whom bad faith is alleged  He argued that there is no such thing as constructive bad faith referred toBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Rambaldi argued that bad faith is a serious allegation and that the Court must reach a comfortable satisfaction that the case is made out in accordance with the Briginshaw test  see Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR     Briginshaw   at     per Dixon J  He submitted that  as there is no precise definition of bad faith  whether the case is made out will depend on the particular facts  Mr Rambaldi contested that there were any grounds in this case for concluding that he had acted in bad faith  Mr Spalla had failed  so Mr Rambaldi said  to adduce evidence to satisfy the Court  on the balance of probabilities  that  in entering into the irrevocable offer  Mr Rambaldi was actuated by bad faith   Further  counsel for Mr Rambaldi contended that Mr Rambaldi  at all times  acted in good faith  Counsel asked for a positive finding that Mr Rambaldi was acting in good faith when he entered into the offer and recommended to his partners that it should be given effect  A key element of Mr Rambaldi s submissions was his claim that a liquidator who is not funded or is without indemnity is not expected to continue a proceeding  Accordingly  Mr Rambaldi could not have been expected to continue his involvement in the primary proceeding beyond   May    Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Borden  who was the lawyer of Mr Rambaldi and Mr Spalla jointly  had said that Mr Rambaldi could not be expected to continue the proceedings without an indemnity and would be entitled to accept a walk away offer in those circumstances   Mr Rambaldi argued that  once he was informed on   April   that his indemnity was to be withdrawn  he knew that he would not be able to continue with the litigation after   May   and he behaved reasonably to protect the interests of creditors in those circumstances  He said that he procured an offer at the mediation that would stay open for seven days  thereby providing an opportunity for options for continuing the litigation to be explored  He claimed that he procured his partners  consent to the Deed only after no reasonable way to continue the litigation was found  He said that his conduct was consistent with the LFA  Mr Spalla was utterly wrong to characterize what he did to preserve Mr Spalla s position for seven days as a  facade    Mr Spalla has attempted to satisfy this standard of review by showing that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in executing the Deed  This is a serious allegation  involving the imputation of moral turpitude  The standard of proof to be applied is proof on the preponderance of probability with due regard to the seriousness of the particular issue being determined  As Dixon J said in Briginshaw at          W  hen the law requires the proof of any fact  the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found  It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality      Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution  it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal  But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature or consequence of the fact or facts to be proved  The seriousness of an allegation made  the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description  or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal  In such matters  reasonable satisfaction  should not be produced by inexact proofs  indefinite testimony  or indirect inferences     An allegation of bad faith is a serious claim affecting reputation and the Court should have regard to this when considering the evidence   Section   of the Act relevantly provides that an officer of a corporation a term that includes a liquidator  s     must exercise powers and discharge duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose  Whether there has been bad faith will depend on the

I find that Mr Spalla has standing under this provision  None of the respondents contended that he did not   I am satisfied that Mr Spalla has standing because of his role in the primary proceeding  Mr Spalla is a moving party in the primary proceeding  which is the subject of the Deed and settlement  and  under the LFA  he  and others  undertook to pay the legal costs in the primary proceeding of Irlmond and Mr Rambaldi  Even though the Spalla Interest claims were not settled  see below  it is reasonable to assume that the settlement of the Irlmond claim would significantly affect Mr Spalla as a party to the primary proceeding and deprive him of the advantage of Irlmond s participation  It also affected his rights and obligations under the LFA  Thus  for example  the Deed did not include any release against costs orders in favour of Mr Spalla and the Spalla Interests  Because of this  Mr Spalla claims that the Deed left him exposed to adverse costs orders in relation to Irlmond s claim in the primary proceeding  Mr Spalla has a  legal grievance  compare Northbourne at    Mr Spalla s role in the primary proceeding  both as a principal party and under the LFA  is sufficient to give him the standing as a  person aggrieved  under s     Under r     of the Rules  Mr Spalla requires an extension of time to bring an appeal pursuant to s   of the Act   Mr Spalla did not purport to bring an appeal under this section until   April   well outside the   day period for which r    a  provides  The Court has the power to grant an extension of time under r     of the Rules  When deciding whether to grant such an extension  the Court has regard to all the circumstances of the case  including the extent and circumstances of the delay and any potential prejudice to other parties  In this case an extension is warranted  As Mr Spalla submitted  his notice of motion of   May   was filed within   days of the challenged act and put Mr Rambaldi on notice of the points he wishes to raise in the appeal  In all the circumstances of the case  and in light of this fact and the fact that the respondents have not opposed an extension of time  I would grant the extension Mr Spalla seeks   In the context of this case  two considerations must be borne steadily in mind  First  s   of the Act provides that a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property  Secondly  by way of reiteration  the courts are generally  loath to enter into the area where the professional liquidator has made a commercial decision which he considers benefits the stakeholders whom he represents  at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision  see Star v Silvia  No       ACLC   at   per Young J  Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd     ACLC   at   per Young J  Northbourne at   Westpac v Totterdell at     per

the preliminary decision to sign the Deed  were clearly discretionary decisions of the liquidator  They also involved matters of business judgment  It is well settled that where an appeal is brought against such a decision  the court will reverse the liquidator s decision only when it is satisfied that he was acting unreasonably or in bad faith  see Jay O Bees at   and the authorities referred to  This is in contrast to an appeal against a rejection of a proof of debt where the Court hears the issue de novo  see Jay O Bees at      The  general approach     in a case like this is that  the Court  should not interfere with a decision made by the liquidator unless either there is fraud  or it can be said that the discretion has not been exercised bona fide  or it can be said that the liquidator has acted in a way which no reasonable liquidator could have acted  Bridgeport at     quoting Yeomans v Walker     NSWLR   at   per Hodgson J   Finally  I turn to the issue of whether the settlement was so unfavourable for Irlmond that it evidences that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith  Absent any other evidence of bad faith  the question must be whether or not  in executing the Deed and ultimately settling Irlmond s claim  Mr Rambaldi acted in a way that no reasonable liquidator could have acted  compare Bridgeport at      In this context  it must be borne in mind that courts are especially reluctant to second guess settlement decisions  Public policy favours settlement  As Chesterman J said in Dew v Richardson   QSC   at     settlement helps  reduce the level of disharmony in society and conserve the resources both of litigants themselves and the community which funds the courts   Others have seen the virtue of settlement in promoting certainty that permits litigants to deal with their affairs in an orderly way looking to the future  For example  in Kelley v Corston     WLR   at   Judge LJ said     Every lawyer in practice and every judge knows that there is no such thing as the case which is bound to succeed  Experience shows that cases with the brightest prospects of success somehow fail and it is difficult to underestimate the value of the certainty provided by a settlement as opposed to the continuing risks of litigation through to judgment  referred toKoowarta v Bjelke Petersen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Various

financial affairs of Irlmond  Nor have I been presented with a proper evidentiary foundation to make such findings  It is unnecessary to decide whether it is sufficient for standing under s   that Mr

stakeholders whom he represents  at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision  see Star v Silvia  No
