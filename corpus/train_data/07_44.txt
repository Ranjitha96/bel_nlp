to O   r   of the Rules for the purposes of this motion  Housewares submits that Bodum s rejection of the first offer of compromise   above  is so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs  Housewares asserted in correspondence that it would seek indemnity costs from the date of that offer in accordance with Alpine Hardwoods  Aust  Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd  No       ALR     Mere refusal of an offer or a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order for indemnity costs  the offeror needs to show that the conduct of the offeree was unreasonable   Alpine Hardwoods   ALR at     Black v Lipovac     ALR   at   to    Bodum took the position that Housewares was not a  person aggrieved  in relation to the first and second designs and  for that reason  rejected the offer to release Housewares from any claim for design infringement in circumstances where Bodum would be liable to pay Housewares  costs  While Housewares was entitled to seek to establish that it was so aggrieved  the cross claim would fail if Housewares had no standing to bring the action  It was not unreasonable for Bodum to argue that Housewares was not a  person aggrieved  in circumstances where

Company Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Bodum s submission that Housewares cannot be a  person aggrieved  is not accepted  Those words embrace   any

disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense  by the entry not being expunged     Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Company Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at     Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of

sufficient in Assa Abloy   although Heerey and Allsop JJ thought it inappropriate in that case to express a view as to what the limits may be  at   citedBlack v Lipovac     ALR   Mere refusal of an offer or a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order for indemnity costs  the offeror needs to show that the conduct of the offeree was unreasonable   Alpine Hardwoods   ALR at     Black v Lipovac     ALR   at   to    Bodum took the position that Housewares was not a  person aggrieved  in relation to the first and second designs and  for that reason  rejected the offer to release Housewares from any claim for design infringement in circumstances where Bodum would be liable to pay Housewares  costs  While Housewares was entitled to seek to establish that it was so aggrieved  the cross claim would fail if Housewares had no standing to bring the action  It was not unreasonable for Bodum to argue that Housewares was not a  person aggrieved  in circumstances where no allegation of design infringement had been pleaded  Mere refusal by Bodum of the first offer of compromise does not justify indemnity costs citedHamod v New South Wales     ALR   In my view  it was unreasonable for Bodum to issue the media release when the offer to surrender the designs and resolve the cross claim had been made  The media release sent a mixed message to Housewares  It unreasonably provoked Housewares to protect its position and the position of the retailers of its products  Bodum should pay the costs incurred by Housewares in respect of its cross claim for rectification of the Register of Designs between the issue of the media release on   October   and the  clarification  by Bodum on   November   on an indemnity basis   Hamod v New South Wales     ALR   at     That leaves for consideration whether costs are payable on an indemnity basis after   November    By then  Housewares was aware that there was no intention on the part of Bodum to allege design infringement  There was  however  still a dispute as to Housewares  entitlement to bring the cross claim and costs  Bodum had offered surrender of the designs on the condition that the cross claim for rectification be discontinued and each party pay its own costs  Housewares had offered to discontinue the cross claim in return for the surrender of the designs on the condition that Bodum pay its costs  The cross claim for rectification of the Register of Designs was capable of resolution subject to the dispute as to who should be liable for costs   Neither party sought to bring that situation to finality  Neither party approached the Court to finalise the surrender of the designs or the cross claim and resolve question of costs  Bodum did not approach Housewares or the Court with respect to orders for surrender of the designs  Housewares  knowing of the proposed surrender and the effect on its cross claim for rectification  did not seek to finalise the matter with Bodum  nor approach the Court for orders as to its cross claim  That was the time to finalise the status of the cross claim for rectification and any costs associated with it  Instead  the matter did not progress until after Housewares served a notice to admit facts relevant to the cross claim and the designs on   February    It was entitled to do so because the cross claim for rectification was still in issue  the designs had not been surrendered  Directions had been made requiring Housewares to prepare its evidence citedRitz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd     NSWLR   Bodum s submission that

Company Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at     Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd     NSWLR   at    A   close and direct connection in both a legal and practical sense between the existence and duration of the designs and potential damage to the appellant   was sufficient in Assa Abloy   although Heerey and Allsop JJ thought it inappropriate in that case to express a view as to what the limits may be  at     On   February   Bodum informed Housewares of its instructions to surrender the designs  with or without agreement from Housewares  That communication was an open letter in respect of each design  The letters stated  i  f  Housewares  is not willing to consent to the offer to surrender  the designs    we propose to file a motion seeking the Federal Court of Australia s consent to the surrender and propose to seek costs if your client unreasonably rejects this offer    It was not unreasonable for Housewares to insist that Bodum pay its costs to date as a condition for its consent  It did so by letter dated   March    It was  however  unreasonable for Housewares to continue to incur costs on the cross claim after being put on notice in an open letter that Bodum had instructed its solicitors to surrender the designs  This is especially so after   March   when Bodum   formally put  Housewares  on notice that it need not take any further steps in these proceedings relating to the  designs   Bodum should not be liable to pay the costs incurred by Housewares after the letters dated   February     Bodum should pay Housewares  costs of its motion for the Court s consent to the surrender of the designs  Bodum should also pay Housewares  costs of the cross claim for rectification of the Register of Designs incurred prior to the letters of   February    Costs incurred by Housewares between   October   and   November   are payable on an indemnity basis  Costs are otherwise payable on a party and party basis  Each party is to bear its own costs in
