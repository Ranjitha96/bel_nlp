SZFTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedNABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant also relied upon the following passages in the Full Court decision in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at       Where the tribunal fails to make a finding on     a substantial  clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts  that failure can amount to a failure to accord procedural fairness and a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction     And at     A failure by the tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence and the contentions before it which  if resolved in one way  would or could be dispositive of the review  can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review required by the Act and thereby a jurisdictional error   I am prepared to accept that discrimination was raised by the appellant but only in a very general and background way  and not so much as a claim which was a  substantial  clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts   I do not characterise  unlike the federal magistrate  the matter of discrimination as a claim which necessarily required the detailed treatment as sought by the appellant  The main focus of the claim was the real chance of persecution and fear of physical harm  The general discrimination complained of by the appellant was to lead to such physical harm  This is the gist of the complaint made by the appellant in his statutory declaration on   June   when he declared    On my return back to Bangladesh  I have real chance of being persecuted because of my community profile  My life will be under threat  There is no safety and security of life in Bangladesh for an activist like me  I shall be arrested and put into jail in relation to the false cases  I have no future in Bangladesh  I shall be discriminated in every walks of my life  My life will be in jeopardy  Under these circumstances I firmly believe that my case has merit to be considered   The question of general discrimination before the Tribunal arose because the appellant confirmed that he believed Buddhists were subject to general discrimination amounting to persecution in Bangladesh  The Tribunal said    The Applicant confirmed that he believed that Buddhists were subject to general discrimination amounting to persecution in Bangladesh  The Tribunal confirmed that the Applicant was an ethnic Bengali  and alerted him to independent information from sources such as the United States  United Kingdom  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch which described particular problems for Bangladeshi Buddhists from the Chittagong Hill Tracks  tribals   These sources referred to discrimination against minority groups generally  but did not refer to any persecution of Bengali Buddhists  The Applicant said his village in particular was not a good place for Buddhists  There were Muslims and Buddhists living there  but Buddhist religious programs had been threatened distinguishedApplicant NAKB of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This is not the

Affairs   FCA     where their Honours were dealing with a clearly articulated claim  and where their Honours could not find that the issues sought to be agitated were either dealt with generally or specifically in any part of the Tribunal s findings appliedWAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALD   The principles of law were not in contention between the parties  In both the appellant s and the first respondent s written submissions  reference was made to the decision of the Full Court in WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALD   which provides that an inference may be drawn that the Tribunal did not consider a particular issue if it fails to deal directly with that issue in its reasons  at    However  the Full Court also observed    But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point  It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected  Where however there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue  if resolved one way  would be dispositive of the Tribunal s review of the delegate s decision  a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked   Even if one treated the question of general discrimination as being a substantial  clearly articulated argument  as the Full Court cautioned in WAEE   ALD at   an inference that the Tribunal did not consider such a particular claim is  not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point
