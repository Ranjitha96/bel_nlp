Sebastian v State of Western Australia   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v The Shell Company of Australia Limited     FCR   I am not persuaded that this is necessarily the case  Common Law Superior Courts of record do not become functus officio merely upon the making and entry of the judgment or order that determines the rights of the parties  they retain power in the same suit to make supplemental orders not limited to orders in aid of the enforcement and working out of the order determining the rights of the parties  So observed Drummond J in Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v The Shell Company of Australia Limited     FCR   at    His Honour also observed that this Court s ancillary powers flow from authority under ss   and   of the FCA Act to resolve the whole of the controversy between the parties referred toBirri Gubba  Cape Upstart  People v State of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The issues involved are  at one level  complex  The applicants in the first motion have not been represented by solicitors or counsel  I would not  in the circumstances  be prepared to characterise the conduct of the applicants in the first motion as being unreasonable  This is so  even though I have concluded that the first motion has no reasonable prospect of success  The position may well have been different if the applicants in the first motion had been represented by experienced lawyers  cf Birri Gubba  Cape Upstart  People v State of Queensland   FCA      These observations should not be seen in any way as a reflection on Ms Hanigan  Ms Hanigan is a law student who I have no doubt has been doing her best to represent the interests of the applicants in the first motion  They are not in receipt of public funding   Furthermore  the articulation by Ms Hanigan of the two issues  which I have dealt with  together with her concession  quite properly made  that the resolution of these adverse to those whom she represents would justify the summary dismissal of the first motion greatly reduced both the time of the hearing and the issues for judgment citedBoston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasian Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   FCA Act   lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment  including summary dismissal  White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR    It is nonetheless not relief which is granted lightly and the Court should be cautious in dismissing proceedings pursuant to s  A  Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR    The utility of bringing such a motion in the present circumstances is questionable when  inevitably  there was  in effect  full argument on the first motion as the means of considering the motion for dismissal  I will refer to the Walman Yawuru respondents  in respect to the dismissal motion  simply as the respondents   It is for the applicant to establish the grounds to warrant an order for dismissal under s  A  Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd   FCA       ALR    Nonetheless the respondents submit that two issues arise on the first motion which  if resolved against them  would justify an order for dismissal  I take this concession to mean that if the applicant satisfies me that the respondents have no reasonable prospects of successfully demonstrating that the two issues are serious issues to be tried then the first motion ought to be summarily dismissed  Both issues reflect the core submission of the respondents which is to the effect that the applicant has no authority to negotiate future acts  on behalf of the Yawuru Community which includes the Walman Yawuru clan  with the State  In this way the matters for judgment have been significantly confined   The first issue is as to whether the applicant is the  native title party  for the purpose of negotiating with the State in respect to future acts  It involves consideration of s   of the Act   Properly understood this issue does not involve any question of the construction of that statutory provision but rather  whether  on the facts  the provision presently has application   The requirement to negotiate in respect to future acts is provided for in Subdivision P of Div   of Part   of the Act   Notification must be given by a Government party  before the act is done  relevantly here  to the registered native title claimant  which is by definition also the native title party  ss  b  and    a  definition of  registered native title claimant  in s   citedCaboolture Park

Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   referred toJames on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  This drafting addressed a perceived hiatus in the Act whereby  once a native title determination had been made and taken effect over an area of land  the Registrar of the Federal Court would notify the Native Title Registrar pursuant to s  A b  of the Act and the Native Title Register would then be amended to remove the entry pursuant to s  d  of the Act if the application was finalised  Early determinations became effective immediately with respect to areas where native title had been extinguished  as well as areas where native title existed  but allowed a period of time for nomination of a prescribed body corporate  An example of this is to be found in the orders made in James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia   FCA    In such a case  there was an hiatus period between removal of the entry from the Register of Native Title Claims and thereby removal of the details of the registered native title claimant and the entry onto the National Native Title Register of the PBC  s  e  of the Act   In James   a period of   months was allowed for nomination of a PBC  Arguably  in this period there was no native title party  s   of the Act   to notify or to negotiate with for the purposes of Part   Division   of the Act    Since the orders of   April   were made in these proceedings  s   of the Act has been amended  by s   of the Native Title Amendment  Technical Amendments  Act    No   of   in the following terms     After paragraph  d  Insert       da  if an approved determination of native title is made to the effect that native title exists in relation to an area       i  but no determination has yet been made under section   or  ii  a determination has been made under section   that the native title rights and interests are to be held by the common law holders  but no determination has yet been made under subsection   of which prescribed body corporate is to perform the functions mentioned in subsection       amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it reflects that fact      The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment  Technical Amendments  Bill    the Explanatory Memorandum  at     and     relevantly states  Item   would insert paragraph  da   Proposed paragraph  da  would make clear that when a determination of native title has been made but no RNTBC has yet been determined  the Register of Native Title Claims should be amended to reflect that situation  The NNTT currently proceeds on the basis that the claim is not finalised until the RNTBC has been determined or registered  which ensures that the native title holders may still be notified of any proposed future acts pending registration  However  this approach gives rise to confusion where the determination establishes that native title has been extinguished over parts of the claim area  in so far as the National Native Title Register will not reflect this  and could suggest that the claimants continue to have procedural rights over those parts  citedRemington Products Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  This Court has power to

FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Walman Yawuru respondents were found to have a special attachment to part of the claim area known as the Mangalagun area  However  it was not such as to constitute or give rise to a native title right or interest as defined in ss   and   of the Act   It followed that no rights or interests claimed by the Walman Yawuru respondents were possessed by them as members of the Walman Yawuru clan  Rubibi Community v The State of Western Australia  No     FCA     and   referred toRubibi Community v The State of Western Australia  No     FCA

clan basis and that they did not have native title rights and interests in that capacity in the claim area  Rubibi Community v The State of Western Australia  No     FCA      Nonetheless  the Walman Yawuru respondents later contended that  as a result of this recognition of special attachment to specific areas in Rubibi  No   they were entitled  under s  c  of the Act to have that attachment recognised in the determination as an  other interest  in relation to the determination area  However  Merkel J held that the only  rights  or  interests  the Walman Yawuru clan members might have in relation to the Yawuru claim area were those held in any capacity they might have as members of the Yawuru Community and not  other interests  that were required to be set out in the determination
