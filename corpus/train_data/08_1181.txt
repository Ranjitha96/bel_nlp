Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  in the matter of James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd  Deregistered    FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   NSWSC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  In my view  the facts recounted above show that the Commissioner is a person aggrieved by the deregistration of JHAF and has standing to apply for reinstatement of its registration  The public responsibilities of the Commissioner can be compared with those of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  which was acknowledged to have standing to apply for a reinstatement under s  AH in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   NSWSC         ALR     JHAF reduced its capital and paid a dividend in late   and made a second reduction of its capital in    These three transactions  most significantly the first two in   involved a denuding of the company of its assets  The Commissioner wishes to have all three investigated by a liquidator with a view to the possible replenishment of JHAF s coffers to enable it to pay tax   JHAF was incorporated by registration on   September    One share in its capital was issued to its parent company upon incorporation and a further   shares were issued to its parent on   February    All   shares were of   each and were issued as having been fully paid in cash  The immediate parent company which held all of the shares was JHFBV  to which I referred at   above   In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   NSWSC         ALR     Austin J addressed the question  When should the Court be satisfied that it is just that the company s registration be reinstated   His Honour said  at   with reference to authorities  The wording of the section is very broad  and the cases confirm that it gives the Court a wide discretion  The Court takes into account the circumstances in which the company came to be dissolved  whether  if the order were made  good use could be made of it  and whether any person is likely to be prejudiced by the reinstatement   approvedJP Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section   of the Corporations Act provided that ASIC must deregister a company at the end of a period three months after the liquidator lodges with ASIC a return of the holding of the final meeting  Mr Green filed that return on   May    ASIC deregistered JHAF on   August    As noted earlier  upon deregistration JHAF ceased to exist  Clearly  Mr Green is no longer in office as its liquidator  It is therefore not quite appropriate to speak of his being  replaced   Although I reached this view before becoming aware of Stone J s decision in JP Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu   FCA         FCR     I note that it is totally in conformity with her Honour s   Section  AH  provides expressly that upon a reinstatement  a person who was a director immediately before the reinstatement  becomes a director again as from the time when ASIC or the Court reinstates the company   The existence of this provision suggests  first  that in the absence of such a provision persons in office at the time of deregistration are not automatically reinstated  and  second  that all that is at issue is whether a person should be appointed to an office as from the time of the reinstatement    Mr Green  who has been served  consents to such orders as the Court may make save as to costs  and does not wish to be heard on the application referred toPacanowski v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   It has been said that the expression  a person aggrieved by the deregistration  should not be narrowly construed  see Re Proserpine Pty Ltd and the Companies Act     NSWLR   at     Pacanowski v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   at    It does not matter that the person s interest in the decision to deregister arose after the deregistration  Proserpine at     referred toRe Proserpine Pty Ltd and the Companies Act     NSWLR   It has been said that the expression  a person aggrieved by the deregistration  should not be narrowly construed  see Re Proserpine Pty Ltd and the Companies Act     NSWLR   at     Pacanowski v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   at    It does not matter that the person s interest in the decision to deregister arose after the deregistration  Proserpine at     referred toRe Steelmaster Pty Ltd  in liq       ACSR   At   his Honour observed that the reported cases establish that the Court will not make an order which is futile  as where the reinstated company would be left without the funding necessary to permit the liquidator to do any work  His Honour noted that in Re Steelmaster Pty Ltd  in liq       ACSR   the Court made an order  albeit by consent  for the applicant for reinstatement to pay the costs and disbursements of the liquidator incurred as a result of the reinstatement  including the costs of any further proceedings under s   of the Corporations Law   The payments by way of return of capital and interim dividend of November   were made to JHFBV  a corporation that no longer exists  The second return of capital  that of September   was to JHIFBV  a company which  so far as the evidence shows  still exists  The second return of capital  however  was in a sum of only   a small fraction of the amount exceeding   which is expected to be the amount of the tax and shortfall penalties  see   above    The Commissioner refers to the fact that the two capital reductions divested JHAF of all of its assets  and that the second of them took place in contemplation of the winding up which was resolved upon the following day  He submits that these steps were taken in the knowledge of the Commissioner s interest in the transactions in which JHAF had previously participated  and that  t here is ample room to investigate the validity of those transactions
