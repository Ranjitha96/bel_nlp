Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The pecuniary penalties that are sought  and agreed  are for the most part well within what I would regard as the  permissible range   Cartel conduct can take many different forms  On the one hand  it may be so grave as to warrant massive pecuniary penalties on the scale of those recently imposed by Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA     Cartel behaviour of the kind with which Heerey J was concerned can  as his Honour noted  at   be extremely damaging to the prosperity of a free market economy  Often the profits to be made can be immense  and the risk of detection slight  That explains  in part  why the legislature has progressively increased the maximum penalties available in relation to this type of conduct   Heerey J went on to observe  at   that many countries with free market economies have enacted laws which make cartel conduct by individuals subject to criminal sanctions  including imprisonment  I note that in April   the Dawson Committee recommended the introduction of criminal sanctions for serious cartel behaviour  I also note that on   February   the Treasurer announced proposals for the criminalisation of serious cartel conduct  He stated that the maximum penalties for the new cartel offence would be a term of imprisonment of five years and a fine of   for individuals  and a fine for corporations that would be the greater of   million or three times the value of the benefit from the cartel  Where the value could not be determined the fine would be   of annual turnover   Although not all cartel conduct should be viewed as warranting the imposition of criminal sanctions  including imprisonment  plainly that option should be available in relation to serious cases of such conduct  See generally B Fisse   The Cartel Offence  Dishonesty      Australian Business Law Review   at    I interpolate that in the event such conduct is criminalised in Australia  problems may arise in formulating a cartel offence in terms that would be comprehensible to ordinary jurors  Section   is complex enough  The idea  which has been mooted  of simply adding the notion of  dishonesty  to what is already a daunting provision may be counterproductive  As Fisse notes  no country other than the United Kingdom  the Enterprise Act    UK  has made dishonesty an element of a cartel offence  and perhaps for good reason   It ought to be possible to define serious cartel conduct in relatively simply terms  Fisse  at   makes several useful suggestions as to how this might be done  Whatever else might be said  in appropriate cases imprisonment should be available as a sentencing option  Pecuniary penalties may be seen as simply part of the price of doing business discussedLowe v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Lowe v The Queen   HCA         CLR   Mason J  as his Honour then was  underlined the importance of the parity principle  His Honour said  at          Just as consistency in punishment    a reflection of the notion of equal justice    is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice  so inconsistency in punishment  because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law  is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice  It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community   In Postiglione v The Queen   HCA         CLR   the principle was further explained  Dawson and Gaudron JJ stated  at      The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice  Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that  if there are relevant differences  due allowance should be made for them  In the case of co offenders  different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances  If so  the notion of equal justice is not violated  On some occasions  different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error  Ordinarily  correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice  However  the parity principle  as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen   recognises that equal justice requires that  as between co offenders  there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to  a justifiable sense of grievance   If there is  the sentence in issue should be reduced  notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options        Footnotes omitted

Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at     the Full Court regarded the fact that legal advice had been obtained as being of little consequence and not as a discounting factor  In that case it was said merely to illustrate that the risk was appreciated   I would regard the principle formulated in Universal Music as being inapplicable to this case  Here it is not so much that legal advice was obtained that is relevant  Rather it is the fact that not one of a bevy of lawyers who were involved in structuring and documenting the arrangement considered for a moment that there might be a breach of s    It is that which lends support to the respondents  claim  accepted by the ACCC  that they did not act dishonestly and had no idea that they were contravening that section  In no sense did they  appreciate  the risk  and choose to run it   I am satisfied that all but two of the pecuniary penalties that are agreed are within the permissible range  and that they should be imposed  These penalties are appropriate because they may deter others from engaging in similar conduct  They are not insubstantial  totalling  for example  in the case of Mr North s clients     The two exceptions are the penalties agreed in relation to Ronda    and Mr Bramley     Try as I might  and despite the fact that neither of these respondents wished to make any further submissions after discovering what penalties had been agreed between the ACCC and the other respondents  I can see no reason why penalties as severe as these should be imposed upon these two respondents
