and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCA   and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Applicants S    HCA         CLR    These decisions were apparently not drawn to the Magistrate s attention   In NATB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at   a Full Court  Wilcox  Lindgren and Bennett JJ  said     s   of the Act gives power to the Minister  where the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so  to substitute for a decision of the RRT another decision more favourable to an applicant  whether or not the RRT had the power to make that other decision  This is a general humanitarian power  The power would be available to the Minister where  for example  a person had a well founded fear of loss of life or liberty  or of torture or other mistreatment  but for a reason which is not a Convention reason  Section   of the Act gives the Minister the same power in relation to decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal under Pt   of the Act      To the same effect is another Full Court s decision in M  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         ALR   at     See also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VFAY   FCAFC   at   the discretion may be exercised on  compassionate or humanitarian grounds    The Magistrate s decision  if correct  would apply to s   and would confine the Minister acting under that section to what might be called refugee related matters relevant to visa applicants within the jurisdiction of the Refugee Review Tribunal  As NATB and   show  that is not the case   In my view the Magistrate drew too much from the existence of the two sets of provisions  The authorities on s   to which I have referred would have provided better guidance  especially given that the Full Court in NATB described s   as conferring  the same power  on the Minister in relation to decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal as that conferred on her by s   in relation to decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal  namely a general humanitarian power   In my view the Tribunal did not take into account an irrelevant consideration when it relied on the respondent s failure to mention his Falun Gong practices in his request under s   by reason of the fact that it was not a matter that could be taken into account by the Minister   In what I have said thus far I have addressed the issue upon which the parties distinctly crossed swords  whether it was relevant to the Minister s consideration of the respondent s request under s   that he feared that if he were to return to China he would be harmed by reason of his practice of Falun Gong  In my view it was citedSAAK v Minister for

FCAFC         ALR   SAAK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCA   and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Applicants S    HCA         CLR    These decisions were apparently not drawn to the Magistrate s attention   In SAAK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No   one question was whether for the purposes of s   of the Act the exercise of the discretionary power in s   is a review of an application for a substantive visa  Mansfield J held it was not  His Honour said at      The power to substitute a decision for a decision of the Tribunal is qualified only by the limitations preserved in s   and by the respondent having the opinion that the grant of the visa is in the public interest  The power to substitute a more favourable decision is not one which readily fits into the concept of a review  The power may be exercised independently of the Tribunal s decision  and irrespective of the reasons for the Tribunal s decision  The respondent may exercise the power even where the Tribunal had no power to have made the more favourable decision  for example where the application to the Tribunal for review was made outside the period specified in s   of the Act   In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Applicants S  at     Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ said     when exercising the power under s   the Minister was not bound either by Subdiv AA  ss     or Subdiv AC  ss     of Div   of Pt   of the Act  or by the Regulations  That follows from the terms of s    Subdivision AC contains the central provision in s   obliging refusal to grant a visa if the Minister be not satisfied that the criteria prescribed by the Act or the Regulations for the relevant visa have been satisfied  Further  s   stipulates that the power under the section may only be exercised by the Minister personally  The identification of the Minister as the sole repository of the power indicates the legislative intention that the question of the substitution of a more favourable decision to disappointed applicants is to be answered by the taking of a broad approach      The point is emphasised by the express statement in s   that the power is to be exercised if the Minister  thinks that it is in the public interest to do so  and by the requirement in sub ss     and   respecting the laying before each House of the Parliament of a statement by the Minister where a decision more favourable to the applicant has been substituted  appliedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Applicants S    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The

Review Tribunal   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Applicants   v Refugee Review Tribunal   FCAFC   a Full Court  Moore  Nicholson and Conti JJ  refused to interfere with the decision of a single judge refusing to grant orders nisi for constitutional writs on the ground that there was no viable basis therefor  However at   Conti J  with whom the other Judges agreed  referred to s      Whilst cognisant of the confined scope of the issues arising on the appeal  I would nevertheless commend for reconsideration by the Minister  pursuant to s        the following factors concerning this evidently unfortunate family  which may conceivably be thought to render permissible their remaining in Australia upon some appropriate visa basis  They are factors which might warrant reconsideration upon grounds divorced from the issues that have arisen for resolution on the appeal  being factors to which reference has already been made in the course of the reasons for judgment    His Honour then listed the factors  which included injuries suffered by two of the applicants in a fire in Belgium before they came to Australia  their residence here for eleven years  the birth and schooling in Australia of a daughter of two of the applicants  and support provided to them by the wider Australian community  As his Honour said  these were factors that were extraneous to the refugee related matters with which the relevant Tribunals  decisions were concerned  As appears from   and   s   is in essentially the same form as s    The purpose and object of the two sections must be the same  to enable compassionate and humanitarian relief to be granted  In each case a broad approach is to be applied  The public interest referred to in each section is itself a broad concept  and there is no reason to confine the exercise of the power to ameliorate an applicant s position consequent on the denial of a visa by reference to matters relevant only to the granting or refusal of that visa    is an example of matters proper for the Minister to take into account under s   that were not relevant to the grant or refusal of a protection visa  The same approach should be available under s     The Magistrate s decision  if correct  would apply to s   and would confine the Minister acting under that section to what might be called refugee related matters relevant to visa applicants within the jurisdiction of the Refugee Review Tribunal  As NATB and   show  that is not the case appliedMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www
