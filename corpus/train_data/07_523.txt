question of invalidity and infringement citedHughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR     Although the discretion of the Court to award costs is a broad one  it must be exercised judicially and unless special circumstances are shown a successful litigant will receive costs  see Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR     per Toohey J  In the present case the question is whether there are special circumstances in relation to the Probiotec parties which displace that general rule distinguishedKnight v F P  Special Assets LTD   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Probiotec parties refer in support of their case on costs to the decision in Knight v F P  Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     where Mason CJ and Deane J considered the principles on which costs may be awarded against a non party to the litigation  Their Honours referred to the position where the non party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non party  or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting  has an interest in the subject of the litigation  The Probiotec parties say in the present case that they were not party to the cross claim alleging invalidity of the patent claim  that they were drawn into the litigation in which they played no active role  and that they should not be the subject of adverse costs order   I do not accept this submission  Clearly the Probiotec parties were a party to the litigation  The expression  litigation  in this case should be read as a reference

to the limited and conditional nature of the position taken by them in the undertaking and in not withdrawing the pleading as to invalidity  the approach of the Probiotec parties to the litigation was not one simply of a submitting party  The University parties therefore are entitled to their costs against the Probiotec parties  including costs on the question of invalidity and infringement appliedStumm v Dixon   Co     QBD   It is settled law that liability for payment of a costs order is ordinarily joint and several  In the present case it cannot be said that the Probiotec parties have raised a separate and distinct defence which has incurred costs that cannot be attributed to the joint conduct of the Cross Respondents in the course of this action  In Stumm v Dixon   Co     QBD   at     the Court of Appeal said     When an action is tried against two or more defendants  and any defendant separates in his defence  and the judgment is against all  the law is that each of them is liable for the damages awarded by the judgment  and each of them is liable to the plaintiff for all costs taxed on his behalf as properly incurred by him in the maintenance of his action  except as to costs caused to him by so much of the separate defence of any defendant as is     a defence for that defendant as distinguished from other defendants   The above principle set out in Stumm was referred to by Cooper J in Thiess Watkins White Constructions Limited  in liq  v Witan Nominees   Pty Ltd     Qd R   at     The final orders made in the case by way of restraint are against all Cross Respondents in relation to the relevant claims challenged  In order to make good its case on the pleadings  it was necessary for the University parties to prove the involvement of the Probiotec parties  and I note no director of any of the Probiotec parties gave evidence about the relationship between those parties and the NSI parties until after the   March   hearing on costs  It was also necessary to counter the allegation of invalidity and appropriate to obtain a Court order  especially having regard to the fact that the undertaking as to conduct was given without admission  After the hearing on costs on   March   I gave liberty to the University parties to make further written submissions  and gave leave for the Probiotec parties to file an affidavit of Mr Stringer  the Chief Executive Officer of Probiotec  Australia  Pty Ltd  That affidavit was filed the next day  on   March    In it  Mr Stringer gives a detailed history and states that he was the person responsible for the Probiotec parties  instructions to solicitors in respect of the current proceedings  He states that he has never given instructions to Messrs Spruson   Ferguson that the Probiotec parties wished to dispute the validity of the University s patents or to assist the First to Fifth Cross Respondents in their contest of the validity of the University parties  patents  His instructions are reflected in the Letter of Undertaking from Spruson   Ferguson to Freehills dated   September    In view of the conclusion which I have reached above and the reasons for that conclusion  the contents of Mr Stringer s affidavit do not persuade me that the Probiotec parties should not be jointly and severally liable for costs in this matter  Consequently  although the University parties have not  since the hearing of   March   made written submissions in reply to either the content of Mr Stringer s affidavit or the written submissions handed up by the Probiotec parties in court on that date  in any event  in view of my conclusion  any further submissions on behalf of the University parties would not affect the outcome of my decision on costs in this matter  as the orders which I have made are in favour of the University parties  In those circumstances  there is no necessity for any further submissions on behalf of the University parties in relation to the costs question citedThiess
