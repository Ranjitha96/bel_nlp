Taxation v Stone   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This proceeding was heard on the same day and immediately before Spriggs v Federal Commissioner of Taxation  VID   of    To avoid unnecessary repetition in these reasons for decision  I incorporate and adopt in these reasons paras   to   of the reasons for decision in Spriggs  Those paragraphs set out the relevant legislation  the relevant principles and some general considerations concerning sport and professional sport examined by the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Stone   HCA         CLR   at   to     Riddell played rugby league as a child  When he was approximately   or   years of age  he was first represented by a player agent  That relationship ended towards the end of   when Riddell was approached by Darryl Mather  Mather  of International Sports Management Pty Ltd  ISM    On   May   Riddell entered into a management agreement with ISM  the ISM Agreement   It provided         RECITALS        Riddell  competes professionally in the sport of  sic        Riddell  desires to engage  ISM  to manage his affairs as hereinafter set out     The Parties Agree as follows        ISM  agrees to provide the following services to  Riddell    a  Advise  Riddell  in respect of his sporting career     b  Negotiate playing contracts on behalf of  Riddell             c  Negotiate product endorsements and sponsorship so far as is reasonably possible     d  Access and arrange legal  financial  superannuation  taxation  insurance and other appropriate advices and services at the request and cost of  Riddell                            ISM  will keep  Riddell  informed in relation to any dealings or negotiations undertaken on  Riddell s  behalf                         The term of this Agreement shall be for five   years and shall continue thereafter until terminated in writing by either party  provided that no less than three months notice shall be given                         ISM shall be entitled to charge  Riddell  fees in respect of its services as follows            a  Twenty per cent   of all gross monies or other considerations paid to  Riddell  for sponsorship  media contracts  endorsement for goods and services  advertising or any form of promotional work and any subsequent income earned from the above monies  The said payments shall continue for a period of three years after termination of the contract in respect of any of the arrangements set out above which commence during the period of the agency                  b  In respect of sporting events in which  Riddell  participates               i  Eight per cent   of all contract monies paid to  Riddell  including bonuses  incentives negotiated by  ISM        ii  Match payments shall not be included for the purpose of this clause      c  The amount payable to  ISM  shall be paid within   days of receipt of monies by  Riddell                           Outside Australia   ISM  may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any company with which it is affiliated  including ProServ USA  ProServ UK  ProServ Europe  ProServ Italy and ProServ Japan        During the first twenty four   months of the Period of Service  ISM  agrees to provide  Riddell  with a scholarship period  During this time   ISM  agrees to waiver  sic  any remuneration which would otherwise be due and payable during this portion of the Period of Service as outlined in Clause  b   This is in no way prejudices the remuneration which may become subsequently due and payable during the remainder of the Period of Service   As with Spriggs   the Commissioner did not contend that it was not possible for a professional sportsperson to be carrying on a business of exploiting his or her sporting talent  It is worth restating what the High Court said in Stone  at        The conclusion that the taxpayer was engaged in a business during the     year proceeds from an acceptance of the proposition that  showing that both before and during that year  the taxpayer was paid to endorse a company or its products as an athlete demonstrated that she has turned her athletic talent to account for money   Riddell s position is not distinguishable  In the   income year  Riddell was carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing his assessable income  He turned his rugby league talent to account for money both before and during the   income year  see     above  For the reasons outlined above  the management fee was incurred by Riddell in carrying on that business   The Commissioner contended that because  business    includes any profession  trade  employment  vocation or calling  but does not include occupation as an employee   s     of the   Act   an outgoing incurred in the course of employment  or to obtain an employment  is not an outgoing incurred  in carrying on a business   Accordingly  the Commissioner contended that the management fee was not deductible because      Riddell was an employee of Parramatta  and        the management fee was incurred in the course of his employment with Parramatta or to obtain employment with Parramatta citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v

distinguishedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena     ALJR   As I said in Spriggs  argument by analogy must never be allowed to obscure the particularity of the arrangements in question  The Commissioner s reliance upon Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena     ALJR   does just that  Maddalena concerned an era of professional sportsmen and women which bears little or no resemblance to professional sport in the twenty first century  One only has to point to the absence of the electronic media  let alone the internet  in the  s to make good that proposition  Secondly  as with Spriggs  the factual matrix in Maddalena is very different to the factual matrix of Riddell   Riddell was and remains a full time professional rugby league player  Maddalena was not  Riddell seeks to claim the management fee as a deduction  That fee was incurred after the playing contract was signed  not before  and could not be charged if no playing contract was negotiated  Maddalena sought to claim travelling expenses and legal expenses  expenses which were incurred before the playing contract and which were incurred regardless of whether or not a playing contract was secured  The management fee incurred by Riddell did not  come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income    In relation to the  negative limb  of s     of the   Act   the Commissioner submitted that even if the management fee was an outgoing incurred by Riddell in gaining or producing assessable income  it was on capital  not revenue  account and therefore not deductible under s     of the   Act   This argument also fails citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Raymor  NSW  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  An
