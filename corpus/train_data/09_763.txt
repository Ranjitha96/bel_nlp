Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlBut doubt as to whether this Court s jurisdiction has been properly invoked need not presently be resolved because the power to transfer a proceeding exists even where a question arises as to jurisdiction  cf Assad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    Tamberlin J there concluded      I note that during argument as to whether the Court ought to transfer the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court  a question arose as to whether this Court has power to remit a  proceeding  to the Federal Magistrates Court where this Court does not have jurisdiction due to the absence of a federal  matter   In my view  the expression  proceeding  in s  AB of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  is distinct from the expression  matter   as used in s  B  of the Judiciary Act    Cth  and is sufficiently wide to encompass the present dispute between the parties  I therefore consider that the Court has power to  and should  transfer the proceeding notwithstanding any doubt which may exist as to its jurisdiction to hear and determine the application  Having considered the factors set forth in s  AB  O   r   and the submissions made both in writing and orally  it is considered that the present proceeding should be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court  What further orders or directions as that Court may hereafter make is a matter for that Court to determine  No submission was advanced that a referral of a proceeding pursuant to s  AB to the Federal Magistrates Court can in any way constrain the manner in which that Court thereafter itself deals with the proceeding citedBeetham v Cortra Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe power conferred by s  AB has been

AB  Nadu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Hong Bo Su v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   citedCommercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard   NSWCA       NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlFor present purposes it may be accepted that each of these issues may well be raised during the course of the proceeding  None of the   complicated points   however  are such that they cannot be resolved by a Federal Magistrate  As was properly recognised by Counsel for the Applicant  assistance has been provided by other courts as to the manner in which at least some of the statutory provisions in question are to be applied  e g  Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard   NSWCA       NSWLR    But there remain difficult issues of statutory construction which are yet to be resolved   or so it was contended by the Applicant  There was said to be   contrary views   expressed by different superior courts  But the Federal Magistrates Court  it should be recognised  routinely confronts and has to interpret a myriad of complex statutory provisions and routinely has to resolve difficult questions of evidence and law  That quite frequently is the nature of the jurisdiction entrusted to that Court  Not surprisingly  Counsel for the Applicant did not refer in his outline of written submissions to the Defence pleading such further facts as  the non disclosure of convictions for offences other than for   not wearing a seatbelt   the non disclosure of convictions for driving with more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol  and the driving of the vehicle the subject of the claim by a driver   under the influence of intoxicating liquor     It is envisaged by the insurer at least that it will be necessary to issue subpoenas and to obtain discovery  The insurer further contends that a significant aspect of its case will be the question as to whether liability can be denied simply upon the basis that the driver of the vehicle was intoxicated at the time of the accident  The insurer envisages that relevant to that part of its case there will be the need to call evidence from police officers  ambulance officers and possibly evidence from those in the emergency department of the hospital to which the driver was taken after the accident  If this be the manner in which the claim is ultimately resolved  the only   complicated point   that may have to be resolved may be confined to s   of the New South Wales Act  Even though it may be accepted that points of general importance may emerge from the most mundane or apparently simple of cases  it is considered that the present proceeding remains a claim made upon an insurance policy in respect to a motor vehicle accident  Even if the jurisdiction of this Court has been properly invoked  such claims only invite inquiry as to whether they should be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court  The potential importance to the present parties of such provisions as ss       and   of the Insurance Contracts Act    Cth  may also be accepted  The application of such provisions  however  will in all likelihood largely depend upon the facts and circumstances to which they are to be applied  As was recognised by both the Applicant and the Respondent  and depending upon how the facts are ultimately to be resolved  one or other of the   complicated points   may not finally emerge for resolution  And such importance as may emerge from the application of those statutory provisions as may extend beyond the interests of the present parties  if any  it is considered  is no reason why it is not appropriate to transfer the proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court citedGarage Wholesalers Pty

 AB b   It is thus a power which may be exercised even though an applicant may oppose such an order being made  e g  Rahman v Dayeh   FCA    But where the parties consent to the making of such an order  Jacobson J has observed that such consent is   decisive   Rixon v Business Parcel Express Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Notwithstanding the fact that the Applicant does not wish for the proceeding to be transferred  it is considered that the case essentially involves a motor vehicle accident claim upon an insurance policy  That claim can be expeditiously resolved in the Federal Magistrates Court  As was stated by Gyles J in Rahman v Dayeh at         It has been put that the Federal Magistrates Court is an inferior court and that  even if it has jurisdiction  it is best exercised by the Federal Court as a superior court  Federal Magistrates are Federal judicial officers governed by Ch III of the Constitution although  in a sense  judges of an inferior court  Both the qualifications for appointment and the characteristics of those individuals who have been appointed  fit them to undertake jurisdiction which might not previously have been thought appropriate  Even though I must pay regard to the opposition of the applicant  in one sense the applicant may be gaining another level of appeal to this Court     Although it is not certain whether the proceeding will be heard at an earlier point of time in the Federal Magistrates Court than in this Court  there is no reason why it could not be heard as expeditiously as that Court considers appropriate  Such legal costs as will be incurred  it is to be expected  will be less   or at least no more   than those that would be incurred in this Court  The Respondent insurer this morning adopted a   neutral stance   as to whether the proceeding should be transferred  Notwithstanding the careful written submissions advanced by Counsel for the Applicant  it is not considered that the proceeding involves any point of general importance  let alone a point which should be resolved by a single judge of this Court   at least initially  If attention is confined to the Application and the Statement of Claim  the only two   federal aspects   of the claim there advanced are  the claim for interest pursuant to s   of the   Act  and the Particulars provided as to a possible implied term of the policy   Neither of those matters  nor any other aspect of the Statement of Claim   is considered to raise any point of general importance  Indeed  it is not understood that Counsel for the Applicant sought to contend otherwise  Whether or not any term is to be implied may possibly depend upon a resolution of disputed facts which  it is considered  are best resolved before a Federal Magistrate citedRixon v Business
