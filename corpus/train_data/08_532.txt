House of Lords  see Government of Canada v Aronson     AC   at    per Lord Lowry  and British Amusement Catering Trades Association v Westminster City Council   AC   at   see also Elazac Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         FCR   at   citedHanlon v The Law Society   AC   The principles that govern the use of regulations in construing the statute under which they are made were stated by Lord Lowry in Hanlon v The Law Society   AC   at     as follows    Subordinate legislation may be used in order to construe the parent Act  but only where power is given to amend the Act by regulations or where the meaning of the Act is ambiguous    Regulations made under the Act provide a Parliamentary or administrative contemporanea expositio of the Act but do not decide or control its meaning  to allow this would be to substitute the rule making authority for the judges as interpreter and would disregard the possibility that the regulation relied on was misconceived or ultra vires    Regulations which are consistent with a certain interpretation of the Act tend to confirm that interpretation    Where the Act provides a framework built on by contemporaneously prepared regulations  the latter may be a reliable guide to the meaning of the former    The regulations are a clear guide  and may be decisive  when they are made in pursuance of a power to modify the Act  particularly if they come into operation on the same day as the Act which they modify    Clear guidance may also be obtained from regulations which are to have effect as if enacted in the parent Act   Number   is applicable to the present case distinguishedMorton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondents relied on Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited   HCA         CLR    In that case the High Court held  at   that reg   of the Excise Regulations    Cth  were ultra vires the Excise Act    Cth  and void because regulations cannot   vary or depart from the positive provisions made by the Act or    go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself   The regulation in question was invalid because it imposed  a distinct and independent addition of liability to the liabilities which the legislature has provided   at     In the present case the respondents eschewed any argument that reg     was ultra vires and therefore void   The present case is not like Morton where the statute covered the field and left no room for regulations  On the contrary  the scheme of both Old Act and New Act is to leave to the regulations questions of who may enforce distinguishedRodway v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondents  alternative argument is that reg     only operates prospectively  They say that at the time the alleged contraventions took place they had a  right  not to be vexed by litigation by anyone other than a party to an AWA  Citing Rodway v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at   they contended that they had a  right to be free of a claim   They rely also on s   of the Legislative Instruments Act    The expression quoted from Rodway appears in a context where their Honours are discussing limitation statutes and whether they should be given a retrospective operation to revive a cause of action which has become barred  or deprive a person of the opportunity of instituting an action which is within time  In such cases  giving the legislation a retrospective operation   would operate so as to impair existing  substantive rights either the right to be free of a claim or the right to bring a claim and such an operation could not be said to be merely procedural   Emphasis added   The actual decision in Rodway does not assist the respondents indeed to the contrary  Until its repeal on   November   s   of the Criminal Code  Tas  required corroboration for conviction of certain offences  Before the date of repeal the appellant was charged with such an offence  He was committed for trial in   and his trial commenced in    The High Court  Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ  unanimously held that the Code in its post amendment form applied  Their Honours said at       ordinarily an amendment to the practice or procedure of a court  including the admissibility of evidence and the effect to be given to evidence  will not operate retrospectively so as to impair any existing right  It may govern the way in which the right is to be enforced or vindicated  but that does not bring it within the presumption against retrospectivity  A person who commits a crime does not have a right to be tried in any particular way  merely a right to be tried according to the practice and procedure prevailing at the time of trial   In the present case the respondents in September December   either did or did not apply duress in relation to AWAs  If they did  they incurred a substantive obligation  the liability to such penalty as might be fixed by a court  They did not acquire any substantive right to have that obligation ascertained in some particular way  or only at the suit of some particular person or class of persons  any more than they acquired the right to be tried only by the law of evidence as it stood in December     For the same reason  the respondents acquired no  rights  in terms of the Legislative Instruments Act    In any event  the presumption against retrospectivity is no more than that  a presumption which must yield to a clear expression of intent to the contrary  An issue of retrospectivity raises the question whether a law which on its face applies equally to past and future events must be read down as to apply only to the latter  In its terms reg     is solely concerned with involvement in proceedings for alleged contraventions under the Old Act  Such contraventions can only have happened before reg     came into operation  The whole purpose of reg     is to deal with past events citedThorn EMI Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   In Thorn EMI Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   Beaumont J  in the context of the sales tax legislative scheme  said  It may be accepted  as a general proposition  that  the intention of Parliament in enacting an Act is not to be ascertained by reference to the terms in which a delegated power to legislate has been exercised   per Brennan J in Webster v McIntosh     FLR   at     On the other hand  as Mason J observed in the course of argument in Brayson Motors Pty Ltd  In Liq  v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       One looks at regulations  not to construe an overall scheme or to throw light on ambiguity in a statutory provision  but to ascertain what the scheme is      In the present context  it has been settled since the decision in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation  SA  v Ellis   Clark Ltd   HCA         CLR     that the Sales Tax Regulations are an essential part of the legislative scheme  see  especially  per Dixon J at    This approach was affirmed recently in Brayson Motors  supra  at   and it is unnecessary to pursue the questions which could arise in other contexts  cf Neill v Glacier Metal Co Ltd     QB   at   Jackson v Hall   AC   at     Bennion  opcit  at p    In my opinion  reference to the Sales Tax Regulations  including reg  A  is not merely permissible  it is essential to an understanding of the legislative plan
