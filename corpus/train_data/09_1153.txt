Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd  No       FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Securities   Investments Commission v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd   WASC  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  htmlFor the purposes of this proceeding  I will also assume that the investments in the Promissory Notes were subject to the requirements of managed investment schemes under the Corporations Law  There was considerable debate before me as to this question  In light of the view I have come to on other issues  it is unnecessary for me to come to a final view on this question  My own tentative view is that the correct contention is that the issue of the Promissory Notes did not form part of a managed investment scheme  The arguments not accepted by Simmonds J in Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd   WASC   seem to have considerable force  It seems to me that all that is involved here is the issue of promissory notes by a corporation with particular credit worthy characteristics and with a particular financing structure  which included the provision of certain securities for the lending of monies to investors  Each investor was offered and accepted a promissory note  All that was offered and acquired was the entitlement to payment of interest and repayment of capital in accordance with the promissory note  and no more or less  This is not the acquiring of rights to benefits produced by any  scheme   As I have said  I do not find it necessary to go further into this matter it would involve an analysis of the decision in Emu Brewery Mezzanine WASC   and possibly  the decisions of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   and Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA         FCR     and the question of the extent to which I should follow those decisions even if I

to analyse the conduct and statements of PIR as a whole  taking into account disclaimers and other circumstances showing the true character of the conduct and statements themselves  see eg Campbell

of the TPA  see eg Petera Pty Ltd v EAJ Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    However  in this case there is not just the disclaimer  Contrary to the contention of Wealthcare  I do not regard the position as analogist to the attempted reliance upon the disclaimer in John G Glass Real Estate Pty Ltd v Karawi Constructions Pty Ltd   ATPR      The context of all the statements in the PIR report referred to

PIR as a whole  taking into account disclaimers and other circumstances showing the true character of the conduct and statements themselves  see eg Campbell   HCA   at   and Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    In coming to the view that Mr Roberts did not rely upon the alleged misrepresentations I am mindful of the comments made by the High Court in Campbell   HCA   at     The essential question is one of causation  It may be artificial to talk in terms of reliance in determining what would have occurred if the true position were known  Nevertheless causation and reliance are related concepts  see eg Heydon   Trade Practices Law   vol   at      In this proceeding  I have come to the conclusion that there was no causal connection between the alleged misrepresentations and the actions of Wealthcare  because there was no reliance in fact upon the alleged misrepresentations citedDigi Tech  Aust  Ltd v Brand   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlThere may be an issue as to the whether there is an inconsistency between the cases relied upon by Wealthcare and Digi Tech  Aust  Ltd v Brand   NSWCA   at         but this does not need further consideration  As Wealthcare did not rely on the alleged representations in the PIR report  no  indirect causation  can arise  Put another way  it cannot be said that Wealthcare s reliance on the PIR reports was  a cause  of Dartberg s investing because there was no reliance at all by Wealthcare to find any  indirect causation   For the above reasons  the Court will order  The cross claim be dismissed  The parties confer as to the appropriate order to make as to costs  and if no agreement can be reached  file and serve within   days any submissions as to costs   I certify
