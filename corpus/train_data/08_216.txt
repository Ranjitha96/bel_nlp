the Tribunal  And   actual notification   requires delivery by hand  Minister for Immigration   Citizenship v SZKKC   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       FCR    See also SZKET v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     The Applicant had been in attendance when the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was handed down and received such notification  A   Checklist   completed apparently by Tribunal staff records the following  At the Handing Down     Did the applicant attend the handing down  No Has the decision  etc been given to the applicant  No   The Application as filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on   September   also contains an acknowledgment by the Applicant that   the decision was received   on   January    There had thus been compliance with the requirement imposed by s   cf Minister for Immigration   Citizenship v SZKKC   FCAFC   at      The Federal Magistrates Court in its   November   decision concluded that proceedings had not been commenced within the time prescribed from the date of actual notification  That Court s reasons were  using the language of that Court  as follows      The solicitors for the respondent Minister submit that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the application       I am aware of the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration   Citizenship v SZKKC   FCAFC    In that decision Giles J agreeing with Buchanan J said   That an actual notification to an applicant of a decision requires physical delivery of a written statement of the decision prepared by the Refugee Review Tribunal to the applicant    His Honour went on to say   That notification must take place within   days of the decision being handed down and referred to subs  B a  and s  B        In this case that is exactly what happened  I refer to an affidavit of Angela Margaret Nanson which was filed in Court on   th October   to which is annexed a letter from the Tribunal to the applicant s then advisers advising that the decision would be handed down on   th January    There is also annexed the Tribunal s check list for handing down the decision on   th January         The document makes it clear that the applicant attended the handing down on that day and a copy of the decision was given to the applicant  In the circumstances there has been compliance in the requirement of the legislation for physical delivery to the applicant of the written statement of the decision prepared by the Tribunal within   days of it being handed down and indeed on the day it was handed down  And such the time limit in s   of Migration Act does apply       The applicant did not commence proceedings until   th September   which is well outside the time  Accordingly the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the application  The applicant told the Court that the reason for the delay was that he had made an application to the Minister  presumably under s   of the Migration Act   That may well be  but it does not affect the operation of s        Concurrence is expressed with these reasons as to the operation of s     It was not until   December   that the Applicant commenced proceedings in this Court seeking leave to appeal from the   November   decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  That application also sought   inter alia   an order   that compliance with Order   subrule   be dispensed with    Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules    Cth  applies where an appeal only lies to this Court with leave and prescribes a period of   days as the period within which such applications are to be made  Relevantly  leave is required from an interlocutory decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  s  A    Order   r   it should be noted  provides as follows     An application shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing     a  the nature of the case     b  the questions involved  and    c  the reasons why leave should be given      The Affidavit as filed in this Court on behalf of the Applicant annexes a statement addressing the grant of work visas    but that is irrelevant to the Application now before this Court  The Affidavit further annexes a statement setting forth the orders sought  The Affidavit clearly does not satisfy the requirements of O   r   consideredNguyen v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the application is  it is considered  an interlocutory decision for the purposes of appeal rights  SZDGN v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per Lindgren J  Md Abdullah Al Mamun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    Accordingly  leave to appeal is required  The Applicant by the form of his Application acknowledges as much  He also acknowledges that an extension of time is also required  cf Nguyen v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCAFC   at      No prejudice is now relied upon by the Respondent Minister by reason of the failure to commence proceedings within   days  The Respondent Minister  however  is critical of the Affidavit as filed  That criticism is soundly based  The fact that an applicant for leave to appeal may be unrepresented is not in itself a licence to disregard those Rules of Court with which all other litigants must comply  The importance of the decision under review    especially when protection visas are sought    cannot be ignored  Difficulties confronting unrepresented litigants  especially in migration appeals  are very real  But applicants do not advance such prospects of success as they may have by failing  as in the present case  to set forth any explanation at all as to why it is contended that the decision of the Federal Magistrate may be erroneous and why they have not commenced proceedings within time  As has been recognised    casual disregard of the requirements of the Rules is inappropriate   Nguyen v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCAFC   at      The failure of the present Applicant to comply with the time limit imposed by s   of the Migration Act when commencing proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court  and his failure to comply with the time limits imposed by this Court s Rules for the commencement of appeals  only supports an inference that no real attention has been given at any point to time limits which are imposed   Subsequent to the filing of the Application for Leave to Appeal on   December   a letter dated   February   was received by the Registry of this Court enclosing   inter alia     a statement from the Pakistan Peoples Party      two Affidavits dated   January   deposing to an attempt to kill the Applicant    a copy of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal signed on   December   and    correspondence forwarded to the Minister     Objection was taken by the Respondent Minister to this further material being considered  even for the purposes of either an application for leave or for the purposes of an application for an extension of time  No objection  however  was taken to the further material being considered and a ruling on its admissibility being deferred  That was the course pursued  The further material has  accordingly  been considered  That material does not satisfy the requirements of O   r   or r  c  nor does it provide any information of relevance to the present Application   The objection to this further material  it is considered  should be upheld and its tender rejected followedSZDGN v Minister for
