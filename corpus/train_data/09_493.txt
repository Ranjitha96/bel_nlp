austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAccordingly  Lanepoint submits that there is a genuine dispute as to the amount of its indebtedness to WIF  In an appropriate case the Court may exercise its discretion to determine such a dispute rather than to stay the winding up application to await the curial resolution of the dispute  Ocean City Ltd v Southern Oceanic Hotels Pty Ltd   FCA         ACSR   at      A great deal of evidence was adduced in this respect including detailed cross examination of  amongst others  Mr Carey  Ms Karen Carey and Mr Gregory Nairn  a former senior Lanepoint executive  No suggestion was made that there was other relevant evidence available going to the resolution of this question  If such an alleged dispute is raised and can be resolved during such an application then in my opinion it ought to be  It would only add to the costs of the parties as well as to the public to put it off  Lanepoint submits that the affidavit of ASIC s expert  Mr Honey  sworn on   October   confirms the following     i  The work in progress on the Regency Motel redevelopment was  as at   January   about   million  That work in progress is also estimated by Ernst   Young at   according to the affidavit of Mr Fraser  one of Lanepoint s receivers  sworn on   March   based on information provided but that the Receiver and Managers were not able to determine the final quantum of renovation costs        ii  In relation to liabilities as at   January   the Suncorp Metway loan stood at   and WIF at         iii  There were intercompany loans to Westpoint  Keypoint and Keyworld at   but there were other sources of finance of some  citedPowell v Fryer     ACLC  The commercial solvency of a company is not proved by merely looking at its accounts and making a mechanical comparison of its assets and liabilities  Insolvency is a question of fact falling to be decided as a matter of commercial reality in light of all the circumstances with things being viewed as it would be by someone operating in a practical business environment  Powell v Fryer     ACLC   at    The background is uncontroversial and the following is taken substantially from ASIC s closing submissions  Lanepoint redeveloped the Regency Motel site on Great Eastern Highway  Rivervale in Western Australia  This was financed  in part  by secured funds obtained from Suncorp Metway Limited and Westpoint Management Pty Ltd as responsible entity for the Westpoint Income Fund  WIF   Westpoint Management was a related or associated company within the Westpoint Group and WIF was a managed investment scheme  which raised funds from the public for use in relation to Westpoint Group projects  The first stage of the Regency Motel redevelopment was undertaken for Lanepoint by Westpoint Constructions Pty Ltd  As a result of the redevelopment   strata title lots were almost completed for sale and one lot was left vacant for the second stage  Adjacent to the redeveloped property are three lots  which were proposed for the third stage
