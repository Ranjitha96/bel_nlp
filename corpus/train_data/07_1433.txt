Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Ross Investments  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedGregory v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The defendants submit that  if a measure of value is the amount that a person is willing to pay for something  then the offer documents themselves are key components in assessing the value of the Cambridge debentures   I do not accept that the amount one offeror is willing to pay for a debenture is  by itself  a proper measure of the value of that debenture  Rather  the value of a debenture would be its exchange value or the price that it would bring when exposed to competition   I put to one side the situation  that sometimes arises  where it is necessary to value an item that is not marketable   The cases say that value is to be determined by reference to the amount that an hypothetical ordinary purchaser who is willing but not anxious to buy would be prepared to pay for the debenture  and an hypothetical ordinary seller who is also willing but not anxious to sell would be prepared to accept for it  assuming both parties were fully informed and had regard to all the circumstances which might affect value  see Spencer v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     and     Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd   HCA
