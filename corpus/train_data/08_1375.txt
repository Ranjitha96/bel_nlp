Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation  No     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSutherland Publishing Company v Caxton Publishing Company Limited   All ER   Subject to s  C    the Copyright Act contemplates that the Court may grant damages in respect of copyright infringement and in respect of conversion  In Sutherland Publishing Company Limited v Caxton Publishing Company Limited   All ER     the English Court of Appeal decided that the remedies given by ss    for breach of copyright  and    for conversion  of the English Copyright Act    were cumulative  not alternative remedies  Lord Wright  MR  explained  at     that  Both are claims for a wrong  each wrong being different from the other  The former is for a wrong done to an incorporeal right  copyright  the latter is for conversion of particular chattels  the infringing copies  The measure of damages is different  In the latter case the measure is the value of the copies  which by force of the statute are deemed to be the property of the plaintiff  from the mere fact of being brought into existence  whereas in the other case  the measure of damage is the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright  as a chose in action  It was strenuously contended that where the infringement consisted in the multiplication and sale of copies of a work  the damages under the two sections would overlap and the injustice of giving double compensation would be committed  It may be true that in some cases there may be an overlapping of the damages under the two sections  but  as I have already explained  there are two separate and diverse causes of action  each of which must receive appropriate consideration when it comes to the question of damages      It must be left to the good sense of the tribunal which assesses the damages to avoid giving excessive damages   Subsection  C  addresses the considerations raised in this second paragraph

there would be a need to consider other bases for calculating conversion damages   In the circumstances  it suffices to say  at this stage  that  subject to the opinion of the Court under s  C  the applicants are entitled to an assessment of conversion damages under s  A  as well as infringement damages under s     Subsection  D  provides that  in deciding whether to grant relief in an action for conversion and in assessing the amount of damages payable  the court may have regard to the following         a  the expenses incurred by the defendant  being a person who marketed or otherwise dealt with the infringing copy  in manufacturing or acquiring the infringing copy   b  whether the expenses were incurred before or after the infringing copy was sold or otherwise disposed of by the

general rule under Order   rule   may be departed from where the party in whose favour the costs order was made was required by the interlocutory proceeding to  incur significant costs over and above those which it would have incurred had the opposing party acted with competence and diligence  Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co  New Zealand  Ltd   FCA     where the proceeding is

Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd  No     FCA    In McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd   FCA     Weinberg J adopted the observation of Lindgren J in Allstate that          the power to order that costs be paid forthwith should perhaps be used less sparingly than it has in the past  This is particularly so in lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill considered pleadings being drawn  Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait  possibly for years  for that to occur     In Barrett   Gilmour J referred to a number of cases in which the unsuccessful respondents in intellectual property cases were ordered to pay costs forthwith  see Barrett at      As his Honour noted  however  each case depends very much on its own circumstances   Having regard to the nature of the case  including the claims and diverse cross claims that it involved  the evidence adduced by the parties  and the length of the trial  it may safely be assumed that the applicants have already incurred substantial costs  These costs are independent of the quantum of damages  which has yet to be established  The disposition of the quantum case may be some way off  Moreover  the applicants submit that  t he claim for damages may be rendered nugatory by the fact that the second respondent is once again bankrupt and by the first respondent s uncertain financial position   The respondents have not disputed this proposition  In the circumstances  it is appropriate that there be an order that the costs of the proceeding to date of the applicants cross  respondents be paid forthwith   The applicants also seek liberty to apply for an order that the costs in their favour be fixed in a gross sum in accordance with O   r  c  of the Rules  They note  and the respondents do not dispute  the second respondent s current status as an undischarged bankrupt  They also note  and the respondents do not dispute  that the first respondent is a foreign corporation registered to conduct business in Australia without obvious assets in Australia  As already observed  the costs involved are likely to be substantial  Having regard to the course of the proceeding to date  it may reasonably be assumed that taxation will be drawn out and expensive  The applicants may well be obliged to meet the entire financial burden  In these circumstances  the applicants have liberty to apply for an order that the costs in their favour be fixed in a gross sum in accordance with the Rules citedXat Ky v Australvic Property
