foreshadowed application pursuant to s   of the Act   Accordingly  I respectfully agree  with the view expressed by Master Sanderson in Caveat Pty Ltd v Baillie   Ors   WASC   at         This approach was adopted by Commissioner Siopis SC  as he then was  in Chuen v Laredo Pty Ltd   Ors   WASC   at      The respondent s counsel placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of Chuen v Laredo Pty Ltd   WASC    His submission was that there was a striking resemblance between the facts of that case and the present in that it involved a disgruntled shareholder seeking to induce a better offer for his shares   by a threat that should such an offer not be received then an application for inspection of the company s books would be made under s  A of the Act   it involved management fees being paid by the respondent company to a related company  the level of directors  fees were in question  a loan had been written off  there was a level of hostility between the applicant and one of the directors of the respondent company  questions were raised concerning the financial statements of the respondent   In that case the applicant in   brought an application relevantly under s  A of the Act in which he raised various questions concerning the accounts of the three respondent companies for the years   to    The facts in that case were complex and the result turned upon particular findings made by Commissioner Siopis SC as his Honour then was  Included in those findings were that the applicant failed to depose specifically as to the nature of the potential action against the respondents under s   of the Act   that the applicant failed to advise the accountant who swore an affidavit on his behalf in support of his application as to the full extent of his knowledge of matters which he was seeking to investigate and indeed was content for an affidavit to be sworn by the accountant deposing to the need to investigate a matter as to which the applicant was already familiar  that the applicant failed to complain about the particular transactions which he was by his application seeking to investigate at the time of the transactions in question or within a reasonable time thereafter  several of the matters which the applicant sought to investigate occurred as much as seven years prior to the application  that at the time those transactions occurred the applicant was a director of the respondent  that many of the transactions were so old as likely to be statute barred in respect of any proposed proceedings in relation to them  that a considerable delay was involved in that a majority of matters in respect of which the applicant by its application sought inspection had been the subject of enquiries made by the applicant almost five years prior to the application with no explanation as to the reasons for delay  that the intention of the applicant in threatening to bring his application was to induce an acceptance of his offer to sell his shares by linking the threat of continuing his agitation to obtain inspection of the respondents  documents to his offer to sell his shares   For these reasons amongst others Commissioner Siopis SC held that the applicant was not acting in good faith and that the inspection of the respondents  books was not for a purpose connected with applying for leave under s   of the Act   that is to say it was not for a proper purpose   Whilst there are superficial similarities between that case and the present  they are  in my opinion  no more than that  That case turned largely on its own facts and for that reason is not of assistance to the resolution of the application before me   Viewing the evidence as a whole I am not persuaded by the submissions of the respondent upon these issues and I am satisfied for the purposes of s  A  of the Act that the applicant has demonstrated that he is acting in good faith and that inspection is to be made for a proper purpose and that in respect to the application governed by s  A     of the Act that the applicant is also acting in good faith and that inspection is to be made for a purpose connected with applying for leave under s   of the Act   or bringing proceedings with leave under that section   The applicant has adduced evidence which condescends in considerable detail to his concerns which if made good upon an inspection of the respondent s books would inform either proceedings contemplated at the instance of the applicant in his own right under ss   and   of the Act and or representative proceedings under ss   and   of the Act    It follows that  in my opinion  orders for inspection of the respondent s books should be made  I will hear counsel as to the precise terms of those orders and the question of costs      I certify that

also the position in respect of the requirement of good faith and proper purpose contained within s  A   See Chuen v Laredo Pty Ltd   WASC   at      The right to apply under s  A  confined as it is to members means that the applicant s purpose must be reasonably related to his or her status as a member  Knightswood Nominees Pty Ltd v Sherwin Pastoral Co Ltd     ACLR    I am satisfied that the applicant s purpose is proper in that respect citedRe Humes Ltd     ACLC   The applicant has no recollection of saying to Ms Dalton that he was looking forward to destroying the respondent  Even if I were to accept Ms Dalton s evidence I would not regard that as sufficient evidence that this application has as its predominant purpose the disruption of the respondent s business  There is clearly hostility between the applicant and Mr Gilmour  This of itself does not necessarily lead to a finding of lack of good faith and in this case I do not do so  Re Humes Ltd     ACLC   at     Nor am I persuaded that the applicant has been guilty of such delay as to evidence bad faith  The applicant had sought justification of certain financial information which  as a shareholder of longstanding  seriously concerned him  The respondent through Mr Gilmour brusquely refused to assist him  Shortly after leaving the employ of the respondent  after offers and counter offers relating to the sale firstly of Mr Gilmour s shareholding and then the applicant s shareholding  formal demands for access to the respondent s books for inspection was made by the applicant s solicitors  Those requests proved futile and led shortly thereafter  as foreshadowed  to this application   I do not consider that anything turns on the failure of the applicant to tender expert accounting evidence  As I indicated earlier the respondent through its counsel conceded that the figures relied upon by the applicant in its affidavits and written submissions were accurate  It does not require an accountant  in my view  for it to be discerned that there are serious concerns raised by the matters complained of in respect of the financial statements and tax returns to which the applicant points
