Vishnumolakala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCoulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The often quoted observations of the High Court in Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR   at   to   loomed large in the respondent Minister s submissions  The Court there indicated that     it is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial  If it were not so  the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the Court of first instance to the appellate Court  tending to reduce the proceedings in the former Court to little more than a preliminary skirmish    As I will indicate in a moment  that observation has particular salience in this matter appliedBranir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees  No   Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I would refer as well to the observations of Allsop J  in the Full Court in Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees  No   Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where his Honour said     The roles of the trial and the appeal need to be kept distinct  The appeal is not a reworking of the trial taking account of such impediments as are thrown up by the judge s finding which alter the landscape   By way of background to the present application  I would note that it arises in proceedings under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  in respect of a decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister refusing an application for a class BN subclass   Skilled Independent Permanent Resident s visa  That decision was at the time not one for which an appeal lay to the Migration Review Tribunal  It was  in consequence  made the direct subject of an application under s  B of the Judiciary Act for relief by way of constitutional writs  The application was dismissed by the Federal Magistrate  The appellant now appeals to this Court impugning the decision of the Federal Magistrate   To permit that evidence now to be called  in my view  is to do the very thing that Allsop J in Branir indicated ought not be done  It is to have a reworking of the trial taking account of such impediments as are thrown up by the judge s findings which alter the landscape  I am not  in the circumstances of this matter  prepared to grant the leave that is sought  It seems to me that what is sought is no more than an attempt to retrieve a point that had been raised and was lost   Accordingly  I will refuse leave to adduce the affidavit evidence that is sought  The orders of the Court will be that leave not be granted in relation to ground   of the amended notice of appeal  Grounds   and   of that amended notice of appeal I am informed now  are not being prosecuted  I adjourn consideration of ground   to the hearing of the appeal  Secondly  leave will not be granted to adduce fresh evidence on the appeal   I certify that the preceding twenty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn    Associate Dated

 htmlcitedMZWCL v MIMIA   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The two new grounds of appeal sought to be raised were not raised at the hearing before his Honour  The principles governing the grant of leave to argue new grounds are reasonably well settled  Leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so  In considering whether it is so in the interests of justice  it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the ground proposed  to determine whether they have reasonable prospects of success  Authorities in support of these well known propositions have been collected in a decision of my own  MZWCL v MIMIA   FCA   at   and    There is one matter which I would give particular attention to in considering the question of leave  and that is in some cases it is not only appropriate but necessary to have regard to the relation of what is now being sought to be done in the appeal to what was done at the trial citedNAJT v MIMIA   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The applicant has placed particular reliance  in relation to the grant of leave  upon the majority decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in NAJT v MIMIA   FCAFC     and particularly upon the factors referred to at    Apart from referring to what are well accepted propositions relating to the prospects of success and whether there was an acceptable explanation of why the grounds were not raised below  those factors deal by and large with issues relating to the efficient conduct of an appeal  whether the issues themselves raised have an importance beyond the case at hand and to prejudice   The one factor upon which particular reliance is placed by the applicant is  what is at stake in a case for the appellant  In the context of this particular visa application  it is said  that if the appellant is not permitted to raise the grounds he wishes to raise  and be given the opportunity to successfully prosecute them  he will not be able to come to Australia at all  Why this particular outcome is said to be inevitable is not the subject of evidence before me   Turning now to the two grounds  the first is the proposed new ground   of the amended notice of appeal           The learned Federal Magistrate erred by holding that under the combined effect of s  c    s   of the Migration Act      the Act    the Delegate was under no obligation to give written reasons for the decision  These subsections of the Act   s   in its entirety and a part of s c  as relevant should be construed as invalid because they are inconsistent with the Federal Court s and Federal Magistrate Court s power under the Constitution both in its original jurisdiction and its appellate jurisdiction and the principle of the Rule of Law   These subsections protect decisions that are potentially affected by jurisdictional error by allowing reasons not to be disclosed and thus they impede or prevent an applicant from establishing jurisdictional error on the part of the Delegate  consideredPublic Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  One possible basis is that the duty to give reasons is so fundamental to the proper conduct of judicial review as to be  in effect  an implication into Ch   of the Constitution   and in particular to s  v  of the Constitution   The difficulty with that proposition is that it stands in sharp contrast with what has been accepted common law in this country in decisions of the High Court for some time  In Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond   HCA         CLR   the High Court  in the context of State legislation  indicated that at common law a governmental decision maker had no duty to give reasons for decision  The same proposition was articulated by Stephen J in Salemi v MacKellar  No     HCA         CLR   at   to    This time  however  it was stated in the setting of a court exercising federal jurisdiction in relation to a decision under the Migration Act  consideredSalemi v MacKellar  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  One possible

austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In light of what I consider to be orthodox law in this country  I do not consider that  if the argument is as I have described it  it has any reasonable prospects of success  An alternative formulation of the argument would seem to be that unless reasons are given  you cannot have procedural fairness  How this is said to ensue is by no means clear  and in any event  it again is inconsistent with decided authority  see Salemi s case above  see also Moradian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at    distinguishedPadfield v Minister of Agriculture  Fisheries and Food   UKHL       AC   In a third alternative explanation of the ground  Mr Silva drew analogy with an approach sometimes evident in judicial decision and well accepted in jurisprudence in England  That is  if a decision maker does not give reasons  a court can presume that the decision maker had no good reason  see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture  Fisheries and Food   UKHL       AC   at   to     to    That bare proposition clearly is inapplicable even if it could be said to represent Australian law  Here there is an express statutory exemption from a general obligation to give written reasons  To apply the presumption to which I had referred would make a nonsense of that exemption   Mr Silva sought to avoid that inconvenient result by saying that if the decision was infected on its face by jurisdictional error and if no reasons were given  it is assumed there were no good reasons  The absence of reasons in this setting seems to serve no operative purpose given that a jurisdictional error has first to be discerned   In short  however one seeks to package this particular ground of appeal and the constitutional question it raises  I am satisfied that it has no reasonable prospects of success  For that reason  I would not give leave for it to be raised on the appeal
