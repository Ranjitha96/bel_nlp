Hurley v McDonald s Australia Ltd   ATPR     at   a Full Court of this Court said in regard to s  AC  emphasis in original     For conduct to be regarded as unconscionable  serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable   must be demonstrated   Cameron v Qantas Airways Ltd     FCR   at    Whatever   unconscionable   means in sections  AB and  AC   the term carries the meaning given by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary  namely  actions showing no regard for conscience   or that are irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable   Qantas Airways Ltd v Cameron     FCR   at    The various synonyms used in relation to the term   unconscionable   import a pejorative moral judgment   Qantas Airways Ltd v Cameron     FCR   at     and     A convenient starting point is the submission of counsel for the respondents that Mr Nagy and Mr Pavia were the agents of Mr Coggin in this transaction and were not the agents of Telstar or Mr Cunningham  Nothing could be further from the truth  The reality is that Mr Nagy and Mr Pavia were old comrades in arms from their door to door cookware selling days  And they were sufficiently familiar with Mr Cunningham to wake him up in the early hours of the morning  moor the Lady Christina at his private mooring  no doubt by prior arrangement  and borrow   from him to pay the skipper  Messrs Nagy  Pavia and Cunningham at all times worked together in pursuit of their own interests  and against the interests of Mr Coggin  This is most strikingly demonstrated by their exclusion of Mr Coggin from the meeting on   December   at which they made the agreement recorded in Mr Cunningham s note   above   They saw the only role of Mr Coggin as being  Joe s Father  who was to provide a boat as collateral for their venture  This is consistent with what Mr Gray told Mrs McIlwee  that Telstar was to make a loan Mr Coggin  for a business venture for Joe Nagy who is the son in law of Mr Coggin    Mr Cunningham was the director of a finance company which usually did not lend on secured transactions  let alone maritime ones  Nor  as far as the evidence reveals  did this Brisbane finance company engage in wholesaling of goods in other States  As the respondents  counsel submitted   this type of transaction was not common for Telstar  appliedRural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR   was a s   case where  amongst other issues  individuals were sought

substantially lessening competition in the market as defined  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ at   firmly rejected this argument  saying       It is wholly unrealistic to seek to characterise knowledge of circumstances in that way  Only a handful of lawyers think or speak in that fashion  and then only at a late stage of analysis of any particular problem  In order to know the essential facts  and thus satisfy s  B  of the Act and like provisions  it is not necessary to know that those facts are capable of characterisation in the language of the statute    Their Honours did not specifically refer to the leading case on accessorial liability under the Act  Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR   although it was cited in argument  at    However  Yorke v Lucas   in applying criminal law principles to accessorial liability under the Act  proceeded on the basis that to form the requisite intent for aiding and abetting a crime  the defendant  must have knowledge of the essential matters which go to make up the offence whether or not he knows that those matters amount to a crime   at    Since  as already noted  the assessment of conduct as unconscionable or not under s  AC may involve the consideration and weighting of   statutory criteria  and an infinite number of other criteria which appear relevant to the judge  it would be quite unworkable to suppose that there could be no finding of accessorial liability unless the individual  at the time of the contravention  considered the same factors  and gave them the same weight  as did the judge at the subsequent trial  Apart from anything else  the morally obtuse would have an undeserved advantage citedYorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and

citedWardley v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The principal element is the value of the vessel as at the end of   this being the time Mr Coggin lost control of her  There is no doubt that there was sufficient causal relationship between the unconscionable conduct and the loss in the  common law practical or common law sense  Wardley v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at     I do not think Telstar should be given credit for the monies it advanced  It has not filed a cross claim  Telstar  through Mr Cunningham  was intimately involved in the way Mr Coggin was drawn into the whole transaction  including the Easy Drink dealership acquisition  Telstar s conduct was seriously unconscionable  It would not be fair to allow it to unpick the transaction and reconstruct something acceptable  Mr Coggin should be put back in the position he was before he encountered the respondents   A claim was also made for loss of rental  This is not so clear  since the availability of solvent lessees at the time is problematic  A better measure is to allow interest on the value of the vessel to date  Counsel agreed that an appropriate rate was ten per cent per annum  not per month  citedSpencer v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On the other hand  a valuation for finance purposes  which contemplates the possibility of a fire sale environment  would be unfair to Mr Coggin  Rather I think the proper measure is market value or current price  Spencer v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     On behalf of the respondents Mr Nicholas Lockyer  another experienced marine surveyor  valued the vessel on a fair market value  as is where is basis  as at   December   at    Mr Lockyer gave his opinion for the purposes of this case and had not inspected the vessel  His report includes two earlier valuations   both for insurance purposes      December   C B Tanner        April   R W Beale    I accept Mr Lockyer s definition of fair market value for these purposes  namely  the price achievable between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser where the vessel has been professionally presented and marketed by brokers in the local domestic market  taking into account recent prices obtained for similar vessels within that market   That being so  I think the best evidence of value was the price in fact achieved  namely    Despite counsel s criticism  I conclude that Telstar took reasonable steps to sell the vessel by placing her with a number of brokers  There is nothing to suggest that the sale which in fact took place was other than at arms  length  The sale was effected after some negotiation and an increase of the buyers  offer   There should be a deduction for repairs carried out on Telstar s instructions amounting to     but not for a further sum of   which seems to have been a gratuity to Mr Cunningham s secretary
