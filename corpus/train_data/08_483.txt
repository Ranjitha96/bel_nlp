Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P  E  Kafka Pty Ltd   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedHermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P  E  Kafka Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   April   I delivered reasons for judgment   Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P  E  Kafka Pty Ltd   FCA   and stood the matter over in order to enable the first applicant to bring in minutes of order to give effect to those reasons  Some issues need to be determined   In principle  the respondents are entitled to costs occasioned by the claim of the second applicant which was not proceeded with  It seems to me that that is likely to be a very slim amount  but that is a matter for agreement  taxation or assessment   The intertwined issues of costs of the adjournment  which took place on   November   and the impact upon the running of interest are rather more difficult questions  The case as pleaded and represented by the evidence was a conventional purchase of a business induced by misleading representations  with the evidence on both sides valuing the property purchased at the time of completion  As with other cases in this Court  it is a case managed proceeding  On the Friday before the hearing  counsel for the respondents raised the spectre of an argument that the proper measure of damage was the difference between the amount paid and the value of the motel at the time of trial  certainly not being the value of the motel at the time of completion  If correct  that would have meant that the applicants had no evidence as to the value at the time contended for  In those circumstances  the applicants sought an adjournment of the proceeding in order that they could meet that potential argument
