Huntley Management Limited v Australian Olives Limited  No     FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAustralian Olives Limited v Stout   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlCounsel for Huntley referred to a statement by Greenwood J in Australian Olives Limited v Stout   FCA   at   where his Honour observed    In order to maintain continuity for those persons dealing with the register  a company recorded by ASIC as a responsible entity of a registered scheme remains the responsible entity until the record is altered to name the new entity  notwithstanding anything in Division       This passage paraphrases subs  of s  FJ and adds an explanation of the purpose of the provision  namely   to maintain continuity for those persons dealing with the register   I do not see any inconsistency between the passage quoted and my construction of s  FJ   The passage quoted applies comfortably to AOL s position  Even on the assumption that there was a valid removal of AOL and appointment of Huntley  those who had dealt with AOL on the faith of the register would be safe in continuing to do so until the register was altered to name Huntley as the new RE  Counsel for Huntley suggests that my construction would lead to intolerable outcomes for innocent third parties  who would be in a quandary as to which company they should deal with as RE  It is true that at the present time  for example  according to the construction I have suggested  Huntley s status as registered RE might be falsified  so that a person dealing with Huntley in reliance on the register might subsequently discover that AOL was the RE  However  the person would have the benefit of the prima facie evidence constituted by the register  which would have to be displaced by evidence  and would have a claim against Huntley for breach of an implied warranty that it was the RE and therefore trustee for the scheme members  see s  FC  of the Act   In any event  the construction urged by Huntley can also lead to difficulty in that the true RE would be denied that status  even if it placed convincing proof of it before the person  unless and until the dispute between the rivals for the position of RE was resolved and ASIC altered the register  Whatever course is followed  the disconformity between the true facts and those suggested by the registration could be a potential cause of hardship and loss in particular circumstances that can be hypothesised referred toH A Stephenson   Son Limited  in liq  v Gillanders  Arbuthnot   Co   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSecond  the construction suggested is consistent with the scheme of the registers kept by ASIC  Generally speaking  an ASIC writing that is based on the ASIC national database is only prima facie evidence  see  for example  ss   and  B  of the Act  An exception is found in s  A  which is the familiar provision to the effect that a certificate issued by ASIC stating that a company has been registered under the Act is conclusive evidence that all requirements of the Act for its registration were complied with and that the company was duly registered as a company under the Act on the date specified in the certificate  The policy underlying that longstanding provision in the companies legislation was explained Evatt J in H A Stephenson   Son Limited  in liq  v Gillanders  Arbuthnot   Co   HCA         CLR   at      Unlike the issuing of a certificate of registration of a company  the making or changing of entries in a register on information supplied to ASIC does not create a new entity and associated rights and obligations  but is supposed to reflect rights and obligations that have already arisen citedING Funds Management Limited v ANZ Nominees Limited   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlThird  a somewhat analogous provision is found in s  GC  of the Act which requires that any modification to a registered scheme s constitution be lodged with ASIC and cannot take effect until lodged  In ING Funds Management Limited v ANZ Nominees Limited   NSWSC   there was a question as to the effectiveness of actions taken by an RE to suspend the rights of members of two registered schemes to require redemption of their units  The RE contended that the actions taken by it were effective to modify the constitutions of the schemes to create the suspension  Section  GC of the Act provided      The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified  or repealed and replaced with a new constitution   a        b  by the responsible entity if the responsible entity reasonably considers the change will not adversely affect members  rights         The responsible entity must lodge with ASIC a copy of the modification of the new constitution  The modification  or repeal and or replacement cannot take effect until the copy has been lodged     The RE lodged documents with ASIC  Barrett J held  for reasons that do not presently matter  that a deed was required and that the execution and lodgment of the documents  which  it was common ground  did not constitute deeds  did not cause the constitutions to be modified pursuant to s  GC b
