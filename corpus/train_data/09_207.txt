under s  A a  and its analogues in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury  acting reasonably  would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial  Mickelberg v The Queen   HCA           CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Mickelberg   That test  as Mason CJ noted in Mickelberg   is derived from views expressed by four of the judges in Gallagher v The Queen   HCA           CLR    Gallagher   Of these  it is worthy of note in the present context that  in so concluding as to the nature of the relevant test  Gibbs CJ observed  at   that   it is too severe  and indeed speculative  a test to require that the court should grant a new trial only if it concludes that the fresh evidence was likely to have produced a different result  in the sense that it would probably have done so   Also worthy of note in the present context is a further observation of Mason CJ in his judgment in Mickelberg  at   in respect of the reference in that case that it indicated  the existence of public concern about the propriety of the convictions   Having regard to what was said in Mickelberg and Gallagher   described above  as to the basis upon which an appellate court on a reference will set aside a conviction  the words emphasised overstate the position  Evidence which is  fresh and compelling  may very well persuade an appellate court not only to set aside a conviction but also not to order a retrial and perhaps to order the entry of an acquittal  However  to secure the setting aside of a conviction  it is enough that the appellate court  considering the case as a whole  concludes that there is a significant possibility that the jury  acting reasonably  would have acquitted the appellant  It is true that  earlier in his reasons  the Minister expresses the opinion that   I consider it appropriate to refer a case to the Court of Appeal where the material presented raises a doubt or question about the conviction or sentence   Read in isolation  that might be thought to posit a test not materially different to that adopted in Mickelberg and Gallagher   As to that though  the Minister is not performing the function of an appellate court  only exercising a discretion as to whether or not there is a case which warrants referral to such a court  His role is to determine whether the applicant has presented a case in which it is reasonably arguable that an appellate court  applying the test in those cases and upon a consideration of the whole of the case  would set aside the conviction  That is a lesser threshold citedHorwitz v Connor   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe discretion conferred by s   of the Judiciary Act by applying s  A of the Queensland Criminal Code is a statutory adjunct to a prerogative of mercy  The prerogative forms part of the executive power of the Commonwealth but  as applied by s   the power exercised by the Court of Appeal upon a reference under s  A is an exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth pursuant to a conferral of federal jurisdiction on that court for that purpose by s   of the Judiciary Act   It is consistent with the views expressed by Lander J in Eastman v A G  ACT  to regard a Ministerial decision as to whether to engage that statutory adjunct as amenable to judicial review even if  as Horwitz v Connor   HCA         CLR   would bind me to hold  a decision to refuse a pardon is not itself reviewable  For completeness  reference should be made to von Einem v Griffin     SASR   in which a conception that the feature that the referral power was an adjunct to the prerogative of mercy led a Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court to hold that a Minister s decision not to refer a case to the Full Court pursuant to that State s analogue of s  A  s  a  of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act    SA  was not amenable to judicial review  Given that conception  Horwitz v Connor was considered to dictate that result  von Einem v Griffin was not a case where the judicial review application was made under an equivalent of the ADJR Act  In this case though  the view is open that  insofar as he refused to refer the case to the Court of Appeal  the Minister made a decision  under an enactment  namely s   of the Judiciary Act   which rendered applicable s  A of the Queensland Criminal Code   of an administrative character  and accordingly one to which the ADJR Act applies    von Einem v Griffin is  for this reason alone  distinguishable  Further  as the Court s jurisdiction is sufficiently invoked by the reliance on the ADJR Act  it is unnecessary to decide whether an alternative basis for a judicial review jurisdiction exists having regard to s  v  of the Constitution and s  B of the Judiciary Act and given that the decision is one made under statute by an officer of the Commonwealth  Though Perrier v Kerr   Pepper v Attorney General  Qld   No   and Eastman v A G  ACT  are not  strictly  binding  I ought to follow them unless  which is not the case here  I am convinced that they are clearly in error consideredMallard v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Mallard v The Queen   HCA         CLR     Mallard s Case  at   Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ observed of the Western Australian equivalent of s  A      Provision for the referral of petitions for clemency to the courts owes its modern origin to public adverse reaction to the excessive imposition of capital punishment in the nineteenth and earlier centuries  As the capital statutes were repealed so as to apply the death penalty to fewer offences  appeals for pardons to the Crown tended to be made in cases of asserted miscarriages of justice  despite the anomaly to which a successful petition might give rise  that a person who has in fact come to be considered to have been wrongly convicted or innocent  is pardoned  and not acquitted of the crime  The importance of this avenue of recourse to justice  effectively controlled by the Executive  declined  after the introduction of the Criminal Appeal Act    UK  to establish the Court of Criminal Appeal  although no attempt was made to abolish it  It proved fortunate that this was so because there was  initially at least  a judicial reluctance to allow appeals in criminal cases  occasioned in part no doubt by the sanctity accorded  and usually desirably so  to the verdict of a jury  and less desirably  to the legal conservatism of some of the judiciary of the day  Mallard s Case is also important for present purposes because of the emphasis given  at   by Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ in their joint judgment to the need for an appeal court on a reference under s  A a  to adhere to the letter and spirit of the words  the whole case  when determining a reference     The  explicit reference to  the whole case  conveys no hint of any inhibition upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal on a reference  Indeed  to the contrary  the words  the whole case  embrace the whole of the evidence properly admissible  whether  new   fresh  or previously adduced  in the case against  and the case for the appellant  Another concern arises from the following passages in the Minister s reasons   The majority of the claims raised in the application were considered at trial or on appeal  and  in respect of  Ground    Even without the material provided in the application  the jury seems to have been well aware that the defence questioned the accuracy of  the complainant s  evidence and argued that the trip actually occurred in August     So much may be accepted  but those claims were not considered against the additional background of the further evidence provided by the Applicant in his application to the Minister  Immediately after the passage from the joint judgement of Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ in Mallard s Case  at   which I have quoted above  at para   their Honours further observe    That does not mean that the Court may not  if it think it useful  derive assistance from the way in which a previous appellate court has dealt with some  or all of the matters before it  but under no circumstances can it relieve it of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case  The history  as we have already mentioned  points in the same direction  The inhibitory purpose and effect of the words  as if it were an appeal  are merely to confine the Court to the making of orders  and the following of procedures apposite to an appeal  and further  and perhaps most relevantly  to require the Court to consider whether the overall strength of the prosecution case requires the Court to apply the proviso contained in s   of the Criminal Code    Emphasis added Paragraphs   and   of the judgment delivered by McMurdo P in the Applicant s unsuccessful appeal  quoted above  highlight that evidence which the complainant and the Applicant gave at the trial as to the number of flights undertaken with each other  when and for what purpose  were before the jury to evaluate in an assessment of the their respective credibility and on the then state of their and other evidence  What was not before the jury or the Court of Appeal was the further evidence which formed part of the Applicant s submission to the Minister  Further  para   of the judgment also shows that the absence of contemporary corroboration of the Applicant s log book entries was recognised as a factor which need not have compelled the acceptance of the veracity of those entries  On a reference under s  A that on the Applicant s earlier appeal the log book had been dealt with in this fashion might  when considering the whole of the case  which would include the PNGCAA material  be thought to raise a stronger interrogative note concerning the relative credibility of the Applicant and the complainant  The enhanced corroboration of other aspects of the Applicant s account of events offered by the other evidence might perhaps also be similarly viewed  Be this as it may  what can be said  having regard to this further observation in Mallard s Case   is that in deciding whether or not there is a reasonably arguable case advanced that on a reference an appellate court would conclude that there was a significant possibility that the jury  acting reasonably  would have acquitted the appellant  it does not follow that because  having regard to the then state of the evidence  an appeal against conviction was dismissed  like claims made against a broader evidentiary background must necessarily meet the same fate  The passage quoted from the Minister s reasons evidences a misunderstanding of the role of the Court of Appeal on a reference under s  A  Of course  as McMurdo P was astute to point out in her judgment  the question before the jury at the Applicant s trial was not whether or not the complainant was mistaken as to the number of flights to Port Moresby she undertook with the Applicant  when and for what purposes  It was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt on admissible evidence that the Applicant had committed the offence charged  Nonetheless  an assessment as to whether the offence had been so proved very much depended in the circumstances of this case on questions of credibility  What the Minister has not considered is whether on the whole of the evidence  as it now stands  the Applicant has presented an arguable case on the authorities for the setting aside of the conviction  A further concern is that the Minister has been dismissive of the Applicant s request for a reference on the basis that the evidence was not  fresh   Having regard to what was said in Daly s Case  Condren s Case and Mallard s Case  that new evidence contained in a request for a reference under s  A might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial and therefore not strictly  fresh  does not mean that the Court of Appeal on a reference could not receive it as a matter of discretion  It is not even evident from the Minister s reasons whether  in referring to an absence of fresh evidence  the Minister is using  fresh  to mean that  though  new  it was evidence that might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial  Such analysis as there is in the Minister s reasons of the particular evidence which accompanied the submission to him displays a misunderstanding of what amounts to  evidence  be it  new  or  fresh  as the following passage in respect of  Ground   reveals    The information in the log book is the same as that in the document from the Papua New Guinea Civil Aviation Authority  PNGCAA   It is therefore not  new evidence  as the information was before the jury when it considered the case   The subjects of when flights were undertaken and with whom were before the jury  At the trial  evidence on that subject came  inter alia  from the Applicant s oral testimony  that of the complainant and from the Applicant s log book  The PNGCAA documentation was evidence  was at least  new  and was never before the jury  These errors aside  the passage quoted is underpinned by the premise  erroneous on the authorities  that  because a subject was before a jury  that means that  faced with new evidence touching on that subject  an appellate court on a reference cannot hold  on the whole of the case  that there is a significant possibility that the jury  acting reasonably  would have acquitted the appellant had the  fresh  or  new  evidence been before it consideredMickelberg v The Queen   HCA           CLR  http

would probably have done so   Also worthy of note in the present context is a further observation of Mason CJ in his judgment in Mickelberg  at   in respect of the reference in that case that it indicated  the existence of public concern about the propriety of the convictions   Such considerations would not be exhaustive of matters to which the Minister might  without committing the error of taking into account an irrelevant consideration  advert in deciding whether or not to refer a case  Because  in making the decision  the Minister acts administratively  he might take into account material which would not be admissible on the consideration of a reference by the Court of Appeal  Thus  as for example  Mason CJ apprehended in his judgment in Mickelberg   he might note public concern as to the propriety of the conviction  His sources of information in this regard might  for example  be reports in the media  a petition presented to Parliament  a representation from a parliamentary colleague  or perhaps hearsay evidence as to the reliability of a complainant or other information in an application for a pardon which did not constitute admissible evidence which could be considered by an appellate court on a reference  None of these would though be considerations that he was obliged to take into account  ie  relevant considerations   Having regard to what was said in Mickelberg and Gallagher   described above  as to the basis upon which an appellate court on a reference will set aside a conviction  the words emphasised overstate the position  Evidence which is

necessary implication from its subject matter  scope and purpose  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA           CLR   at      The Applicant submitted that s  A did not authorise the Minister to act as a  gatekeeper  second guessing what the Court of Appeal might make of fresh evidence  The submission allowed that the Minister might refuse to refer an application which was obviously frivolous but that it did not authorise the ignoring  as was submitted had occurred  of the evidence submitted with the application to the Minister  The Respondents submitted that s  A of the Queensland Criminal Code does not expressly specify any criteria as relevant to the exercise of the discretionary power for which that section provides  such that the scope of the discretion was unconfined save insofar as the subject matter  scope and purpose of the section dictated otherwise  So much may be accepted but it rather begs the question as to what is dictated by the subject matter  scope and purpose of s  A  To answer this question it is necessary to consider in some detail authorities concerning s  A and its analogues citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAny consideration of the Minister s reasons must commence from the premise that they are meant to inform and are not to be read narrowly or zealously with an eye for error upon judicial review  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at      Further  and with all due respect to its author  the Minister was confronted with an application which  even as it came to be amplified  was diffuse and  as the title  corrupt prosecution  might suggest  attended with large claims about a course of conduct in respect of the Applicant allegedly involving agencies here and in Papua New Guinea tantamount to a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice  The Minister s reasons take the form in which they appear because of an evident endeavour by him and those advising him to engage in an orderly way with the Applicant s application  I do not underestimate the difficulty which that presented in the circumstances  The  conspiracy  aspects of the submission made to the Minister were supported by hearsay accounts of varying degrees of remoteness from various persons  Another part of Mrs Tapari s statement had such material in it  It is not necessary for the purpose of deciding this judicial review application to refer in detail to that part of her statement or to other hearsay accounts  The Minister could  in my opinion  have taken these into account in deciding whether or not to refer a case  but he was not bound so to do  In the form presented  this material did not constitute evidence to which the Court of Appeal might advert upon its consideration of the whole of the case  Likewise  the withdrawal of a separate charge in respect of a complaint by another person had nothing to do with whether there existed further evidence warranting a reference to the Court of Appeal  Grounds       and   of the Minister s reasons relate to these aspects of the application  Of the attached reasons  only grounds   and   appear to relate to the request for a reference under s  A  In my respectful opinion  the Minister s reasons demonstrate that he has applied an overly rigorous test in deciding whether or not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal  Of particular concern is the following passage    In the absence of fresh and compelling evidence casting doubt on your conviction  paramount weight must be placed on the decision of the court  As the further evidence provided in the application was not fresh or compelling it does not warrant further consideration

It was held that the State Attorney could not be ordered pursuant to s   of the Judicial Review Act  an analogue of s   and  A  of the ADJR Act  to furnish a statement of reasons for the refusal  The basis for the Court of Appeal s so holding was not that the State Attorney s decision was not one to which the Judicial Review Act applied  but rather that it was a decision in the administration of criminal justice and thus  by virtue of the exemption for which s   and Schedule   item   of the Judicial Review Act provide  exempt from the statutory obligation to give reasons if requested  For

defence case and of the basis upon which his appeal against conviction to the Court of Appeal failed  These matters are comprehensively canvassed in the judgment of McMurdo P  with whom Holmes JA and Cullinane J agreed  in the disposal by the Court of Appeal of the Applicant s appeal against his conviction  R v Martens   QCA    It would only add unnecessarily to the length of these reasons to recite all of what is there stated  Some matters  salient in light of the present proceeding  should be recorded  That the complainant was under   years of age at the time of the alleged offence was uncontroversial  as were the facts that the Applicant was an Australian citizen and that he and the complainant were at least on some days  each in Port Moresby between the dates alleged in the indictment  Whether the offence was proved depended very much upon an evaluation by the jury of whether the complainant was to be believed in her account that the Applicant had intercourse with her while they were in Port Moresby  Her evidence was that she had twice flown to Port Moresby with the Applicant in   firstly in March for the purpose of securing a passport to be used by her in later travelling to Australia for educational purposes and secondly  so she said  on a school day after her birthday   September  but before Papua New Guinea s Independence Day   September  the   celebration of which in Port Moresby she stated she attended  At the trial the Applicant mounted a concerted challenge to the complainant s credibility  His evidence was that there had been but one flight to Port Moresby with the complainant as his passenger  According to him  it was this trip which was made for the purpose of the completion of the complainant s passport application  Apart from his oral evidence to this effect he produced his pilot s log book in which was recorded but one trip to Port Moresby with the complainant  on   August    A passport photograph of the complainant endorsed on the reverse with the date   August   and a related photographic laboratory receipt dated   August   featured in the defence case  The evidence tendered by the prosecution included the

theory citedR v Wilkes   EngR         Burr       ER  The office of Attorney General is an ancient one  It evolved because the Sovereign could not appear in person in his courts to plead cases which affected his interests  Hence a need to appear by an attorney  see The Hon LJ King AC  QC    The Attorney General  Politics and The Judiciary      ALJ    Conventionally  in relation to the criminal law of a body politic which is a constitutional monarchy  the Crown has the constitutional responsibility for the prosecution of crimes with that prosecutorial function being discharged in the courts on behalf of the Crown by the Attorney General  R v Wilkes   EngR         Burr       ER    In more modern times  there has been parliamentary recognition that a need for independence from political considerations in the making of a range of prosecutorial decisions is enhanced by consigning the tasks of making decisions in individual cases and representing the Crown in criminal cases to an official removed from politics  a Director of Public Prosecutions  Nonetheless  Ministerial responsibility for the administration of the criminal law and for the office of a Director of Public Prosecutions  in conformity with convention  is usually consigned to the Attorney General  It is certainly possible to explain the Queensland Parliament s definition of  Crown Law Officer  for the purposes of the Queensland Criminal Code by such considerations  That might be thought to support the Applicant s submission citedRe Judiciary and Navigation Acts   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI accept therefore that the decision made by the Minister is one to which the ADJR Act applies and that consequently this court has jurisdiction to review the Minister s decision to refuse to refer the case to the Court of Appeal  In so doing  it is unnecessary to decide and I refrain from expressing any view as to whether  were the Minister desirous of having the benefit of the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point arising in the application for a pardon  for which s  A b  of the Queensland Criminal Code prima facie provides  a need to read s   of the Judiciary Act subject to the Constitution  s  A Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   Acts Interpretation Act   would prevent the application of that part of the provision to a person who sought a pardon in respect of a federal offence  A concern would be whether that application would be prevented by the prohibition  arising from the interpretation of Chapter III of the Constitution favoured in Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts   HCA         CLR     against the furnishing of advisory opinions in the exercise of judicial power in federal jurisdiction  That is a subject which may only arise  if at all  in the event not only that the present decision were set aside but the Minister  assuming he is the relevant Commonwealth Minister of State  were disposed to act under s  A b  rather than s  A a  of the Queensland Criminal Code   The request made by the Applicant in his application and the way it was dealt with by the Minister suggest that it was both intended to be and was treated as one made under s  A a  only  Was the Minister empowered to make the decision The Applicant s argument in respect of this issue was succinct but none the worse for that  There were officers of the Commonwealth whose title corresponded exactly with those State officers named in the definition of  Crown Law Officer  for the purposes of s  A of the Queensland Criminal Code   That being so  it was submitted that there was no warrant for applying this provision  pursuant to s   of the Judiciary Act    so as  it is  applicable  to enlarge its application so as to embrace the Minister  To the contrary  it was submitted that  having regard to the sensitivity which might attend the pardoning of a person convicted after a jury verdict and subsequent unsuccessful appeal  the choice in the definition of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions may not have been coincidental representing as it did the Crown s First Law Officer on the one hand and the senior independent officer holder charged with responsibility for prosecutions  The Respondent s argument was rather more elaborate  Its starting point was Ch II of the Constitution   Section   of the Constitution makes provision for a Federal Executive Council  In turn  s   of the Constitution provides for the appointment of members of the Federal Executive Council as Ministers   the Queen s Ministers of State for the Commonwealth   to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor General in Council may establish   Section   then materially provides that those Ministers of State  shall

even if that evidence might  by the exercise of due diligence  have been produced at the trial  The Queen v  Young  No     Qd R   at    In the latter case  ibid  the Queensland Court of Criminal

and Eastman v A G  ACT  are not  strictly  binding  I ought to follow them unless  which is not the case here  I am convinced that they are clearly in error  These conclusions are  in my opinion  consistent with conclusions reached by Lander J as a member of the Full Court in von Einem v Griffin     SASR   at     concerning the analogous reference power upon the assumption  contrary to the conclusion he reached  that the South Australian Attorney s decision to decline a reference request was amenable to judicial review  His Honour stated    Judicial review would only be available to review the decision whether or not to exercise the discretion and then the subsequent exercise of that discretion to determine whether the exercise of the discretion conformed with the policy scope and objects of the Act      What  then  is the policy or scope and objects of s   The section has no application unless a petition for mercy has been presented to the Governor  It therefore assumes that the Petitioner has exhausted all of his or her legal rights and that all appeals have been exhausted and the conviction and the sentence must stand according to law      The section further assumes that there may be circumstances  notwithstanding that all appeals have been exhausted  where it would be appropriate to refer this matter back to the Court for further hearing as an appeal  In that respect the section perhaps contemplates that fresh evidence has emerged which might make the conviction unsafe or unsatisfactory  It also contemplates that perhaps a restatement of the law may require the revisiting of a previous decision or the conviction      The policy  purpose and object of s  is to ensure  so far as practicable  that no person is the victim of a miscarriage of justice      The section has been included to allow for circumstances of the kind to which I have referred so that even if a person has exhausted all that person s rights of appeal  that person will not be the victim of a miscarriage of justice  if later circumstances show that the conviction should not stand for any reason including that it is unsafe and unsatisfactory      It is within that policy and purpose that the Attorney General must act  When a petition is presented to the Governor and referred to the Attorney General apart from advising on the question of mercy  generally  the policy and purpose of s  is to have the Attorney General apply his mind as to whether or not it would be appropriate to invoke the Court s jurisdiction yet again  notwithstanding that the appeal process has been exhausted  so that the Court may determine whether  in any way  there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to that petitioner      The policy and purpose of this section is to require the Attorney General to apply his mind as to whether it would be appropriate to refer the matter to the courts in either of the ways mentioned in s  in case there has been a miscarriage of justice      Any matter relevant to the policy  scope or objects of the section              Did The Attorney General Apply The Correct Legal Test      In considering the matters raised in the petition the Attorney had to adopt a criterion to determine whether the material provided could give rise to the invocation of either of the powers contained in s       He was advised that unless the material referred to in the petition raised a sufficient doubt about the correctness of the decision the appropriate response was to advise His Excellency that it was not proposed to take any further action in respect of the petition  In considering whether the material raised in the petition raised a sufficient doubt about the correctness of the decision he was further advised that the material would not raise such a doubt unless it appears reasonably possible that a miscarriage of justice has occurred      The Attorney General accepted that advice and on the evidence acted upon the criterion to the extent  that unless the material disclosed the reasonable possibility of a miscarriage of justice his proper response was to advise His Excellency to take no further action upon the petition      The plaintiff complained about the test adopted by the Attorney General which he said amounted to a misunderstanding of the legal principles involved in exercising his discretion under this section  Initially the plaintiff argued that the adoption of such a test was an error of law  but I think that it was otherwise said that the criterion adopted was so unreasonable that no sensible person could have adopted the test      If the matter had come before a judge of this Court  after conviction and sentence  for the purpose of obtaining leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court  then the test which would have been applied by that judge was whether the ground or grounds of appeal  raised on the application for leave to appeal  were arguable  The plaintiff argued  on this application  that that is the test which the Attorney General should have asked himself in relation to the matters raised on the petition  It was said that to approach the matter any other way amounted to an error of law and was so unreasonable that no sensible person could have adopted the test      Of course  the proposition that a ground of appeal is arguable begs the question  Arguable in what sense  It must be arguable that there has been a miscarriage of justice      It is right  I think  as Mr Abbott submitted  that a single judge in this State will grant leave to appeal from a conviction or sentence if that judge is satisfied that it is arguable there has been a miscarriage of justice      The practice book in this State  Criminal Law South Australia  Butterworths  Judge Lunn  states at para        The test for leave is whether it is at least arguable that the exercise of the trial judge s discretion has miscarried or there could be any real element of injustice to the appellant if leave was refused  McDonald v R     NTR           In McDonald v R   Asche CJ relied upon a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Broadway   VR   and concluded that on an application for leave to appeal the appropriate test should be  at least an arguable case   at        Asche CJ  however  accepted that it was inappropriate in applications for leave to appeal to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria  He suggested that another test could be  that some possible though real element of injustice might be thought to occur if leave were refused   at        He said that the purpose of a provision requiring leave to appeal is to discriminate between the obvious cases where it is clear that the appeal cannot succeed and to allow the others to go forward      Accepting the decision in McDonald v R and the matters to which Asche CJ has referred  it cannot be said that the criteria for granting leave to appeal is necessarily appropriate in determining whether or not a matter should be referred to this Court pursuant to either of the limbs of s       There is a point of distinction between an application for leave to appeal and a reference under s    A matter which is being considered by the Attorney General under s   has already been the subject of appeal and all of the rights of appeal have already been exhausted      In any event  it is not self evident to me that the test that it is arguable that there was a miscarriage of justice is any less onerous than the test asked by the Attorney General of himself  i e  whether there was a reasonable possibility of a miscarriage of justice  It seems to me that the tests  in a sense  ask the same question  A point will not arguably show that there has been a miscarriage of justice unless there is a possibility that there has been a miscarriage of justice and  of course  that possibility must be reasonable  What then of the Minister s consideration of the Applicant s request for a reference citedWilliams v The King  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSection   of the Judiciary Act does not  in terms  refer to any Minister  Rather  it  picks up  provisions of State legislation  which may or may not themselves refer to a State Minister or other official  and applies them  so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth   In so doing   the adoption of the State law must proceed by analogy  an observation made by Sir Owen Dixon in Williams v The King  No     HCA         CLR   at   which commended itself to Gibbs J  as his Honour then was  in Peel s Case   HCA         CLR   at   and to Gibbs CJ  Mason and Wilson JJ in Rhode s Case   HCA         CLR   at   see also to like effect in that case the separate judgement delivered by Brennan J     CLR at     consideredZoeller v Attorney General  Cth      FCR  The Respondents then pointed to the now accepted position

applicable by s   of the Judiciary Act to the pardon application made by the Applicant citedThe Hon LJ King AC  QC    The Attorney General  Politics and The Judiciary      Australian Law Journal  The office of Attorney General is an ancient one  It evolved because the Sovereign could not appear in person in his courts to plead cases which affected his interests  Hence a need to appear by an attorney  see The Hon LJ King AC  QC    The Attorney General  Politics and The Judiciary      ALJ    Conventionally  in relation to the criminal law of a body politic which is a constitutional monarchy  the Crown has the constitutional responsibility for the prosecution of crimes with that prosecutorial function being discharged in the courts on behalf of the Crown by the Attorney General  R v Wilkes   EngR         Burr       ER    In more modern times  there has been parliamentary recognition that a need for independence from political considerations in the making of a range of prosecutorial decisions is enhanced by consigning the tasks of making decisions in individual cases and representing the Crown in criminal cases to an official removed from politics  a Director of Public Prosecutions  Nonetheless  Ministerial responsibility for the administration of the criminal law and for the office of a Director of Public Prosecutions  in conformity with convention  is usually consigned to the Attorney General  It is certainly possible to explain the Queensland Parliament s definition of  Crown Law Officer  for the purposes of the Queensland Criminal Code by such considerations  That might be thought to support the Applicant s submission
