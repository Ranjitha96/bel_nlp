per Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ  and Commonwealth v Yarmirr   HCA         CLR     Yarmirr   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ   All the elements of the definition of native title in s   must be given effect  Yorta Yorta at    In Ward at     Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ said in relation to s      Several points should be made here  First  the rights and interests may be communal  group or individual rights and interests  Secondly  the rights and interests consist  in relation to land or waters   Thirdly  the rights and interests must have three characteristics  they are rights and interests which are  possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the relevant peoples  by those traditional laws and customs  the peoples  have a connection with  the land or waters in question  and the rights and interests must be  recognised by the common law of Australia    The High Court reiterated those matters in Yarmirr at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ and also in Yorta Yorta at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ   In Yorta Yorta   the High Court  Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ  Gaudron and Kirby JJ dissenting  further addressed the requirements of s   and expanded on the need for connection   The majority set out the following principles at        First  it follows from Mabo  No   that the Crown s acquisition of sovereignty over the several parts of Australia cannot be challenged in an Australian municipal court  Secondly  upon acquisition of sovereignty over a particular part of Australia  the Crown acquired a radical title to the land in that part  but native title to that land survived the Crown s acquisition of sovereignty and radical title  What survived were rights and interests in relation to land or waters  Those rights and interests owed their origin to a normative system other than the legal system of the new sovereign power  they owed their origin to the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous peoples concerned   At     and at     the majority stated that the rights and interests the subject of the NT Act are those which derive from traditional laws and customs forming a body of norms that existed before sovereignty  This principle affects the construction of the definition of native title in s   in particular  the meaning of  traditional   See Yorta Yorta at     where the majority said         the references  in pars  a  and  b  of the definition of native title  to  traditional  law or custom must be understood in the light of the considerations that have been mentioned  As the claimants submitted   traditional  is a word apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom  A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a society  usually by word of mouth and common practice  But in the context of the Native Title Act    traditional  carries with it two other elements in its meaning  First  it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions  the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown  It is only those normative rules that are  traditional  laws and customs      Secondly  and no less importantly  the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned  requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed  the traditional laws and customs  is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty  If that normative system has not existed throughout that period  the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist  And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title   The majority judgment in Yorta Yorta imposes a requirement of continuity on both the Aboriginal society and also on the acknowledgment and observance of the traditional laws and customs which are claimed to give rise to the rights and interests under the NT Act  at       Laws and customs do not exist in a vacuum they  arise out of and  in important respects  go to define a particular society  Yorta Yorta at      In this context   society  is to be  understood as a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of laws and customs  at    If the society ceases to exist  then so too do its traditional laws and customs  from which rights and interests arise  at    Once a society has ceased to exist  it is not possible for descendants of that society to take up again the  traditional  laws and customs as those expressions are used in the NT Act       As the majority said in Yorta Yorta at        When the society whose laws or customs existed at sovereignty ceases to exist  the rights and interests in land to which these laws and customs gave rise  cease to exist  If the content of the former laws and customs is later adopted by some new society  those laws and customs will then owe their new life to that other  later  society and they are the laws acknowledged by  and customs observed by  that later society   they are not laws and customs which can now properly now be described as being the existing laws and customs of the earlier society  The rights and interests in land to which the re adopted laws and customs give rise are rights and interests which are not rooted in pre sovereignty traditional law and custom but in the laws and customs of the new society         See also Yorta Yorta at     The requirement for continuity of connection is not absolute  In Yorta Yorta   the majority recognised at   that        demonstrating some change to  or adaptation of  traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests in the period between the Crown asserting sovereignty and the present will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim      The key question is whether the law and custom can still be seen to be traditional law and traditional custom  Is the change or adaptation of such a kind that it can no longer be said that the rights or interests asserted are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples when that expression is understood in the sense earlier identified         See also Yorta Yorta at   and       The acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs must have continued  substantially uninterrupted  since sovereignty  Yorta Yorta at     The issues on the hearing have been hard fought  Apart from facilitating the course of the evidence  the Territory and the other respondents have made no admissions  They dispute each element of the matters the applicants or one or other of the first applicants or the second applicants must establish to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Court that  but for the extinguishing effect of any particular dealings with any parts of the claim area  they have or would have native title rights or interests in any part of the claim area   Senior counsel for the DCC identified five steps in the respondents  opposition    that no native title rights and interests have been shown to exist in the claim area  or  if such rights do exist  they are limited and non exclusive rights only  and      the extent to which  if at all  s  A and s  B of the NT Act can apply in respect of any parts of the claim area    in respect of those parts of the claim area to which s  A or s  B apply  what extinguishment of native title rights and interests should be disregarded by reason of their operation  and    in respect of those parts of the claim area where s  A or s  B of the NT Act do not apply  or if they do where extinguishment is not to be disregarded  the detailed consideration of the nature and effect of the myriad extinguishing acts relied upon by the respondents   It is appropriate at this point to address the question whether  at sovereignty  there existed a society of Aboriginal persons having traditional laws and customs under a normative system under which those laws and customs gave rise to rights and interests in the land and waters comprising the claim area possessed by members of that society  It is also appropriate to identify whether at the time of settlement there existed such a society of Aboriginal persons  And finally  it is appropriate to determine whether such society as may be found to have existed at the time of settlement  in say the mid  s  is the Larrakia people  and is the same society as that found to exist at the time of sovereignty  Each of those questions is necessary to be answered affirmatively if the claims of either the first applicants or of the second applicants are to succeed  see the discussion above  and in particular Yorta Yorta at       and     The affirmative determination of those questions at this point of my reasons which I am about to record is not intended to say anything on the subsequent issues which also must be affirmatively answered if the first applicants or the second applicants are to be determined to be entitled to native title in respect of the claim area or parts of it   As I indicated  I am satisfied about each of those matters  I find that within the geographical area which includes the claim area  at sovereignty  there existed an Aboriginal society which  by its traditional laws and customs  had a normative system which gave rise to rights and obligations on the part of its members in relation to the land and waters within that area  The archaeological evidence points to there having been some form of society at that time  albeit directly demonstrating only an  economic  society  From the time of the first observations of the area by European observers  their observations are in general terms consistent with there being then  and there having been  such a society  Again  the observations are only a course indication of such a society   The NT Act does not require a specific method for the transmission of knowledge between generations of an Aboriginal society  Section   requires that the  rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  and that the Aboriginal group have a connection with the land or waters  by those laws and customs   In Yorta Yorta at   the majority said that  traditional  does not mean only that which is transferred by word of mouth from generation to generation  it reflects the fundamental nature of the native title rights and interests with which the Act deals as rights and interests rooted in pre sovereignty traditional laws and customs   The majority went on to say that demonstration of some adaptation or change will not  necessarily be fatal  to a native title claim  and that the  key question is whether the law and custom can still be seen to be traditional law and traditional custom   The current proceeding presents a situation where  a  there is no documentary or expert evidence of an historical or anthropological nature indicating the existence of any traditional system of transmission of knowledge at the time of sovereignty  and  b  it is obvious  given the notorious oral nature of historical tradition of all Australian indigenous societies  that such a system must have existed  and  c  primary evidence indicates that current members of the Larrakia community have obtained knowledge through a variety of methods  including  but not exclusively  from other Larrakia people  from non Larrakia people  from books  from courses of study  and from the Kenbi Claim hearings which spanned many years  A series of events such as the removal of children from their parents  and removal of people from the area during the war  detailed in the outline of the history of the area  above have precipitated this process and the need for it   I regard it as significant that the recent processes for the acquisition and transmission of cultural knowledge are somewhat piecemeal  It is not a criticism that they have that quality  It is a consequence of the history of the Larrakia people during several decades of the   th Century  I am prepared to infer that the process of knowledge acquisition and transmission which existed at sovereignty  and which I have found continued to the time of settlement in the  s and beyond  was not of the same piecemeal character  it was likely to have been a process effected within formal rules of the Larrakia people as to who should hold  and pass on  knowledge  when they should do so  and to whom they should do  It was unlikely to involve any passing on of knowledge from non Larrakia people   In Yorta Yorta   Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ said at   that  society  is to be understood as a  body of persons united in and by its observance and acknowledgment of a body of laws and customs    For reasons which are apparent from the above consideration of the evidence  and findings in relation to it  I am also satisfied that the Larrakia people are the same society as that which existed previously  including at settlement  There is no reason to think otherwise  and I did not understand the respondents to contend otherwise  although there was  as discussed  significant debate as to the accurate composition of the Larrakia people    However  that is not sufficient for the first applicants or the second applicants to succeed in a determination of native title rights and interests in respect of the claim area or parts of it   As quoted above  in Yorta Yorta   the majority at     said          A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a society  usually by word of mouth and common practice  But in the context of the Native Title Act    traditional  carries with it two other elements in its meaning  First  it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions  the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown  It is only those normative rules that are  traditional  laws and customs      Secondly  and no less importantly  the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned  requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed  the traditional laws and customs  is a system that has had a continued existence and vitality since sovereignty  If that normative system has not existed throughout that period  the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist   The first applicants contrast those circumstances  involving interruption in the use or enjoyment of native title rights and interests which may not disqualify the current generation from having those laws and practices regarded as  traditional  from those where there has been an interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of laws and customs  In the latter context  it is contended the laws and customs which are now acknowledged and observed will not have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty  see Yorta Yorta at    Sundberg J in Neowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA   described the contrast in the following way at      When dealing with the  washed away  submission it is important to bear in mind that if what is asserted is a change or adaptation of traditional law or custom  the question is whether that change is of such a kind that it can no longer be said that the rights or interests asserted are possessed under the traditional laws and customs of the Aboriginal people at sovereignty  If what is asserted is that there has been an interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of the law or custom  the question is whether that interruption is  substantial  or whether the acknowledgment and observance has continued  substantially uninterrupted  Yorta Yorta at   and     I am mindful that ultimately the court must simply apply the provisions of s   of the NT Act  Interruption of the enjoyment or exercise of native title rights and interests in a particular geographical area will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim  Nor will change of itself necessarily have that effect  The significance of change to  or adaptation of  traditional law or custom in particular circumstances may present difficult questions as to whether the current law and custom is still  traditional  as used in s  a  and as discussed  for example  in Yorta Yorta   In that case  the majority also pointed out at   that interruption of use or enjoyment of native title rights or interests may be significant in determining whether those rights and interests now possessed are possessed under  traditional  laws and customs  That is why the observance and acknowledgment of the pre sovereignty laws and customs should be shown to have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty  In Yorta Yorta the majority at     said     Yet again  however  it is important to bear steadily in mind that the rights and interests which are said now to be possessed must nonetheless be rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the peoples in question  Further  the connection which the peoples concerned have with the land or waters must be shown to be a connection by their traditional laws and customs  For the reasons given earlier   traditional  in this context must be understood to refer to the body of law and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty      For exactly the same reasons  acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty  Were that not so  the laws and customs acknowledged and observed now could not properly be described as the traditional laws and customs of the peoples concerned  That would be so because they would not have been transmitted from generation to generation of the society for which they constituted a normative system giving rise to rights and interests in land as the body of laws and customs which  for each of those generations of that society  was the body of laws and customs which in fact regulated and defined the rights and interests in land as the body of laws and customs which  for each of those generations of that society  was the body of laws and customs which in fact regulated and defined the rights and interests which those people had and could exercise in relation to the land or waters concerned  They would be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe laws and customs of content similar to  perhaps even identical with  those of an earlier and different society      To return to a jurisdprudential analysis  continuity in acknowledgement and observance of the normative rules in which the claimed rights and interests are said to find their foundations before sovereignty is essential because it is the normative quality of those rules which rendered the Crown s radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which now are identified as native title   I have carefully considered the evidence  A combination of circumstances has  in various ways  interrupted or disturbed the presence of the Larrakia people in the Darwin area during several decades of the   th Century in a way that has affected their continued observance of  and enjoyment of  the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia people that existed at sovereignty  A significant circumstance has simply been the development of Darwin into a substantial community  following European settlement  As the evidence shows  that process has involved many other Aboriginal people than the Larrakia people moving into the Darwin area  The other circumstances are discussed above  It is not necessary to repeat them  Some are the consequence of natural or external events  Some are the consequence of governmental policy  It is not the function of the Court to form or express any views about the wisdom or appropriateness of the circumstances which flowed from or followed governmental policy  Its function is to determine the issues of fact which s   of the NT Act requires  In that  the Court must apply s   as explained by the High Court   There was evidence from the observations of Spencer in his  Preliminary Report on Aboriginals of the Northern Territory  early in the   th Century that the practice of Larrakia traditional laws and customs in the Darwin area was waning  He apparently attributed that to the racially mixed community there  naming Asiatics in particular  The evidence also shows other groups of Aboriginal persons were also part of the Darwin community by then  Other evidence of the time indicated a more thriving community with those laws and customs  Subsequent material suggests Spencer was correct  It is not necessary to decide if his more extreme view that the Larrakia people had by then already  lost all their old customs and beliefs  was correct  I think it was likely to have been  at the time  an overstatement   I have therefore reached the conclusion that the Larrakia people  that is the present society comprising the Larrakia people  do not now have rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the Larrakia people at sovereignty  That is because I do not find that their current laws and customs are  traditional  in the sense explained in Yorta Yorta    There is considerable ambiguity  and some inconsistency  about the current laws and customs of the Larrakia people which I have discussed in my findings when considering the evidence  There are also in my view significant changes in those laws and customs from those which existed at sovereignty  Again  I have discussed my findings when considering the evidence  Those differences and changes stem from  and are caused by  a combination of the historical events which occurred during the   th Century  Those events have given rise to a substantial interruption in the practice of the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia people as they existed at sovereignty and at settlement  so that their practise and enjoyment has not continued since sovereignty  I find that the present laws and customs of the Larrakia people are not simply an adaptation or evolution of the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia people in response to economic  environmental and historical and other changes   In my judgment  the present laws and customs of the Larrakia people reflect a sincere and intense desire to re establish those traditional laws and customs adapted to the modern context  These are the consequence of significant efforts on the part of many to achieve that result  It is an entirely proper objective  It is apparent that the process is enriching the lives of the Larrakia people  and of the Darwin community  That  however  is not a sufficient factual foundation for making a determination of native title rights and interests in this proceeding   In view of that conclusion  I shall refer to the requirements of s  c  only briefly  The common law is not the source of the relevant rights and interest  if they were found to exist   Recognition  by the common law of such rights and interests requires that they be capable of enforcement or protection by remedies available in appropriate courts in Australia  and so excludes any particular rights or interests which are repugnant to the fundamental principles underlying the common law  see Ward at     Yorta Yorta at    Those rights and interests must have survived the fundamental change in the legal regime which occurred at sovereignty so that they can be enforced  if necessary  under the common law  They must also be capable of being expressed with sufficient precision to be enforceable by the courts   Had the first applicants or the second applicants established an entitlement to a determination of native title in terms of the proposed determination of the first applicants  or in similar terms  I would have had no difficulty in finding that the rights and interests to which it refers are not repugnant to fundamental principles underlying the common law  There is no particular reason to conclude to the contrary  Any determination would  of course  have had to describe the rights and interests with precision  so that they could be enforced or protected  I have no doubt that could be done in terms which reflect the rights and interests which existed at sovereignty  That may have required some alteration to the first applicants  proposed determination  It could  I am sure  have been done effectively   Subject to addressing issues of extinguishment  and to being satisfied of occupation at the time of the various applications now consolidated into the current proceeding as required by ss  A c  and  B c  I would conclude that the rights and interests claimed do meet the requirement of s  c   The respondents did not make a firm submission to the contrary   For the reasons given  in my judgment the application must be dismissed  I think that is a consequence of the application of s  a  and  b  of the NT Act to the facts as I have found them to be  It is a conclusion which is not intended to  and should not  be seen as meaning that the Larrakia people do not presently exist as a society in the Darwin area with a structure of rules and practices directing their affairs  They clearly do  My conclusion is based upon the finding that  by reason of past events  those rules and practices are not  traditional  in the sense required by s  a  and as explained by the High Court  particularly in Yorta Yorta    I certify that the preceding nine hundred and thirty eight   numbered

Gummow and Hayne JJ   Jango v Northern Territory of Australia  No     FCA     Jango   addressed the same issues  In that case  certain expert anthropologists  reports were the subject of in excess of   objections by the respondents  Sackville J observed at   that it was apparent that the reports had been  prepared with scant regard for the requirements of the  Evidence Act   His Honour cited the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Yarmirr   where their Honours noted at   that an expert anthropological report had been received in evidence in that case without proof and without objection      despite it being a document which was in part intended as evidence of historical and other facts  in part intended as evidence of expert opinions the authors held on certain subjects  and in part a document advocating the claimants  case  Although it was not suggested that the mixing of these disparate elements  without any evident delineation between them  ultimately led to any insuperable difficulty in this case  it is a practice which has obvious difficulties and dangers   His Honour then discussed the submission that it had become common for parties to rely on  discursive expert reports  prepared without assistance from lawyers  a practice which has its genesis in preparation of claims under the ALR Act  He pointed out that claims under the ALR Act were not subject to the rules of evidence in contrast to s   of the NT Act  Consequently  his Honour observed at   that any such practice      should have ceased with the enactment of the new s         Certainly  the practice of tendering a report containing undifferentiated statements of facts  expressions of opinion and advocacy of a claimants  case should not have survived the observations of the High Court in Commonwealth v Yarmirr   AFANT  in addition to adopting the Territory s submission on extinguishment  made submissions about tidal waters in the claim area  It contends that the public right to fish and to navigate in tidal waters  discussed in Yarmirr at   and   meant that the first applicants could no longer properly maintain a right to exclude from the tidal waters all but those exercising those public rights  Whether such a claimed right may be available is a matter of doubt  see the High Court in Ward at   Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia  No     FCA     Gumana v

provided for   In Bodney v State of Western Australia   FCA     Bodney   before Wilcox J  the parties accepted the adoption of the approach in Quall v Risk   The Full Court in Bodney v Bropho     FCR   did not find it necessary to determine this issue because the parties had accepted the approach in Quall v Risk   see the judgments of Spender J at   Branson J at   and Stone J at     Emmett J in Wharton on behalf of the Kooma People v State of Queensland   FCA     Wharton   considered O Loughlin J s decision in Quall v Risk in the context of a notice of motion to strike out a native title determination application under s  C of the NT Act  His Honour drew attention to item   of Sch   to the amending Act which provided as follows     Section  C of the new Act applies where the main application mentioned in that section was made either before or after the commencement of that section  If the main application was made before the commencement  the reference in that section to section   or section   is a reference to section   or section   of the old Act   The decision in Wharton was the subject of an application for leave to appeal to the Full Court  which comprised Ryan  Finn and North JJ  Branfield v Wharton   FCAFC    The application was refused  Their Honours were prepared to assume the existence of the principle said to be established by Quall v Risk for the purposes of the application  However  at   their Honours found that the applicants had not established any error made by Emmett J in the application of the principle   Before the Full Court in Wharton   the State of Queensland argued that Quall v Risk was wrongly decided  and that an application under s  C of the NT Act in respect of an application for a determination of native title commenced before the amending Act was to be considered under the old s   whether or not there were amendments made to the application after the commencement of the amending Act  The Full Court found that it was unnecessary to decide this point  and that  c onsideration of that argument should await a case in which its determination is required by the facts of the case  at     On that state of the authorities  in my view I should follow the approach in Quall v Risk   It is a decision of some years  standing  and has been followed in a number of subsequent single judge decisions  Counsel for the first applicant did not contend that it is clearly wrong  Consequently  the next step is to determine whether the requirements of the new s   were fulfilled in relation to the applications comprised in the consolidated proceedings   As noted above  s   requires that a person who makes an application for a native title determination be  authorised by all the persons  the native title claim group   who  according to their traditional laws and customs  hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed        Authorised  is defined in s  B as follows     For the purposes of this Act  all the persons in a native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application or a compensation application  and to deal with matters arising in relation to it  if       a  where there is a process of decision making that  under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group  must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process  or    b  where there is no such process the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision making agreed to and adopted  by the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group  in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters  or in relation to doing things of that kind   The requirement that  all  persons of the group are to authorise the applicant to make the application does not mean that every single person must give their authorisation  In Lawson v Minister for Land and Water Conservation  NSW    FCA   at     Stone J held that s  B a  and  b  provide the means by which  all the persons in a native title claim  are taken to have given their authorisation  Similarly  O Loughlin J in Quall v Risk at   held that  all  cannot mean every member of the group  Further  there is no prescribed procedure in the NT Act by which each member of the group authorises an applicant to bring an application  indicating that as long as a decision making process is adhered to as outlined in s  B  the authorisation will be valid referred toDieri People v State of South

was sufficient to indicate that the decisions were made pursuant to traditional laws and customs  at     The issue of authorisation in the current proceedings was not pleaded by the applicants nor by the respondents  It is therefore not surprising that so little evidence was led in relation to this evidence  Indeed  the only evidence led was that of Mr Risk   The issue emerged in essence during final submissions  It was thoroughly canvassed in the Territory s written submissions  There was no attempt by counsel for the first applicants to bring the authorisation within s  B b  of the Act

the regime under Div  B of Pt   of the NT Act  and the transitional provisions dealing with them  I do not consider that the decision of the Full Court in State of Western Australia v Strickland   FCA

FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is agreed between the parties that the Crown acquired sovereignty over the Northern Territory in   and that the first European settlement in the Darwin region was in    The date of sovereignty results from the extension of the boundary of the Colony of New South Wales to the meridian of   o east longitude from the meridian of   o east longitude by Letters Patent issued to Governor Darling and dated   July   see the discussion in Hayes v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR   at   per Olney J   In the First Applicants  Amended Points of Claim  filed   August   the first applicants plead the following      Prior inhabitants          Aboriginal people   prior inhabitants   have inhabited the Larrakia country including the claim area since before non indigenous sovereignty was asserted over  and long before non indigenous settlement first occurred in  Larrakia country                 The following facts and matters are relied on to establish such prior inhabitancy                 a  archaeological material at least   years old  and perhaps as much as   years old  is known from the region of the claim area and Larrakia country  Many different types of sites are known  with artefact scatters and middens being the most common  Many thousands of sites exist within Larrakia country  These sites are found throughout the region but are concentrated on coastal and riverine zones  The archaeological material shows that during the last few thousand years the foraging economy of the occupants of Larrakia country changed as people exploited marine molluscs less intensively and switched focus of their food gathering in wetland areas  The archaeological material is consistent with Aboriginal occupation of the area by a single group that changed its economic practices throughout the   years recorded and developed into the Larrakia as observed historically  Ethnographic and historical observations are largely congruent with the kinds of archaeological patterns that have been documented  The targeting of resources and the focus of occupation  between prehistoric and historic periods suggests continuity of lifestyle     b  a survey of the historical attestations of the Larrakia language and a review of the phonology  grammar and vocabulary of Larrakia language in order to explore the historical relations between Larrakia and other languages leads to the conclusion that Larrakia is likely to have developed over a number of millennia in its most recent location     c  the Darwin area was occupied by an Aboriginal people in organised society in   and in      d  the first recorded interactions between Aboriginal people and Europeans in the immediate Darwin area was made in   some   years after the inclusion of the Northern Territory in the colony of New South Wales involved  on the part of Europeans  John Lort Stokes  Attestations by Stokes of the language of the Aboriginal people he met are more similar to Larrakia than to any other known language of the area  Permanent European occupation of the Darwin area did not occur until    Prior to this there was very little European activity in the Darwin area  The historical record created between    sic  and   consistently recognises Larrakia people as belonging to the Darwin region because of their prior occupation of that area  The historical record demonstrates that from   non Aboriginal people continued to recognise Larrakia rights in the Darwin area  Between   and   and to the present day the historical record contains references to Larrakia assertions of traditional rights within the Darwin area     e  the historical record  the genealogical record  and the oral history of the Larrakia attest to the ancestral connection between the members of the Larrakia claim group and the Aboriginal people in occupation of the claim area in   and    f  the traditional connection of the Larrakia with the claim area  and the native title rights and interests they assert  were inherited from their ancestors in accordance with traditional laws and customs   Archaeological evidence was provided by Dr Hiscock  a Senior Lecturer and Head of Archaeology at the Australian National University in Canberra   The dispute in submissions was about what amounts to occupation of the area  The Territory pointed out that neither s  A c  nor s  B c  refer to occupation of part only of the relevant area  In Western Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR   at     it was said by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in the context of s  A that a broad view should be taken of the word  occupy  so that it would be satisfied by use of the land for the reserved purpose  as and when that person wishes to do so  even if the person is rarely present on the land  Essential elements of occupation  according to that decision  are some occasional physical presence on the land  for s  A some relevant usage of the land in accordance with the grant  or for s  B some relevant usage of it consistent with  the way of life  habits  customs and usages of the group   per Olney J in Hayes v Northern Territory     FCR   at   and that the activity be permitted  The single judge decisions in Rubibi Community v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   at     Passi on behalf of the Meriam People v Queensland   FCA   at     Daniel at   and Neowarra   FCA   are consistent with that view consideredDaniel v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  An historical source document is only as objective as its author  Therefore  it is reasonable that an expert historian would adopt a methodology requiring a critical reading of source documents  In Daniel v State of Western Australia   FCA     Daniel   at   Nicholson J said that it must always be borne in mind that any historical record about Aboriginal people is incomplete  There are  silences  in the historical record  His Honour said that  t he nature of these  silences  and the manner in which they should be addressed is the subject not merely of academic interest  but one that bears directly upon the approach the Court must take in order to interpret the expert and witness evidence  and to derive the inferences that of necessity must be made  in order to decide upon the issues in contention   Nicholson J said that this was particularly so in Daniel   where the records of  police and pastoralists  were  ethnocentric  and where there was a  lack of continuity of anthropological observation of the customs  practices and lifestyles of Aboriginal people  and Europeans generally  including police  pastoralists and Native Welfare officers  did not identify people by tribe or language   Dr Wells in cross examination referred to the issue of silences in the historical record  saying       indigenous history has    changed markedly since the  s and prior to that  history was sort of written as  you know  white fellas came and did this to Aborigines  There was not much said  about      the Aborigines responding or having a part in that process  and so over the last   years historians have tried to understand the part of Aborigines in that process and understand that they were making informed choices and decisions about     how they would react to different aspects of colonisation   In the light of the cross examination  I have come to the view that Dr Wells to a degree adopted a view of historical records which was favourable to the Larrakia claimants  That is not because she was in fact partisan  or was not trying to assist the Court  It was appropriate for her to assess the significance of elements of the historical record  I accept  with respect  what fell from Nicholson J in Daniel   Those observations are equally apt here  But the cross examination exposed a number of instances where the historical record was not silent  and where Dr Wells had taken a view as to its significance which appeared not to be justified by its terms or on occasions which appeared to be inconsistent with its terms  An historian may well regard such an approach as sensible  and as fitting in with a more general thesis supported by other material  All evidence  whether historical or contemporary  is sought to be understood in its context including the context of its author or speaker  However  in this instance  the primary sources which Dr Wells sought to interpret or read  against the grain  were many in number and in a number of instances the reasons for doing so were not persuasive to me  As the respondents submitted  that material on its face was also consistent with  and in some cases indicative of  the alternative thesis that during the middle part of the  s the Larrakia people were not consistently as coherent a society as Dr Wells said the record intended to show  I think that alternative thesis in respect of that period was not as fully considered by Dr Wells as it might have been referred toAllied Interstate  Qld  Pty Limited v Barnes   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Territory challenged Dr Well s reliance on Walsh s report in relation to the land claim at Gundal  on the basis that  since Dr Walsh also co authored the claim book in the first Kenbi Claim  it was self serving evidence  In Allied Interstate  Qld  Pty Limited v Barnes   HCA         CLR   at   Barwick CJ said that the weight of self serving statements is a matter for the Court  Further  Barwick CJ said that while the weight accorded to self serving statements may not always be great  where such a statement is made under exposure of immediate checking and under penalty for falsity it is  impossible not to give it any weight   Dr Walsh as an expert witness was under a duty to the Court  Further  in his report  relied on by Dr Wells  Dr Walsh specified his sources of information  In these circumstances  I propose to give some weight to his report   Due to the construction of the Army barracks at Emery Point  the ceremonies were discontinued at Gundal at some point between   and    A few years later the Kahlin Compound ceased to exist   In Walsh s report  referred to by Dr Wells  Dr Walsh cited a   report to the Administrator by W B Kirkland  the Chief Protector of Aborigines of the time  that the ceremonies had been transferred to a more isolated location on the Cox Peninsula     It was gleaned that ceremonial centres in the vicinity of Darwin had been abandoned for several years and that initiation ceremonies were now conducted some five miles from Darwin  entailing a voyage across the harbour by canoe      followedThe Wandarang  Alawa  Marra and Ngalakan Peoples v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Proceedings before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner do not fall within the descriptions in s  a i   iv   However  consistent with the approach of Olney J in The Wandarang  Alawa  Marra and Ngalakan Peoples v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR   I approach the matter on the basis that the Aboriginal Land Commissioner is  any other person or body  within the meaning of s  a v  of the NT Act  Both the applicants and the Territory accepted that  In accordance with s   I received into evidence extensive transcripts of evidence in the Kenbi Claim   On   June   I made the following order         If a party proposes to apply to the Court for an order pursuant to section   of the Native Title Act that party shall file and serve on or before   August   a note setting out with full and detailed particulars the evidence or the recommendation  finding  decision or judgment that is the subject of the proposed application   Notices were filed and served by both the first applicants and the Territory  The notices have been overtaken by an agreed table of Kenbi Claim transcript  This agreed table of transcript  tendered by consent by the first applicants and the Territory  was received by the Court without objection by any party  The transcript which has been tendered amounts to thousands of pages  and it contains evidence from many of the witnesses called in the current proceedings referred toNorthern Land Council v Olney     FCR   The Kenbi Claim was first lodged in    It was the subject of two separate hearings  one before Justice Olney as the then Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner in      The findings in his Report were set aside by the Federal Court  see Northern Land Council v Olney     FCR    The second hearing was before Justice Gray between   and     There were four separate and competing claim groups  Each sought to be recognised as the traditional owners of the land in question  These groups included the Larrakia group  and the Danggalaba group  There was also the Tommy Lyons group  and the Belyuen group  Unlike the Tommy Lyons and the Danggalaba groups  the Belyuen group does not have any link with  Larrakia  country apart from the Kenbi claim area  It is accepted that the Larrakia group in the current proceedings is the same as in the Kenbi Claim proceedings  Some of the people identified as Danggalaba group members in the Kenbi Claim are among the second applicants in the current proceedings   Although the Kenbi Claim was brought under the ALR Act  evidence presented during its hearings  in particular about the relationship of Aboriginal people to land and waters  is also relevant to the current proceedings   There is no precise correspondence between the proof requirements under the NT Act and those for a claim under the ALR Act  Section   of the ALR Act defines  traditional Aboriginal owners  as including that they be a local descent group of Aboriginals who have common spiritual affiliations  being affiliations that place that group under a primary spiritual responsibility for the particular land  It is a term which does not include all those Aboriginals who may have a traditional right to use or occupy the land  cf s   of the ALR Act  and the discussion by Northrop  Hill and O Loughlin J in Northern Land Council v Olney     FCR   at      The Territory contended that since Justice Gray s findings were made in accordance with the ALR Act  and because they included findings of law or of mixed fact and law  it is not appropriate to adopt them in this matter   Despite its objections to the first applicants  submissions  the Territory in its submissions on connection referred to the findings of Justice Gray in his Summary to the Kenbi Report  paras     and    These findings were as follows     It is well known that Aboriginal societies traditionally impart knowledge to their members progressively  It is clear that the Belyuen group functions in this manner  Its members hold knowledge relating to dreamings and their relationship to sites on the land claimed  The degrees of knowledge held depend upon initiation  age and experience  There is a considerable amount of ceremonial activity  often involving people who do not live at Belyuen  as well as those who do  Some senior people are identified as leaders  Those who have been born with entitlements to knowledge are considered not to have lost those entitlements  even if they have moved away to live  such spiritual affiliations as those persons have acquired by birth as members of the group will remain      So far as most of its members are concerned  the Larrakia group does not have the characteristics of Aboriginal society that have been described  The events which have occurred since the establishment of the first European settlement in   have had drastic effects on the society which once existed among members of the Larrakia language group  To a very great extent  knowledge of dreamings and sites has been lost to Larrakia people  Young people are not routinely initiated into adulthood  Ceremonial activity has ceased  There had not been a consistent spiritual tradition  handed down from generation to generation  among those who are said to constitute that group              At its heart  the case put on behalf of the Larrakia group is that the possession of any Larrakia ancestry entitles a person by birth to all of the spiritual affiliations available in respect of all the dreamings so far as they relate to all of the sites on or near the land claimed  I am unable to accept this argument              With respect to the Larrakia group  the position is much more difficult  There can be no doubt that some members of the Larrakia group have spiritual affiliations to sites on the land claimed  Others have affiliations to the land itself  rather than to specific sites  In my view  the absence of a detailed common tradition of spiritual affiliations with sites  handed down from generation to generation to members of the Larrakia group  has resulted in the development of different spiritual responses on the part of different people  In the absence of such a tradition  it is difficult to make findings as to the nature of the spiritual affiliations  if any  of the many Larrakia group claimants who did not give any evidence  The lack of the regular practice of ceremonial activity related to dreamings and sites  and of the staged acquisition of knowledge in association with that ceremonial activity  has resulted in different members of the Larrakia group having spiritual affiliations that differ essentially in many ways  As such  to attempt to speak of spiritual affiliations which are  common  to the members of the Larrakia group would be unreal   The issue is whether any findings of the Land Rights Commissioner in the Kenbi Report ought be adopted in this matter  in circumstances where that course of action is not consensual discussedPhillips v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Phillips v State of Western Australia   FCA     Carr J was asked to strike out certain applications for a determination of native title over an area of land in Western Australia  A delegate of the Native Title Registrar had previously decided that the applications would not be accepted for registration  The respondent submitted that the Court ought to adopt the delegate s decision pursuant to s  c   His Honour concluded that he would not adopt the earlier findings by the delegate of the Native Title Registrar  However  His Honour said at        In respect of non controversial matters  there might well be a saving of time and resources if the Court were to exercise its discretion to adopt particular findings or decisions of a court person or body of a kind mentioned in s    There might also be cases where that would be an appropriate exercise of the discretion even in contentious matters  That would depend upon the subject matter of the proposed adoption and the circumstances of each case   In the current proceedings  I am inclined not to adopt any of the findings of the Land Rights Commissioner in the Kenbi Report  The Kenbi Claim covered a claim area distinct from that involved in these proceedings  Not all of the witnesses who gave evidence before his Honour were called in these proceedings  for various reasons  The expert evidence was in part from different witnesses  The expert evidence too related to the different issues which arose under the ALR Act  and was in respect of different land  The matters to which those findings relate have also been  to varying degrees  the subject of additional and in some instances different evidence in the current proceedings  Those considerations have led me to the view which I have expressed   I have addressed in part the evidence during the Kenbi Claim in the course of my findings above  I will refer to it further below   It is at this point helpful to discuss the anthropological evidence and the genealogical evidence  It introduces and explains the traditional laws and customs which  the applicants contend  are presently recognised by them and which can be traced back through their preceding generations to the society of Larrakia people which I have found to have existed at sovereignty   I propose then to make findings about the current society of Larrakia people  in particular rights and interests which they claim to possess under the laws and customs observed by them  and by which they have a connection to the land and waters of the claim area  From that point  I will turn to my ultimate findings or conclusions on whether those rights and interestes under those laws and customs are in essence the same as those which existed at sovereignty and whether their acknowledgment and observance has continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty citedDaniel v State of Western

FCA     Harrington Smith    I respectfully adopt those analyses  It is therefore necessary to refer only briefly to its provisions   His Honour observed at       that      the Evidence Act does not  in terms  require  as a condition of admissibility  that an expert witness state distinctly and fully the facts assumed as the basis of his or her opinion  cf ALRC Report No    Evidence  vol   par   Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd     FCR   at     per Branson J  Daniel v State of Western Australia     ALR    RD Nicholson J  at   Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd     IPR   per Branson J at        But expert opinion will not be relevant if there is an insufficient correspondence between all the facts assumed by the expert as the basis for his or her opinion  and those proved or admitted  cf Ramsay v Watson   HCA         CLR   at      Absent that sufficient correspondence  it cannot be known whether the opinion proffered applies to the facts proved or admitted  If I cannot discern in a report  distinguishing between them  the expert s opinion and all facts assumed by the expert on which that opinion is based  I will not be able to be satisfied          that the assumed facts are  to a sufficient degree  the actual facts as I find them to be  to make that opinion  relevant  for the purposes of s   of the Evidence Act  cf Quick at   per Branson J  Sydneywide at   per Branson J  or      perhaps  that the opinion proffered is one substantially based on the expert s specialised knowledge  for the purposes of s   of the Evidence Act  cf Makita at   per Heydon JA        While perhaps it cannot be said that in all cases evidence of expert opinion will be inadmissible if an expert does not separately list all the factual assumptions underlying his or her report  if this is not done  there is a substantial risk that the court will not be able to be satisfied on reading the report  as to what they were  with the result that the opinion will be inadmissible  If the expert does not state and distinguish between all the factual assumptions underlying the opinion and the opinion itself  can I be satisfied that the two criteria of admissibility mentioned are met    Nicholson J discussed the specialised knowledge of anthropologists in Daniel v State of Western Australia     ALR   at      The specialised knowledge of an anthropologist derives from the function to be performed by the anthropologist and for which he or she is trained and in relation to which study has been undertaken and experience gained   Anthropology  is the science of humankind  in the widest sense  The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary  p    Cultural or social anthropology is the science of human social and cultural behaviour and its development  Socio cultural anthropology is traditionally divided into ethnography and ethnology  The former is the primary  data gathering part of socio cultural anthropology  that is  field work in a given society  This involves the study of everyday behaviour  normal social life  economic activities  relationships with relatives and in laws  relationship to any wider nation state  rituals and ceremonial behaviour and notions of appropriate social behaviour  See C P Kottak  Anthropology  the Exploration of Human Diversity    rd ed    p    It is apparent that an anthropologist carrying out field work is more than likely to speak to a wide range of persons in the people under examination  discussedHarrington Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The relevant provisions of the Evidence Act have been analysed in cases such as Daniel v State of Western Australia     ALR   Neowarra and in Harrington Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia  No     FCA     Harrington Smith    I respectfully adopt those analyses  It is therefore necessary to refer only briefly to its provisions   In Harrington Smith Lindgren J outlined at   what must be shown to establish the admissibility of evidence of expert opinion     a  that the opinion is relevant  including that the field of knowledge is one in which expert opinion can properly be called  see Cross on Evidence  Australian ed  at     Evidence Act ss            b  that the person put forward as an expert possesses specialised knowledge in that field   Evidence Act s        d  that the specialised knowledge is based on the person s training  study or experience   Evidence Act s    and    e  that the particular opinion tendered is based on the specialised knowledge   Evidence Act s       In both Harrington Smith and in Jango   the expert anthropology reports were criticised  inter alia  on the basis that they did not  distinguish between the facts upon which opinions  were  presumably based and the opinions themselves   I share with Lindgren J the view  as he expressed in Harrington Smith at   that there are  great practical differences  between experts reports from different disciplines  His Honour said that      Admittedly  there are great practical differences in the present respect between  for example  Makita   an appeal concerned with a report of expert opinion given by a  physicist who specialised in the investigation of slipping accidents      in relation to the slipperiness of a stair  and a case such as the present one  concerned with reports of opinions given by historians and anthropologists in relation to the more complex question whether there are communal  group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples in relation to land or waters  where the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the Aboriginal peoples  and they  by those laws and customs  have a connection with the land or waters     Underlying his Honour s statement is the notion that science and mathematics are exact disciplines  whereas the disciplines of anthropology  humanity  much of economics  and history are not  There is a longer list which could be created  In most if not all disciplines  opinion is formed by reasoning drawn from a group of  facts   The facts may be drawn from a scientific experiment  historical documents or a series of conversations held with members of a native title claimant group  However   facts  themselves have varying degrees of primacy or subjectiveness  Some facts are now  in reality  and despite the deconstructionists  incontrovertible  Our communication systems make them so  the use of numbers in measurement is a clear example  Some are obviously more subjectively perceived  estimates  descriptions of persons or events  and the like  the explanations of Dr Wells for the significance she attributed to many contemporary records provides examples   Some are complex and themselves involve judgment  In the realm of expert evidence  the primary data upon which an opinion is based may comprise a mixture of primary and more complex facts  The opinion may then be further based upon an interpretation  sometimes requiring expertise  of those facts and that stage may require an exercise of judgment  sometimes fine judgment  by the person concerned   This is not the occasion to dilate at length upon such matters  That is better left to others  The important thing in any expert s report  in my view  is that the intellectual processes of the expert can be readily exposed  That involves identifying in a transparent way what are the primary facts assumed or understood  It also involves making the process of reasoning transparent  and where there are premises upon which the reasoning depends  identifying them  An understanding of the nature of the judicial process in addressing expert evidence would readily recognise the need for the expert s report to communicate those matters to the court   The premises  whether based on primary facts or on other material  then need to be established  Their ready identification ensures that the means of satisfaction whether by proof of primary facts or in some other way can be addressed by the party relying upon that expert opinion  generally by the legal representations discussedJango v Northern Territory of Australia  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Jango v Northern Territory of Australia  No     FCA     Jango   addressed the same issues  In that case  certain expert anthropologists  reports were the subject of in excess of   objections by the respondents  Sackville J observed at   that it was apparent that the reports had been  prepared with scant regard for the requirements of the  Evidence Act   His Honour cited the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Yarmirr   where their Honours noted at   that an expert anthropological report had been received in evidence in that case without proof and without objection      despite it being a document which was in part intended as evidence of historical and other facts  in part intended as evidence of expert opinions the authors held on certain subjects  and in part a document advocating the claimants  case  Although it was not suggested that the mixing of these disparate elements  without any evident delineation between them  ultimately led to any insuperable difficulty in this case  it is a practice which has obvious difficulties and dangers   In relation to a particular expert anthropology report before the Court in Jango Justice Sackville said at   that it did not      clearly expose the reasoning leading to the opinions arrived at by the authors  Nor does it distinguish between the facts upon which opinions are presumably based and the opinions themselves  Indeed  it is often difficult to discern whether the authors are advancing factual propositions  assuming the existence of particular facts  or expressing their own opinions  Certainly the basis on which the authors have reached particular conclusions is often either unstated or unclear   In Makita  Australia  Pty Ltd v Sprowles   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     Heydon JA confirmed the existence in common law of the  basic principle   This  basic principle  or  basic rule  was expressed by Sackville J in Jango as requiring an expert opinion to be  based on facts stated by the expert and either proved by the expert or assumed by him or her and proved aliunde   at    Section   of the Evidence Act does not import the  basis rule  Neowarra at   per Sundberg J  However  Sundberg J said that despite this      an expert should nevertheless differentiate between the facts on which the opinion is based and the opinion in question  so that it is possible for the court to determine whether the opinion is wholly or substantially based on the expert s specialised knowledge which in turn is based on training  study or experience   In both Harrington Smith and in Jango

Western Australia     ALR   Expert anthropological evidence serves to provide a framework within which the primary evidence of Aboriginal witnesses can be considered  Lee J in Ward v State of Western Australia     ALR     Ward   first instance  at    As I said in The Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Warumungu  Wakay Native Title Claim Group v Northern Territory     ALR     Alyawarr   at      Not only may anthropological evidence observe and record matters relevant to informing the court as to the social organisation of an applicant claim group  and as to the nature and content of their traditional laws and traditional customs  but by reference to other material including historical literature and anthropological material  the anthropologists may compare that social organisation with the nature and content of the traditional laws and traditional customs of their ancestors and to interpret the similarities or differences  And there may also be circumstances in which an anthropological expert may give evidence about the meaning and significance of what Aboriginal witnesses say and do  so as to explain or render coherent matters which  on their face  may be incomplete or unclear   In relation to genealogies  Lee J in Ward   first instance at   said that their preparation     involved distilling information from a broad context of ethnographic material and it involved the application of skill and expertise of anthropologists      The charts as received in evidence were not restricted to the expression of opinion by anthropologists but were also evidence as to the truth of the statements contained therein  Genealogies duly prepared by anthropologists employing their specialised skill and understanding of the structure and culture of a society represent not only an appropriate field of expert evidence but also a record of statements made to the anthropologists  the record of which is likely to be reliable  the statements made being appropriate to be admitted in a case of this nature   In the current matter  Mr Graham gave evidence to the effect that in preparing his report  he had performed fieldwork with various members of the Larrakia group  as well as

Perry  No       SASR     Perry   at   Cox J discussed different types scientific opinions  Firstly  his Honour gave the example of opinion evidence from a psychiatrist  in relation to the diagnosis of a mental condition  and a pathologist  in relation to a person s cause of death  His Honour said about this type of evidence that  much depends on the expert s judgments and it is recognised that the views of informed persons on such matters may reasonably differ   Justice Cox compared this type of scientific evidence with evidence from an expert analytical chemist  His Honour said that where a reliable method requiring little independent judgment was used to measure the level of arsenic in a person s blood  any statement regarding the presence or absence of arsenic was to be regarded as a statement of fact   At least in the context of expert anthropological reports  the line between an opinion and the fact upon which that opinion is based is not always clear  This is especially the case because expert anthropology reports often rely on hearsay evidence from members of the tribe itself  Judgments are made by the anthropologist about the significance of such evidence  In Milirrpum

persons form the basis of conclusions in clinical medicine and in anthropology   It is trite that Australian indigenous cultures have a distinctly oral tradition  rather than one based on documentary

   FCR   a case involving the expert evidence of a  qualified accountant and registered auditor with extensive experience as an insolvency practitioner  Branson J said at   that  T he distinction between evidence of  fact  and evidence of  opinion  assumes a dichotomy which is not always easy to draw   Her Honour also referred to ALRC Report No    Vol   para   where the decision of Cox J in Perry is considered followedNeowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The general purpose of genealogies as evidence in native title determination applications is to establish a link between the current claimants and previous inhabitants of the claim area  In an ideal world  genealogies would allow claimants to establish links with the inhabitants of the claim area at the time of sovereignty  However  due to a number of reasons including population decline  the oral nature of Aboriginal tradition  and the frailty of human memory  this is not always possible  In Neowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA   at     Sundberg J held that      I nsofar as ancestors of the claimants cannot be traced back to sovereignty   it is reasonable to infer that there have been no intervening events between   and the time of the birth of the known ancestors of the applicants that stand in the way of a conclusion that the claimants of today are the descendants of the Aboriginal people present on the claim area  at sovereignty      See also Mason v Tritton     NSWLR   at     and Alyawarr at     Both Dr Walsh and Mr Graham gave evidence in relation to genealogies  Dr Walsh prepared the principal report and genealogies  which were checked and updated under the supervision of Mr Graham   Dr Walsh s curriculum vitae  detailing his qualifications and experience  was tendered as an exhibit  He has a PhD in Linguistics and is a Senior Lecturer in Linguistics at the University of Sydney  He has experience with this native title claim group spanning three decades  having been one of the co authors of the Kenbi Claim Book  I am satisfied that he is qualified to give the expert evidence he has provided to the Court   The first applicants responded that it was essentially of little weight whether the use of kinship terms and the language of such terms  was consistent or otherwise  This was because  it was submitted  the general purpose behind the kinship system was fulfilled regardless of any inconsistency  The Court s attention was drawn to Neowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA     where Sundberg J at   quoted an expert anthropologist as saying that purpose of kinship was to make  biological links meaningful  culturally   The first applicants submitted that the Larrakia people s use of kinship terminology fulfilled this purpose  because what is consistent is the presence of  classificatory nomenclature which uses terms that primarily refer to lineal relatives to refer also to collateral relatives   The use of the kinship terminology  to quote the submission  fulfilled its purpose by  includ ing  in a close network  people who would otherwise be only distantly related  if at all   Some Larrakia people now practice and recognise requirements and prohibitions concerning relationships  Primary evidence was led in relation to an avoidance requirement for relationships between brothers and sisters  as well as avoidance rules for mothers in law and sons in law  For example  Lorraine Williams and Anne Risk gave evidence about the brother sister rule  whilst Maureen Ogden gave evidence in relation to the mother in law son in law rule  The Territory noted in its submissions that the only witnesses to give evidence about the latter rule were members of the Williams family   The Territory also points to an inconsistency of application of avoidance rules  There were anomalies in the evidence as to whether  for example saying the name of a brother sister was prohibited  or whether speaking directly to that person was prohibited  There was evidence that some witnesses had only been informed of the avoidance rule in the last few years  The rule is neither universally nor consistently practised  Certain witnesses gave evidence that they were prohibited from saying the name of their sibling  because of the avoidance rule  only to use that same name in the context of other evidence   The first applicants contrast those circumstances  involving interruption in the use or enjoyment of native title rights and interests which may not disqualify the current generation from having those laws and practices regarded as  traditional  from those where there has been an interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of laws and customs  In the latter context  it is contended the laws and customs which are now acknowledged and observed will not have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty  see Yorta Yorta at    Sundberg J in Neowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA   described the contrast in the following way at      When dealing with the  washed away  submission it is important to bear in mind that if what is asserted is a change or adaptation of traditional law or custom  the question is whether that change is of such a kind that it can no longer be said that the rights or interests asserted are possessed under the traditional laws and customs of the Aboriginal people at sovereignty  If what is asserted is that there has been an interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of the law or custom  the question is whether that interruption is  substantial  or whether the acknowledgment and observance has continued  substantially uninterrupted  Yorta Yorta at   and     Section  A must use the word the  area  consistently  The area required to be occupied must therefore be the area held expressly for the benefit of the particular Aboriginal group under the relevant grant  It was referred to in submissions as the  particular land administration area   The common position on that issue  at least in respect of s  A  follows the observations of Sundberg J in Neowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA   at      The identification of the  area  for the purposes of s  B is more elusive than under s  A  simply because it is described in an exclusory rather than an inclusory way  In Neowarra   FCA   Sundberg J at   said that      in such a case as the present it means the particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that  but for the section  native title rights would be extinguished      I respectfully agree   It is the nature of the extinguishing act or acts which informs the identification of the area or areas within the claim area upon which s  B  if otherwise applicable  may operate  It is not the claim area itself  although in certain circumstances the claim area and the  area  to which s  B refers may entirely overlap  The finding about whether that  area  was occupied at the time of the relevant application then becomes a matter of fact to be determined upon the whole of the evidence   The dispute in submissions was about what amounts to occupation of the area  The Territory pointed out that neither s  A c  nor s  B c  refer to occupation of part only of the relevant area  In Western Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR   at     it was said by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in the context of s  A that a broad view should be taken of the word  occupy  so that it would be satisfied by use of the land for the reserved purpose  as and when that person wishes to do so  even if the person is rarely present on the land  Essential elements of occupation  according to that decision  are some occasional physical presence on the land  for s  A some relevant usage of the land in accordance with the grant  or for s  B some relevant usage of it consistent with  the way of life  habits  customs and usages of the group   per Olney J in Hayes v Northern Territory     FCR   at   and that the activity be permitted  The single judge decisions in Rubibi Community v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   at     Passi on behalf of the Meriam People v Queensland   FCA   at     Daniel at   and Neowarra   FCA   are consistent with that view   That is the view taken at first instance by several judges of the Court  Nicholson J in Daniel at   and   and Sundberg J in Neowarra   FCA   at   and   applied s  A and s  B in circumstances where the application preceded the enactment of those sections  I did the same in Alyawarr at    In none of those cases did the issue of intervening grants apparently arise consideredWestern Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It was accepted by the Territory that certain witnesses gave evidence that their current hunting and fishing practices are motivated not only by a  desire for sustenance  but also by a desire to maintain a connection with the land and their ancestors  Western Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR   at     Patrick Briston  Bill Risk  Keith Risk  Eric Fejo  Morris Fejo and Lorna Talbot  in the Kenbi Claim  all gave evidence to this effect  Roque Lee explained that he goes hunting and fishing in the Darwin area  for personal satisfaction  because I enjoy that sort of thing  but it s also looking after Larrakia country  it s keeping in touch with all the places that I used to go to  that I know of  and basically looking after country  as in checking on it and just going to the places   The Territory submitted that a system of hunting  fishing and foraging activities  as a way of  looking after country  has arisen to fill the absence of a system based on spiritual connection to country  It was submitted that this system is so different to the pre sovereignty system that it  cannot be considered to be part of a system of  traditional laws and customs  which connect Larrakia people to the claim area    The DCC also highlighted the evidence of other witnesses  who said that they participated in hunting  foraging and fishing activities for sustenance and enjoyment  so supporting the notion that the desire to maintain a connection to country was a recent phenomenon  The first applicants rejected this position  stating that  to be motivated to use one s country by the need for sustenance clearly involves  connection  under the system of law and custom that entitles you to regard country as your own   The dispute in submissions was about what amounts to occupation of the area  The Territory pointed out that neither s  A c  nor s  B c  refer to occupation of part only of the relevant area  In Western Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR   at     it was said by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in the context

rarely present on the land  Essential elements of occupation  according to that decision  are some occasional physical presence on the land  for s  A some relevant usage of the land in accordance with the grant  or for s  B some relevant usage of it consistent with  the way of life  habits  customs and usages of the group   per Olney J in Hayes v Northern Territory     FCR   at   and that the

Neowarra   FCA   are consistent with that view referred toDe Rose v South Australia  No     FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first applicants in their submission accepted that s  a  of the NT Act requires that the laws and customs of the present society should have been passed from generation to generation of the society from sovereignty  and that they exist under a normative system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty  They point out that change in laws and customs does not necessarily mean that they are no longer  traditional   They may be modified and adapted in response to changing environmental  economic or other circumstances  but nevertheless preserve the link which gives them their  traditional  character  There may be circumstances in which their exercise in a particular geographical area may be interrupted  but not in a way which destroys their character as  traditional  see e g  De Rose v South Australia  No     FCAFC         FCR   citedGerhardy v Brown   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Hence  subject to s  A and s  B of the NT Act  any extinguishment of native title rights and interests at common law before that date continues to be effective  Acts and matters outside the definitions of  previous exclusive possession act  and  previous non exclusive possession act  and which occurred before   October   will retain their force despite the existence of native title and at common law will have effectively extinguished native title  Ward at      That date is the date of commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   the RD Act   Even if the RD Act applies  extinguishing acts after that date may still maintain their effectiveness where there is provided an entitlement to compensation in the native title holders  see Ward at   Gerhardy v Brown   HCA         CLR   at    Sections  A and  B provide for certain circumstances in which the effect of certain extinguishing acts is to be disregarded  They are further referred to later in these reasons   Extinguishing acts may fall into three categories  legislative or executive acts which simply extinguish native title rights and interest  laws or acts which create rights in third parties which are inconsistent with the continued right to enjoy native title  either wholly or partly  and laws or acts by which the Crown requires full beneficial ownership of land previously subject to native title  Acts in the first category are assessed objectively as to whether they have the purpose of extinguishing native title  The second category requires an assessment of the respective rights and interests under native title and of the third parties under the relevant instruments  Except on matters of general principle  I do not consider it possible to embark upon any detailed consideration of that category as it involves an assumption of the existence of certain native title rights and interests contrary to my earlier conclusion  The third category encompasses either an acquisition of land in which native title rights or interests existed and the assertion by the Crown of rights inconsistent with them  or an acquisition of such land for a purpose or purposes  and the use of the acquired land  inconsistent with the continued enjoyment of native title  The requirement for inconsistency means the third category also is one into which I consider it inappropriate to delve   The respondents have approached extinguishment by first addressing those acts which  they claim  wholly extinguish native title over some or all of the claim area  They then address acts said to partially extinguish native title  The third step is to address acts which  it is argued  cannot be disregarded by s  B of the NT Act  This final grouping includes public works which are said to extinguish native title followedRubibi Community v Western Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii

authorisation acknowledges  the communal character of traditional law and custom which grounds native title  It is not a condition to be met by formulaic statements in or in support of applications  Strickland v Native Title Registrar     ALR   at     approved by the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland   FCA         FCR   at   and cited in Daniel v WA at     In my view  there is no clear indication that s  A and s  B were intended to have a retrospective effect  The introduction of legislation intended to have that effect is likely to have been specifically remarked upon in the transitional provisions  That is more clearly so when the amending Act introduced extensive other amendments which included the regime under Div  B of Pt   of the NT Act  and the transitional provisions dealing with them  I do not consider that the decision of the Full Court in State of Western Australia v Strickland   FCA   directs a different result  It concerned the Native Title Registrar s obligations under s  C of the NT Act in respect of the registration of a second claim over the same area  The context and purpose of the provision is quite different  The decision did not involve the potential alteration of established rights and interests retrospectively referred toErubam Le  Darnley Islanders    v State of Queensland   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In my view  a  prior interest  must be one created before the making of the application  That is the meaning to be derived from the context  Both s  A  and s  B  dictate their application by reference to circumstances at the date when the relevant application was made  It would follow that their effect  if they apply  is to operate at the same point in time  Both s  A  and s  B  have as their introductory words  f or all purposes under this Act in relation to the application       Those words further point to the extinguishing effect of those sections applying to interests which arose before the date of the application  In addition  as s  b  refers to  any other  prior interest  the interest referred to in s  a  may also inform the meaning of  prior  it does so by identifying an interest which must have existed before the application was made  I do not see anything in the decision in Erubam Le  Darnley Islanders    v State of Queensland   FCAFC         FCR     Erubam Le   to the contrary   I do not consider that s  B  leads to any different conclusion  It preserves the validity of the creation of any prior interest  or the interest of the Crown in any public works  It does not thereby tend to support the view that s  B generally applies to interests created after the application was made and before   September    The contrary would appear to be the case by reason of the use of the term  prior interest  which  as I have found above  refers to an interest created before the making of the relevant application   The DCC was constituted as a body corporate under s   of the Local Government Ordinance    NT   The Municipality of Darwin was constituted and defined under s   of that Ordinance on   June    The DCC is the municipal council for the Municipality of Darwin   The DCC contended that s  B does not apply within its municipal area  It also contended that  even if s  B did apply  it does not cause the extinguishing effects of public works to be disregarded  It relied on Daniel   and Erubam Le respectively for those propositions  If s  B does not so apply to its municipal area  or to those parts of its municipal area within the proclaimed Towns of Darwin  Sanderson and Nightcliff  any areas within those boundaries which have been subject to a previous exclusive possession act are  it contended  excluded from the application of s  B so that it would not operate in those municipal areas to direct certain extinguishing acts to be disregarded   Section  B b ii  relevantly provides that the section applies only if  at the time of the application  the relevant area was not covered by  a reservation  proclamation     conferred by the Crown     under which the whole or a part of the land or waters in the area is to be used for public purposes or for a particular purpose    The proclamation of the Town of Darwin was made on   June    The Town of Nightcliff was constituted and proclaimed on   March   by proclamation under the Crown Lands Ordinance   and also duly gazetted  The Town of Sanderson was constituted and proclaimed on   June   by proclamation under that Ordinance and duly gazetted  Section   of the Acts

referred toNorthern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Waranungu  Wakaya Native Title Claim Group   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  I have no reason not to follow those decisions  and I do so  They were commented upon with apparent approval by the Full Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Waranungu  Wakaya Native Title Claim Group   FCAFC     Alyawarr FC   at       Proof of occupation is a question of fact  So much is now clear  see Alyawarr FC at    There may therefore be matters of degree to be assessed  more so in relation to s  B  Evidence to prove occupation of the particular land administration area may not be confined to what happens or has happened on that area  The particular administration area may  in a practical sense  be part of a wider area which the claimant group  or some of them  utilise in a way which amounts to occupation of that total area including the particular land administration area  At the other end of the scale  occupation need not involve intensive use of all parts of the particular land administration area  Use of parts of it  whether by residence  visits  use of roads  activities  or in other ways  may reveal occupation of that area even though not every piece of that area has been the subject of such elements  Evidence going to proof of connection may therefore be relevant to proof of particular occupation  but a finding of connection will not necessarily lead to a finding of contemporary occupation at the time of the application   I do not accept that occupation may be simply  rights based   In the case of s  A  the existence of the relevant grant and its terms may be very significant evidence going to occupation  Very little more may be required to take the additional step of being satisfied about occupation  In the case of s  B  there is unlikely to be such an instrument  Underlying s  B is that  in particular circumstances where native title rights and interests existed or would exist but for extinguishment  extinguishment is to be disregarded  On its face  it does not equate the existence of those rights and interests with occupation  Section  B c  is intended to add a further qualifying condition to its operation  Consequently  the fact of there being  if there were  native title rights and interests over a claim area including an area to which s  B might apply would not  in my view  of itself establish occupation  Occupancy involves more than that  Of course  depending upon the relative sizes of the claim area and of the area to which s  B might apply  the evidence going to establish native title rights and interests may also prove occupation in particular circumstances citedBodney v Westralia Airports Corporation Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In view of that conclusion  the further submissions of the Territory focusing upon the definition of  statutory authority  as being  in relation to the Crown in right of the Commonwealth  a State or a Territory  do not need to be addressed  Those words have also led to certain decisions of the Court which have taken the view that certain municipal corporations are not  statutory corporations  as defined  see Bodney v Westralia Airports Corporation Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     Daniel     I note that the definition of  public work  in s   of the NT Act extends to certain works carried out  on behalf of the Crown  or a local government body or other statutory authority of the Crown   The consequence of my conclusion on this issue does not therefore affect the significance of the public works carried out by the DCC   I have indicated above why I have not fully addressed the arguments concerning extinguishment  There are many other matters of principle which have been the subject of submissions  and which have then flowed into the very thorough submissions applying the relevant provisions of the NT Act to
