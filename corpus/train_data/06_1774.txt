Alternatively  Mr Tree submitted that review by the Court was constrained in the same way as courts are upon a review of a taxation of costs  In such a case it is said that the Court will only interfere on an error of principle or  on a matter of discretion   where the taxing officer s discretion appears not to have been exercised at all  or to have been exercised in a manner which is manifestly wrong  and where the question is one of amount only  will do so only in an extreme case  Schweppes  Ltd v Archer     SR  NSW    at     Neither submission should be accepted  The power of

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  ASIC sought information about the progress of the winding up  ASIC was at pains  both in its enquiries and in the present application to the Court  to make it clear that it was not alleging or suspecting wrongdoing by the Liquidator  It may be doubted that ASIC was exercising its power of enquiry under s   of the Corporations Act   It never stated that it was  It has never claimed that the Liquidator  in terms of s  a    had not  faithfully performed his duties  or had not  observed a requirement of the Court or of the Corporations Act or of the regulations or the rules   It did not make the Liquidator aware that it was acting as a result of communications from the Trust until   March    But in any event  there is no question that ASIC had power to act as it did  Rather the point is whether in responding to ASIC s queries the Liquidator was providing the services contemplated by the Winding Up Order  Put another way  was the provision of information to ASIC an incident of the Liquidator acting as such  charged with the responsibility of winding up the Scheme  cf Pantzer v Wenkart   FCAFC         FCR   at      In my opinion  both questions must be answered in the affirmative   In Pantzer the Full Court of this Court upheld a claim for remuneration by a trustee in bankruptcy  In his capacity as a former trustee the appellant had been drawn into litigate to assert a claimed amount which the respondent had not challenged by seeking taxation  Nothing in the judgment of the Full Court would appear to be inconsistent with the conclusion I have reached  Mr Tree was correct in submitting that  i  Pantzer provides no support for an additional requirement that to qualify for remuneration a liquidator s work must also  add value  to the liquidation  and  ii  the present case is stronger in that the Liquidator s work was not just  unavoidable  in a practical sense  albeit for his own benefit  at     he was lawfully compelled by the Winding Up Order to perform it   There will be an order that Barry Keith Hamilton is entitled to be paid by the Solicitors  Trust the sum of      ASIC s application will be dismissed   The parties should file and serve before   am on Wednesday   December   written submissions as to how the costs of this application should be dealt with  The alternatives seem to be that the costs of all parties be paid out of the proceeds of the winding up  or from the Guarantee Fund  or that ASIC and the Trust pay the Liquidator s costs    I certify that the preceding forty

with  hopefully  very unusual circumstances  far removed from the present case  A receiver of a partnership attended at the partnership property  In the course of an argument the defendant fired a

remuneration discussedAustralian Securities and Investment Commission v Atlantic   Financial  Aust  Pty Ltd   QSC  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QSC  html  Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Atlantic   Financial  Aust  Pty Ltd   QSC   involved claims for remuneration by investigating accountants appointed by order of the Supreme Court of Queensland to investigate certain managed investment schemes and report to the Court  Mullins J heard detailed objections to the accountants  claims  One claim disallowed  at   was for attending a meeting with ASIC to explain the report  This was on the basis that the obligation of the accountants was to report to the Court and the subsequent conference with ASIC was a matter for ASIC and  cannot be characterised as part of the supervision required to be undertaken by the accountants or as part of the work in preparing the report   Also disallowed  at   were work undertaken on certain loan schemes when the accountants knew the schemes had already been wound up by the date of their appointment  These were purely questions of fact and provide no analogy to the present case where the Liquidator reported to ASIC  pursuant to his obligations under the Winding up Order  express or implied  as to the progress of the winding up discussedMirror Group Newspapers plc v Maxwell     BCLC   Mirror Group Newspapers plc v Maxwell     BCLC   supports the conclusion I have reached  The Court appointed receivers of the estate of the notorious Robert Maxwell  Questions rose over the remuneration of the receivers  including their costs of time spent in responding to a report of a committee of the House of Commons  the Select Committee on Social Security  The committee had been investigating pension funds  When it became apparent  soon after Mr Maxwell s death  that pension funds of companies associated with Mr Maxwell had been  plundered to the extent of hundred of millions of pounds   at   the committee turned to investigate the receivers and other sets of administrators of the affairs of Mr Maxwell and his companies  The receivers devoted substantial amounts of time and incurred substantial expenditure in dealing with the requirements of the committee  at    They also spent time dealing with enquiries from the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the prosecution of Mr Maxwell s son  Ferris J said  at      These activities are highly unusual ones for receivers to have become involved in  But they would not have arisen but for the fact that the receivers held the office to which the court had appointed them  Moreover the participation of the receivers was not initiated by them  nor was attendance before the select committee and the provision of information to it voluntary in any true sense  because physical  as well as moral  sanctions might have been applied if the receivers had ignored the requests for assistance made by the select committee  My present view is  therefore  that at least the initial response of the receivers to the requirements of the select committee and probably the entirety of their dealings with the Serious Fraud Office were wholly proper  even if also extraordinary  acts done in the course of the receivership  So far as I have residual doubts  these are attributable to the absence of full information about what has been done  In particular I am concerned that a significant part of the time and effort which the receivers have devoted to satisfying the requirements of the select committee may have been attributable to the receivers defending their conduct from criticism rather than merely providing information  If this were the case I would wish to give further consideration to the question whether the cost  whether in the form of remuneration for time spent by the receivers themselves or in disbursements paid to third parties  is properly to be paid out of the estate   The present case is stronger in that the provision of information to ASIC was not extraordinary but rather an obligation expressly required by the Winding Up Order itself and indeed the very sort of obligation one would expect when a winding up occurs on the application of ASIC  Further  given the tenor of ASIC s enquiries  and particularly its letter of   December   the essence of the Liquidator s response was the provision of information  not justification or answers to accusations
