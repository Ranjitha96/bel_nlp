Lindsay Transport Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedState Electricity Commission of Victoria v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The definition of Manufacture related activity   to the extent of pars  a   b  and  c  as substantially extracted above  was described in the joint judgment of Heerey and Merkel JJ  with whom Carr J agreed other than to an extent not here material  in State Electricity Commission of Victoria v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at   at   as follows     Paragraphs  a   b  and  c  of Item   of the Exemptions Act deal with a continuum  The common feature is the application of a process or treatment  Paragraph  a  is concerned with the processing of raw materials prior to the stage of manufacture  whether the processor is or is not to be the manufacturer  Paragraph  b  is concerned with the actual process of manufacture  Again the processor can be the manufacturer or someone else  Paragraph  c  is concerned with a post manufacture stage  But the person who is to market or use the goods has to be the manufacturer  Importantly  the paragraph contains an implicit assumption that bringing goods into a marketable form or condition need not necessarily form part of the process of manufacture of such goods   The Commissioner recorded that Chapter     Glossary of Terms   of the Explanatory Memorandum to the STEC Act employed the term business inputs   though the Commissioner acknowledged that such a term did not appear in that legislation  and pointed out that the Explanatory Memorandum contained the following     Road vehicles of a kind ordinarily used for the transport of persons or the transport or delivery of goods or other property will be excluded from the exemptions for goods for use in mining  primary production  manufacturing  printing and other businesses  unless they are for use exclusively in the exemption user s premises or in going between adjacent premises    So much was said by the Commissioner to be reflected in the abovementioned Item   headed Primary production activities  R    appearing in Sub Chapter     in turn headed Mining and primary production   and also in Item   headed Manufacture related activities  R    appearing in Sub Chapter     in turn headed Manufacturing and industrial etc   Lindsay drew attention to the exclusion provisions of subItem   appearing in the context of Item   in so far as the same is picked up by reference in Item   headed Subcontractors appearing in Sub Chapter     headed Miscellaneous   I will return shortly to the critical operation of Item   in relation to the circumstances postulated by Lindsay as allegedly produced of the operation of Item   critically  and solely  in its favour   It will have been noticed that each of the headings to Items   and   bore the insignia  R  at all material times  in relation to which s   of the STEC Act stipulated as follows      Certain exemption Items available only to registered persons         Goods are not covered by an exemption Item marked  R  unless the exemption user is a registered person at the time specified in the Table in section        Lindsay was not a registered person at any material time  being a matter upon which the Commissioner placed reliance  but as I have already foreshadowed  Lindsay s case at least on the appeal was confined to the operation of Item   upon the footing of its inclusion of reference relevantly and specifically to Item   and upon the further basis that unlike Item   the heading to Item   was not prefixed  R   It was that critical circumstance of legislative drafting which Lindsay contended to have been overlooked or misunderstood by the Tribunal   The Commissioner sought assistance also from State Electricity Commission   from which I have cited earlier the passage at   of the reasons for decision thereof concerning the operation generally of paras  a   b  and  c  of Item    In that case  the Electricity Commissioner as taxpayer used transformers in its business to convert voltage and current so that it could be generated for domestic or industrial consumption  and it sought declaratory relief to the effect that a manufacture related activity was involved by its use of transformers thus to apply a process or treatment within the scope of the subject subItem   expression  A Full Federal Court  Heerey Carr and Merkel JJ  held that neither of pars  a   b  or  c  of subItem   applied in favour of the Commission  In relation to par  c  being that the subject of particular focus in the present dispute  all members of the Full Court agreed that electricity and electrical power constituted goods within Item  c   At   at   of the reasons for joint judgment of Heerey and Merkel JJ  the following further appears     In the context of the Exemptions Act  and in particular Item   the tangible  goods  brought into existence for sale in the present case is electrical energy  Energy is a function of power over time  That is the  Commodit y  of commerce     which is bought and sold  The commodity is electrical energy  rather than electric current having a particular voltage  On this view  a change in current or voltage does not result in the manufacture or production of a different commodity or different goods    Those circumstances are materially removed from the circumstances of this present litigation   The perishable goods in the form of foodstuffs here involved are to be apparently marketed by or on behalf of a manufacturer of the goods   each of them being a primary producer or manufacturer of the goods   or in relation to whom the goods are wholesaler s materials goods within the s   definition of that expression   or otherwise are within the par  c iii  description of qualifying goods within in turn the s   definition of that further expression  Lindsay submitted that in the present context therefore  a  process or treatment to goods    which has the purpose of bringing goods into and keeping goods in a marketable or usable condition  within the purport of subItem  c  need not involve a change in the form  nature or condition of the goods the subject of scrutiny  Lindsay contended rather that it is enough that some action is applied to the goods which results in preserving their marketability or usability in the hands of the manufacturer of the goods  and additionally as here its transportation consignee Lindsay citedCommissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumina Ltd     FCR   In the determination of the issues of construction arising on the appeal  being issues on Lindsay s case related to the operation at least ultimately of Item   headed Subcontractors   it was submitted by Lindsay that a broad and beneficial approach is appropriate  I was referred in that regard to the Full Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumina Ltd and others     FCR   where Burchett J observed generally at   in relation to the then Item   and the then definition of aids to manufacture of the precursor to the present STEC Act  that  the beneficial purpose of the legislation with which this appeal is concerned is as apparent as was that of Div   in the cases to which I have referred    That

legislation citedICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   Further as to Lindsay s case as to non fulfilment of the statutory description of general purpose road vehicle   the Commissioner drew attention nevertheless to dicta of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   where at   Gray J  with whom Kaye J agreed  said     The test for inclusion in this category is that one can stipulate that the primary purpose of the vehicle and its customary use is to transport goods or persons in the course of commercial activity  In applying this test  the concept of  ordinarily used for  equals  whose primary but not necessarily exclusive purpose and customary use is   I say that because in my view the expression  ordinarily used  in the present context cannot be divorced from the concept of the primary purpose for which the vehicle is intended to be used and is in fact customarily used    The Commissioner submitted on that footing that the expression general purpose road vehicle is sufficiently wide as to connote any type of vehicle which travels on the road  provided it is used for the transport of persons or goods  irrespective of the vehicle not being capable of self propulsion  Even if that be so  which in my opinion must be at least doubtful  the submission does not at least readily accommodate the statutory notion of a kind ordinarily used   A consideration of each of the descriptions of the relevant goods of Lindsay  at least when addressed individually  does not satisfactorily fulfil the ordinary or usual notion of vehicle  for instance as appearing in the Oxford and Macquarie dictionaries  nor that of road vehicle   so far as concerns the refrigeration unit and the rigid body in particular  The reefer is however at least more debateable as it potentially falls within the Macquarie Dictionary  Revised Third Edition  definition of vehicle as a  carriage on wheels    The earlier foreshadowed s   of the STEC Act  which is headed Lower level operation of excluded property  and upon which the Commissioner placed reliance  provides as follows  so far as is material        In deciding whether exemption Item              applies  the exemption user cannot rely on               a  the use of the exemption goods  so far as the use relates directly to             i  excluded property  or                              b  the use of other property so far as its use relates directly to                       i  excluded property                          In this section      excluded property means property that is expressly excluded from the exemption Item concerned                   The exceptions or non inclusions thereafter set out refer to Items not here material   The note to Item   which I have earlier substantially reproduced  makes reference of course to s   of the STEC Act which is not readily comprehensible in its scope of application  addressing as it does exemptions or exclusions from excluded property  Before addressing s   I should perhaps observe that at least no aspects of the so called generally excluded property   as exemplified in subss   and   of the STEC Act  are here relevant  referring as the same respectively do to  motor vehicles covered by Item   in Schedule    other than vehicles known as four wheel drive vehicles  or  p roperty    for use mainly for or in connection with the preparation or preservation of food or drink for human consumption  if the preparation or preservation takes place in       i  a retail or catering establishment  or          ii  premises that are occupied in connection with a retail or catering establishment         Section   may therefore be put aside   On the appeal in Hamersley Iron   Lush J  with whom Kaye J agreed  said at      The goods  so identified  are shown by the evidence to have been subjected to a desired change  If a chemical change is sought  the change wrought in the goods is a reduction of variability in the concentration of chemicals throughout the ore  If a change in form  nature or condition is sought  then the goods have been changed in such a way that  if they have not been made marketable  they have at least been made marketable to the better advantage of both seller and buyer  In a word  the change in the goods justifies the application of the word treatment to the mode of producing the change  If it be necessary  it should be held that in the context of item   chemical change is not of the essence of treatment    And further at        Even if the decision on the meaning of  treatment  and the concept of what are the goods be rejected  the individual fragments of mineral are  processed  by the blending because they are  intentionally and usefully  re arranged vis   vis one another     The Commissioner contended that a change in form or nature of the goods was required  but that is inconsistent with  certain English authority decided in       and can be regarded as consistent with such cases as  certain further English authority decided in   and   only if goods the subject of the operation are regarded as a general mass of useful goods together with dirt  waste or impurities  and not the separate individual pieces intended for delivery or sale    Establishing and maintaining a requisite low temperature to foodstuffs  in order to preserve marketability  would seemingly satisfy the present Schedule    ie Item  c  notions above addressed in those authoritative descriptions referred toDavis v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   Section   of the STEC Act stipulates by subsection   that  s ome exemption Items require the exemption goods to be used in a particular way or by a particular person    and in the Table thereafter set out in that section headed Use requirements for Schedule     there appears   inter alia   under the column heading Use requirement that the ground for quoting must be the  intended use by the quoter  maintained  during the whole of the statutory period    The Commissioner pointed out uncontroversially that the operation of the statutory period in the subject circumstances was required by that Table to start at the time when the goods are first applied to a person s own use in Australia  the latter expression reflecting what I have earlier identified as the statutory abbreviation AOU   and to end   years after the time of that first application to the person s own use  However the Commissioner contended controversially that  i t is to be inferred from the objective character of the relevant goods that it was  Lindsay s  intention at the time of purchase  thereof  to use the goods as part of or in conjunction with the road vehicles it used in its business of freight transport  being an intention  borne out by the actual subsequent use made of the goods   I was referred in that regard to the opinion expressed by Hill J in Davis v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   to the effect that the best evidence of purpose will ordinarily be found in the use to which the goods are in fact put by the taxpayer  a principle the applicability whereof was common ground  However that assertion of the Commissioner as to Lindsay s intention understated Lindsay s reasons for purchasing the relevant goods  namely the critical objective of maintaining the temperature  and thereby the condition  of perishable goods in transit   It is appropriate at this point of recording the respective principal submissions of the parties to revert to the threshold theme of the Commissioner s case in relation to the definition contained in s   of the STEC Act of a general purpose road vehicle  and the qualified exclusion by subsection   of each of Items   and   of a general purpose road vehicle   subject to exceptions not here material  The Commissioner s contention was that the words road vehicle are      alone    sufficiently wide to connote any type of vehicle which travels on the road provided it is used for the transport of persons or goods   As will be seen  however  more is required to render that broad contention wholly supportable by the provisions of Schedule   falling for consideration in the present context   The expression  any type of vehicle  is too imprecise as such in the context of the complexity of the STEC Act and Schedule   thereto   The Commissioner drew further attention nevertheless to the following non inclusive definition of parts further appearing in s   of the STEC Act     parts  in relation to road vehicles  includes           a  bodies for those road vehicles  including insulated bodies  tank bodies  and other bodies designed for the transport or delivery of goods or other property of particular kinds               b  underbody hoists  and other equipment or apparatus of a kind ordinarily fitted to road vehicles for use in connection with the transport or delivery of goods or other property by those road vehicles      The Commissioner emphasised in particular the words  insulated bodies  and  apparatus of a kind fitted to road vehicles for use in connection with the transport or delivery of goods    by those road vehicles  asserting that the same would cover the refrigeration unit  Whether however the definition extended to the rigid body or the reefer was not seemingly the subject of specific submission by the Commissioner citedHolland v Jones   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The first basis was that it was unnecessary to adduce evidence to the effect that it is critical to refrigerate temperature sensitive goods in the course of being transported  so much was described by Lindsay as  so generally known that every ordinary person may be reasonably presumed to be aware of it   In my opinion that first asserted basis is soundly conceived on Lindsay s part  I was referred in that regard to the evidentiary principle enunciated in Holland v Jones   HCA         CLR   at   where Isaacs J  with whose reasons Barton ACJ concurred  said as follows     The basic

referring to Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   Gobbo J observed at   in Hamersley Iron that authority  supports a meaning of processing that does not require that there be a change producing a commercially distinct article     and his Honour referred to recent English authority which had  adopted the view    that alteration of the material was not necessary to involve subjecting it to a process   That submission was soundly conceived   The Commissioner submitted however that the reasons for decision in Hamersley Iron at first instance and on appeal did not support Lindsay s case  upon the basis that  r efrigeration is not a chemical change  and it is doubtful whether it would be regarded as a physical action on the goods of the sort contemplated by the definition of a manufacture related activity within subItem    The difficulty for the Commissioner is that even if a chemical change is not effected by refrigeration  refrigeration must at least involve physical action  Lindsay pointed out that in Hamersley Iron   t he stacker and reclaimer were machines which physically stacked  and then physically blended the iron ore to ensure homogeneity  which the Commissioner appeared to accept was sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that a process or treatment was involved  However the Commissioner contended further that  the mere cooling of goods during transport is qualitatively different from the process under consideration in Davies   because there the winding of the yarn onto the cones and tubes was described as  part of the process of bringing the ultimate product  namely the piece goods  into a form or condition in which they could be marketed    The difficulty for the Commissioner flowing from any comparison of the factual circumstances in Hamersley Iron   and also in Davies   is that whilst the physical outcome of the process or treatment might be described in each case as more significant in terms of process and extent of change  the STEC notion of applying a process or treatment of goods appearing in the Item   definition of manufacture related activity would clearly enough accommodate situations of varying degree  depending upon the nature and extent of the process or treatment the subject of application  I have not found the Commissioner s endeavours to distinguish the circumstances in Hamersley Iron  or Davies for that matter  from the present to be persuasive distinguishedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd   ATC   The Commissioner sought to demonstrate  contrary to Lindsay s submissions  that the subItem   notion of process or treatment did not extend further to Lindsay s advantage  once comparison was made to the circumstances in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd   ATC    Gray J  and on appeal in   ATC    Crockett King and Beach JJ   The Supreme Court of Victoria there held that a machine which weighed  priced and labelled trays of meat in plastic bags could not be viewed as manufacture   and hence that the weighing machine was not an aid to manufacture   However I am unable to discern sufficient analogy between the circumstances the subject of that latter authority and those circumstances here postulated by Lindsay   Lindsay emphasised moreover that the dicta in Hamersley Iron   ante   occurred in the context of determining whether certain stacking equipment was used in a process or treatment for the purpose of bringing goods into a marketable or usable condition within at least subItem  c  that is to say  in order to put the iron ore as mined into a blended and stored condition ready for shipping  SubItem   being said by Lindsay to be analogous to Item   of the schedule to the precursor exemption legislation to the STEC Act  Lindsay further contended that the foregoing dicta in Hamersley Iron occurred in the further context of determining whether there was at any material time a change in the form  nature or condition of the goods  In that respect  Lindsay asserted that goods cannot be maintained and changed at the same time  Lindsay submitted therefore that on the tests stated in Hamersley Iron to the extent I have recorded  where incidentally the exemption related in part to      apparatus    for use in the mining industry in carrying out mining operations and in the treatment of the products of those operations  no change in form  nature or condition of the goods is required  The description treatment appears of course throughout each of the definitions of manufacture related activity appearing in subItem    The foregoing was described by Lindsay as an established conclusion  fortified by the statutory language having implicitly incorporated the notion of  keep ing  the goods refrigerated  as postulated by Mr Cooper in his expert evidence  Lindsay submitted therefore that by prescribing a sales tax exemption for equipment used in applying a process or treatment for the purpose of keeping goods in a marketable or usable condition  the Legislature did not require that any change in form  nature or condition must necessarily occur   That thesis was said by Lindsay to be supported by the example given in the STEC Act  by way of footnote to par  c  of the definition of manufacturer related activity appearing in the context to subItem   which I have earlier extracted  and which reads      applying a coating of grease to manufactured hand tools to prevent corrosion    It was said by Lindsay  rightly in my opinion  that the application of a coating of grease to a hand tool would not bring about any change in the form  nature or condition of the hand tool  but rather would serve to keep the hand tool in the condition in which it would be appropriately marketed by the manufacturer citedICI Chemicals   Polymers Ltd v The Lubrizol Corporation Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Lindsay further drew attention to the notion of process appearing in subItem  c  as an aspect of the definition of manufacture related activity  being a notion addressed in the patent case of ICI Chemicals   Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corporation Inc   FCA         FCR    The relevant subItem   expression is of course that of process or treatment to goods   being words of wide import and operation  In the reasons for joint judgment of the Full Court  Lee  Heerey and Lehane JJ  at   the following appears  upon which Lindsay placed reliance by way of illustration and analogy     Refrigeration involves a transfer of heat  A refrigerant is contained within what is described as a refrigeration loop  Liquid refrigerant  under pressure  is released into an evaporator  where  now under low pressure  it boils  absorbing heat from the space to be refrigerated  In the course of that process  the liquid refrigerant is entirely evaporated  It is drawn into a compressor in which it is both compressed and further heated  Thence it passes through tubing to a condenser  There  still under pressure  it loses heat through the walls of the condenser  condensing into liquid  It is then piped once more to the evaporator  The process continues so long as the compressor operates  In general terms  that is the way in which both refrigerators  domestic and industrial  and air conditioning systems  including those installed in motor vehicles  work    The Commissioner s response was that the foregoing dicta was of no assistance to Lindsay  emanating as it did from  a different statutory and factual context  and moreover that ICI Chemicals referred to  refrigeration abstractly as a process or treatment to goods  and cannot assist in determining whether the process concerned was a manufacture related activity process   I have not found that response on the Commissioner s part to be persuasive  and such as to reflect any distinction relevantly of the authorities cited by Lindsay and identified above by way of illustration  Refrigeration does involve to my mind  both conceptually and realistically  a process or treatment by way of transfer of heat of temperature  as probably reflected in ICI Chemicals above  and I therefore am of the opinion that the analogy advanced by Lindsay was soundly or sufficiently conceived consideredThe Queensland Cement and Lime Co Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   So much was contended by Lindsay moreover to be no different in principle  materially or relevantly  from the process or treatment involved in maintaining the slurry in Queensland Cement   Lime Co Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   being a decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland  in which the following views were expressed by de Jersey J  at   albeit in the context of the   precursor to the STEC Act     I should add  with regard to a submission made on behalf of the defendant  that it would in my view be artificial to regard the conversion of limestone power to slurry  and the transporting of that slurry to Fisherman s Landing  as standing apart from the process of manufacture of the clinker  This is  of course  apart from what I have already referred to as a concession on the pleadings  As I have indicated  fairly read  the material before me suggests one continuous process of manufacture  commencing at the latest with the grinding of the limestone            I should also record my view that the pumps were for use in the  processing or treatment  of the slurry  The defendant s submission appeared to me to involve the views first  that the transporting through the pipes was not part of the overall manufacturing process  the matter with which I have just dealt  and second  that the primary and principal use of the pumps was not in the  processing or treatment  of the slurry being confined to its transportation to Fisherman s Landing  In my opinion  the use of the pumps to move the slurry through the pipes  and manage it at homogeneous and therefore usable consistency  did involve their use in the processing or treatment of the slurry  Clearly such use was and is the  primary and principal  use of the pumps   The Commissioner asserted that there was a difference in the present factual context between  maintaining the slurry  and Lindsay s  activity of refrigeration  both being descriptions framed by the Commissioner  and sought to rely on the following passage earlier in the reasons of de Jersey J also at        more than mere transportation is involved  the pumps continue the mixing process necessary for manufacture of the clinker by ensuring the homogeneity of the mixture delivered at Fisherman s Landing       Of course Lindsay disputed that any such notion of mere transportation was here involved  which I think to be correct as an evidentiary proposition  and significantly to my mind  the Commissioner nevertheless acknowledged that Queensland Cement and Lime constituted  a further example of a process falling within the continuum of manufacture   Of course  issues of the kind here arising fall ultimately to be determined having regard to their own circumstances  as well as of course in the light of legislative stipulations of sufficient operation   The Commissioner further submitted that Lindsay      only contracted to provide freight services between two points and on any view it did not have any subjective or objective purpose to manufacture goods  and that  its purpose in carrying out the activity of refrigeration was extraneous to any purpose warranted or contemplated under subItem  c  that was directed to a manufacture related activity   So much seemingly boiled down to perhaps the essence of the Commissioner s case  and was of course disputed by Lindsay as not addressing the substance of Lindsay s case founded on subItem  c  for reasons which I have generally as well as specifically outlined already at some length  The Commissioner further asserted that      there is no evidence as to whether the goods once unloaded  remained at the temperature of the insulated bodies or were returned to room temperature  when for example  they are placed on display in a Woolworth s store   That latter contention hardly bore upon the significance or otherwise of the condition in which Lindsay was required to deliver the transported foodstuffs etc to their appointed destination  and in any event was not only speculative but seemingly at odds with the thrust of Lindsay s extensive evidence citedRanicar v Frigmobile Pty Ltd and Royal Insurance Australia Ltd   TasR   It was therefore submitted by Lindsay that the evidence  which I have sought thus far to summarise  sufficiently established that its refrigeration unit was used in conjunction with the reefer or rigid body  all three of course together comprising the relevant goods the subject of the proceedings  in order to control the environment in which a manufacturer s temperature sensitive goods were to be held and maintained in the course of transit  and in order thereby to prevent those goods from spoiling or perishing and to maintain their marketable condition for the benefit of the manufacturer or other principal involved  So much was described by Lindsay as reflective of  a paradigm case illustrating the purpose which subItem  c  was intended to serve   In any event  so Lindsay s submissions continued  if contrary to that submission  the subItem  c  notion of  process or treatment to goods for the purpose of bringing them into  or keeping them in  the form or condition in which they are to be marketed or used by a person  does require change to occur in order for goods to be subjected to a process or treatment   the in transit refrigeration process applied by Lindsay did involve a physical change to the goods subjected thereto  being a change from that prevailing at the time prior to any process or treatment by way of establishment of the requisite degree of coolness in relation to the goods  I was referred in that regard  by way of purportedly analogous exemplification  to a decision of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in Ranicar v Frigmobile Pty Ltd and Royal Insurance Australia Ltd   TasR   where Green CJ said as follows  at      The question which remains is whether in the circumstances of this case that change in temperature amounted to damage in the scallops  In my view  it plainly did  An alteration in temperature undeniably involves a physical change to a substance and in this case that change had the effect of removing one of the primary qualities which the scallop had their exportability  As a result  it is plain that their usefulness was impaired and their value reduced  That is not to say  of course  that in every case a change in temperature would amount to damage  It would depend upon the circumstances and the nature of the goods    Reliance was placed by Lindsay in particular upon the implications there stated of  a n alteration in temperature  involving  a physical change to a substance    The Commissioner rejoined that when a supermarket places frozen chickens in its freezer  it could not be said that it was thereby engaging in part of a manufacturing process  but the analogy is hardly compelling  Either way  arguments by way of analogy so often carry at least marginal difficulty  but I do not think that the dictum in Ranicar can be so radically rejected merely by the analogy proffered by the Commissioner distinguishedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Rochester   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  For completeness  I should further record that attention was also drawn to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Rochester   HCA         CLR   which related to precursor sales tax legislation  and where it was held that by preparing and cooking fish and chips  the defendant taxpayer had neither produced nor manufactured goods  In that earlier statutory context  manufacture was defined non exclusively to include  production and also the combination of parts or ingredients     except such combination as    is customary or reasonably practical for users or customers of those articles or substances to undertake    The statutory formula there prevailing is somewhat removed from the notion of applying a process or treatment to goods formulated in subItem    Each case must of course be considered in the light of its contextual circumstances  and that the retail example derived from Rochester was conceptually removed to my mind from that here subject to consideration   Lindsay submitted in summary in relation to the Item   issue as follows     i  the relevant goods were used mainly  being of course the Item   expression  in refrigerating temperature sensitive goods     ii  refrigeration is a process or treatment which was applied to temperature sensitive goods   process or treatment to goods being an element in each of pars  a   b  and  c  of the subItem   meaning of manufacture related activity   and     iii  the refrigeration was  for the purpose of    keeping  temperature sensitive goods  in the form or condition in which they  were  to be marketed  or otherwise  used by    the    manufacturer of the goods  within the scope of subItem  c    Upon that footing it was concluded by Lindsay that the relevant goods were each used by Lindsay  mainly in carrying out    a manufacture related activity    in the course of a business  within subItem  a  of Schedule   to the STEC Act  and thus involved the  use  of   g oods    mainly in carrying out one or more activities described in subItem   of exemption Item      on behalf of one or more other persons  the principals      within subItem   of Schedule    As a consequence  so Lindsay further submitted  the goods qualified for sales tax exemption under subItem   provided that the condition in Item   which relates to  use by the principal concerned mainly in carrying out the countable activity at the place at which the activity is to be carried out by the exemption user     was satisfied  In that regard  it was Lindsay s case that subItem    will be satisfied as long as the relevant goods  or any of them  would be covered by subItem   and if the applicant s principals used the goods   mainly   in carrying out the same   countable   activities for instance the subject of Item   and further that  the relevant goods will be covered by subItem   unless they are excluded either as a general purpose road vehicle by subItem  b  or by section   of the STEC Act   I have of course earlier reproduced s   which is headed Lower level operation of excluded property  Item   requires for its operation that      either the condition in subitem   of this Item or the conditions in subitem   of this Item must be met for each activity  countable activity  that is relied on to establish that this subitem applies    and in the present circumstances  subItem   uses the more conceptually apposite expression place   and subItem   uses the perhaps less apposite expression premises    The issues falling for resolution are of course complex  in relation to which both parties provided comprehensive written submissions by way of analysis of the legislation  judicial authority and the evidence tendered to the Tribunal below  In the course of presentation of the respective cases of the parties to the Federal Court  Lindsay appears to have chartered additions and modifications at least of detail to its case presented to the Tribunal below  a course which is perhaps understandable given the complexity and detail of the prospectively or conceivably relevant provisions of the STEC Act  and in particular of the extensive Schedule   thereto  In the context of a statutory appeal by way of review of administrative decision making  an appellant tends to take the opportunity to vary  modify or refine the emphasis and scope of its case conducted earlier at first instance in an administrative tribunal below  and I think that the present application by way of statutory appeal has adopted that course to some extent   Lindsay s contextual foundation for the relief invoked on the present appeal was of course its operations of road haulage and freight transportation which were undertaken as a subcontractor for principals whose business operations involved the production of fresh primary products  and the subsequent merchandising thereof at distant markets in that condition  In relation to the first of the five issues tendered by Lindsay for resolution on the appeal  being the issues set out in   of these reasons for judgment  Item   of Schedule   to the STEC Act was primarily invoked by Lindsay  and so invoked in its capacity as a transport subcontractor of those primary products  It was in relation to its capacity as a haulage subcontractor that Lindsay has sought to establish its fiscal status as an exemption user under the STEC Act  and hence within the scope more specifically of its activities in relation to exemption Items the subject of Schedule   to the STEC Act  and to do so in particular in respect of a countable activity within the scope of Item   headed Subcontractors
