discussedRe Francis  Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy     ALR   It was held by the Full Court of this Court in Re Francis  Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy     ALR   that the bankruptcy of one of two joint tenants severs the joint tenancy with the interest of the bankrupt vesting in the Official Trustee or a registered trustee under s   of the Act  and the remaining co owner becoming a tenant in common with the Official Trustee or trustee  The Court said  at      When the estate of the male bankrupt in the land in question became vested in the Official Trustee  the unity of title was immediately destroyed  in that the respective interests of the Official Trustee and the female co owner in the land did not derive from the same act or document  Nor is there any unity of time between the two estates  The unity of interest also does not exist because the interest of the Official Trustee is impressed with his responsibilities under the Bankruptcy Act   and may  and very likely will  be of less duration than that of his co owner      The fact that upon the later bankruptcy of the female bankrupt the Official Trustee succeeded to her interest in the land as well  cannot recreate a joint tenancy out of what has become on severance a tenancy in common  if for no other reason  because the unities of title and time are not present      Finally on the matter of principle  it could hardly be said that  if the female bankrupt had died after the male bankrupt s bankruptcy but before she herself became bankrupt  the Official Trustee would have succeeded to her estate and interest in the land by survivorship      Later in its reasons  in commenting on Re Boots  Ex parte Official Receiver     FLR    discussed below  where a husband and wife with jointly owned non partnership assets became bankrupt at the same time  the Court observed  at   that  i n those circumstances no question of severance of joint tenancies arose    The question in Boots  case was whether  because the husband and wife were  joint debtors   in consequence of their conduct of the partnership business  their jointly owned real property  though not partnership property  was to be included in their  joint estate  under s    In holding that that property was part of the joint estate  Riley J clearly proceeded on the premise that no severance of the joint tenancy resulted from the contemporaneous bankruptcy of the joint tenants  The dictum quoted above from Re Francis endorsed the correctness of that premise  In this matter I am being asked to deal directly with whether the Full Court s dictum and the premise of Boots  are correct   There is now a significant body of Australian case law in addition to Re Francis to the effect that the bankruptcy of a joint tenant severs the joint tenancy at law  if the land in question is old system land  or in equity  if the land is held under a title registration system  the involuntary alienation worked by s   of the Bankruptcy Act effecting the severance in either case  see generally Sistrom v Urh     FCR   Re Holland  Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy     FCR   Re Prestia   FCA   at         As Re Francis indicates  that involuntary alienation severs at least two of the  unities   i e  of interest and of time    When one turns to where joint tenants are made bankrupt at the same time as joint debtors  a somewhat more complex state of affairs exists  Section   in express terms contemplates that  in such a case  a joint estate does come into existence  I consider the section envisages that where jointly owned property is alienated to the Official Trustee or trustee by s   that property retains that character in the Official Trustee s or trustee s hands  And it does so because as between the joint tenants no act was done by  or to  either or both of the bankrupts other than the bankruptcy itself and its s   consequence which could require that the property no longer be considered as joint property to be applied in the payment of their joint debts  To say that the very act which makes the joint property of both available to be utilised under s    i e  the joint bankruptcy  has the effect of severing what was joint property until that moment is to negate what I consider to be the manifest purpose of s    I do not consider that the section requires that construction  hence my agreement with the dictum in Re Francis    Having reached this conclusion I would have to say  though  that I have some difficulty in seeing a principled operation for the right of survivorship of a joint tenant were one of the bankrupts to die during the course of the administration either before or after the jointly owned property was sold   Accordingly  I would direct that the interests of Colin and Marlene as joint tenants in both the Bordertown and Hayborough properties be allocated to the joint estate of Colin and Marlene  this being the only joint estate of which they alone are joint debtors  While they are also joint debtors for the purposes of the partnership estate  the joint debtors for that particular estate are not limited to them alone  They include Colin as well discussedRe Boots

cases cth HCA  html  The trustee is not seeking a direction as to whether in the circumstances Craig could have maintained an action against Colin and Marlene  for specific performance to rectify the manner in which he held his interest in the Bordertown property  sic   Rather  what is sought are directions as to whether he should take any further steps in relation to whether a claim exists and  if so  what steps should be taken in relation to dealing with that claim  The trustee acknowledges that any claim Colin might have has vested in him and that Colin  has no right to bring or prosecute proceedings to protect  enhance or add to the property of which he has been divested on bankruptcy  Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL   HCA         CLR   at     The directions sought are not ones I am prepared to give notwithstanding that they may be of a type that a trustee properly could seek  i e  concerning the incurring of expense to ascertain whether legal proceedings may be in the interests of creditors and  if there is the prospect of a surplus  the bankrupt   By way of analogy  trustees commonly approach courts under the provisions of the Trustee Acts that obtain in most Australian jurisdictions for directions as to whether to sue or to defend an action  see Jacobs  Law of Trusts in Australia     th ed      I would preface what I have to say with this comment  A successful claim by Craig against his parents would not result in a nett accretion to the totality of the joint and separate estates being administered by the trustee  However  depending upon whether the outcome of that action was to give Craig a joint tenancy with his parents in part of the Bordertown property or only an additional several interest  the result of his claim could affect both the partnership estate and the joint estate of his parents  in the event of a joint tenancy finding  or the joint estate of his parents and his own separate estate if his additional interest in the property was that of a tenant in common appliedRe Lemon Tree Passage   Districts RSL and Citizens Club Cooperative Ltd     ACLR   Turning to my reasons for declining to give any directions  the materials put before me are opaque and are quite inadequate insofar as they reveal the possible basis of any claim or claims that might be made  Is it to specifically enforce a contract  in which case what contract and is it in writing  cf Property Law Act  SA  s    Is it a Holroyd v Marshall type constructive trust claim based on the consideration for the transfer of an interest having been executed in the steps taken by Craig in relation to the McLaren Vale property  Meagher  Gummow and Lehane s Equity  Doctrines and Remedies     th ed    Is the claim based on equitable estoppel  Etc  Equally  with any possible claim being likely to turn critically on the intentions and actions of the three bankrupts  there seems to be no material at all before me from them which might illuminate the matter  I am simply asked to speculate  While I do not have to determine whether or not any proposed proceedings will or will not be successful  I need to investigate the matter sufficiently to determine whether or not any such proceedings would be fruitless  cf Re Lemon Tree Passage   Districts RSL and Citizens Club Cooperative Ltd     ACLR   at    There is insufficient material before me to make this determination let alone a determination as to whether it would be worthwhile for the trustee to further investigate a possible claim by Craig  Re Lemon Tree Passage   at    Hence I decline to give the directions sought
