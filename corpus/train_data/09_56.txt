Barrick v Qantas Flight Catering Limited  No     FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBagshaw v Scott   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn my judgment  the proceedings were commenced without reasonable cause and were  from first to last  untenable  Bagshaw v Scott   FCA   at   and    From the outset  the proceedings had no substantial or any prospects of success  and it is clear  in my judgment  that the proceedings were commenced  maintained  and conducted vexatiously  Notwithstanding all of the above  for the reasons which follow  I think it right  in all the circumstances of this case  simply to order that  except where specific costs orders have been made with the opposite effect  the applicant pay the costs of the respondent of and incidental to the proceedings  I note that the dates that had been first set down for the hearing of the trial had to be vacated because of the inadequacy of the respondent s preparation for trial  In respect of that matter  I ordered the respondent to pay the costs of the applicant thrown away by the need to adjourn the trial of the proceedings  On   May   I dismissed the application and set a timeframe in respect of the making of submissions as to costs discussedBarrick v Qantas Flight Catering Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe principal proceedings were  in many respects  bizarre  On   May   I gave judgment in this matter dismissing the application  Barrick v Qantas Flight Catering Limited   FCA    In those reasons  I said  at         the Federal Court proceedings  which were commenced by an application filed on   June   involve an extraordinary collocation of alleged causes of action  many of which are misconceived or assert a cause of action not known to the law  It is a sad but true observation that the applicant s case has been conducted on the basis essentially of assertion  and the absence of probative evidence       The relief claimed by Mrs Barrick in these proceedings is for     i  the recovery of fines and penalties for alleged breaches of a number of provisions of the Award by Qantas Catering   ii  recovery of wages and superannuation alleged to have been unpaid by Qantas Catering     iii  damages under s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TP Act  for breaches of s  AA and s      iv  and further and alternatively  for damages for breach of contract and or statutory duty     v  and further and alternatively  damages and or equitable compensation for harsh and unconscionable conduct     vi  and further and alternatively  for declaratory relief in reliance on s   of the TP Act  or alternatively  on reliance on the rules of natural justice and the principles of equity and good conscience and the common law of the Commonwealth     vii  and further and alternatively  for a mandatory injunction in reliance on s   of the TP Act  and or alternatively in reliance on the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to uphold the statutory and common law of the Commonwealth  including the rules of natural justice and the principles of equity and good conscience     viii  and further and alternatively damages and or equitable compensation as the Court deems fit and appropriate including exemplary damages in consequence of the respondent s compliance or non compliance with the proposed orders for declaratory and mandatory injunction     ix  such further or other orders as the Court deems fit in all the circumstances of the case as set out herein     x  an order for costs on an indemnity basis     xi  interest on all monies and damages found to be payable    It was pleaded in Mrs Barrick s case in   of the Further Amended Statement of Claim  filed   April             the conduct of the Respondent   Qantas Flight Catering Limited   in       i  reversing its previous positions   ii  and failing to take appropriate steps to correct its treatment of the Applicant on the strength of its original allegations and accusations  including its dismissal of the Applicant  her prosecution for fraud and refusal to pay superannuation on the grounds of ill health   iii  and putting forward evidence  claims and defences in these proceedings which it could and should have put forward in the previous proceedings is unreasonable and contrary to equity and good conscience         Further  in   it was pleaded     In the premises and in the absence of proper and reasonable explanations from the Respondent  Qantas Flight Catering Limited  to justify or excuse the conduct on its part     the Respondent should be held as the Applicant reasonably apprehends to have committed an abuse of the process of the AIRC and the Magistrates Court to the detriment of the Applicant     This is  quite simply  an extraordinary assumption of what the Federal Court is empowered to do  There was no cause of action available to the applicant by which she could revisit the the issues which were the subject of findings in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission  AIRC  to the effect that the applicant was complicit in a fraudulent scheme  The applicant asserted that in the AIRC proceedings  the conduct by the respondent in resisting her application for unlawful termination or reinstatement was false  and was a representation in trade or commerce entitling the applicant  pursuant to the Trade Practices Act    Cth  to recovery of legal expenses  As my reasons for judgment in the principal proceedings demonstrate  I was and am of the view that the proceedings in the Federal Court were brought for the dominant purpose of having the Federal Court revisit the determinations of other courts and tribunals  including the proceedings in the AIRC  and the findings concerning the conduct of the respondent  or its officers  in such proceedings  which were determined adversely to the applicant  In particular  it was said that the proceedings in the Federal Court were brought to obtain findings from the Federal Court contrary to those of the AIRC   to clear the applicant s name
