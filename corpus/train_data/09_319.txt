that rule   did not make any appropriate provision for General Meetings to allow members of the Branch the opportunity to attend  counsel for the applicant relied on Griffiths v Ansett Pilots Association   FCA     in which Ryan J said  at     It is common ground that the control provided for by the rules must be available in a practical sense and must not be susceptible to obstruction or unreasonable delay by the committee concerned  The related general observation can be made  in this context  that the reasonableness of the rules of an organisation  within the meaning of s   of the Act  is to be measured by what is practicably achievable under the rules in the actual circumstances in which they operate   Section   was a precursor to s   of Schedule     Ryan J continued  at     The circumstances to which I referred in the last paragraph  or  extrinsic facts  as they have been called  include the number of members of the organisation  their geographic distribution and concentration  whether or not the organisation is divided into branches and the nature of the industry or occupational activities in which members are engaged   This principle derives from such authorities as Hodder v Australian Workers  Union     FCR     at   per Pincus J  approved in Lawley v Transport Workers  Union of Australia     IR   and Thomson v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing and Kindred Industries Union of Australia     IR     and Gordon v Carroll     FLR     at   per Smithers  Woodward and St John JJ  As Ryan J noted in Griffiths   FCA     at   the rules under consideration in that case contemplated that each general meeting be held at only one place prescribed by the proper body or officer  After recording counsel s submission that the rules of the Association did not infringe s  b iv  as the Act then stood  his Honour said  at            control  as used in that provision  extends to control between elections  It is possible  particularly for an organisation with relatively few members  to provide for such control by granting a reasonably small number of members the facility to require the calling of a general meeting if such a meeting has the power to give directions to the relevant committee  No such power appears to be reposed by the rules in their present form in a general meeting of the Association  Moreover  the facility to require a general meeting which is accorded by rule   of the Association s rules is severely circumscribed by the location of its members and the nature of their work  As well  the fact that a single general meeting may only be convened at one place and at one place and at one time  in the light of the geographic distribution of the Association s members and their variously rostered working hours and the restrictions on voting by proxy  precludes that facility from according to members the requisite degree of control          It might have been otherwise had the rules permitted the calling of general meetings at several locations and staggered hours to maximise the opportunity for members to attend  and had the rules permitted the votes cast at such meetings to be aggregated for the purpose of deciding whether a binding direction had been given to the COM  However  while the rules remain in their present form  I do not consider  putting to one side new rule   that they provide in the requisite sense for control of the COM by the members  The applicant argued that Ryan J s ruling in Griffiths   FCA   was apposite to this case  Mr Jackson did not dispute the principles outlined by his Honour  but affirmed that the present case was a different one from Griffiths   FCA    In effect  the applicant s case was that  having regard to the nature of the members  employment  general meetings were not an adequate controlling mechanism and that a plebiscite should be the means by which the governing body was controlled by members but that a plebiscite could not operate in this way under the Union s rules  To make good the first part of this argument  the applicant again relied on Ryan J s analysis in Griffiths   FCA     where  citing Boland v Munro     FLR     his Honour said at     Control  in the relevant sense  is not confined to the control which may be said to be exercisable through the ballot box at elections but extends  in a limited sense  to control between elections         His Honour accepted that   control  in the present context  meant a power to check or restrain and not dominating control     In Griffiths   FCA   at         Ryan J concluded that     I n evaluating the sufficiency of control over a committee given to the members  regard has to be had to the rules as a whole                  Because I have been persuaded     that the rules as a whole of the Association  considered without regard to the new rule   fail to make a provision required by the Act  namely one for control of the COM by the members  it follows that an order may be made under s   of the Act unless the new rule   has effectively remedied the failure  As Mr Jackson pointed out  however  in Griffiths   FCA     Ryan J was concerned with a meeting of a national union  whose membership was dispersed through out Australia and more than half of whom were likely at any one time to be preparing for flight duties  I accept  as Mr Jackson submitted  that the present case might well be relevantly distinguishable from Griffiths   On the evidence as it presently stands  it cannot be said that there is necessarily a Griffiths  type situation  Indeed  as Mr Jackson reiterated  there was some evidence before the Court that   Branch members  out of a total of   listed their home address at a location within a   kilometre radius of Dallas Brooks Hall in central Melbourne  Moreover  none of the evidence before the Court about attendance at Branch meetings apparently related to attendance at Special General Meetings citedHodder v Australian Workers  Union
