Bolnisi Gold NL  in the matter of Bolnisi Gold NL  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toRe APN News   Media Ltd     ACSR   I discussed break fees and other  deal protection  measures  notably  no shop  or exclusivity period provisions  in Re APN News   Media Ltd     ACSR     APN   at     and to a lesser extent in Re Investa Properties Ltd     ACLC   at     and will not repeat what I said in those cases  Generally  a break fee is a fee payable by the target company to the acquiring company in certain circumstances in which the acquisition is not implemented  Such provisions form part of a merger implementation agreement to which the directors of the target company commit their company prior to a scheme of arrangement being considered by the target company s shareholders  When deciding whether to order that a meeting be convened or that a scheme be approved  the Court is not in a position to decide whether a merger implementation agreement was entered into in breach of the duties owed by the target company s directors  The Court could do so only on a contested hearing in which it is alleged  and sought to be proved  that by committing the target company to the merger implementation agreement  the directors breached their statutory and general law duties  see eg  Idameneo  No   Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Limited   FCA     The United Kingdom  like Australia  has legislative provision for judicial approval of schemes of arrangement  Companies Act    UK  c   Pt    ss      There  as here  there is also a specialist takeover panel  the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers  and an associated administrative document containing guidance as to an acceptable level of break fee in the context of takeovers  The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers   th ed  Panel on Takeovers and Mergers    and the Panel s Practice Statement No   r     regarding inducement fees  the effect of which I summarised in APN   ACSR   at     The researches of Bolnisi s counsel did not elicit anything of specific relevance to naked no vote break fee provisions from the United Kingdom   In New Zealand  Part XV of the Companies Act    NZ   ss     also provides for judicial approval of schemes of arrangement  However  solicitors for Bolnisi informed the Court that Bolnisi s New Zealand counsel advised that the Takeovers Panel in New Zealand had not had to consider the issue of naked no vote break fees  or break fees more generally citedRe Ausdoc Group Ltd     ACSR   Two decisions of the Takeovers Panel are relevant  In Re Ausdoc Group Ltd     ACSR   a break fee was payable  inter alia  where a   percent minimum acceptance condition of a takeover offer was not satisfied  The Panel found the break fee provision to be unacceptable and accepted undertakings by the bidder and the target company not to enforce the provision or to pay the fee  respectively  The Panel stated  at   that   In assessing the potential for the   break fee to influence the decision of Ausdoc shareholders  we had regard to the fact that      t he   break fee represents approximately   of  that year s  expected profit figure   The Panel had regard to the fact that payment of the break fee would mean that shareholders would not be paid a dividend for the year  The Panel accepted ASIC s submission that the break fee provision was coercive  that naked no vote break fees are to be distinguished from others  and that in the particular circumstances of the case  only a de minimis naked no vote break fee could be supported   For the purposes of assessing a particular break fee  I see no distinction between the   percent minimum acceptance condition in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd   ACSR   and the minimum voting percentages referred to in s  a ii  of the Act  The approach taken by the Panel in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd   ACSR   may have been influenced by the size of the break fee in question  Be this as it may  the view expressed in Re National Can Industries  No   is inconsistent with any notion that a naked no vote break fee can only be supported if it is de minimis    Overseas comparisonscitedBrazen v Bell Atlantic Corp   A d    Del Supr   In Brazen v Bell Atlantic Corp   A d    Del Supr     Brazen v Bell   the Supreme Court of Delaware made  at     the following observations that are pertinent to this question  the case concerned a stock for stock merger of equals  with reciprocal identical break fees    Plaintiff further argues that the termination fee provision was coercive  Plaintiff contends that  a  the stockholders never had an option to consider the merger agreement without the fee  and  b  regardless of what the stockholders thought of the merits of the transaction  the stockholders knew that if they voted against the transaction  they might well be imposing a   million penalty on their company  Plaintiff contends that the termination fee was so enormous that it  influenced  the vote  Finally  plaintiff argues that the fee provision was meant to be coercive because the drafters deliberately crafted the termination fees to make them applicable when Bell Atlantic s stockholders decline to approve the transaction as opposed to a termination resulting from causes other than the non approval of the Bell Atlantic stockholders  We find plaintiff s arguments unpersuasive     First  the Court of Chancery properly found that the termination fee was not egregiously large  Second  the mere fact that the stockholders knew that voting to disapprove the merger may result in activation of the termination fee does not by itself constitute stockholder coercion  Third  we find no authority to support plaintiff s proposition that a fee is coercive because it can be triggered upon stockholder disapproval of the merger agreement  but not upon the occurrence of other events resulting in termination of the agreement     In Williams v Geier   this Court enunciated the test for stockholder coercion  Wrongful coercion that nullifies a stockholder vote may exist  where the board or some other party takes actions which have the effect of causing the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposed transaction for some reason other than the merits of that transaction   Williams v Geier   A  d    Del Supr        But we also stated in Williams v Geier that  i n the final analysis     the determination of whether a particular stockholder vote has been robbed of its effectiveness by impermissible coercion depends on the facts of the case    Id at     I referred at   above to Brazen v Bell in which a nearly naked no vote break fee was upheld by the Supreme Court of Delaware  The fee was US  million  less than one percent of the corporation s market capitalisation   I say  nearly  because another condition was that there must have been in existence a competing proposal  even though it was rejected or withdrawn  If the competing proposal came to fruition within one and a half years  however  an additional US  million was payable  the total of US  million was approximately   percent of the target s approximately US  billion market capitalisation    A complicating factor was that the Supreme Court of Delaware tested the fee against a liquidated damages measure rather than the business judgment rule  because the agreement s provision had the effect of specifically requiring the application of that measure  The Supreme Court of Delaware held the fee of US  million to be in the nature of liquidated damages  not a penalty  because it was  within the range of reasonableness   at   citedCW Shareholdings Inc v WIC Western International Communications Ltd     BLR  d    As in the US  judicial consideration of break fees by Canadian courts often occurs in the context of contested litigation  Canadian courts have upheld break fees generally  see CW Shareholdings Inc v WIC Western International Communications Ltd     BLR  d     I was informed that counsel for Bolnisi s Canadian subsidiary company  Palmarejo  conducted a survey of plans of arrangement undertaken in Canada in   and found that many included a naked no vote break fee   The evidence before the Court relevant to the naked no vote break fee in the present case  Bolnisi relies on the following three affidavits  The first is an affidavit of Norman Alfred Seckold  Chairman and a Director of Bolnisi  sworn   October   paras     of which were set out in my earlier reasons for judgment  at   and are summarised at   below   The second affidavit is a further affidavit of Mr Seckold sworn   November   in which Mr Seckold states that the terms of the MIA were negotiated at meetings on   April   and   May   and that at one of those meetings a partner from Freehills  representing Coeur  told him that Coeur would not enter into a transaction with Bolnisi unless Bolnisi agreed to pay a break fee triggered by a failure of its shareholders to vote to agree to the proposed Scheme  Mr Seckold stated that he agreed subject  inter alia  to Coeur s agreeing to a reciprocal break fee provision  because without it  it would be open to Coeur shareholders to frustrate implementation of the Scheme by not passing the resolution to increase the number of the authorised shares in the capital of Coeur  Mr Seckold states that he took the view that without the provision for the Coeur break fee  the Coeur shareholders would have  a free option over the scheme  citedEmerson Radio Corp v International Jensen Inc   WL    Del Ch   In several cases  the Delaware Court of Chancery has made passing reference to naked no vote break fees

questions of the legitimacy of break fees arise in litigated contests  notably in the Delaware Court of Chancery and  on appeal from it  the Supreme Court of Delaware  Consequently  break fees have been considered in Delaware in the factually rich matrix of  often disputed  evidence  In those cases  the plaintiff is often a competing bidder or an aggrieved stockholder who assumes the task of proving a breach of the target company s directors  fiduciary duty to obtain the highest price for the target s shareholders  and not to allow any conflict of interest or other factor to interfere with their doing so  as recognised in Revlon Inc v MacAndrews   Forbes Holdings Inc   A d    Del Supr     This is a very different situation from that which prevails in applications under s   of the Act  even after allowance is made for performance of the plaintiff s duty to draw the Australian Court s attention to matters that might point against approval   The Delaware cases have recognised the tension that potentially exists between  the business judgment rule  and the fiduciary duty of the directors  The business judgment rule cautions against the courts  substituting their opinion as to where the commercial interests of the corporation and its shareholders lie for the opinion of the directors citedIn re Toys  R  Us Inc Shareholder Litigation   A d    Del Ch   So called  break fees  have worn different names  particularly in the US  termination fees   inducement fees   cancellation fees   The amount payable sometimes varies according to the circumstances in which it becomes payable  the amount being less in the naked no vote situation  For example  In re Toys  R  Us Inc Shareholder Litigation   A d    Del Ch     Toys  R  Us   the break fee in one offer was described as follows  at     The Company offered to pay the KKR Group  the acquiring company    of the Company s equity value  as implied by the final deal terms  The payment of the   was  from what I can discern  to be made only when           the Company s board terminates the merger agreement to accept a higher bid or the KKR Group terminates because the board had withdrawn its recommendation of the merger     another offer to acquire the Company exists at the time the Company s stockholders vote on the merger  the Company s stockholders do not approve the merger agreement  and the Company consummates an alternative transaction within the next year  or     another offer to acquire the Company exists at the time the merger agreement terminates automatically by having reached its termination date  September     and the Company consummates an alternative transaction within a year          In the event that the merger agreement was terminated simply because the Company s stockholders voted it down  the Company offered only to reimburse the KKR Group for a to be negotiated sum approximating its documented  out of pocket expenses   In Toys  R  Us  the target company  agreed to pay only up to US  million in documented expenses  less than half of a percent of the equity value of the company  upon the occurrence of a naked no vote  at    On the other hand  a full termination fee  payable for the most part only if the company terminated the merger agreement in order to sign up another acquisition proposal within a year  was US    million     percent of equity value and     percent of enterprise value   at    Although the Court did not scrutinize the naked no vote fee in its opinion  it did observe  at      T he bottom line is that the public stockholders will have an opportunity tomorrow to reject the merger if they do not think the price is high enough in light of the Company s stand alone value and other options  If the stockholders vote no  the only price will be the payment of   million to KKR Group  which is likely less than its actual expenses to date   It seems to follow that in Toys  R  Us the Court did not view the naked no vote break fee provision with disapproval   In   a Project Report of the Mergers   Acquisitions Market Trends Subcommittee of the Committee on Negotiated Acquisitions of the American Bar Association s Section of Business Law was released  entitled   Strategic Buyer Public Target Mergers   Acquisitions Deal Points Study   The study relates to transactions and acquisitions announced in   and    It found that nine percent of   and   acquisitions involved naked no vote break fees  The report also found that out of the   transactions that contained a naked no vote trigger    required reimbursement of expenses only  as was the case in Toys  R  Us  for example  rather than the higher break fee payable in other contexts
