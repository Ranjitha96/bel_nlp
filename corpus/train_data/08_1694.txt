SZFTV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedfollowedJess v Scott     FCR   In Jess v Scott     FCR   a Full Court of this Court held that  when exercising the discretion which I am called upon to exercise in respect of this matter under O   r   the longer the duration of the delay the more persuasive the purported   special reason   must be  In that case their Honours held   FCR   at   that   It would require something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave after  for example  a year citedNAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Federal Magistrate then considered the third ground  Her Honour found that the Tribunal clearly considered the country information submitted by the applicant post hearing as well as other independent country information  Her Honour held  in accordance with NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     that the Tribunal had a discretion to determine what country information it had regard to  Her Honour was satisfied that it was open to the Tribunal to base its opinion on one particular piece of country information  in this case information suggesting that the protections were available in secular law remedies   The learned Federal Magistrate dismissed the fourth ground on the basis that it amounted to a challenge to the fact finding of the Tribunal and thus constituted no more than an impermissible request for a merits review   The application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on   July    This is almost three years after the learned Federal Magistrate handed down her decision  As I have already observed  her Honour s decision was delivered on   October     In support of his application  the applicant has filed an affidavit  written out in his own hand  to which are attached various pages from the Court Book and a draft Notice of Appeal  Paragraphs   to   of that affidavit are in the following terms         I am the spouse of  name  both declared husband and wife on            I now understand that the Federal Magistrate Court dismissed my application reference SYG        I was asked by the Dept of Immigration to depart Australia and such action traumatized my wife and myself      My community volunteer wrote to Hon Minister and the Officer of Ministerial Intervention Unit did not refer his letter to the Minister      Based on the latest decision by their Honours Moore  Marshall   Lander JJ dated       I ask the Federal Court of Australia to accept my current review as I have ground to succeed      I attach copies of the Court Book pages           and implore the Honourable Court to deal with my matter according to the decision of the Full Court NSD       Again and again I implore the Hon Court to accept my Review   The draft Grounds of Appeal attached to this affidavit contained one ground of appeal only  namely   The Refugee Review Tribunal failed to notify the authorized recipient as required by S  G  Court Book FM pages                 I note that the applicant informed me that the Department s request referred to in par   of his affidavit was made in    The alleged trauma caused by that request is not and could not be advanced by the applicant as a reason for his delay in making the application which is before me today citedSZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There is a reference in the applicant s affidavit in support of his application to a decision of the Full Court of this Court comprising Moore  Marshall and Lander JJ dated   July    I thought that the applicant s reference was a reference to the decision of SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALD    My assumption has now been confirmed because the applicant has referred to that decision during the course of his oral submissions   The Full Court in SZIZO   FCAFC       ALD   held that the failure by the Tribunal to provide certain documents to the authorised recipient in the circumstances of that case resulted in jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal   Section  G b  of the Act requires that if there is an authorised recipient notified to the Tribunal  it is to that person  instead of the applicant  that the Tribunal must give any document that it would otherwise have given to the applicant  The expression   give     a documen t  is given meaning by s  B of the Act    In the present case  as I understand the applicant s submission  it is the applicant s contention that    There was an authorised recipient within the meaning of s  G of the Act who had been authorised by him in late   and   and to whom relevant communications should have been sent      Certain documents  being those identified in the affidavit filed in support of this application  were not sent to that authorised recipient but rather were sent to the applicant himself  and    Accordingly  there had been a breach by the Tribunal of s  G b    The pages to which the applicant has referred in support of that position established that in his Application for Review dated   December   the applicant authorised a migration agent  Ms Therese Nicolas  to be his authorised recipient  Those pages also establish that a letter dated   December   was sent to two persons with the primary addressee at the top of the letter being the applicant by name but the address in that place being the address of the migration agent nominated by him  Ms Nicolas   It is clear also that the letter appears to have been sent to the migration agent herself  at the same address  The notation that indicates that this occurred is a notation at the foot of the letter   A further letter addressed in similar fashion was sent on   March   appliedfollowedVu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALD   A   special reason   has been regarded by the Court as a circumstance which   takes the case out of the ordinary     See Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALD     As I have already indicated  it seems to me that the applicant has not advanced any explanation for the inordinate delay in filing the present application let alone attempted to demonstrate by evidence and submission that there were special reasons applicable in the present case which justified an extension of the time within which he may lodge his Notice of Appeal   It seems to me that I am also entitled to weigh in the balance the very weak nature of the proposed appeal which  as I have already indicated  is  at most  barely arguable  When I introduce that factor into the equation and weigh it up in light of the significant delay in the present case and the lack of explanation for that delay  I am compelled to conclude that the applicant has failed to make out the requirements that would justify an extension of time in the terms sought by him   It really does seem to me that  over the last few years  the applicant has not been of the view that the learned Federal Magistrate s decision was wrong or even challengeable but rather that his interests were best served by pursuing administrative avenues which he considered were available to him   For these reasons  I will dismiss the application with costs   I certify that the preceding forty two   numbered paragraphs
