ACCC v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredTrade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd   Anor     A Crim R   The case for the Commission was  and remains  that the mischief involved is similar to that which was disclosed in Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd   Anor     A Crim R    So it is that the submission of the Commission is that the following passage from the reasons for judgment in that case  at page   is apposite  What I need to determine  for the purpose of assessing penalty  is Cue s motive in involving itself in the dual priced swing tags in the manner in which it did  If  the product manager  truthfully stated that it did not occur to her that members of the buying public would infer from the two prices that the garments had been on sale at the higher prices for any substantial period of time then she is either very naive or recklessly indifferent to the perceptions of the buying public   Then a little later   In my opinion  the natural and probable consequence of a dual priced swing tag is that members of the buying public would assume that the garment had previously been offered for sale at the higher of the two prices and was now available at the lower price   Then a little later still  at page   I regard the conduct of the defendants as serious breaches of the TPA  It was conduct that preyed on the gullibility of the public   The submission has been made on behalf of the Corporate Defendant that this particular feature of the case  which is not challenged by the Commission in terms of the factual accuracy of the response  is a matter going to mitigation in the sense that this is not a case where a diamond of at least a particular comparability in terms of type had never been offered for sale  I agree  and I do take that into account in mitigation of penalty  That is not to say  however  that there is not a discrete vice revealed by the conduct of the same ilk as that revealed in the Cue case   So far as penalty is concerned  one is constrained to have regard to particular factors by the terms of s  A of the Crimes Act    Cth   Crimes Act    Other judges of this Court have taken the view that the factors listed in s  A  of the Crimes Act are not exhaustive of considerations that are relevant in the imposition of penalty in respect of a Federal offence  I respectfully agree  In particular  one does not see  in s  A   a reference to general deterrence as a sentencing consideration  nor does one see reference to having regard to the objects of the statute which makes provision for the particular Federal offence   In this instance  it is relevant to recall that a particular purpose of the Trade Practices Act is consumer protection  Further  offences against the Trade Practices Act are not always easy to detect or  at least  insofar as they are detected  involve a considerable investment in public funds in their investigation and prosecution  The Trade Practices Act also represents a value judgement by the Australian Parliament as to particular standards of commercial morality that should obtain in our country  I bear all of these factors in mind in relation to sentencing  apart from having regard to s  A  list of factors consideredAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Proprietary

Australia Proprietary Limited   FCA     and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Proprietary Limited   FCA     It seems to me  though  that the circumstances of this case have a uniqueness which limits the utility of that exercise  I have noted  however  and see force in the submission made on behalf of the Corporate Defendant  that so far as the Allans Music case is concerned  this ought not be approached on the basis that one is sentencing a defendant who has demonstrated market power  Equally  I see force in the submission that there was an additional aggravating quality in the Skippy case  lent by the threat posed to the safety of children by the nature of the conduct in respect of the product in question   It seems to me that were I to impose individual penalties in this case  of an order that would reflect a proportion of the maximum  the aggregate result would be out of all relationship with the gravity of the criminal conduct  having regard to the totality principle  That being so  I have  in reflecting upon the application of s  K and that totality principle  come to a view that I ought to impose but one penalty and that that penalty should be    In coming to that view  I have considered those cases in respect of penalty to which I ve referred already  namely  the Skippy case and the Allen s Music case although  as I have observed  it seems to me that there is a uniqueness about this case which does limit the utility  even in a proportionality exercise   The submission that was made on behalf of the Commission is that a short time ought to be allowed in respect of the payment of the penalty by way of fine  One aspect of that short tine that was put forward was   days  although  I did not detect any particular rigidity in that reference  as opposed to the submission that it should not be so long as to allow the Defendant anything more than a reasonable opportunity to ascertain whether or not it was indeed in a position to meet the amount of the fine  The submission made on behalf of the Defendant was that one ought to allow one month  Given the amount of the fine that I have come to regard as appropriate and the facts   little though they may be   that are known to the Court in relation to the Corporate Defendant  it would be in the interests of justice to allow that slightly longer period of one month    I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan    Associate Dated    July   Counsel
