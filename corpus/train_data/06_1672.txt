application for an order for security for costs under s   of the Act  it is clear that the rule is not intended to be an exhaustive statement of the factors the Court may consider  nor does the rule limit the power of the Court under s     Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation     FCR   at       The first and third applicants in this case are corporations  one of which is currently subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement within the meaning of Pt    A Corporations Act    Cth   Accordingly  s   Corporations Act is also relevant  Section   provides      Where a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding  the court having jurisdiction in the matter may  if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his  her or its defence  require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given      The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be borne by such party to the proceeding as the court  in its discretion  directs   Although the respondents have sought an order for security for costs pursuant to either s   of the Federal Court Act or s   Corporations Act   in the circumstances of this case the parties have not addressed the issue whether the content of the requirement to act judicially is different under s   to that under s    Accordingly  it is not necessary for me to consider this issue separately   It is well settled that the court is vested with a discretion to award or not security for costs  and that the power is wide with the need to exercise the discretion judicially being the only relevant limitation   Bell Wholesale at    However  useful guidelines which courts typically take into account in determining such applications were listed by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd     FCR   at     as follows     That such applications should be brought promptly      That regard is to be had to the strength and bona fides of the applicant s case      Whether the applicant s impecuniosity was caused by the respondent s conduct subject of the claim      Whether the respondent s application for security is oppressive      Whether there are any persons standing behind the company who are likely to benefit from the litigation and who are willing to provide the necessary security      Whether persons standing behind the company have offered any personal undertaking to be liable for the costs      Is the party against whom security is sought in substance a plaintiff   In my view an award of security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate  In forming this view I take into account the following factors     The first and third applicants were ordered earlier this year to pay the first and second respondents security for costs up to the end of the first day of trial in the sum of

the quantum of costs I have ordered is reasonable in the circumstances  taking into consideration the estimates of the expert witnesses for both parties  the likely length of the resumed hearing and

Stephen Colbran notes in his text Security for Costs  Longman Professional    at   that prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act    UK        Vict  c   security for costs did not apply to past costs and nor would further security be required for a new trial  although an interesting exception to this rule appears to be in the case of Harvey v Jacob     B   Ald     ER   where the plaintiff  having been convicted of a felony and receiving a sentence of transportation to Australia  was ordered to give security for costs retrospective and prospective   However in   the discretion of the Federal Court vested by s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act is very broad  and there is nothing in the terms of either section which would in any way limit the discretion of the Court or its jurisdiction to order security for costs already incurred by the respondents  Indeed  a review of the case law indicates that it is not uncommon for courts to order security for costs already incurred  Examples of cases where such orders have been made are Brocklebank   Co v King s Lynn Steam Ship Co     CPD   Massey v Allen     ChD   JWH Turner   Co Ltd v O Riordan     WN

reasons are as follows     Although the applicants  costs assessor  Mr Graham  has deposed to a view that the trial will take a further three days  as distinct from the seven days which have now been allocated  I do not accept this view  During the   days of trial in November  of which seven days was hearing  Counsel made opening submissions and the evidence of only six witnesses was given  Nine witnesses of the respondent remain to be heard  This includes the second respondent  Mr Strahley  who I anticipate will be in the witness box for some time  Further  the seven days allocated in May   includes closing submissions from Counsel  and dealing with the respondent s objections to the applicants evidence  On two occasions during the second week of the hearing I advised Counsel that I intended to list this matter for a further seven days in May    see TS   November   p   ll     and TS   November   p   ll      I note that on the second occasion the transcript reads that I indicated eight days  however  I believe it was understood by all parties in the room that I meant seven days being the     of May    A listing for this matter for a period of seven days commencing   May   has been made by the Federal Court Registry  At no time did either Counsel demur from this estimation  In my view this is a fair estimate of the time required and the respondents should be entitled to security for costs for seven further hearing days  I have compared the estimates of Mr McLellan in his affidavit filed   March     per day being fees for senior and junior counsel and the professional fees for the lawyers per day of trial  and Mr Graham in his affidavit filed   April       per day being fees for senior and junior counsel  the professional fees for the lawyers and the transcript fees per day of trial   In my view it is reasonable to order     in respect of the seven days of trial remaining      Although the applicants dispute that any security for costs should include further

preparation costs being incurred by the parties prior to the resumption of the hearing  Brown v Rodgers   FCA    It is to be expected that Counsel for the respondents will need to prepare once again

application include costs reasonably incurred both in the litigation and in preparation for the litigation   Re Gibson s Settlement Trusts     All ER   Higgins v Nichol  No       FLR   Liverpool City

applicants suffered no disadvantage whatsoever by the conduct of the respondents in moving for further security in the sum of     on Friday   November   at     pm      The Court may order security for costs already incurred  Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd     FCR        There had been a change of circumstances before the Court which justifies the Court revisiting the issue of security for costs  in particular        it is clear that the hearing of this matter will require   days    as is clear from the evidence of the second applicant  the second applicant and Mrs Tracy controlled  in February   net assets of approximately       in value    Mrs Tracy  is a major beneficiary of the litigation    there is no dispute that Mr Tracy transferred assets out of his name in June         The evidence of Mr Graham  the expert witness in respect of costs for the applicants  is concerning because        he argues legal points in his evidence  which are wrong in law    the Full Court rejected his evidence as to quantum    his second affidavit proceeds on the basis of a number false premises  including that the remaining number of days for the trial to be completed is three days  whereas the joint assessment of Counsel had been to allow seven further days  that no valuation evidence was required  whereas four valuers are giving evidence  no non party disclosure was required from HTW and National Australia Bank  which is not the case  that the solicitors for the respondents would require only   hours to prepare all statements  whereas there are   affidavits  and no allowances were made for Senior Counsel       The evidence of Mr James McLellan  an expert witness in respect of costs for the respondents  assessed the costs  including preparation and hearing  for a   day trial at     the costs per day following being    totalling  for a further eight days being seven days in May   and one day in July        The total amount in costs for the trial is accordingly          As the respondents have already paid     towards security for costs  an order for a further     is appropriate in all the circumstances of this case   In summary  the submissions of the applicants are as follows     Short notice was given by the respondents for this application      It is admitted that the first and third applicants are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings      The respondents have not adduced any new factual evidence in support of the application to justify the costs of          It is inappropriate to consider future costs in light of the affidavit of Mr McLellan      Mr McLellan made no calculation of the costs now claimed  and there is no suggestion that a person experienced in the calculation of legal costs has turned their mind to claims made in items     of the schedule      No authority was cited by the respondents or principle enunciated to support the contention that in exercise of its discretion the Court will order security for costs already incurred  particularly where there has been an earlier unsuccessful application      Mr Graham s evidence is that the daily rate for party and party costs is     making a total of       for the further three days of the trial  Accordingly  in all the circumstances if the Court decides to exercise its discretion to order further security then the appropriate quantum of such security is          The effect of Mr Graham s evidence is that the costs claimed at items       and   of the schedule are not appropriate to form part of an order for security because they have already been incurred and because they have been dealt with by the orders made by the Court on the two previous security for costs applications      In giving his evidence  Mr Graham relies on the fact that all that remains to be done in relation to the witnesses is cross examination and re examination      The facts in Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd were not relevant to this case  further the observations of French J in that case concern the issue of power rather than discretion  Neither Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd nor another case  Southern Cross Exploration NL v Fire and All Ricks Insurance Co Ltd     NSWLR   are authority for the proposition that the Court has power to order security for costs already incurred in the circumstances of this case      The fact that the respondents have relied on previous affidavits filed by them in support of earlier applications for security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing that has occurred since those affidavits were filed      The respondents chose not to cross examine Mr Graham  and in those circumstances Mr Graham s evidence as to the quantum of any appropriate security order is uncontested      There is no admissible evidence before the Court to support the assertion that the trial will take a further seven days to complete  The only admissible evidence which comprehends the extent to which the trial has been heard and the likely further duration of the trial is Mr Graham s evidence in which he gives his expert opinion that the trial will take a further three days to complete  This estimate is based on a consideration of the remaining witnesses to be cross examined by the applicants and has regard to the fact that written submissions are likely to be required      It is inappropriate for the Court to take into account any of the evidence adduced thus far at the trial because the evidence is incomplete and no findings of fact have yet been made  including in relation to whether the third applicant was trading whilst insolvent or whether Mr Tracy had transferred property to which he was beneficially entitled in order to defeat creditors      As the respondent had failed in its most recent application for security for costs   Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   and had not appealed the decision  the decision created an estoppel against a further application based on the facts extant at the date of the order  The policy reason for such an estoppel is that  had the applicants known on the date upon which the Court dismissed the most recent security for costs application that they would have to provide a further     security  they may have elected to discontinue the proceedings at that point  thereby saving the costs of the   day trial because of their inability to meet the further security order  This is prejudice which cannot now be remedied      Mr McLellan s evidence is unhelpful in that it does not contain any assessment of the likely further duration of the trial having regard to the witnesses already dealt with or remaining witnesses  whether the respondents are able to obtain an order for security for incurred costs or whether the respondents are estopped from obtaining further security  or whether the respondents are entitled on a party and party basis to obtain an allowance for preparation for trial more than once   In Australia the substantial weight of authority has rejected any suggestion that a defendant is entitled to an order for security as of right where the impecuniosity of the company has been established  French J in Bryan E Fencott Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd     FCR   at    However the differing approaches are reflected by the broad terms of s   Federal Court Act  and the specific terms of s   Corporations Act which apply where there is evidence that a corporate plaintiff is insolvent  A statutory predecessor of s   was explained by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Harpur v Ariadne     Qd R   at   in the following terms     The mischief at which the provision is aimed is obvious  An individual who conducts his business affairs by medium of a corporation without assets would otherwise be in a position to expose his opponent to a massive bill of costs without hazarding his own assets  The purpose of an order for security is to require him  if not to come out from behind the skirts of the company  at least to bring his own assets into play  If however he is already available for whatever he is worth  the object of the legislation is seen to be satisfied   In my view an award of security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate  In forming this view I take into account the following factors     The first and third applicants were ordered earlier this year to pay the first and second respondents security for costs up to the end of the first day of trial in the sum of     Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd   FCAFC    To paraphrase Emmett J in Checked Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd   FCA   at     for reasons I detail below I do not see any reason at all to depart from the view of the Full Court in making an order that security for costs were payable  and note that the Full Court did not preclude a subsequent application at an appropriate time      The first and third applicants have admitted that they are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings  This admission of the applicants means that under both s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act the Court has a broad discretion  fettered only by the requirement that the Court act judicially  to order the applicant to give security for the payment of the respondent s costs  Branson J in Hopeshore Pty Limited v Melroad Equipment Pty Limited   FCA   at          The application was filed and served on   November   once it was clear that the trial would not finish on   November   and the matter has been adjourned until May    There is no issue of delay in respect of this application in respect of future costs      Although the courts have shown reluctance to order security for future costs in respect of part heard trial  on the basis that  if the applicant cannot provide security  it runs the risk of having wasted costs of the trial days already heard  the fact that the length of the proceedings was not foreseen is a factor which may influence the court to exercise its discretion in ordering security for those costs  see comments of Street CJ in Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at        In my view it is not appropriate to form any views as to the strength of the applicants  case at this stage of the trial  cf comments of Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     at    It is clear however that there are triable issues  and it has not been suggested to me that the case of the applicants is frivolous      Insofar as this application is concerned  it is clear that the first and third applicants are unable to satisfy a costs order  I do not need to go to the evidence which has been heard to be so satisfied  Further  in my view the impropriety of reaching conclusions in this respect works both ways clearly the respondents strongly deny that their conduct has caused the impecuniosity of the first and third applicants  indeed it is a basis of the litigation  and in my view it is not proper at this stage when some  but not all  of the evidence has been heard  to make any findings as to this issue  I believe it is acceptable  however  to note evidence given in Court by Mr Hambleton  the administrator under the third applicant s deed of company arrangement  that in his opinion there was a strong prospect that the third applicant was insolvent from incorporation  TS   November p   ll          Although the applicants contend that the reliance by the respondents on previous material filed in respect of security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing has occurred to justify this application for security for costs  I cannot accept that contention  Plainly  circumstances have altered  A trial which was listed for   days being the best estimate of Counsel as communicated to the Court is now manifestly running over that time  I shall consider this issue later in this judgment in relation to quantum  However I fail to see how the respondents  in relying on evidence of Mr McLellan that the costs for each day beyond   days would be   is a tacit admission of the kind submitted by the applicants  notwithstanding that the affidavit of Mr McLellan was filed   March    In my view the only  admission  of the respondents in this respect is that their trial costs beyond   days would not exceed   per day  and would not increase in the   calendar year      There is no evidence before me that the effect of an order awarding security for costs would be to stultify the litigation  Indeed as was clear during the hearing it would be the second applicant  Mr Tracy  who would be providing any security for costs ordered  TS   November   p   ll      As pointed out by Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd   FCA   at     there is an intrinsic connection between the  stultify factor  and the  persons standing behind  factor as described by Beazley J in KB Cable   That the second applicant and his wife  Mrs Adrienne Tracy  are principal beneficiaries  and in the case of the second applicant  the principal architect  of the litigation before me is also clear from the evidence  for example TS   November   p   ll   TS   November   p   ll     TS   November   p   ll     and exhibit R   Further  that Mr and Mrs Tracy are of considerable means was made clear from evidence before the Court  including a balance sheet describing assets and liabilities of the second applicant  Mrs Tracy and their companies as at   November    exhibit R   The first and third applicants appear to be impecunious  however there is no evidence before me that the second applicant or Mrs Tracy are at a similar financial disadvantage notwithstanding the events which have resulted in the litigation before me  No undertakings have been provided by the second applicant or any other person as to the costs to which the first and third applicants may become liable  Accordingly in such circumstances security for costs may be ordered to ensure that those who stand to benefit from the litigation undertake some of the risks    Rosenfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bain   Co     ACLR   at     Acohs Pty Ltd v Merck Ltd   FCA     Costa Vraca v Bell Regal Pty Ltd   FCA   at

FCA   at          Stephen Colbran notes in his text Security for Costs  Longman Professional    at   that prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act    UK        Vict  c   security for costs did not apply to past costs and nor would further security be required for a new trial  although an interesting exception to this rule appears to be in the case of Harvey v Jacob     B   Ald     ER   where the plaintiff  having been convicted of a felony and receiving a sentence of transportation to Australia  was ordered to give security for costs retrospective and prospective   However in   the discretion of the Federal Court vested by s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act is very broad  and there is nothing in the terms of either section which would in any way limit the discretion of the Court or its jurisdiction to order security for costs already incurred by the respondents  Indeed  a review of the case law indicates that it is not uncommon for courts to order security for costs already incurred  Examples of cases where such orders have been made are Brocklebank   Co v King s Lynn Steam Ship Co     CPD   Massey v Allen     ChD   JWH Turner   Co Ltd v O Riordan     WN  NSW    Estates Property Investment Corporation Ltd v Pooley     ACLR   Procon  Great Britain  Ltd v Provincial Building Co Ltd     WLR   and Bryan E Fencott  and see the discussion of this topic in Colbran at pp       In my view there are  as Hill J said in Equity Access   a number of discretionary issues peculiar to the facts of the present case which are persuade me that it is not appropriate to order that costs of   days of the trial already heard be encompassed in an award for security for costs  They are as follows     In cases where security for costs have been awarded in respect of costs already incurred  there is often a catalyst which distinguishes the case from the usual circumstance where security is awarded in respect of prospective costs  and therefore justifies the application  So  for example        in Pooley   Procon and Bryan E Fencott the retrospectivity of the award for security was not in contention    in Turner and Pooley the respondents had only immediately prior to bringing the application discovered that the applicants were insolvent     In the case before me  no such catalyst is evident      In my view it would be oppressive to require the first and third applicants to now pay security for costs for those   days of trial already held  when they could reasonably rely on the decision in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   as meaning that they were not subject to a security for costs order in respect of that part of the trial  Although Mr Bell on behalf of the respondents made no secret of the fact that  if the trial did not commence within the scheduled time  his clients would be making an application for security for costs in the sum of     in my view to allow the respondents to have security for costs which have already been denied would be unjust in the circumstances      Following on from this point  I note that I had dismissed the application by the first and second respondents for security for costs for that part of the trial just heard  on the basis of delay in bringing that application   Notwithstanding that the matter has now been adjourned  that the respondents indicated that they would seek security for costs if the trial did not get underway  and that the respondents were prompt in renewing their call for security for costs in respect of the trial dates once it was clear that the trial would not conclude within the scheduled   days  nothing has occurred which impacts on the reasons I gave dismissing the application of the respondents in respect of security for costs for the   days of trial      The fact that the trial was not completed within the   days could substantially be attributed to such actions which could properly be laid at the feet of the applicants including the failure of the applicants to comply with earlier directions in relation to exchanging objections to evidence  thus requiring valuable scheduled trial time to be spent dealing with such issues  an adjournment requested by the applicants for the entirety of Wednesday   November   and the failure of a key witness of the applicants to appear at Court which required me to stand down the Court while I considered an appropriate ruling in the circumstances  Having said that  it appeared that  despite my formal direction that the parties seek to resolve objections to evidence in advance of the trial and further attempts by Counsel on this score  the respondents  objections to evidence required two days of trial time which was considerably more than had been anticipated  Further  while no blame at all attaches to Counsel the fact remains that the examination  cross examination and re examination of the second applicant extended over four days  which also appeared to be considerably more than had been anticipated  Accordingly  in light of these developments it would be unfair to lay fault for the failure of the trial to finish during the allotted time completely at the feet of the applicants   I am prepared however to order security in the amount of     being in respect of seven further days of trial and further preparation for the May   hearing  My reasons are as follows     Although the applicants  costs assessor  Mr Graham  has deposed to a view that the trial will take a further three days  as distinct from the seven days which have now been allocated  I do not accept this view  During the   days of trial in November  of which seven days was hearing  Counsel made opening submissions and the evidence of only six witnesses was given  Nine witnesses of the respondent remain to be heard  This includes the second respondent  Mr Strahley  who I anticipate will be in the witness box for some time  Further  the seven days allocated in May   includes closing submissions from Counsel  and dealing with the respondent s objections to the applicants evidence  On two occasions during the second week of the hearing I advised Counsel that I intended to list this matter for a further seven days in May    see TS   November   p   ll     and TS   November   p   ll      I note that on the second occasion the transcript reads that I indicated eight days  however  I believe it was understood by all parties in the room that I meant seven days being the     of May    A listing for this matter for a period of seven days commencing   May   has been made by the Federal Court Registry  At no time did either Counsel demur from this estimation  In my view this is a fair estimate of the time required and the respondents should be entitled to security for costs for seven further hearing days  I have compared the estimates of Mr McLellan in his affidavit filed   March     per day being fees for senior and junior counsel and the professional fees for the lawyers per day of trial  and Mr Graham in his affidavit filed   April       per day being fees for senior and junior counsel  the professional fees for the lawyers and the transcript fees per day of trial   In my view it is reasonable to order     in respect of the seven days of trial remaining      Although the applicants dispute that any security for costs should include further preparation time  in my view it is appropriate to order security to encompass costs for further preparation  Notwithstanding the submission of Mr Perry that

inevitably result in additional preparation costs being incurred by the parties prior to the resumption of the hearing  Brown v Rodgers   FCA    It is to be expected that Counsel for the respondents will need to prepare once again for the May   hearing  This is particularly so in light of the unfortunately lengthy adjournment of this matter from November   to May    In any event  as a general rule  costs of and incidental to an application include costs reasonably incurred both in the litigation and in preparation for the litigation   Re Gibson s Settlement Trusts     All ER   Higgins v

prepared however to order security in the amount of     being in respect of seven further days of trial and further preparation for the May   hearing  My reasons are as follows     Although the applicants  costs assessor  Mr Graham  has deposed to a view that the trial will take a further three days  as distinct from the seven days which have now been allocated  I do not accept this view  During the   days of trial in November  of which seven days was hearing  Counsel made opening submissions and the evidence of only six witnesses was given  Nine witnesses of the respondent remain to be heard  This includes the second respondent  Mr Strahley  who I anticipate will be in the witness box for some time  Further  the seven days allocated in May   includes closing submissions from Counsel  and dealing with the respondent s objections to the applicants evidence  On two occasions during the second week of the hearing I advised Counsel that I intended to list this matter for a further seven days in May    see TS   November   p   ll     and TS   November   p   ll      I note that on the second occasion the transcript reads that I indicated eight days  however  I believe it was understood by all parties in the room that I meant seven days being the     of May    A listing for this matter for a period of seven days commencing   May   has been made by the Federal Court Registry  At no time did either Counsel demur from this estimation  In my view this is a fair estimate of the time required and the respondents should be entitled to security for costs for seven further hearing days  I have compared the estimates of Mr McLellan in his affidavit filed   March     per day being fees for senior and junior counsel and the professional fees for the lawyers per day of trial  and Mr Graham in his affidavit filed   April       per day being fees for senior and junior counsel  the professional fees for the lawyers and the transcript fees per day of trial   In my view it is reasonable to order     in respect of the seven days of trial remaining      Although the applicants dispute that any security for costs should include further preparation time  in my view it is appropriate to order security to encompass costs for further preparation  Notwithstanding the submission of Mr Perry that the applicants  case has now closed and that the majority of the work to be done henceforth is by Counsel for the applicants  TS   November   p   ll     an adjournment part way through the trial will inevitably result in additional preparation costs being incurred by the parties prior to the resumption of the hearing  Brown v Rodgers   FCA    It is to be expected that Counsel for the respondents will need to prepare once again for the May   hearing  This is particularly so in light of the unfortunately lengthy adjournment of this matter from November   to May    In any event  as a general rule  costs of and incidental to an application include costs reasonably incurred both in the litigation and in preparation for the litigation   Re Gibson s Settlement Trusts     All ER   Higgins v Nichol  No       FLR   Liverpool City Council v Commonwealth of Australia     FCR   and I also note O   r   which contemplates preparation costs included in a taxation   It is reasonable that an award of security for costs should include preparation as well as trial time  The Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd   FCA    In this matter the respondents claim five days preparation  Mr McLellan estimates preparation by senior and junior counsel at   per day in total  Although the applicants dispute that further preparation for the trial is recoverable by the respondents  I note that in the affidavit of Mr Graham filed   April   Mr Graham accepts the daily rate for preparation by Counsel except to the extent that the figure should be discounted by   per cent on the basis that no allowance should be made for GST  In my view it is reasonable to order the first and third applicants to pay security for costs in the sum of     in respect of preparation      In making an order for security for costs the Court does not set out to give a complete and certain indemnity to a respondent  nor is it to be assumed that the applicant will fail in the proceeding  Brundza v Robbie   Co  No     HCA         CLR   at   Menhaden Pty Ltd v

that  if the applicant cannot provide security  it runs the risk of having wasted costs of the trial days already heard  the fact that the length of the proceedings was not foreseen is a factor which may influence the court to exercise its discretion in ordering security for those costs  see comments of Street CJ in Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at        In my view it is not appropriate to form any views as to the strength of the applicants  case at this stage of the trial  cf comments of Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     at    It is clear however that there are triable issues  and it has not been suggested to me that the case of the applicants is frivolous      Insofar as this application is concerned  it is clear that the first and third applicants are unable to satisfy a costs order  I do not need to go to the evidence which has been heard to be so satisfied  Further  in my view the impropriety of reaching conclusions in this respect works both ways clearly the respondents strongly deny that their conduct has caused the impecuniosity of the first and third applicants  indeed it is a basis of the litigation  and in my view it is not proper at this stage when some  but not all  of the evidence has been heard  to make any findings as to this issue  I believe it is acceptable  however  to note evidence given in

incorporation  TS   November p   ll          Although the applicants contend that the reliance by the respondents on previous material filed in respect of security for costs is a tacit admission that

amendment to his evidence  and other unforeseen complications during the course of the two weeks of the trial  which re commenced   November   following the adjournment in July   the hearing of the matter was not completed during the time allocated   In summary  the submissions of the applicants are as follows     Short notice was given by the respondents for this application      It is admitted that the first and third applicants are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings      The respondents have not adduced any new factual evidence in support of the application to justify the costs of          It is inappropriate to consider future costs in light of the affidavit of Mr McLellan      Mr McLellan made no calculation of the costs now claimed  and there is no suggestion that a person experienced in the calculation of legal costs has turned their mind to claims made in items     of the schedule      No authority was cited by the respondents or principle enunciated to support the contention that in exercise of its discretion the Court will order security for costs already incurred  particularly where there has been an earlier unsuccessful application      Mr Graham s evidence is that the daily rate for party and party costs is     making a total of       for the further three days of the trial  Accordingly  in all the circumstances if the Court decides to exercise its discretion to order further security then the appropriate quantum of such security is          The effect of Mr Graham s evidence is that the costs claimed at items       and   of the schedule are not appropriate to form part of an order for security because they have already been incurred and because they have been dealt with by the orders made by the Court on the two previous security for costs applications      In giving his evidence  Mr Graham relies on the fact that all that remains to be done in relation to the witnesses is cross examination and re examination      The facts in Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd were not relevant to this case  further the observations of French J in that case concern the issue of power rather than discretion  Neither Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd nor another case  Southern Cross Exploration NL v Fire and All Ricks Insurance Co Ltd     NSWLR   are authority for the proposition that the Court has power to order security for costs already incurred in the circumstances of this case      The fact that the respondents have relied on previous affidavits filed by them in support of earlier applications for security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing that has occurred since those affidavits were filed      The respondents chose not to cross examine Mr Graham  and in those circumstances Mr Graham s evidence as to the quantum of any appropriate security order is uncontested      There is no admissible evidence before the Court to support the assertion that the trial will take a further seven days to complete  The only admissible evidence which comprehends the extent to which the trial has been heard and the likely further duration of the trial is Mr Graham s evidence in which he gives his expert opinion that the trial will take a further three days to complete  This estimate is based on a consideration of the remaining witnesses to be cross examined by the applicants and has regard to the fact that written submissions are likely to be required      It is inappropriate for the Court to take into account any of the evidence adduced thus far at the trial because the evidence is incomplete and no findings of fact have yet been made  including in relation to whether the third applicant was trading whilst insolvent or whether Mr Tracy had transferred property to which he was beneficially entitled in order to defeat creditors      As the respondent had failed in its most recent application for security for costs   Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   and had not appealed the decision  the decision created an estoppel against a further application based on the facts extant at the date of the order  The policy reason for such an estoppel is that  had the applicants known on the date upon which the Court dismissed the most recent security for costs application that they would have to provide a further     security  they may have elected to discontinue the proceedings at that point  thereby saving the costs of the   day trial because of their inability to meet the further security order  This is prejudice which cannot now be remedied      Mr McLellan s evidence is unhelpful in that it does not contain any assessment of the likely further duration of the trial having regard to the witnesses already dealt with or remaining witnesses  whether the respondents are able to obtain an order for security for incurred costs or whether the respondents are estopped from obtaining further security  or whether the respondents are entitled on a party and party basis to obtain an allowance for preparation for trial more than once   As I have already noted  the respondents brought an application for security for trial costs   days before the trial was due to re commence  which application I heard two days before the trial re commenced  I held that  in the circumstances  the delay in bringing the further application was unacceptable  and dismissed the application  Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA    Clearly in making that order I did not preclude any subsequent application for security for costs   In my view there are  as Hill J said in Equity Access   a number of discretionary issues peculiar to the facts of the present case which are persuade me that it is not appropriate to order that costs of   days of the trial already heard be encompassed in an award for security for costs  They are as follows     In cases where security for costs have been awarded in respect of costs already incurred  there is often a catalyst which distinguishes the case from the usual circumstance where security is awarded in respect of prospective costs  and therefore justifies the application  So  for example        in Pooley   Procon and Bryan E Fencott the retrospectivity of the award for security was not in contention    in Turner and Pooley the respondents had only immediately prior to bringing the application discovered that the applicants were insolvent     In the case before me  no such catalyst is evident      In my view it would be oppressive to require the first and third applicants to now pay security for costs for those   days of trial already held  when they could reasonably rely on the decision in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   as meaning that they were not subject to a security for costs order in respect of that part of the trial  Although Mr Bell on behalf of the respondents made no secret of the fact that  if the trial did not commence within the scheduled time  his clients would be making an application for security for costs in the sum of     in my view to allow the respondents to have security for costs which have already been denied would be unjust in the circumstances      Following on from this point  I note that I had dismissed the application by the first and second respondents for security for costs for that part of the trial just heard  on the basis of delay in bringing that application   Notwithstanding that the matter has now been adjourned  that the respondents indicated that they would seek security for costs if the trial did not get underway  and that the respondents were prompt in renewing their call for security for costs in respect of the trial dates once it was clear that the trial would not conclude within the scheduled   days  nothing has occurred which impacts on the reasons I gave dismissing the application of the respondents in respect of security for costs for the   days of trial      The fact that the trial was not completed within the   days could substantially be attributed to such actions which could properly be laid at the feet of the applicants including the failure of the applicants to comply with earlier directions in relation to exchanging objections to evidence  thus requiring valuable scheduled trial time to be spent dealing with such issues  an adjournment requested by the applicants for the entirety of Wednesday   November   and the failure of a key witness of the applicants to appear at Court which required me to stand down the Court while I considered an appropriate ruling in the circumstances  Having said that  it appeared that  despite my formal direction that the parties seek to resolve objections to evidence in advance of the trial and further attempts by Counsel on this score  the respondents  objections to evidence required two days of trial time which was considerably more than had been anticipated  Further  while no blame at all attaches to Counsel the fact remains that the examination  cross examination and re examination of the second applicant extended over four days  which also appeared to be considerably more than had been anticipated  Accordingly  in light of these developments it would be unfair to lay fault for the failure of the trial to finish during the allotted time completely at the feet of the applicants citedCosta Vraca v Bell Regal Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my view an award of security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate  In forming this view I take into account the following factors     The first and third applicants were ordered

Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     at   are     Whether there are aspects of public interest which weigh in the balance against the making of an order  and     Whether there are any particular discretionary matters peculiar to the circumstances of the case   Obviously the factors of the individual case will to a significant degree determine the outcome because it is incumbent on the judge  in exercising discretion  to consider the circumstances of the case at hand   The first and second respondents have sought an order for an award of security for costs in respect of their costs of these proceedings  essentially those not covered by the previous order of the Full Court  The onus is on them to satisfy the Court that it is a proper exercise of the Court s discretion to make such an order  It is clear that the costs represented in their application relate to costs incurred both during the   days of trial already held  and future costs  I propose to deal first with security in respect of costs yet to be incurred  and then consider the application of the respondents in respect of costs incurred during the   days of trial already held   In my view an award of security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate  In forming this view I take into account the following factors     The first and third applicants were ordered

To paraphrase Emmett J in Checked Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd   FCA   at     for reasons I detail below I do not see any reason at all to depart from the view of the Full Court in making an order that security for costs were payable  and note that the Full Court did not preclude a subsequent application at an appropriate time      The first and third applicants have admitted that they are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings  This admission of the applicants means that under both s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act the Court has a broad discretion  fettered only by the requirement that the Court act judicially  to order the applicant to give security for the payment of the respondent s costs  Branson J in Hopeshore Pty Limited v Melroad Equipment Pty Limited   FCA   at          The application was filed and served on   November   once it was clear that the trial would not finish on   November   and the matter has been adjourned until May    There is no issue of delay in respect of this application in respect of future costs      Although the courts have shown reluctance to order security for future costs in respect of part heard trial  on the basis that  if the applicant cannot provide security  it runs the risk of having wasted costs of the trial days already heard  the fact that the length of the proceedings was not foreseen is a factor which may influence the court to exercise its discretion in ordering security for those costs  see comments of Street CJ in Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at        In my view it is not appropriate to form any views as to the strength of the applicants  case at this stage of the trial  cf comments of Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     at    It is clear however that there are triable issues  and it has not been suggested to me that the case of the applicants is frivolous      Insofar as this application is concerned  it is clear that the first and third applicants are unable to satisfy a costs order  I do not need to go to the evidence which has been heard to be so satisfied  Further  in my view the impropriety of reaching conclusions in this respect works both ways clearly the respondents strongly deny that their conduct has caused the impecuniosity of the first and third applicants  indeed it is a basis of the litigation  and in my view it is not proper at this stage when some  but not all  of the evidence has been heard  to make any findings as to this issue  I believe it is acceptable  however  to note evidence given in Court by Mr Hambleton  the administrator under the third applicant s deed of company arrangement  that in his opinion there was a strong prospect that the third applicant was insolvent from incorporation  TS   November p   ll          Although the applicants contend that the reliance by the respondents on previous material filed in respect of security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing has occurred to justify this application for security for costs  I cannot accept that contention  Plainly  circumstances have altered  A trial which was listed for   days being the best estimate of Counsel as communicated to the Court is now manifestly running over that time  I shall consider this issue later in this judgment in relation to quantum  However I fail to see how the respondents  in relying on evidence of Mr McLellan that the costs for each day beyond   days would be   is a tacit admission of the kind submitted by the applicants  notwithstanding that the affidavit of Mr McLellan was filed   March    In my view the only  admission  of the respondents in this respect is that their trial costs beyond   days would not exceed   per day  and would not increase in the   calendar year      There is no evidence before me that the effect of an order awarding security for costs would be to stultify the litigation  Indeed as was clear during the hearing it would be the second applicant  Mr Tracy  who would be providing any security for costs ordered  TS   November   p   ll      As pointed out by Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd   FCA   at     there is an intrinsic connection between the  stultify factor  and the  persons standing behind  factor as described by Beazley J in KB Cable   That the second applicant and his wife  Mrs Adrienne Tracy  are principal beneficiaries  and in the case of the second applicant  the principal architect  of the litigation before me is also clear from the evidence  for example TS   November   p   ll   TS   November   p   ll     TS   November   p   ll     and exhibit R   Further  that Mr and Mrs Tracy are of considerable means was made clear from evidence before the Court  including a balance sheet describing assets and liabilities of the second applicant  Mrs Tracy and their companies as at   November    exhibit R   The first and third applicants appear to be impecunious  however there is no evidence before me that the second applicant or Mrs Tracy are at a similar financial disadvantage notwithstanding the events which have resulted in the litigation before me  No undertakings have been provided by the second applicant or any other person as to the costs to which the first and third applicants may become liable  Accordingly in such circumstances security for costs may be ordered to ensure that those who stand to benefit from the litigation undertake some of the risks    Rosenfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bain   Co

Fencott Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd     FCR   at   Interline Hydrocarbon at   Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd   FCA   at          This application is of particular interest because it has been brought   days into a trial which has been adjourned and is expected to run another seven days  Two cases where similar applications were brought are Southern Cross Exploration and Equity Access    In Equity Access the matter was heard for three days  and then adjourned for two months when it was expected to continue for a further two and a half days  Hill J  in declining to make an order for security for costs in respect of the two and a half days of trial already heard  said     Weighing all the factors as best I can  the appropriate conclusion seems to me that the Court should order that  assuming the applicant s financial position to remain as it is  without the injection of further capital  the applicant provide security for costs  not in respect of the proceedings now past  but in respect of the remaining two and a half days of hearing yet to come  I so conclude because it seems relatively clear at the moment that the applicant could not meet an order for costs if such were made even in respect of the costs not yet incurred  There is some evidence of intention that the capital of the company will be increased and that as a result the company might then be able to meet the costs of the proceedings       ATPR     at   In my view there are  as Hill J said in Equity Access   a number of discretionary issues peculiar to the facts of the present case which are persuade me that it is not appropriate to order that costs of   days of the trial already heard be encompassed in an award for security for costs  They are as follows     In cases where security for costs have been awarded in respect of costs already incurred  there is often a catalyst which distinguishes the case from the usual circumstance where security is awarded in respect of prospective costs  and therefore justifies the application  So  for example        in Pooley   Procon and Bryan E Fencott the retrospectivity of the award for security was not in contention    in Turner and Pooley the respondents had only immediately prior to bringing the application discovered that the applicants were insolvent     In the case before me  no such catalyst is evident      In my view it would be oppressive to require the first and third applicants to now pay security for costs for those   days of trial already held  when they could reasonably rely on the decision in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   as meaning that they were not subject to a security for costs order in respect of that part of the trial  Although Mr Bell on behalf of the respondents made no secret of the fact that  if the trial did not commence within the scheduled time  his clients would be making an application for security for costs in the sum of     in my view to allow the respondents to have security for costs which have already been denied would be unjust in the circumstances      Following on from this point  I note that I had dismissed the application by the first and second respondents for security for costs for that part of the trial just heard  on the basis of delay in bringing that application   Notwithstanding that the matter has now been adjourned  that the respondents indicated that they would seek security for costs if the trial did not get underway  and that the respondents were prompt in renewing their call for security for costs in respect of the trial dates once it was clear that the trial would not conclude within the scheduled   days  nothing has occurred which impacts on the reasons I gave dismissing the application of the respondents in respect of security for costs for the   days of trial      The fact that the trial was not completed within the   days could substantially be attributed to such actions which could properly be laid at the feet of the applicants including the failure of the applicants to comply with earlier directions in relation to exchanging objections to evidence  thus requiring valuable scheduled trial time to be spent dealing with such issues  an adjournment requested by the applicants for the entirety of Wednesday   November   and the failure of a key witness of the applicants to appear at Court which required me to stand down the Court while I considered an appropriate ruling in the circumstances  Having said that  it appeared that  despite my formal direction that the parties seek to resolve objections to evidence in advance of the trial and further attempts by Counsel on this score  the respondents  objections to evidence required two days of trial time which was considerably more than had been anticipated  Further  while no blame at all attaches to Counsel the fact remains that the examination  cross examination and re examination of the second applicant extended over four days  which also appeared to be considerably more than had been anticipated  Accordingly  in light of these developments it would be unfair to lay fault for the failure of the trial to finish during the allotted time completely at the feet of the applicants   Like Waddell J in Southern Cross and Hill J in Equity Access   weighing all the factors as best I can  in my view the appropriate conclusion in this case is that the respondents are entitled to an award for security for costs in respect of future costs  but not in respect of costs for that part of the trial recently heard distinguishedEstates Property Investment Corporation Ltd v Pooley     ACLR   Stephen Colbran notes in his text Security for Costs  Longman Professional    at   that prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act    UK        Vict  c   security for costs did not apply to past costs and nor would further security be required for a new trial  although an interesting exception to this rule appears to be in the case of Harvey v Jacob     B   Ald     ER   where the plaintiff  having been convicted of a felony and receiving a sentence of transportation to Australia  was ordered to give security for costs retrospective and prospective   However in   the discretion of the Federal Court vested by s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act is very broad  and there is nothing in the terms of either section which would in any way limit the discretion of the Court or its jurisdiction to order security for costs already incurred by the respondents  Indeed  a review of the case law indicates that it is not uncommon for courts to order security for costs already incurred  Examples of cases where such orders have been made are Brocklebank   Co v King s Lynn Steam Ship Co     CPD   Massey v

corporation without assets would otherwise be in a position to expose his opponent to a massive bill of costs without hazarding his own assets  The purpose of an order for security is to require him

citedHiggins v Nichol  No       FLR   I am prepared however to order security in the amount of     being in respect of seven further days of trial and further preparation for the May   hearing  My reasons are as follows     Although the applicants  costs assessor  Mr Graham  has deposed to a view that the trial will take a further three days  as distinct from the seven days which have now been allocated  I do not accept this view  During the   days of trial in November  of which seven days was hearing  Counsel made opening submissions and the evidence of only six witnesses was given  Nine witnesses of the respondent remain to be heard  This includes the second respondent  Mr Strahley  who I anticipate will be in the witness box for some time  Further  the seven days allocated in May   includes closing submissions from Counsel  and dealing with the respondent s objections to the applicants evidence  On two occasions during the second week of the hearing I advised Counsel that I intended to list this matter for a further seven days in May    see TS   November   p   ll     and TS   November   p   ll      I note that on the second occasion the transcript reads that I indicated eight days  however  I believe it was understood by all parties in the room that I meant seven days being the     of May    A listing for this matter for a period of seven days commencing   May   has been made by the Federal Court Registry  At no time did either Counsel demur from this estimation  In my view this is a fair estimate of the time required and the respondents should be entitled to security for costs for seven further hearing days  I have compared the estimates of Mr McLellan in his affidavit filed   March     per day being fees for senior and junior counsel and the professional fees for the lawyers per day of trial  and Mr Graham in his affidavit filed   April       per day being fees for senior and junior counsel  the professional fees for the lawyers and the transcript fees per day of trial   In my view it is reasonable to order     in respect of the seven days of trial remaining      Although the applicants dispute that any security for costs should include further preparation time  in my view it is appropriate to order security to encompass costs for further preparation  Notwithstanding the submission of Mr Perry that the applicants  case has now closed and that the majority of the work to be done henceforth is by Counsel for the applicants  TS   November   p   ll     an adjournment part way through the trial will inevitably result in additional preparation costs being incurred by the parties prior to the resumption of the hearing  Brown v Rodgers   FCA    It is to be expected that Counsel for the respondents will need to prepare once again for the May   hearing  This is particularly so in light of the unfortunately lengthy adjournment of this matter from November   to May    In any event  as a general rule  costs of and incidental to an application include costs reasonably incurred both in the litigation and in preparation for the litigation   Re Gibson s Settlement Trusts     All ER   Higgins v Nichol  No       FLR   Liverpool City Council v Commonwealth of Australia     FCR   and I also note O   r   which contemplates preparation costs included in a taxation   It is reasonable that an award of security for costs should include preparation as well as trial time  The Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd   FCA    In this matter the respondents claim five days preparation  Mr McLellan estimates preparation by senior and junior counsel at   per day in total  Although the applicants dispute that further preparation for the trial is recoverable by the respondents  I note that in the affidavit of Mr Graham filed   April   Mr Graham accepts the daily rate for preparation by Counsel except to the extent that the figure should be discounted by   per cent on the basis that no allowance should be made for GST  In my view it is reasonable to order the first and third applicants to pay security for costs in the sum of     in respect of preparation      In making an order for security for costs the Court does not set out to give a complete and certain indemnity to a respondent  nor is it to be assumed that the applicant will fail in the proceeding  Brundza v Robbie   Co  No     HCA         CLR   at

of Costs LexisNexis Butterworths   at p   the protective object of an order for security for costs is well known  As Einstein J said in Idoport Pty Limited   Anor v National Australia Bank Limited   NSWSC   at        The purpose of a security for costs order is therefore a protective jurisdiction to ensure that the primary purposes for having costs orders themselves  can be achieved  A defendant is protected against the risk that a costs order obtained at the end of the day may turn out to be of no value by reason of the impecuniosity of the plaintiff   As submitted by Counsel in Idoport in my view correctly the jurisdiction to award security for costs should thus be seen as protecting the efficacy of the exercise of the jurisdiction to award costs and it is undesirable for the court to

FCA   at         distinguishedJWH Turner   Co Ltd v O Riordan     WN  NSW    Stephen Colbran notes in his text Security for Costs  Longman Professional    at   that prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act    UK        Vict  c   security for costs did not apply to past costs and nor would further security be required for a new trial  although an interesting exception to this rule appears to be in the case of Harvey v Jacob     B   Ald     ER   where the plaintiff  having been convicted of a felony and receiving a sentence of transportation to Australia  was ordered to give security for costs retrospective and prospective   However in   the discretion of the Federal Court vested by s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act is very broad  and there is nothing in the terms of either section which would in any way limit the discretion of the Court or its jurisdiction to order security for costs already incurred by the respondents  Indeed  a review of the case law indicates that it is not uncommon for courts to order security for costs already incurred  Examples of cases where such orders have been made are Brocklebank   Co v King s Lynn Steam Ship Co     CPD   Massey v Allen     ChD   JWH Turner   Co Ltd v O Riordan     WN  NSW    Estates Property Investment Corporation Ltd v Pooley     ACLR   Procon  Great Britain  Ltd v Provincial Building Co Ltd     WLR   and Bryan E Fencott  and see the discussion of this topic in Colbran at pp       In my view there are  as Hill J said in Equity Access   a number of discretionary issues peculiar to the facts of the present case which are persuade me that it is not appropriate to order that costs of   days of the trial already heard be encompassed in an award for security for costs  They are as follows     In cases where security for costs have been awarded in respect of costs already incurred  there is often a catalyst which distinguishes the case from the usual circumstance where security is awarded in respect of prospective costs  and therefore justifies the application  So  for example        in Pooley   Procon and Bryan E Fencott the retrospectivity of the award for security was not in contention    in Turner and Pooley the respondents had only immediately prior to bringing the application discovered that the applicants were insolvent     In the case before me  no such catalyst is evident      In my view it would be oppressive to require the first and third applicants to now pay security for costs for those   days of trial already held  when they could reasonably rely on the decision in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   as meaning that they were not subject to a security for costs order in respect of that part of the trial  Although Mr Bell on behalf of the respondents made no secret of the fact that  if the trial did not commence within the scheduled time  his clients would be making an application for security for costs in the sum of     in my view to allow the respondents to have security for costs which have already been denied would be unjust in the circumstances      Following on from this point  I note that I had dismissed the application by the first and second respondents for security for costs for that part of the trial just heard  on the basis of delay in bringing that application   Notwithstanding that the matter has now been adjourned  that the respondents indicated that they would seek security for costs if the trial did not get underway  and that the respondents were prompt in renewing their call for security for costs in respect of the trial dates once it was clear that the trial would not conclude within the scheduled   days  nothing has occurred which impacts on the reasons I gave dismissing the application of the respondents in respect of security for costs for the   days of trial      The fact that the trial was not completed within the   days could substantially be attributed to such actions which could properly be laid at the feet of the applicants including the failure of the applicants to comply with earlier directions in relation to exchanging objections to evidence  thus requiring valuable scheduled trial time to be spent dealing with such issues  an adjournment requested by the applicants for the entirety of Wednesday   November   and the failure of a key witness of the applicants to appear at Court which required me to stand down the Court while I considered an appropriate ruling in the circumstances  Having said that  it appeared that  despite my formal direction that the parties seek to resolve objections to evidence in advance of the trial and further attempts by Counsel on this score  the respondents  objections to evidence required two days of trial time which was considerably more than had been anticipated  Further  while no blame at all attaches to Counsel the fact remains that the examination  cross examination and re examination of the second applicant extended over four days  which also appeared to be considerably more than had been anticipated  Accordingly  in light of these developments it would be unfair to lay fault for the failure of the trial to finish during the allotted time completely at the feet of the applicants appliedKP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd     FCR   It is well settled that the court is vested with a discretion to award or not security for costs  and that the power is wide with the need to exercise the discretion judicially being the only relevant limitation   Bell Wholesale at    However  useful guidelines which courts typically take into account in determining such applications were listed by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd     FCR   at     as follows     That such applications should be brought promptly      That regard is to be had to the strength and bona fides of the applicant s case      Whether the applicant s impecuniosity was caused by the respondent s conduct subject of the claim      Whether the respondent s application for security is oppressive      Whether there are any persons standing behind the company who are likely to

the courts have traditionally adopted different approaches to individual applicants and corporate applicants  The approach was summarised by Megarry VC in Pearson v Naydler     WLR   at   as follows     In relation to security for costs  there seems to me to be an essential distinction between natural persons and limited companies as plaintiffs  For a natural person  the basic rule is that he will not be ordered to give security for costs  however poor he is    In the case of a limited company  there is no basic rule conferring immunity from any liability to give security for costs  The basic rule is the opposite    citedPhoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd     FCA   For similar statements considering the purpose of an award of security for costs  see Lord Aldborough v Burton

distinguishedProcon  Great Britain  Ltd v Provincial Building Co Ltd     WLR   Stephen Colbran notes in his text Security for Costs  Longman Professional    at   that prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act    UK        Vict  c   security for costs did not apply to past costs and nor would further security be required for a new trial  although an interesting exception to this rule appears to be in the case of Harvey v Jacob     B   Ald     ER   where the plaintiff  having been convicted of a felony and receiving a sentence of transportation to Australia  was ordered to give security for costs retrospective and prospective   However in   the discretion of the Federal Court vested by s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act is very broad  and there is nothing in the terms of either section which would in any way limit the discretion of the Court or its jurisdiction to order security for costs already incurred by the respondents  Indeed  a review of the case law indicates that it is not uncommon for courts to order security for costs already incurred  Examples of cases where such orders have been made are Brocklebank   Co v King s Lynn Steam Ship Co     CPD   Massey v Allen     ChD   JWH Turner   Co Ltd v O Riordan     WN  NSW    Estates Property Investment Corporation Ltd v Pooley     ACLR   Procon  Great Britain  Ltd v Provincial Building Co Ltd     WLR   and Bryan E Fencott  and see the discussion of this topic in Colbran at pp       In my view there are  as Hill J said in Equity Access   a number of discretionary issues peculiar to the facts of the present case which are persuade me that it is not appropriate to order that costs of   days of the trial already heard be encompassed in an award for security for costs  They are as follows     In cases where security for costs have been awarded in respect of costs already incurred  there is often a catalyst which distinguishes the case from the usual circumstance where security is awarded in respect of prospective costs  and therefore justifies the application  So  for example        in Pooley   Procon and Bryan E Fencott the retrospectivity of the award for security was not in contention    in Turner and Pooley the respondents had only immediately prior to bringing the application discovered that the applicants were insolvent     In the case before me  no such catalyst is evident      In my view it would be oppressive to require the first and third applicants to now pay security for costs for those   days of trial already held  when they could reasonably rely on the decision in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   as meaning that they were not subject to a security for costs order in respect of that part of the trial  Although Mr Bell on behalf of the respondents made no secret of the fact that  if the trial did not commence within the scheduled time  his clients would be making an application for security for costs in the sum of     in my view to allow the respondents to have security for costs which have already been denied would be unjust in the circumstances      Following on from this point  I note that I had dismissed the application by the first and second respondents for security for costs for that part of the trial just heard  on the basis of delay in bringing that application   Notwithstanding that the matter has now been adjourned  that the respondents indicated that they would seek security for costs if the trial did not get underway  and that the respondents were prompt in renewing their call for security for costs in respect of the trial dates once it was clear that the trial would not conclude within the scheduled   days  nothing has occurred which impacts on the reasons I gave dismissing the application of the respondents in respect of security for costs for the   days of trial      The fact that the trial was not completed within the   days could substantially be attributed to such actions which could properly be laid at the feet of the applicants including the failure of the applicants to comply with earlier directions in relation to exchanging objections to evidence  thus requiring valuable scheduled trial time to be spent dealing with such issues  an adjournment requested by the applicants for the entirety of Wednesday   November   and the failure of a key witness of the applicants to appear at Court which required me to stand down the Court while I considered an appropriate ruling in the circumstances  Having said that  it appeared that  despite my formal direction that the parties seek to resolve objections to evidence in advance of the trial and further attempts by Counsel on this score  the respondents  objections to evidence required two days of trial time which was considerably more than had been anticipated  Further  while no blame at all attaches to Counsel the fact remains that the examination  cross examination and re examination of the second applicant extended over four days  which also appeared to be considerably more than had been anticipated  Accordingly  in light of these developments it would be unfair to lay fault for the failure of the trial to finish during the allotted time completely at the feet of the applicants citedRe Energy Drilling Inc   unreported  Federal Court of Australia  Gummow J    May    For similar

security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate  In forming this view I take into account the following factors     The first and third applicants were ordered earlier this year to pay the first and second respondents security for costs up to the end of the first day of trial in the sum of     Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd   FCAFC    To paraphrase Emmett J in Checked Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd   FCA   at     for reasons I detail below I do not see any reason at all to depart from the view of the Full Court in making an order that security for costs were payable  and note that the Full Court did not preclude a subsequent application at an appropriate time      The first and third applicants have admitted that they are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings  This admission of the applicants means that under both s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act the Court has a broad discretion  fettered only by the requirement that the Court act judicially  to order the applicant to give security for the payment of the respondent s costs  Branson J in Hopeshore Pty Limited v Melroad Equipment Pty Limited   FCA   at          The application was filed and served on   November   once it was clear that the trial would not finish on   November   and the matter has been adjourned until May    There is no issue of delay in respect of this application in respect of future costs      Although the courts have shown reluctance to order security for future costs in respect of part heard trial  on the basis that  if the applicant cannot provide security  it runs the risk of having wasted costs of the trial days already heard  the fact that the length of the proceedings was not foreseen is a factor which may influence the court to exercise its discretion in ordering security for those costs  see comments of Street CJ in Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at        In my view it is not appropriate to form any views as to the strength of the applicants  case at this stage of the trial  cf comments of Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     at    It is clear however that there are triable issues  and it has not been suggested to me that the case of the applicants is frivolous      Insofar as this application is concerned  it is clear that the first and third applicants are unable to satisfy a costs order  I do not need to go to the evidence which has been heard to be so satisfied  Further  in my view the impropriety of reaching conclusions in this respect works both ways clearly the respondents strongly deny that their conduct has caused the impecuniosity of the first and third applicants  indeed it is a basis of the litigation  and in my view it is not proper at this stage when some  but not all  of the evidence has been heard  to make any findings as to this issue  I believe it is acceptable  however  to note evidence given in Court by Mr Hambleton  the administrator under the third applicant s deed of company arrangement  that in his opinion there was a strong prospect that the third applicant was insolvent from incorporation  TS   November p   ll          Although the applicants contend that the reliance by the respondents on previous material filed in respect of security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing has occurred to justify this application for security for costs  I cannot accept that contention  Plainly  circumstances have altered  A trial which was listed for   days being the best estimate of Counsel as communicated to the Court is now manifestly running over that time  I shall consider this issue later in this judgment in relation to quantum  However I fail to see how the respondents  in relying on evidence of Mr McLellan that the costs for each day beyond   days would be   is a tacit admission of the kind submitted by the applicants  notwithstanding that the affidavit of Mr McLellan was filed   March    In my view the only  admission  of the respondents in this respect is that their trial costs beyond   days would not exceed   per day  and would not increase in the   calendar year      There is no evidence before me that the effect of an order awarding security for costs would be to stultify the litigation  Indeed as was clear during the hearing it would be the second applicant  Mr Tracy  who would be providing any security for costs ordered  TS   November   p   ll      As pointed out by Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd   FCA   at     there is an intrinsic connection between the  stultify factor  and the  persons standing behind  factor as described by Beazley J in KB Cable   That the second applicant and his wife  Mrs Adrienne Tracy  are principal beneficiaries  and in the case of the second applicant  the principal architect  of the litigation before me is also clear from the evidence  for example TS   November   p   ll   TS   November   p   ll     TS   November   p   ll     and exhibit R   Further  that Mr and Mrs Tracy are of considerable means was made clear from evidence before the Court  including a balance sheet describing assets and liabilities of the second applicant  Mrs Tracy and their companies as at   November    exhibit R   The first and third applicants appear to be impecunious  however there is no evidence before me that the second applicant or Mrs Tracy are at a similar financial disadvantage notwithstanding the events which have resulted in the litigation before me  No undertakings have been provided by the second applicant or any other person as to the costs to which the first and third applicants may become liable  Accordingly in such circumstances security for costs may be ordered to ensure that those who stand to benefit from the litigation undertake some of the risks    Rosenfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bain   Co

Insurance Co Ltd     NSWLR   In summary  the submissions of the applicants are as follows     Short notice was given by the respondents for this application      It is admitted that the first and third applicants are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings      The respondents have not adduced any new factual evidence in support of the application to justify the costs of          It is inappropriate to consider future costs in light of the affidavit of Mr McLellan      Mr McLellan made no calculation of the costs now claimed  and there is no suggestion that a person experienced in the calculation of legal costs has turned their mind to claims made in items     of the schedule      No authority was cited by the respondents or principle enunciated to support the contention that in exercise of its discretion the Court will order security for costs already incurred  particularly where there has been an earlier unsuccessful application      Mr Graham s evidence is that the daily rate for party and party costs is     making a total of       for the further three days of the trial  Accordingly  in all the circumstances if the Court decides to exercise its discretion to order further security then the appropriate quantum of such security is          The effect of Mr Graham s evidence is that the costs claimed at items       and   of the schedule are not appropriate to form part of an order for security because they have already been incurred and because they have been dealt with by the orders made by the Court on the two previous security for costs applications      In giving his evidence  Mr Graham relies on the fact that all that remains to be done in relation to the witnesses is cross examination and re examination      The facts in Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd were not relevant to this case  further the observations of French J in that case concern the issue of power rather than discretion  Neither Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd nor another case  Southern Cross Exploration NL v Fire and All Ricks Insurance Co Ltd     NSWLR   are authority for the proposition that the Court has power to order security for costs already incurred in the circumstances of this case      The fact that the respondents have relied on previous affidavits filed by them in support of earlier applications for security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing that has occurred since those affidavits were filed      The respondents chose not to cross examine Mr Graham  and in those circumstances Mr Graham s evidence as to the quantum of any appropriate security order is uncontested      There is no admissible evidence before the Court to support the assertion that the trial will take a further seven days to complete  The only admissible evidence which comprehends the extent to which the trial has been heard and the likely further duration of the trial is Mr Graham s evidence in which he gives his expert opinion that the trial will take a further three days to complete  This estimate is based on a consideration of the remaining witnesses to be cross examined by the applicants and has regard to the fact that written submissions are likely to be required      It is inappropriate for the Court to take into account any of the evidence adduced thus far at the trial because the evidence is incomplete and no findings of fact have yet been made  including in relation to whether the third applicant was trading whilst insolvent or whether Mr Tracy had transferred property to which he was beneficially entitled in order to defeat creditors      As the respondent had failed in its most recent application for security for costs   Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   and had not appealed the decision  the decision created an estoppel against a further application based on the facts extant at the date of the order  The policy reason for such an estoppel is that  had the applicants known on the date upon which the Court dismissed the most recent security for costs application that they would have to provide a further     security  they may have elected to discontinue the proceedings at that point  thereby saving the costs of the   day trial because of their inability to meet the further security order  This is prejudice which cannot now be remedied      Mr McLellan s evidence is unhelpful in that it does not contain any assessment of the likely further duration of the trial having regard to the witnesses already dealt with or remaining witnesses  whether the respondents are able to obtain an order for security for incurred costs or whether the respondents are estopped from obtaining further security  or whether the respondents are entitled on a party and party basis to obtain an allowance for preparation for trial more than once   This application is of particular interest because it has been brought   days into a trial which has been adjourned and is expected to run another seven days  Two cases where similar applications were brought are Southern Cross Exploration and Equity Access    In Southern Cross   the defendants brought an application for security for costs after   days of trial  in circumstances where it was anticipated that the trial would continue for another     days  The defendants sought security for the costs of the whole of the proceedings  namely for the costs they had already incurred as well as for the costs of the remainder of the trial  Waddell J held that the words of s   Companies  New South Wales  Code were in sufficiently wide terms to give the court power to make an order for security in respect of costs which had been incurred before the making of the order     NSWLR   at    His Honour considered that the defendants  delay in making what was their first application for security for costs was a most important factor to be taken into account in the exercise of the court s discretion in this case  at    The defendants in that case submitted that it could not reasonably have been foreseen that the trial of the proceedings would take as long it had taken and was estimated to take in the future  and that therefore a late application was justified  Waddell J  in refusing to make an order for security in respect of costs already incurred  said     In the present case it seems to me that the circumstances mentioned are such as to make it quite impossible  without severe and unexpected prejudice to the plaintiffs  to make an order for security in respect of costs which have already been incurred by the defendants  The plaintiffs have incurred very substantial costs in relation to the proceedings to date and have been allowed to do so by the defendants in the absence of any intimation of any application for security for costs  It would clearly be highly unjust to make such an order in respect of costs already incurred   However  Waddell J was prepared to make an order in respect of future costs in light of the unexpected length of the trial   Like Waddell J in Southern Cross and Hill J in Equity Access   weighing all the factors as best I can  in my view the appropriate conclusion in this case is that the respondents are entitled to an award for security for costs in respect of future costs  but not in respect of costs for that part of the trial recently heard citedState of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On the afternoon of Thursday   November   I ordered the Court to be adjourned while I considered the issue of whether time for hearing of this notice of motion should be abridged  I subsequently ruled that time in respect of this matter be abridged  that the requirements of O   r   Federal Court Rules be dispensed with in relation to the motion filed by the respondents on   November   and that the notice of motion should be returnable on Friday   November    My reasons were as follows       I noted that O   r   provides   Where a notice of motion is required to be served  it shall  unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders  be served not less than three days before the date fixed for the motion     The policy in O   r   of requiring three days notice of service of a notice of motion prior to the date fixed for the motion is to allow the respondent to the notice of motion time to prepare to meet the notice  and to avoid the situation where the respondent to the notice of motion is taken by surprise by the application  In this case  the notice of motion was filed in Court at approximately     pm on Wednesday   November    If the notice of motion were heard on Friday afternoon at     pm  obviously less than two full days notice would have been provided between serving the notice and the hearing      The discretion of the Court to order that the requirements of O   r   be dispensed with appears to be unfettered  However that discretion must be exercised judicially      At the hearing on   November   Mr Bell for the respondents  in  as he said  laying all the cards on the table  indicated that if the trial were pushed away to the earliest convenient date  the respondents would be renewing their application for security for costs  The comments of Mr Bell that day were made in the context of submissions as to whether the trial should proceed at that time  However  despite the efforts of Counsel and this Court to conclude the hearing during the scheduled time  it was clear by early during the week commencing   November   that the trial would not conclude by Friday   November    Further  given the history of this matter and the comments of Mr Bell noted above  the fact that the respondents would be making an application for further security for costs if the trial did not end during the scheduled two weeks could be of no surprise to anyone  including the applicants      The respondents relied on affidavits filed in March and June    This material was not new  and has been before the applicants for some time      I had previously heard  and dismissed  an application for security for costs by the respondents on   November    While the circumstances then were not the same as those before me in considering the issue of abridgment of a fresh application for security  it was clear that the issue of security for costs had recently been raised substantively by the parties in this Court in relation to this case  and would have been considered by the applicants      The respondents had already filed their submissions in support of this notice of motion  This was done at the same time as the notice of motion was filed      The parties were before me until the following day  and Counsel had all indicated that they are not available the following week to argue the substantive matter or an application for security for costs  While this in itself was not determinative  and indeed as pointed out by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   the interests of justice are not subordinated to issues of case management  in light of the history of this case  the availability of Counsel  and the fact that these issues were not new  it was in my view reasonable that this notice of motion be heard on Friday   November     In light of this ruling  Mr Perry for the applicants requested a     am commencement on Friday to enable him time that morning to prepare to respond to the notice of motion  which I granted   Cross examination of witnesses by Mr Perry did not conclude until     pm on Friday afternoon  however Mr Bell pressed for the respondents  notice of motion in respect of security for costs to nonetheless be heard on the basis that there was a risk that the application could not be heard in the foreseeable future citedSunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In my view an award of security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate  In forming this view I take into account the following factors     The first and third applicants were ordered earlier this year to pay the first and second respondents security for costs up to the end of the first day of trial in the sum of     Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd   FCAFC    To paraphrase Emmett J in Checked Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd   FCA   at     for reasons I detail below I do not see any reason at all to depart from the view of the Full Court in making an order that security for costs were payable  and note that the Full Court did not preclude a subsequent application at an appropriate time      The first and third applicants have admitted that they are unable  from their own resources  to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings  This admission of the applicants means that under both s   Federal Court Act and s   Corporations Act the Court has a broad discretion  fettered only by the requirement that the Court act judicially  to order the applicant to give security for the payment of the respondent s costs  Branson J in Hopeshore Pty Limited v Melroad Equipment Pty Limited   FCA   at          The application was filed and served on   November   once it was clear that the trial would not finish on   November   and the matter has been adjourned until May    There is no issue of delay in respect of this application in respect of future costs      Although the courts have shown reluctance to order security for future costs in respect of part heard trial  on the basis that  if the applicant cannot provide security  it runs the risk of having wasted costs of the trial days already heard  the fact that the length of the proceedings was not foreseen is a factor which may influence the court to exercise its discretion in ordering security for those costs  see comments of Street CJ in Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at        In my view it is not appropriate to form any views as to the strength of the applicants  case at this stage of the trial  cf comments of Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     at    It is clear however that there are triable issues  and it has not been suggested to me that the case of the applicants is frivolous      Insofar as this application is concerned  it is clear that the first and third applicants are unable to satisfy a costs order  I do not need to go to the evidence which has been heard to be so satisfied  Further  in my view the impropriety of reaching conclusions in this respect works both ways clearly the respondents strongly deny that their conduct has caused the impecuniosity of the first and third applicants  indeed it is a basis of the litigation  and in my view it is not proper at this stage when some  but not all  of the evidence has been heard  to make any findings as to this issue  I believe it is acceptable  however  to note evidence given in Court by Mr Hambleton  the administrator under the third applicant s deed of company arrangement  that in his opinion there was a strong prospect that the third applicant was insolvent from incorporation  TS   November p   ll          Although the applicants contend that the reliance by the respondents on previous material filed in respect of security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing has occurred to justify this application for security for costs  I cannot accept that contention  Plainly  circumstances have altered  A trial which was listed for   days being the best estimate of Counsel as communicated to the Court is now manifestly running over that time  I shall consider this issue later in this judgment in relation to quantum  However I fail to see how the respondents  in relying on evidence of Mr McLellan that the costs for each day beyond   days would be   is a tacit admission of the kind submitted by the applicants  notwithstanding that the affidavit of Mr McLellan was filed   March    In my view the only  admission  of the respondents in this respect is that their trial costs beyond   days would not exceed   per day  and would not increase in the   calendar year      There is no evidence before me that the effect of an order awarding security for costs would be to stultify the litigation  Indeed as was clear during the hearing it would be the second applicant  Mr Tracy  who would be providing any security for costs ordered  TS   November   p   ll      As pointed out by Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd   FCA   at     there is an intrinsic connection between the  stultify factor  and the  persons standing behind  factor as described by Beazley J in KB Cable   That the second applicant and his wife  Mrs Adrienne Tracy  are principal beneficiaries  and in the case of the second applicant  the principal architect  of the litigation before me is also clear from the evidence  for example TS   November   p   ll   TS   November   p   ll     TS   November   p   ll     and exhibit R   Further  that Mr and Mrs Tracy are of considerable means was made clear from evidence before the Court  including a balance sheet describing assets and liabilities of the second applicant  Mrs Tracy and their companies as at   November    exhibit R   The first and third applicants appear to be impecunious  however there is no evidence before me that the second applicant or Mrs Tracy are at a similar financial disadvantage notwithstanding the events which have resulted in the litigation before me  No undertakings have been provided by the second applicant or any other person as to the costs to which the first and third applicants may become liable  Accordingly in such circumstances security for costs may be ordered to ensure that those who stand to benefit from the litigation undertake some of the risks    Rosenfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bain   Co     ACLR   at     Acohs Pty Ltd v Merck Ltd   FCA     Costa Vraca v Bell Regal Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Harpur v Ariadne at   Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v

of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I am prepared however to order security in the amount of     being in respect of seven further days of trial and further preparation for the May   hearing  My reasons are as follows     Although the applicants  costs assessor  Mr Graham  has deposed to a view that the trial will take a further three days  as distinct from the seven days which have now been allocated  I do not accept this view  During the   days of trial in November  of which seven days was hearing  Counsel made opening submissions and the evidence of only six witnesses was given  Nine witnesses of the respondent remain to be heard  This includes the second respondent  Mr Strahley  who I anticipate will be in the witness box for some time  Further  the seven days allocated in May   includes closing submissions from Counsel  and dealing with the respondent s objections to the applicants evidence  On two occasions during the second week of the hearing I advised Counsel that I intended to list this matter for a further seven days in May    see TS   November   p   ll     and TS   November   p   ll      I note that on the second occasion the transcript reads that I indicated eight days  however  I believe it was understood by all parties in the room that I meant seven days being the     of May    A listing for this matter for a period of seven days commencing   May   has been made by the Federal Court Registry  At no time did either Counsel demur from this estimation  In my view this is a fair estimate of the time required and the respondents should be entitled to security for costs for seven further hearing days  I have compared the estimates of Mr McLellan in his affidavit filed   March     per day being fees for senior and junior counsel and the professional fees for the lawyers per day of trial  and Mr Graham in his affidavit filed   April       per day being fees for senior and junior counsel  the professional fees for the lawyers and the transcript fees per day of trial   In my view it is reasonable to order     in respect of the seven days of trial remaining      Although the applicants dispute that any security for costs should include further preparation time  in my view it is appropriate to order security to encompass costs for further preparation  Notwithstanding the submission of Mr Perry that the applicants  case has now closed and that the majority of the work to be done henceforth is by Counsel for the applicants  TS   November   p   ll     an adjournment part way through the trial will inevitably result in additional preparation costs being incurred by the parties prior to the resumption of the hearing  Brown v Rodgers   FCA    It is to be expected that Counsel for the respondents will need to prepare once again for the May   hearing  This is particularly so in light of the unfortunately lengthy adjournment of this matter from November   to May    In any event  as a general rule  costs of and incidental to an application include costs reasonably incurred both in the litigation and in preparation for the litigation   Re Gibson s Settlement Trusts     All ER   Higgins v Nichol  No       FLR   Liverpool City Council v Commonwealth of Australia     FCR   and I also note O   r   which contemplates preparation costs included in a taxation   It is reasonable that an award of security for costs should include preparation as well as trial time  The Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd   FCA    In this matter the respondents claim five days preparation  Mr McLellan estimates preparation by senior and junior counsel at   per day in total  Although the applicants dispute that further preparation for the trial is recoverable by the respondents  I note that in the affidavit of Mr Graham filed   April   Mr Graham accepts the daily rate for preparation by Counsel except to the extent that the figure should be discounted by   per cent on the basis that no allowance should be made for GST  In my view it is reasonable to order the first and third applicants to pay security for costs in the sum of     in respect of preparation      In making an order for security for costs the Court does not set out to give a complete and certain indemnity to a respondent  nor is it to be assumed that the applicant will fail in the proceeding  Brundza v Robbie   Co  No     HCA         CLR   at   Menhaden Pty Ltd v Citibank NA     FCR   at   Caruso Australia Pty Ltd v Portec  Australia  Pty Ltd     FCR   at   Re
