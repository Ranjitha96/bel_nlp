http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  T  reminded itself of the need when assessing credibility to be sensitive to the difficulties often faced by asylum seekers  It said that the benefit of the doubt should be given to asylum seekers who are generally credible but unable to substantiate all of their claims  It referred to various authorities  including Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR     which held that where a Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim  but cannot make that finding with confidence  it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that it might possibly be true   T  noted the delegate s view that the appellant had been generally forthright at his initial interview and that the answers he gave to questions had been consistent with information contained in his written application  T  further noted that T  had found it unnecessary to determine whether the appellant was in fact homosexual but had rejected his claims for other reasons  T  went on to conclude that the appellant was not  and never had been  homosexual  relying upon what it regarded as the implausibility of a gay activist leading a  reclusive  life in Australia  at least in terms of his contact with Sydney s gay community  It therefore rejected his account of past mistreatment in the Ukraine  For that reason  T  affirmed the delegate s decision   On   May   the Federal Magistrates Court  by consent  set aside T s decision  It once again remitted the matter to be reheard and determined according to law  Once again  the reason for the Minister s consent is not apparent citedCraig v The State of South Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Underlying the

merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant power and  subject to political control  for the repository alone  Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan J  However  the process is not simply one of classification and there are problems at the margin   I accept that at common law want of logic is not synonymous with error of law  I also accept that in general  when considering factual matters  the Tribunal may draw inferences that are incorrect and give rise to findings that are wrong without necessarily thereby committing jurisdictional error  However  every case must be considered in the light of its own particular circumstances  and there comes a point at which it may fairly be said that the Tribunal has not discharged its statutory function appliedNAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The decision of the High Court in NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   provides a useful illustration of the fine lines that sometimes have to be drawn  In that case  a husband  wife and their daughter applied for protection  The application was refused  On   June   they applied to the Tribunal for review  The Tribunal held oral hearings on   May   and again on   December    However  it did not hand down its decision affirming the delegate s decision until   January    The Tribunal said that it did not accept as credible certain claims made  and evidence given by  the applicants   In proceedings for judicial review  the applicants submitted that the delay in determining the review involved a denial of procedural fairness or a failure by the Tribunal to perform its statutory functions  The application was dismissed  as was an appeal to the Full Federal Court   The High Court  by majority  Gleeson CJ  Kirby  Callinan and Heydon JJ  with Gummow and Hayne JJ dissenting  reversed the decision of the Full Federal Court  Gleeson CJ  with Kirby J agreeing  held that the delay created a real and substantial risk that the Tribunal s capacity to assess the applicants  evidence and evaluate their claims was so impaired as to deny them a fair hearing  In a separate judgment  Callinan and Heydon JJ held that procedural unfairness could spring not only from a denial of an opportunity to present a case but also from the denial of an opportunity to consider it  The applicants  demeanour and credibility were relevant to the Tribunal s decision  It could be inferred from the delay that  in the absence of contrary evidence  the Tribunal had deprived itself of its capacity to assess their oral evidence   Speaking generally  therefore  NAIS stands as support for the proposition that lengthy delay  unacknowledged by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision   can give rise to jurisdictional error  This may be because the Tribunal has failed to take into account a matter that it was obliged to consider  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR    Alternatively  it may be that the Tribunal has denied the applicant a fair hearing  and thereby denied him procedural fairness   The Minister submitted that NAIS could be distinguished from the present case  NAIS concerned delay and its effect upon the capacity of the Tribunal to assess demeanour  The present case also involved delay but not in the way that this issue arose in NAIS    The Minister did not specifically challenge the proposition that the decision in NAIS established that delay could  in some circumstances  give rise to a denial of procedural fairness  Nor did he necessarily accept that proposition  He submitted  however  that the particular circumstances of this case were far removed from those in NAIS   There the Tribunal had made demeanour based findings against an appellant in circumstances in which four and a half years had elapsed between the observation of the demeanour and the making of the findings  In the present case  the differences between the accounts given by the appellant over time relied upon by T  had never featured in the reasoning of either T  or T   In other words  the Minister submitted  it could not logically be said that delay had had any impact upon the memory of the appellant or upon his ability to give evidence  Rather  it appeared that the delay had had an  improving effect  upon his memory  It was for that reason that T  found that he had in fact fabricated his claims   Further  the Minister submitted  as the Federal Magistrate found  T  was well aware of the chronology of the evidence given by the appellant  including the number of times  the dates  the successful applications for judicial review  and the content of what he had previously said  That justified his Honour s finding that T  had  implicitly  taken all relevant matters into account and  more particularly  all matters that it was obliged to take into account  The Minister contended that the appellant s submission amounted to no more than an attack upon the merits of T s decision   I accept the Minister s submission that NAIS is not directly in point  However  the principles underlying the majority view seem to me to be relevant  by analogy  to the particular circumstances of this case   As previously indicated  the appellant first gave a detailed account of his past history in the Ukraine as far back as    Some of the events that he described were relatively recent at that stage  However  through no fault of his own  he was obliged over the next four years to recall repeatedly the details of events that must have become more difficult to remember with the passage of time   In my view  T  was obliged to take that aspect of delay into account when considering any possible inconsistencies between the various statements that he made regarding these events   However  when one adds to the mix the fact that none of the inconsistencies identified were properly analysed  several seemed to have misstated the appellant s earlier position  and some involved summaries taken out of context  the entire process appears to have gone badly wrong  To use the language of Gummow J in NAIS   the Tribunal did not give  proper  genuine and realistic  consideration to the appellant s case  He was not afforded the hearing to which the law entitled him   In my view  the Federal Magistrate erred in dismissing the appellant s complaints by treating the Tribunal as having  implicitly  taken into account matters that I frankly doubt it ever considered   It follows that the appeal must be allowed  The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court must be set aside  There will be orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus  which will have the effect of quashing the decision given by T  and remitting the matter to a fourth Tribunal to be dealt with according to law    I certify that the preceding one hundred   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg

FCA  htmlcitedAbebe v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Minister noted that the appellant sought to rely upon Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   as support for the proposition that T  was obliged to consider the so called delay that occurred in this case before making its finding on credit  However  the Minister submitted  Abebe did not support the appellant s proposition  In Abebe   Gummow and Hayne JJ  in referring to the potential for refugee applicants to embroider their claims  nevertheless stated that the significance of such embroidery was a matter for the Tribunal in assessing the merits of the case citedMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Speaking generally  therefore  NAIS stands as support for the proposition that lengthy delay  unacknowledged by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision   can give rise to

 Alternatively  it may be that the Tribunal has denied the applicant a fair hearing  and thereby denied him procedural fairness citedHadid v Redpath     MVR   An analogous point  in the context of a negligence action  was made by Heydon JA  as his Honour then was  in Hadid v Redpath     MVR   where he said at         N o favourable assumptions could be made  and it was up to the trial judge to put beyond question any suggestion that he or she had lost an understanding of the issues  Something should be said about how the possible effects of delay on the judicial process have been overcome  Some explanation should be given as to how the trial judge had recorded or recaptured impressions formed of witnesses at the time they testified  A judge might  for example  say  I have a perfect recollection of all the characters in the trial  or  I have contemporaneous notes of my impressions       T he trial judge made no statements of the kind just indicated  and no assumption in her favour that she had retained any relevant impressions could be made    Emphasis added   I accept that the Tribunal s task in assessing credibility is often a difficult one  Having regard to the divergent views previously expressed about this appellant s credibility  the present case was no exception  T  had to take particular care to ensure that it did not overlook the combined effect of delay  and the disadvantage to the appellant of having to repeat a detailed account of past mistreatment  when assessing the overall consistency of his account   Both T  and T  as well as the delegate  seemed to have warned themselves appropriately of the need for appropriate caution when considering refugee claimants in unusual circumstances  T  did nothing of the kind  Rather it undertook what seems to have been a detailed analysis of everything the appellant had previously said regarding his treatment in the Ukraine  It ultimately found five instances of supposed inconsistency  It extrapolated from these  together with one instance of a claim regarded as implausible  that the appellant was to be disbelieved in virtually everything he said   Had the inconsistencies that T  identified been both real and substantial  one might well understand how it arrived at its conclusion  Even then  it would have been highly desirable for T  to have stated expressly that it had taken into account the dangers associated with drawing sweeping conclusions from what on any view was a mere handful of discrepancies
