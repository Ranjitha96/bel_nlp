Kite v State of South Australia   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedReid v State of South Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I recently have had the need to outline the principles applicable to a matter such as this  see Reid v State of South Australia   FCA   at         The following  with some addition  is drawn from what I there said   An application for a determination of native title under s  a  of the Native Title Act can be brought in accordance with s   by  for present purposes     A person or persons authorised by all the persons  the native title claim group   who  according to their traditional laws and customs  hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed  provided the person or persons are also included in the native title claim group                Note   The person or persons will be the applicant  see subsection   of this section    Note   Section  B states what it means for a person or persons to be authorised by all the persons in the native title claim group    Original emphasis citedHarrington Smith v State of Western Australia  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As Lindgren J commented in Harrington Smith v State of Western Australia  No     FCA   at        The expression  native title claim group  is defined in s   to mean  relevantly  the native title claim group mentioned in this passage  The expression is commonly and understandably used to refer to the group on whose behalf a native title determination application claimant application is made  Indeed  Form   prescribed by para  a  of the Native Title  Federal Court  Regulations    Cth  uses the expression in that sense  treating  claimants  and members of the  native title claim group  as synonymous  But there is no escaping the fact that the  native title claim group  all of whose members are required by s   to authorise the applicant to apply  is a group constituted by all the actual holders  according to their traditional laws and customs  of the common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed   I would note in passing that the indispensable nexus between traditional laws and customs and claimed native title rights and interests is made plain in s   of the Act which recognises  communal  group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples  in relation to land where  the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the Aboriginal peoples   emphasis added    Section   provides that where a native title application is one authorised by a claim group the application must  a  name the persons constituting the group or  b  otherwise describe the persons sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons   I have noted above the tie between group membership and authorisation  Of the significance of authorisation I need do no more than gratefully adopt what was said by Lindgren J in Harrington Smith  No   at        Proper

untenable upon the  version of the evidence  favourable to the respondent to the strike out  McKenzie   at   Bodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR     For my own part I consider the trust like claim gives some reason for pause  The application and the accompanying evidence when considered most favourably to Mr Kite  see McKenzie at   does suggest  subject to what is later said  that there is a basis for asserting the claim group members were  in accordance with traditional law and custom  authorised to make the claim  i e  as Nguraritjas  that they were entitled to speak for the country  and that they had particular responsibilities in relation to the land claim  But the doubt it engenders is that these matters have had some part to play in contriving the claim group itself  That doubt is exaggerated by the not altogether satisfactory explanation given of the  rights  of the wider community of descendants of Bill Kite to enjoy or to have the benefits of the native title rights and interests claimed  Nonetheless  it is said on Mr Kite s behalf that the division between holding the claimed rights and interests on the one hand  and having the benefit or enjoyment of them on the other is a factual proposition that is not to be tested on the present motion   In the end I consider that I am obliged to give Mr Kite the benefit of the doubts I have  I would  however  observe this much  I am not prepared to assume that the particular traditional laws and customs of an Aboriginal group cannot produce the type of internal relationship within a community such as is advanced in this claim  Nonetheless  I have some concern that in this matter the claim may well owe more to concepts drawn from common law conceptions of property than from traditional laws and customs  I refer in particular to the apparent equation here of the idea of being a  holder  of native title rights and interests with that of being the  owner  of those rights and interests   The second two matters to which I need refer relate to the actual composition of the claim group itself and to the basis of its membership  I have foreshadowed both of these matters  The first relates to the members

behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The vices in the membership of the claim group carry over into the alleged authorisation of Mr Kite to bring the claim itself  I need say no more about this  other than to observe that this particular claim group is itself probably best described as self identifying and self authorising and is objectionable for those reasons  see Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia   FCA   at     The process of authorisation described in
