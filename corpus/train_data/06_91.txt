Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The notes then referred to discussion at the meeting about the implications and the possibility of the AR terminal being designated as rail corridor or commercial corridor land under s   of the Transport Infrastructure Act   The notes record the following       QT apparently consider they have the power to designate such a facility as of strategic importance to the State and effectively take control of it  This was clearly not the intent of this section of the Transport Infrastructure Act   QR would argue that the terminal was not of strategic importance to the State as part of a transport corridor  This is because it is non corridor  QR is also unaware of it being in a transport infrastructure strategy  If QT pursued this avenue they would also end up with ownership of a terminal and potential responsibility for reimbursing NRC for their  m improvements      If this avenue is not pursued by QT  Government  via Treasury  have the power to declare the terminal under the QCA Regulations  As such  QR is vulnerable to QT taking direct action contrary to QR s commercial interests   The notes went on to record that it was decided the best way forward would be to maintain QR s stance that the terminal was non corridor and          Resolutely refuse to have the terminal declared or made a common user facility and therefore no appeal processes if capacity not available to a third party using reciprocity and our need to have easy access to our own terminal as a rationale    emphasis added  The notes concluded by stating that QR may not need to brief the Minister if an agreement could not be reached because Queensland Transport was  giving precedence to their regulatory role over their shareholding role    Even if Recital B a ii  has the meaning suggested by Mr Graham s evidence  it would be wrong to construe the recital as over riding the operative provisions of cl  a  Ansett

construction  was not reasonable and could not found an estoppel   Clause  a  makes it plain that it was for NRC to identify particular assets  as it did in relation to the AR terminal  and that the State of Queensland had a discretion as to the form of property rights to be granted  It could choose between ownership  lease or access  It was then for the parties to negotiate commercial terms and

Verwayen at      It may be possible to divide detriment into the  narrower  and  broader  sense  although this approach  which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at   really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment  The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption  whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption  It is avoidance of the broader or  real detriment  flowing from reliance  from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position  Grundt at   per Dixon J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ    It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered  see P Feltham et al   Spencer Bower s Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation   th ed  Butterworths  London at  V    and Grundt at        Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel  the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense  that is to say  reliance  Verwayen at     per Mason CJ    Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to

Verwayen at     per McHugh J    The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at           In my opinion  to establish an equitable estoppel  it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that   the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship    the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation    the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation    the defendant knew or intended him to do so    the plaintiff s action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled  and   the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise         In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations  it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other s freedom to withdraw has gone  that is to say  there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed  This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General  Hong Kong  v Humphreys Estate  Queen s Gardens  Limited     AC     Humphreys

Limited     ALR      WD Systems   at   per Selway J   In my opinion the effect of what was said in Berbatis by Gleeson CJ at     and by Gummow and Hayne JJ at     is that two criteria must be established  The first is that the plaintiff was in a position of special disadvantage  whether by reason of illness  ignorance  inexperience  impaired facilities  financial need or other circumstances affecting its ability to conserve its own interests   The second criterion is that the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff s disability or special disadvantage   The ambit of s  AC is wider than that of s  AA  it is not limited to equitable doctrines or common law principles of unconscionability  see Berbatis at first instance    FCA         FCR   per French J at   and  WD Systems at   referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Safeway Stores Pty Limited     FCR   As Heerey and Sackville JJ pointed out in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Safeway Stores Pty Limited     FCR     Safeway   at   in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power it is necessary to look not only at what the firm did but why the firm did it  That is why a business rationale for the conduct  to which I referred in the second principle above  independent of the question of market power  is relevant to determining the sufficiency of the connection  That is what lies at the heart of the assessment of whether the firm has taken advantage   In the present case it is necessary to consider QR s rationale for refusing to grant a long term lease to NRC in   and   and for its service of the notice to quit on PN in May     QR s business rationale for its conduct in   and   was not as fully developed as that which more clearly emerged in documents recording its objectives in giving the notice to quit  Nevertheless  documents exist which  when read in the light of oral testimony  explain why QR changed its position with respect to the grant of a long term lease to NRC in   and why it maintained that stance in    The documents were not admitted as proof of the facts but  insofar as they state QR s objectives  they must be accepted as containing such statements  unless challenged by PN   PN accepted that Mr O Rourke and Mr Hearsch were the witnesses whose evidence was relevant to QR s purposes in its   conduct   It is to be noted that at the outset  Mr O Rourke stated in his letter of   March   that the AR terminal was of strategic importance and that there was a need for it to be operated as a common user facility   In making a finding of purpose the Court is not so much concerned with the search for the  directing mind and will  of the corporation  it is concerned with inferences from the conduct of the corporation and of any other relevant person as well as other relevant circumstances  Safeway at       An inference of proscribed purposes is to be drawn on the balance of probabilities

in the form of unreasonable  unfair  bullying and thuggish behaviour amounts to unconscionable conduct within s  AC  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No Knead  Franchising  Pty Limited   FCA         FCR     No Knead   at   per Sundberg J  His Honour said that a refusal to supply or to negotiate constituted unconscionable conduct where the refusal amounted to intimidation or the application of illegitimate pressure on the other party to do something which the party applying the pressure had no entitlement to have done   Neither of the elements of unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law has been proved  First  the proposition that NRC was in a position of special disadvantage needs only to be stated to be rejected  NRC was  and remains  a large corporation with a very substantial business  It was  and is  well and capably managed and it had the support of Commonwealth and State Governments  It had access to and relied upon legal advice from prominent and very competent firms of solicitors  Any suggestion that it was incapable of looking after its own interests must be firmly rejected   Similarly  any suggestion that QR unconscientiously took advantage of a disability or special disadvantage of NRC in   and   or in giving the notice to quit to PN in May   cannot be accepted   There is nothing to suggest serious misconduct of the type described by the Full Court in Hurley   There is no suggestion of unreasonable or bullying behaviour or any attempt to apply illegitimate pressure of the kind referred to by Sundberg J in No Knead   This is hardly surprising given the identity of the parties   But unmeritorious negotiating positions could not  without more  amount to unconscionable conduct  At very least  it was necessary for PN to demonstrate that QR s behaviour was unreasonable in the sense stated in No Knead and that the conduct was in fact carried out  Mr Scheuber disavowed any suggestion that unmeritorious behaviour took place  I accept his denial   I have rejected the claim of abuse of market power in dealing with PN s claim under  s   of the Act  The same matters relied upon to support a claim of unconscionable conduct must suffer the same fate   PN contends that QR s conduct  firstly in its refusal to grant PN a long term lease of the AR terminal and  secondly  in issuing PN with the notice to quit on   May   amounts to a taking advantage by QR of its market power in two rail infrastructure markets for the purpose of deterring or preventing PN from engaging in competitive conduct in two downstream

Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks   Spencer Plc   All ER  D     Feb  at        As I have already said  the fact that there was never any agreement to reach or even to set out the essential principles which might govern any legally binding long term relationship indicates that neither party can here objectively be taken to have intended to make any legally binding commitment of a long term nature  and the law should not be ready to seek to fetter business relationships with its own view of what might represent appropriate business conduct  when parties have not chosen  or have not been willing or able  to do so in any identifiable legal terms themselves  These considerations  in my judgment  also make it wrong to afford relief based on estoppel  including relief limited to reliance loss  in the present context      As Mance LJ observed at     even if the recognised principles of estoppel are  fertilised  by a broader approach exemplified in cases such as Holiday Inns   those cases are explained on the basis that the parties envisaged that rights already existed or they intended them to be created by contract distinguishedBond Brewing  NSW  Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited  unreported  Supreme Court of NSW  Waddell CJ in Eq    August   The proposition that there might have been encouragement of the type mentioned by Mr George was not put to Mr O Rourke  There is nothing in the document which gives rise to a Jones v Dunkel inference by reason of QR s failure to call Mr George  The present case is in no way analogous to the position in Bond Brewing  NSW  Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited  unreported  Supreme Court of NSW  Waddell CJ in Eq    August   where the tenant of a hotel acted upon an assumption that the landlord would not terminate a lease without paying to the tenant a reasonable sum for the value of the goodwill  His Honour found that the landlord knew this to be so  and that detriment was clearly established

Commission   HCA         CLR     Boral   at   per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J   The circumstances which may give rise to the absence of competitive constraint on a corporation are diverse  They are not confined to the matters identified in s   see Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete  Qld  Pty Limited     FCR     Pioneer Concrete   at     and   see also Boral at   per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ   Alternatively  any power arising from QR s ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC  Melway at   Boral at   and Pioneer Concrete at     and     Mr Ergas  opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power  However  that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above  in particular Melway at   Boral at   and Pioneer Concrete at      and     Section   requires the co existence of market power  taking advantage and proscribed purpose  Melway at   and Boral at     Whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is often a difficult question to answer  This may be because the words  take advantage  have been equated with  use  see Queensland Wire at       and     but the word  use  does not capture the full meaning of  take advantage  Boral at     The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction      what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of  Melway at   and   Boral   and   Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR     Rural Press   at    McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required  Boral at       if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation  that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct  Melway at   Boral at       the words  take advantage  do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection  Rural Press at       in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage  is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market  Melway at   and   Rural Press at       it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power  Melway at   Rural Press at       McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power  Boral at       the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power  Melway at       one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition  Queensland Wire at       the purpose of s   is the promotion of competition  it is concerned with the protection of competition  not competitors  Queensland Wire at   and   Boral at       and   Melway at       it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power  which can be taken advantage of  to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process  Boral at       As Heerey J said at first instance in Boral   this is a factor which points against a finding that the conduct constitutes taking advantage of market power  see     ALR   at    His Honour s views were adopted in the High Court  see   and     It seems to me that these were matters of commercial judgment which  when considered in the light of QR s continuing offer of access to PN and its proposed conversion of the AR terminal to a multi user facility  suggest that this was not an exercise of market power or a taking advantage of it   Mr Ergas considered the question of how QR would behave in a competitive market by assuming that QR would provide PN with a   year lease because PN is a more efficient terminal operator than QR and  accordingly  it would be more profitable for QR if PN controls the terminal  He criticised QR s conduct as irrational in a competitive market and supported his argument by reference to various hypothetical examples   PN criticised Mrs Smith s approach as based on faulty assumptions  including an assumption that there are several terminals equivalent to the AR terminal for standard gauge  That criticism is well placed but I accept the general effect of her approach which is plainly consistent with objective facts  As McHugh J said in Boral at   a rational business firm seeks to maximise profit and to increase its share of the market  That is the obvious explanation of QR s conduct   As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at   the operation of s   is predicated upon an assumption that competition is the means to protect the interests of consumers  Competition is by its nature deliberate and ruthless  All of the majority justices in Boral pointed out that s   is concerned with promoting competition  not protecting competitors  see       and    Injuries to rivals are a necessary bi product of vigorous competition   Second  I do not see that QR s desire to run the AR terminal as a common user or multi user facility gave it an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power  Boral at     First  there are constant reminders in the authorities that competition is a ruthless process  As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at   competitors always try to injure each other by taking away sales and these injuries are the inevitable result of the competition that s   is designed to promote  In Boral at   Gleeson CJ and Callinan J pointed to the danger of confusing aggressive intent with anti competitive behaviour  see also per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   and per McHugh J at     I do not consider that this constitutes a sufficient connection to amount to taking advantage within the principle stated by the High Court in Melway and Boral  referred toBrambles Holdings Limited v Carey     SASR   In Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Limited   HCA         CLR   at     the High Court approved the following statement of principle of Bright J in Brambles Holdings Limited v Carey     SASR     Brambles   at        Always  when beliefs or opinions or states of mind are attributed to a company it is necessary to specify some person or persons so closely and relevantly connected with the company that the state of mind of that person or those persons can be treated as being identified with the company so that their state of mind can be treated as being the state of mind of the company   That is not to say that the state of mind to be attributed to a corporation must always be the state of mind of one particular officer  Brambles at   per Bray CJ  see also Wood v City of Melbourne     ALR   at     However  difficulties arise in ascertaining the state of mind of large corporations  Brambles at    Different board members may hold different beliefs and it is sometimes possible to look beyond the resolutions of the board to the deliberations of individual board members as well as those of senior management  Ishac v David Securities Pty Limited  No       ACSR   at     per Young J and the authorities there cited   As Bray CJ said in Brambles at   a corporation cannot know or believe two contradictory things at once and it is rational belief  not schizophrenia which is to be attributed  see also Halsbury s Laws of Australia   Vol   Corporations at       Here  Mr Graham was  closely and relevantly connected  with all decisions taken by NRC in relation to the AR terminal during the period from about six months after the execution of the EA to   February   when the shares were purchased by the Toll Patrick consortium  He was directly responsible for all dealings with respect to the AR terminal during that period  He made the decisions as to what steps should be taken and his recommendations to the Board were accepted by the Board members  There was evidence  in general terms  from a number of Board members  Mr Butcher  Mr Moore Wilton  Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh  that they relied on Mr Graham   Whether NRC s state of mind for the purpose of determining what  if any  assumptions were adopted  is confined to that of Mr Graham is not entirely clear  PN accepted in final address that Mr Graham s state of mind was  paramount   But it submitted that Mr Butcher s assumptions were also relevant because of his regular discussions with Mr Graham  Although PN called evidence from Mr Moore Wilton  Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh  it did not submit that their states of mind were to be attributed to NRC  That is hardly surprising because their assumptions were different from Mr Graham s  However  the same comment applies to Mr Butcher   PN also called evidence from Mr Hanscomb  a senior executive of NRC  who had  in   assisted Mr Moore Wilton on the Committee of Officials  which was a Committee established to examine options for the funding of NRC  and assisted in drafting the EA  His expectation was that there would be a lease  I do not consider that his state of mind is to be attributed to NRC within the principle stated in Brambles   His evidence has some bearing on Mr Graham s expectations   Mr O Rourke was the CEO of QR and its predecessor  Queensland Railways  He was closely and relevantly connected with all dealings and decisions in respect of the AR terminal  His state of mind can be treated as that of QR for the purpose of determining what assumptions QR held and he must be taken to have known what was in his mind as CEO of Queensland Railways   The relevant period for determining on what assumptions QR acted and the conduct which is said to have induced NRC to act to its detriment is the period up to March   or perhaps to the date of Mr O Rourke s letter of   March    The other relevant mind of QR in that period was Mr Hearsch   Second  as I have already mentioned  there are inconsistencies between the various assumptions said to have been held by Mr Graham  as managing director  and the board members who were called  It is true that Mr Graham was far more relevantly connected with the day to day dealings with QR in relation to the AR terminal than were Mr Butcher and the other board members  But it was the board which made the ultimate decisions to incur the expenditure on the AR terminal and the East Coast Strategy  not Mr Graham  cf Brambles   In any event  the inconsistent evidence of Mr Graham and the other directors indicates that no clear or unambiguous assumption was held by NRC  Even if Mr Graham s belief was the only state of mind attributable to NRC within the principle stated in Brambles   so that his state of mind was that of NRC  the estoppel claim fails for other reasons stated later   Assuming I am correct in reaching the conclusion that PN has not proved that the relevant persons held the alleged assumptions  it is unnecessary to examine the extensive documentary record to see whether the documents give rise to an inference that NRC did in fact hold those assumptions  In any event  in my opinion  the documents do not support such a finding   Plainly  the critical document is the EA  It laid down the legal framework agreed between the Commonwealth and the States for the establishment of NRC as a government owned corporation to conduct rail freight operations on a

estoppel claim  the respondent points to the following proposition stated by McHugh J in Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen   HCA         CLR     Verwayen  at   as a complete answer to the claim       Once the detriment has ceased or been paid for  there is nothing unconscionable in a party insisting on reverting to his or her former relationship with the other party and enforcing his or her strict legal rights   NRC puts its claim under both s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Act   and estoppel but similar questions arise in each of the claims   NRC also claims that the respondent has engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of ss  AA and  AC of the Act   These claims turn largely upon strategies put forward by the respondent s middle management  in particular during   for avoiding any obligations on the State of Queensland under the EA and for the use of the AR terminal as a  bargaining chip  in efforts by the respondent to enter interstate markets for the supply of rail freight services   In the Verwayen at   Mason CJ described estoppel as a label which covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories  I do not need to set out all of the rules because PN confined its case to three categories  In doing so  PN recognised that the question of whether there is a  single overarching doctrine  or  a general doctrine of estoppel by conduct  was left open by the High Court in Giumelli v Giumelli   HCA         CLR     Giumelli   at     I will enumerate the propositions as follows        The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which  unless the assumption is adhered to  would operate to the other s detriment  Thompson v Palmer   HCA         CLR     Thompson   at   per Dixon J  Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited     CLR     Grundt   at   per Dixon J  Legione at     Waltons at   per Brennan J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ and at   per McHugh J    Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption  Thompson at   per Dixon J  Grundt at     Legione at     Waltons at   per Mason CJ  Wilson J  Verwayen at   per Deane J and at   per McHugh J    Accordingly  the reference to an  unjust  departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness  Legione at    That is to say  it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption    The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance  that is to say  if the assumption were not adhered to  Grundt at     Waltons at   and Verwayen at      It may be possible to divide detriment into the  narrower  and  broader  sense  although this approach  which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at   really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment  The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption  whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption  It is avoidance of the broader or  real detriment  flowing from reliance  from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position  Grundt at   per Dixon J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ    It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered  see P Feltham et al   Spencer Bower s Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation   th ed  Butterworths  London at  V    and Grundt at        Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel  the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense  that is to say  reliance  Verwayen at     per Mason CJ    Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment  see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at        The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel  Thompson at   per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at   per Mason CJ  Dixon J s reference in Thompson at   to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph  ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff  It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established  see J D Heydon   Cross on Evidence   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworth  Sydney at        Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties

The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence  as stated by the High Court in Con Stan at     has been qualified by later authority  The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law  Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts     NSWLR   at     per Samuels JA  Waltons at   and Verwayen at   per Dixon J    per Deane J  and at   per McHugh J    An estoppel by convention  unlike estoppel by representation  depends upon mutual assumptions  It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts  or law  Con Stan at      Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters  But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel  in particular a promissory estoppel  Waltons at     per Mason CJ and Wilson J and   per Gaudron J and Verwayen at     per McHugh J    The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at           In my opinion  to establish an equitable estoppel  it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that   the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship    the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation    the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation    the defendant knew or intended him to do so    the plaintiff s action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled  and   the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise         In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations  it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other s freedom to withdraw has gone  that is to say  there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed  This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General  Hong Kong  v Humphreys Estate  Queen s Gardens  Limited     AC     Humphreys      The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances  Waltons at   per Mason CJ and Wilson J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ and at   per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v

Representation at  V         A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that  a particular legal relationship  or  interest  would arise or be granted  Mobil Oil at      A pre existing contractual relationship is not  under Australian law  a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel  Waltons at     per Mason CJ and Wilson J and     per Brennan J and Verwayen at   per Dawson J    A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at         If a man  under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land  or  what amounts to the same thing  under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest  takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord  and upon the faith of such promise or expectation  with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him  lays out money upon the land  a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation         Lord Kingsdown s statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington     AC     Plimmer  at   and again in Humphreys at   see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited     NSWLR     Austotel   at      Priestley JA s distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent  Mobil Oil at      Subject to a qualification stated below  it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract  The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief  Plimmer at     Inwards v Baker     QB   at   and Austotel at     per Priestley JA    The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land  the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights  Austotel at     per Kirby JA and at     per Rogers AJA   The third category  operational detriment  involves the fulfilment of expectations  It is an aspect of the broader category of detriment referred to in Verwayen   Three principles should be added to those which I included in my summary of the relevant legal principles of estoppel at       see also propositions   and   in Brennan J s summary of the principles of equitable estoppel set out at       Third  the principles of equitable estoppel are concerned with satisfaction of the minimum equity necessary to do justice  Equitable estoppel is intended to relieve against the detriment suffered and not to make good an expectation  see the Full Court s discussion of the principles stated in Verwayen in Mobil Oil at       Fourth  once the detriment has ceased or been paid for  there is nothing unconscionable in a party insisting upon the enforcement of its strict legal rights  Verwayen at     This case is to be distinguished from all of the proprietary estoppel  or estoppel by acquiescence  cases because from the time when QR sought to resile from the alleged assumptions  it offered to negotiate to provide access rights in accordance with the EA   In particular  from the time of the offer of the Terminal Services Agreement in Mr Wilson s seventh affidavit  there was a specific offer of terms which in my view cannot be said to be uncommercial  It seems to me that for PN to succeed in establishing the necessary detriment I would have to be satisfied that the terms offered by QR are so unreasonable that they could not possibly satisfy any rights which might be embedded in the broad terms of cl  a  of the EA  In particular  I would have to be satisfied that the proposed Terminal Services Agreement does not confer upon PN the ability to recoup any detriment suffered by the withdrawal of the offer of a long lease   It must be borne in mind that QR has amended the terms of the proposed Terminal Services Agreement to meet some of the objections raised by PN in cross examination of Mr Wilson  It is also to be borne in mind that QR has undertaken to keep the offer open until   days after the delivery of my judgment   Although it is true that the term or period of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement is not for so long as NRC continues to carry on interstate freight operations  I do not think that this is an answer to QR s contention that the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement will overcome any detriment suffered by the withdrawal of the  offer  of a long term lease  Nor is PN s objection that the extensions of the term be at QR s discretion   What seems to me to be the decisive answer to the estoppel claim put by PN is that under the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement  any detriment alleged by PN will cease for reasons set out below  That is to say the detriment  if any  will cease or be paid for within the principle stated by McHugh J in Verwayen    Even if PN has not recouped the initial expenditure on the AR Terminal or on the East Coast Strategy  it will have ample opportunity to do so under the Terminal Services Agreement  It should be noted that the proposed Terminal Services Agreement incudes an offer by QR to expand the size of the terminal to add two parcels of land comprising an additional     hectares  This will enable QR to expand the capacity of the AR terminal so as to accommodate PN s existing profitable level of throughput with some increases as envisaged in the latest draft of the Terminal Services Agreement  It must be borne in mind that NRC has already had more than eight years to recoup any detriment said to have been occasioned by QR s change of position in March     PN called evidence from its Financial Controller  Mr Gilchrist  His evidence was that between   July   and   June   NRC had made a net benefit from its operation of the AR terminal of   million before tax and depreciation  He agreed that in calculating the net benefit it was appropriate to disregard depreciation referred toCon Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

strict legal rights  Austotel at     per Kirby JA and at     per Rogers AJA   A conventional estoppel must be mutual  see Con Stan at    At most  there was a mutual assumption of Mr Graham and Mr O Rourke that control had been transferred for three years in anticipation of a lease of up to   years being negotiated  That is not an assumption of existing fact  If it can found an estoppel at all  it can only be a promissory estoppel  see     which I address below at     The high water mark of this claim is Mr O Rourke s concession that control was transferred to NRC on   April   in anticipation of a   year lease being negotiated   The climate of goodwill which then existed between the parties  and the perception amongst all concerned that micro economic reform of the rail freight industry was to be effected  suggests that Mr Graham and Mr Butcher held a similar assumption referred toCrabb v Arun District Council     Ch   The last mentioned words appear to be a reference to the form of estoppel stated in Ramsden v Dyson     LRHL     Ramsden v Dyson   at    That is to say  it refers to an equitable estoppel arising from an expectation created or encouraged by the words or conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is raised  This form of estoppel includes failure to disabuse a party where the person estopped has knowledge of the other party s intention to act upon the expectation  see Crabb v Arun District Council     Ch     Crabb  per Lord Denning MR at     Failure to disabuse may  in some circumstances  create or encourage an expectation  Crabb at      But this head of equity usually depends upon proof that the owner of the property seeks to take unconscionable advantage of another by allowing the other to spend money on the property in the belief  known to the owner  that the person expending the money will enjoy a benefit over the property  Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead     EG     Holiday Inns   discussed by Priestley JA in Austotel at

obligations they have assumed under it  The law allows for exceptions but they must be proved according to established legal categories  Equuscorp Pty Limited v Glengallan Investments Pty Limited     CLR   at     Mr Graham s evidence that there was no  sunset  provision on the transfer of control is at odds with the written agreements  Substantially greater and more precise evidence would have been required to establish any reasonable argument to the effect that the transfer of control was assumed to be for a longer period than the term of the lease   Even if Mr Graham had an assumption that NRC would continue in possession and control of the AR terminal for a period beyond the expiration of the three year lease  that was not an assumption of existing fact referred toEslea Holdings

Verwayen at      It may be possible to divide detriment into the  narrower  and  broader  sense  although this approach  which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at   really points to the distinction

of the options available to the State of Queensland was the grant of access rights  But Mr Graham and Mr Stanko differed in their beliefs  Mr Graham accepted that the State s minimum obligation was to provide access rights  although he believed in effect that the rights would be perpetual  and on terms that ensured NRC s commercial viability   The proposition that there might have been

    EG     Holiday Inns   discussed by Priestley JA in Austotel at     and     The position is effectively captured in the following passage from the judgment of Mance LJ in Baird Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks   Spencer Plc   All ER  D     Feb  at        As I have already said  the fact that there was never any agreement to reach or even to set out the essential principles which might govern any legally binding long term relationship indicates that neither party can here objectively be taken to have intended to make any legally binding commitment of a long term nature  and the law should not be ready to seek to fetter business relationships with its own view of what might represent appropriate business conduct  when parties have not chosen  or have not been willing or able  to do so in any identifiable legal terms themselves  These considerations  in my judgment  also make it wrong to afford relief based on estoppel  including relief limited to reliance loss  in the present context      As Mance LJ observed at     even if the recognised principles of estoppel are  fertilised  by a broader approach exemplified in cases such as Holiday Inns   those cases are explained on the basis that the parties envisaged that rights already existed or they intended them to be created by contract referred toHope v Bathurst City Council   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The short answer to the status of documents such as the Task Force Report and the Heads of Government Agreement is that they were superseded by the EA  In an estoppel case  it is possible to put forward an understanding based on communications which preceded the execution of a written agreement  cf Hoyts  Pty Limited v Spencer   HCA         CLR

authorities there cited referred toLegione v Hateley   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  PN relied on the words of Mason and Deane JJ in Legione v Hateley   HCA         CLR     Legione   at   to support the formulation of the third category  In the passage to which PN referred  their Honours said that estoppel in pais includes common law estoppel comprising conventional estoppel and estoppel by representation  They also said that it includes  the overlapping equitable doctrines of proprietary estoppel and estoppel by acquiescence or encouragement    It follows from the description of estoppel in pais in Legione at   and from the three categories propounded by PN  that each of the categories put forward is a species of estoppel in pais   Without endeavouring to discuss the many and varying observations that have been made in the cases  I will attempt to state the essential propositions which flow from the cases and which underlie the determination of the present proceedings   I will enumerate the propositions as follows        The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which  unless the assumption is adhered to  would operate to the other s detriment  Thompson v Palmer   HCA         CLR     Thompson   at   per Dixon J  Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited     CLR     Grundt   at   per Dixon J  Legione at     Waltons at   per Brennan J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ and at   per McHugh J    Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption  Thompson at   per Dixon J  Grundt at     Legione at     Waltons at   per Mason CJ  Wilson J  Verwayen at   per Deane J and at   per McHugh J    Accordingly  the reference to an  unjust  departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness  Legione at    That is to say  it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption    The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance  that is to say  if the assumption were not adhered to  Grundt at     Waltons at   and Verwayen at      It may be possible to divide detriment into the  narrower  and  broader  sense  although this approach  which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at   really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment  The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption  whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption  It is avoidance of the broader or  real detriment  flowing from reliance  from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position  Grundt at   per Dixon J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ    It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered  see P Feltham et al   Spencer Bower s Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation   th ed  Butterworths  London at  V    and Grundt at        Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel  the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense  that is to say  reliance  Verwayen at     per Mason CJ    Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment  see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at        The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel  Thompson at   per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at   per Mason CJ  Dixon J s reference in Thompson at   to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph  ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff  It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established  see J D Heydon   Cross on Evidence   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworth  Sydney at        Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship  Thompson at   Con Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR     Con Stan   at      The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence  as stated by the High Court in Con Stan at     has been qualified by later authority  The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law  Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts     NSWLR   at     per Samuels JA  Waltons at   and Verwayen at   per Dixon J    per Deane J  and at   per McHugh J    An estoppel by convention  unlike estoppel by representation  depends upon mutual assumptions  It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts  or law  Con Stan at      Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters  But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel  in particular a promissory estoppel  Waltons at     per Mason CJ and Wilson J and   per Gaudron J and Verwayen at     per McHugh J    The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at           In my opinion  to establish an equitable estoppel  it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that   the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship    the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation    the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation    the defendant knew or intended him to do so    the plaintiff s action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled  and   the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise         In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations  it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other s freedom to withdraw has gone  that is to say  there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed  This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General  Hong Kong  v Humphreys Estate  Queen s Gardens  Limited     AC     Humphreys      The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances  Waltons at   per Mason CJ and

in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at         If a man  under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land  or  what amounts to the same thing  under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest  takes possession of such

of Appeal in Low v Bouverie     Ch    Bowen LJ explained it as follows at        Now  an estoppel  that is to say  the language upon which the estoppel is founded  must be precise and unambiguous  That does not necessarily mean that the language must be such that it cannot possibly be open to different constructions  but that it must be such as will be reasonably understood in a particular sense by the person to whom it is addressed   It seems to me to follow that  whatever species of estoppel falls for consideration  the assumption which is said to have been engendered must be clear and unambiguous   I have drawn attention to the different assumptions held by Mr Graham and the other directors because  at very least  this must negate the requisite elements of clarity and certainty appliedMelway Publishing Pty Limited v Robert Hicks Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Melway Publishing Pty Limited v Robert Hicks Pty Limited   HCA         CLR     Melway   at   the majority justices observed that the notion of market power as the capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors is reflected in s    The absence of constraint from customers is also a relevant matter  Matters of degree are involved  Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR     Boral   at   per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J   Alternatively  any power arising from QR s ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC  Melway at   Boral at   and Pioneer Concrete at     and     Mr Ergas  opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power  However  that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above  in particular Melway at   Boral at   and Pioneer Concrete at      and     Section   requires the co existence of market power  taking advantage and proscribed purpose  Melway at   and Boral at     The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction      what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of  Melway at   and   Boral   and   Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR     Rural Press   at    McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required  Boral at       if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation  that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct  Melway at   Boral at       the words  take advantage  do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection  Rural Press at       in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage  is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market  Melway at   and   Rural Press at       it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power  Melway at   Rural Press at       McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power  Boral at       the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power  Melway at       one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition  Queensland Wire at       the purpose of s   is the promotion of competition  it is concerned with the protection of competition  not competitors  Queensland Wire at   and   Boral at       and   Melway at       it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power  which can be taken advantage of  to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process  Boral at       Moreover  the suggestion that QR took advantage of market power is at odds with three further principles which emerge from the authorities  First  I do not see how it can be said that to obtain possession with a view to converting the AR terminal to a common user facility as was sought in     or a multi user facility in   was facilitated by the existence of the power  Melway at   and Rural Press at     Third  QR s conduct cannot be said to have been  necessarily  an exercise of market power  Melway at     I will deal briefly with Mr Ergas  contention that a number of the clauses of QR s open offer in the Draft Terminal Services Agreement  as amended on   July   constituted a misuse of market power  Mr Ergas argued that only a firm with market power could make such an offer  He argued that in a competitive market  confronted by such an offer  the firm would go elsewhere   Mr Ergas  attack focussed upon three clauses of the draft document  as amended  which I have set out above  They are  first  the provision dealing with late trains contained in cl     second  the provision for PN to be able to increase the monthly throughput in the capacity of the AR terminal  in addition to the right to a   increase in the allocated monthly TEU provided for in cl  a ii  of Schedule    The provision for additional throughput is found in cl     which includes in cl    d  the notion of a deemed permanent increase with resulting increased costs for PN   Purpose involves the notion of an intention to achieve the result spoken of in one or other of ss  a     b  or  c  Queensland Wire at   and Melway at    In the present case  PN contended that QR s purpose was to damage NRC or to deter it from engaging in competitive conduct in the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market  s  a  and or  c  or to prevent NRC or Toll from entering the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market or from engaging in competitive conduct in that market  s  b  and or  c    I do not consider that this constitutes a sufficient connection to amount to taking advantage within the principle stated by the High Court in Melway and Boral  referred toMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic     FCR   There are a number of reasons for this  First  any suggestion that a sitting government would act  or be likely to act  in a particular way based upon expressions of a particular point of view must usually be rejected  Although his Honour was dealing with principles of administrative law  it seems to me that what Gummow J said in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic     FCR   at     applies equally in the present context  A discretion conferred by statute is to be exercised on a proper understanding of what the statute requires and  ordinarily  is not to be confined by a statement or decision which forecloses the discretion   It seems to me to follow from this that any suggestion of a lost opportunity to obtain the benefit of Mr Hamill s support cannot be an opportunity which the law would recognise   Second  there is nothing to suggest that a long lease would have been negotiated in the available time  It took nearly three years for the parties to agree the final terms of the three year lease that was the subject of the   April   Heads  The good faith negotiations for a new lease which commenced in May   had not culminated in an agreement after about   months of negotiations referred toMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The terms of the EA could  if supported by necessary evidence from the relevant minds on behalf of NRC  give rise to a  legitimate expectation  that the State of Queensland and QR would act conformably with the terms of the EA  see  in a different context  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR     However  any evidence given by the directors of NRC as to their expectations based upon reading the EA would have to be tested against the proper and ordinary construction of the EA  This is because of the principle stated in     that the adoption of any assumption by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v McDade   FCA         FCR

cth HCA  html  It would be a false dichotomy to suggest that there is a distinction between taking advantage of market power and taking advantage of property rights  see NT Power Generation Pty Limited v Power and Water Authority   HCA         CLR     NT Power   at    Property rights can be a source of market power attracting liability under s   of the Act    The position in the present case is quite different from that which existed in NT Power   There  the owner of electricity and distribution infrastructure which refused access to a competitor was held to have a substantial degree of power in the market for transmission and distribution of electricity  The owner was held to have taken advantage of its power for a proscribed purpose   However  by contrast with the present case  the market power of the infrastructure owner in NT Power derived from its ownership and control of the infrastructure  The majority justices said at   that the critical fact underlying the owner s market power was its control of the infrastructure  see also at     Mr Ergas sought to overcome this difficulty in PN s case by arguing that QR had market power by reason of its ability as owner to refuse to grant a lease and to thereby undermine PN s security of tenure  This  he said  could increase PN s costs by reducing its ability to invest in improvements to the AR terminal which would increase PN s costs on the East Coast Line  thereby giving exclusionary market power to QR   Mr Ergas added to this that if PN does not have secure long term leasing arrangements the effect is to threaten investment security and impede it from operating efficiently  forcing it to have higher costs and  in turn  raising rival s costs   QR also submitted that it was not a supplier of the relevant service  namely access  It pointed to the statement in NT Power at   that s  c  provides that the relevant power is supplier power or acquirer power  It submitted that QR was not a supplier of access  that service being supplied by PN through its existing control of the AR terminal   In NT Power at   the majority justices were merely identifying  the character or capacity in which the corporation has whatever market power it has   They distinguished this from other forms of power such as that of a financial institution   This leaves open the possibility that in certain circumstances an owner whose market power derives from its capacity as owner may have  supplier power  in the sense referred to by McHugh ACJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power   However  in the present case  it seems to me that without any right of possession  and in circumstances in which QR s own requests for access has been refused  it cannot be said that it has the requisite capacity   A further question arises on the pleadings  It is whether QR has market power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market by reason of its control of the track from the AR terminal to the NSW border  However  I accept QR s submission that this is a false issue because there is no complaint that QR has sought to injure NRC as a competitor by denying or restricting its access to the track   Accordingly  I do not need to consider QR s submission that there are various constraints on the power  Nevertheless  I would observe that there is considerable force in Mr Ergas  argument that a self imposed constraint is no constraint at all  This seems to me to answer QR s submission that the East Coast Line is administered by QR s NAG in the same way as the infrastructure on the North Coast Line which is the subject of a statutory undertaking  I doubt that the NAG is truly ringfenced as contended by QR   Third  in my view  QR s longstanding offer to grant access rights to NRC and its desire to establish a common user or multi user facility at the AR terminal are inconsistent with the purposes for which NRC contends  This distinguishes the case from NT Power  where the infrastructure owner appreciated the existence of its market power and of the capacity to exercise that power to deliver access to the infrastructure  see NT Power at     Fourth  although they post date the impugned conduct  the General Freight Agreement of   November   for access to the East Coast Line  and the North Coast Access Agreement of   October   for access to the North Coast Line  are inconsistent with the suggestion of proscribed purposes   In cross examination of Mr Merrigan it was suggested that certain observations in his report of March   revealed a purpose of eliminating NRC as a competitor  He was taken to his remarks that NRC would not be a player in the long term and that this would be to QR s competitive advantage  see      Mr Merrigan said that this was a reference to NRC ceasing to exist as such after privatisation  There is force in Mr Walker s proposition that this was  meritless fencing   But I do not see that the comments of a consultant to QR  without more  are sufficient to give rise to an inference of proscribed purpose referred toPlimmer v Mayor of Wellington     AC   The amendment adding Schedule   provides as follows      Month     Allocated Monthly TEU     January           February

that detriment flows from the reliance  that is to say  if the assumption were not adhered to  Grundt at     Waltons at   and Verwayen at      It may be possible to divide detriment into the  narrower  and  broader  sense  although this approach  which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at   really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment  The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption  whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption  It is avoidance of the broader or  real detriment  flowing from reliance  from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position  Grundt at   per Dixon J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ    It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered  see P Feltham et al   Spencer Bower s Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation   th ed  Butterworths  London at  V    and Grundt at        Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel  the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense  that is to say  reliance  Verwayen at     per Mason CJ    Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment  see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at        The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon

promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at           In my opinion  to establish an equitable estoppel  it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that   the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship    the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation    the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation    the defendant knew or intended him to do so    the plaintiff s action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled  and   the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise         In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations  it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other s freedom

 Mr Lawrence was the source of the relevant information in the letters and in any event  QR disavowed any suggestion that the statements were made dishonestly  In these circumstances  I do not consider that Mr Smith s evidence would have elucidated this particular matter  see Payne v Parker     NSWLR   at   per Glass JA   I am not satisfied that NRC s consideration of QR s access applications involved anything other than a fair consideration of them on their merits  notwithstanding that NRC s responses were based on an erroneous assumption as to the overall capacity of the terminal  I do not consider that NRC was guilty of undue delay or obfuscation  as was suggested by QR   Accordingly  I have come to the view that NRC s failure to grant the access applications did not amount to taking advantage of market power  The relevant connection between NRC s market power and the impugned conduct was not  in my opinion  established referred toQueensland Wire Industries Pty Limited v Broken Hill Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Market power may be defined as the ability of a firm to raise prices above supply costs without rivals taking away customers  see Queensland Wire Industries Pty Limited v Broken Hill Pty Limited   HCA         CLR     Queensland Wire    at   and    Market power is not confined to the ability to influence prices  it may be manifested in practices directed at excluding competition  such as exclusive dealing or refusal to supply  Queensland Wire at     The reason for this is quite straightforward  QR owned the relevant infrastructure  but the terms of NRC s occupation  that is to say as a tenant with the right of exclusive possession and control  was inconsistent with the existence of market power residing in QR  The market is for the supply of access to the infrastructure  QR had no powers in that market  It had no ability to ask  let alone raise  prices for the supply of that service  Queensland Wire at   and     Whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is often a difficult question to answer  This may be because the words  take advantage  have been equated with  use  see Queensland Wire at       and     but the word  use  does not capture the full meaning of  take advantage  Boral at     The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction      what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of  Melway at   and   Boral   and   Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR     Rural Press   at    McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required  Boral at       if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation  that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct  Melway at   Boral at       the words  take advantage  do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection  Rural Press at       in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage  is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market  Melway at   and   Rural Press at       it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power  Melway at   Rural Press at       McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power  Boral at       the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power  Melway at       one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition  Queensland Wire at       the purpose of s   is the promotion of competition  it is concerned with the protection of competition  not competitors  Queensland Wire at   and   Boral at       and   Melway at       it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power  which can be taken advantage of  to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process  Boral at       There is a further reason why Mr Ergas  approach must be rejected  It is to be found in the reasons of the High Court in Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which explain the full impact of that decision   As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at   the operation of s   is predicated upon an assumption that competition is the means to protect the interests of consumers  Competition is by its nature deliberate and ruthless  All of the majority justices in Boral pointed out that s   is concerned with promoting competition  not protecting competitors  see       and    Injuries to rivals are a necessary bi product of vigorous competition   PN s approach is fundamentally flawed because it has at its heart the protection of its own position as a competitor of QR  not the interests of competition  It seeks to advance its own private interests over that of the public interest in promoting competition  It fails to distinguish between monopolistic practices which are prohibited and vigorous competition which is not  Queensland Wire at   per Dawson J   Purpose involves the notion of an intention to achieve the result spoken of in one or other of ss  a     b  or  c  Queensland Wire at   and Melway at    In the present case  PN contended that QR s purpose was to damage NRC or to deter it from engaging in competitive conduct in the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market  s  a  and or  c  or to prevent NRC or Toll from entering the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market or from engaging in competitive conduct in that market  s  b  and or  c    First  there are constant reminders in the authorities that competition is a ruthless process  As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at   competitors always try to injure each other by taking away sales and these injuries are the inevitable result of the competition that s   is designed to promote  In Boral at   Gleeson CJ and Callinan J pointed to the danger of confusing aggressive intent with anti competitive behaviour  see also per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   and per McHugh J at   citedRadaich v Smith   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The fundamental right given by a lease is a right of exclusive possession  Radaich v Smith   HCA         CLR   at    The nature of access contemplated by cl  a  in order to distinguish it from a lease  must be a right of non exclusive possession  But what is plain from the clause is that the grant of access is to be on commercial terms and conditions agreed between the parties  The extent of the rights of access would be a matter of construction of those terms  as agreed  Winter Garden Theatre  London  Limited v Millennium Productions Limited   AC   referred toRamsden v Dyson     LRHL   The last mentioned words appear to be a reference to the form of estoppel stated in Ramsden v Dyson     LRHL     Ramsden v Dyson   at    That is to say  it refers to an equitable estoppel arising from an expectation created or encouraged by the words or conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is raised  This form of estoppel includes failure to disabuse a party where the person estopped has knowledge of the other party s intention to act upon the

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction      what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of  Melway at   and   Boral   and   Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR     Rural Press   at    McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required  Boral at       if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation  that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct  Melway at   Boral at       the words  take advantage  do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection  Rural Press at       in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage  is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market  Melway at   and   Rural Press at       it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power  Melway at   Rural Press at       McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power  Boral at       the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power  Melway at       one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition  Queensland Wire at       the purpose of s   is the promotion of competition  it is concerned with the protection of competition  not competitors  Queensland Wire at   and   Boral at       and   Melway at       it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power  which can be taken advantage of  to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process  Boral at       Moreover  the suggestion that QR took advantage of market power is at odds with three further principles which emerge from the authorities  First  I do not see how it can be said that to obtain possession with a view to converting the AR terminal to a common user facility as was sought in     or a multi user facility in   was facilitated by the existence of the power  Melway at   and Rural Press at     Nor am I satisfied that NRC s purpose in failing to grant the access applications was a proscribed purpose in contravention of s    Its purpose was the protection of the integrity of its national network  The position is not entirely analogous with that which arose in Rural Press   Nevertheless  in my view  so long as NRC gave proper consideration to the access applications  which in my opinion it did  its purpose cannot be said to be to have been to prevent QR from engaging in competitive conduct in the relevant market   It follows from my rejection of PN s estoppel claim and from my rejection of the claims of misleading conduct  unconscionability and breach of s   that QR is entitled to an order for possession  There is to be a stay of the order in accordance with the undertaking given by QR to the Court   It also follows that QR is entitled to an order for payment by NRC of additional rent pursuant to s   of the Property Law Act  referred toSebben v Partridge  unreported Supreme of South Australia  Lander J    December   It follows that I am not satisfied that the statements made in the relevant letters were incorrect  Moreover  I am not satisfied that the statements were made otherwise than honestly in good faith  It is true that Mr Smith was not called to give evidence  although a belated attempt was made to re open to rely on his affidavit  But it is unnecessary for me to make a finding that his evidence would not have assisted  cf Sebben v Partridge  unreported Supreme of South Australia  Lander J    December    In that case  Lander J was of the view that a Jones v Dunkel inference was

Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Three clauses call for consideration  Clause   deals with the term of the amended Terminal Services Agreement  The initial term is for approximately two and a half years  to   October    Renewal for a period of five years is conditional upon the existence of a Corridor Access Agreement for the full renewal period  Since QR owns the rail track from the border to the AR terminal  it would be under an implied duty to cooperate with PN in the grant of a Corridor Access Agreement  Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Limited v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     It is true that  under cl     extensions beyond the Renewal Term are in the discretion of QR  But there is nothing to suggest that QR would refuse to extend the agreement to PN which would  at least on the existing evidence  be its largest customer  Moreover  a refusal may trigger a claim of contravention of s   of the Act  although  of course  that would depend upon the factual circumstances at the time of any refusal referred toSouth Australia v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  QR submitted that the EA was a political agreement not intended to create legal relations  see eg South Australia v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR    Railways Standardisation Case  at         and      There is considerable force in this submission  Mr Hanscomb acknowledged that the EA was a mixture of commercial arrangements and political imperatives  However  PN does not seek to enforce the EA  Rather  PN contends that the EA engendered assumptions founding an estoppel   It is unnecessary for me to decide whether a political agreement is capable of providing the foundation for a claim in estoppel  I consider it unlikely to be so capable in the absence of a representation or other conduct which could have been relied upon  But even if the terms of the EA could give rise to an estoppel  the claim fails because PN s evidence of the assumptions said to arise from a reading of the EA rests upon two misconceptions   First   access  in cl  a  is not to be given a meaning equivalent to  control  or  exclusive possession   To do so would be to construe  access  as conferring rights equivalent to a lease  That cannot be correct because cl  a  specifically distinguishes between ownership  lease and access  It follows that  access  must import something different from the rights which would flow from a lease referred toStandard Chartered Bank Aust

points to the distinction between reliance and detriment  The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption  whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted

Waltons at           In my opinion  to establish an equitable estoppel  it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that   the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship    the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation    the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation    the

that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise         In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations  it is necessary for the party

apart from the fact that Mr Lonergan s third report adopted a completely different approach and methodology to his previous report  there are a number of serious difficulties with his evidence which cause me to reject it  First  Mr Lonergan did not identify which costs were fixed and which were variable  Second  PN failed to discharge the onus of adducing evidence of all the costs of operations on the East Coast corridor  I could not be satisfied that Mr Lonergan s evidence matched the whole of PN s expenditure with the whole of its revenue  This criticism is directed at PN rather than Mr Lonergan  PN carried the evidentiary onus on this issue  Swain v Waverley Municipal Council     ALR   at         The evidence of QR s witness  Mr Bryant  is to be preferred  notwithstanding that both experts are well qualified   The short answer to Mr Lonergan s attempt to offer a different approach to interest costs is that his first report was based on actual interest costs whereas his third report looked at interest in the nature of opportunity costs  A calculation of whether expenditure has been recouped is not concerned with lost opportunity costs  Accordingly  Mr Lonergan s approach

conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights  Austotel at     per Kirby JA and at     per Rogers AJA   Here the question is whether there has been an unjust departure by one person  that is to say QR   from an assumption adopted by another  ie NRC  as the basis for NRC s decision to make the investment decisions to which I have referred  see Thompson at     Thus  although as I have said at   Messrs Butcher  Moore Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh gave evidence in general terms that they relied on Mr Graham  it seems to me to be necessary to look at the evidence of their deliberations to see whether this was consistent with the approach taken by Mr Graham  I do not consider that reliance in general terms can be sufficient in circumstances where the individual directors gave evidence of their own approaches to the matter   It follows that of the four pleaded assumptions  only the second assumption finds any support in the evidence  But the only evidence to support it was that of Mr Graham and his approach was inconsistent with that of the other directors  In my opinion this does not establish that NRC adopted the assumption as the basis for the relevant actions within the principle stated by Dixon J in Thompson    As Dixon J said in Thompson at   whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption   Even if the assumptions propounded by PN are capable in their terms of giving rise to an estoppel  the claim fails because QR did nothing to occasion or cause the adoption of the assumption   Mr Graham formed his assumptions based upon his reading of the EA  He did not put forward any positive statement or conduct by Mr O Rourke or  to the extent that Mr Hamill s conduct is  or may  be relevant  any positive statement or conduct of Mr Hamill  Instead he emphasised that nothing said by either of those persons in the period from   to March   was inconsistent with Mr Graham s understanding of the EA   The claim of lost opportunity to apply political pressure is  to borrow from the words of Starke J in Thompson at   at best  wholly speculative and conjectural  and affords  no solid basis  for concluding that NRC acted to its detriment   The same may be said of the suggestion that NRC lost the opportunity to avail itself of the alternative dispute resolution provisions of cl   of the EA  Not only did NRC fail to invoke the clause  but as I have already said  the clause did not provide a mechanism for determination of the form or the terms of the rights to be accorded to NRC   There were three species of operational detriment identified by PN  The first was generalised evidence of the adverse effect on future operating conditions at the AR terminal given  in particular  by Mr Fullerton  The second was said to be the comparison between PN s existing cost of operations and the price to be charged by QR under the Terminal Services Agreement  This proposition was put to QR s CEO  Mr Scheuber  in cross examination referred toTrade Practices Commission v

Commission v Pioneer Concrete  Qld  Pty Limited     FCR     Pioneer Concrete   at     and   see also Boral at   per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ   The primary consideration in determining market power is whether there are barriers to entry into the relevant market  Pioneer Concrete at   citing Eastern Express Pty Limited v General Newspapers Pty Limited     FCR     Eastern Express   at     per Lockhart and Gummow JJ   A corporation will have a substantial degree of power in the market if it has a considerable or large degree of power  Eastern Express at     In JD Heydon  Trade Practices Law   Restrictive Trade Practices  Deceptive Conduct and Consumer Protection  LBC  Vol   Sydney at     the learned author observes that s   is not concerned with a firm moving toward possession of a substantial degree of power in a market but only with a firm which has already gained possession of a substantial degree of power  This is because abuse of monopoly power consists of a corporation with the requisite degree of power taking advantage of it for a proscribed purpose  Unless the power presently exists there is nothing of which it can be said the corporation has taken advantage   Alternatively  any power arising from QR s ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC  Melway at   Boral at   and Pioneer Concrete at     and     Mr Ergas  opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power  However  that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above  in particular Melway at   Boral at   and Pioneer Concrete at      and   referred toTransfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  PN will lose some flexibility in its ability to handle late trains  The wording of cl    a i  of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement is awkward  but in my opinion it imposes a positive obligation upon the Terminal Manager to do what is reasonable in the circumstances to provide services  Transfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited   HCA         CLR     Transfield   at    In my view  the alteration to the clause in the draft of   July   to replace  reasonable endeavours  with  best endeavours  does not affect the scope or content of the obligation prescribed by the clause   Clause     and Schedule   of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement make provision for the allocation of capacity to PN for increases in the allocated monthly TEU  Schedule   lists the allocated monthly TEU which varies according to seasonal use  The total annual allocation is approximately   TEU  which is equal to PN s throughput for the year ended   June   as stated in Mr Lawrence s evidence  However  Mr Lawrence said that he expected throughput of   to   TEU for the year ending   June     Schedule   provides for an automatic and permanent increase of   in the allocated monthly TEU upon notice to the Rail Operator  This would enable PN to come close to the anticipated   throughput   The proper construction of cl     seems to me to impose an obligation on QR to use reasonable endeavours to provide services for late trains  see Transfield at    The proper construction of the clause is not controlled by the heading  The clause is not clearly expressed but the agreement to use  best endeavours  must be seen as a proviso to the opening words of cl    a i  which appear on their face to deny such an obligation   The business rationale for the clause is the efficient operation of the AR terminal  whilst at the same time making provision for QR to use reasonable endeavours to service PN s late trains   In summary  it is my opinion that even if QR had a substantial degree of power in the market at the time of the impugned conduct  it did not take advantage of the power referred toUnited Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The first assumption is that QR would grant a lease or access  for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations in Queensland  on a commercial basis  or for at least   years  The extent of any such business and the degree of repetition or continuity of the requisite activity are not spelled out  Hope v Bathurst City Council   HCA         CLR   at   and United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited   HCA

agreement of the parties as to the content of the terms citedWaltons Stores  Interstate  Limited v Maher   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Waltons Stores  Interstate  Limited v Maher   HCA         CLR     Waltons  at   Brennan J pointed to the difficulty of contending for an estoppel against a party s freedom to withdraw from contractual negotiations  His Honour said that it is only if the first party induces the other to believe that the inducer  ie the first party  is already bound and that there is no freedom to withdraw  that it could be unconscionable for the first party to assert an entitlement to withdraw from the negotiations   Notwithstanding this difficulty  the applicant contends that the respondent is estopped from interfering with its occupation  management and control of a parcel of land comprising about   square metres and known as the Acacia Ridge Interstate Container Terminal  the AR terminal  near Brisbane in circumstances in which the respondent withdrew from negotiations for a   year lease  The respondent owns an adjoining parcel of land comprising about   square metres  This is known as the Q link Terminal  I will describe its location at    The respondent conducts rail freight services from the Q link terminal  The applicant makes no claim to that terminal  These proceedings are concerned solely with the applicant s claim in respect of the AR terminal   The respondent owns the AR terminal  which is an intermodal terminal enabling the transfer of containers between trains and trucks which service the Brisbane area  The applicant went into possession  and assumed the management and operational control  of the AR terminal on   April    It has remained in occupation  management and control ever since  It occupied the AR terminal as a monthly tenant under an expired lease from April   until its tenancy was purportedly terminated in May    It remained in occupation thereafter as explained below   I will enumerate the propositions as follows        The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which  unless the assumption is adhered to  would operate to the other s detriment  Thompson v Palmer   HCA         CLR     Thompson   at   per Dixon J  Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited     CLR     Grundt   at   per Dixon J  Legione at     Waltons at   per Brennan J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ and at   per McHugh J    Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption  Thompson at   per Dixon J  Grundt at     Legione at     Waltons at   per Mason CJ  Wilson J  Verwayen at   per Deane J and at   per McHugh J    Accordingly  the reference to an  unjust  departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness  Legione at    That is to say  it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption    The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance  that is to say  if the assumption were not adhered to  Grundt at     Waltons at   and Verwayen at      It may be possible to divide detriment into the  narrower  and  broader  sense  although this approach  which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at   really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment  The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption  whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption  It is avoidance of the broader or  real detriment  flowing from reliance  from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position  Grundt at   per Dixon J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ    It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered  see P Feltham et al   Spencer Bower s Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation   th ed  Butterworths  London at  V    and Grundt at        Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel  the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense  that is to say  reliance  Verwayen at     per Mason CJ    Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment  see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at        The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel  Thompson at   per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at   per Mason CJ  Dixon J s reference in Thompson at   to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph  ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff  It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established  see J D Heydon   Cross on Evidence   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworth  Sydney at        Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship  Thompson at   Con Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR     Con Stan   at      The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence  as stated by the High Court in Con Stan at     has been qualified by later authority  The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law  Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts     NSWLR   at     per Samuels JA  Waltons at   and Verwayen at   per Dixon J    per Deane J  and at   per McHugh J    An estoppel by convention  unlike estoppel by representation  depends upon mutual assumptions  It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts  or law  Con Stan at      Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters  But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel  in particular a promissory estoppel  Waltons at     per Mason CJ and Wilson J and   per Gaudron J and Verwayen at     per McHugh J    The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at           In my opinion  to establish an equitable estoppel  it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that   the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship    the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation    the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation    the defendant knew or intended him to do so    the plaintiff s action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled  and   the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise         In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations  it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other s freedom to withdraw has gone  that is to say  there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed  This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General  Hong Kong  v Humphreys Estate  Queen s Gardens  Limited     AC     Humphreys      The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances  Waltons at   per Mason CJ and Wilson J  Verwayen at   per Mason CJ and at   per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China     NSWLR   at   per Giles J    A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous  Legione at     Foran v Wight   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason J  and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited     FCR     Mobil Oil   at   per Lockhart  Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ  see also Spencer Bower s Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at  V         A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that  a particular legal relationship  or  interest  would arise or be granted  Mobil Oil at      A pre existing contractual relationship is not  under Australian law  a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel  Waltons at     per Mason CJ and Wilson J and     per Brennan J and Verwayen at   per Dawson J    A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at         If a man  under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land  or  what amounts to the same thing  under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest  takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord  and upon the faith of such promise or expectation  with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him  lays out money upon the land  a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation         Lord Kingsdown s statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington     AC     Plimmer  at   and again in Humphreys at   see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited     NSWLR     Austotel   at      Priestley JA s distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent  Mobil Oil at      Subject to a qualification stated below  it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract  The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief  Plimmer at     Inwards v Baker     QB   at   and Austotel at     per Priestley JA    The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land  the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights  Austotel at     per Kirby JA and at     per Rogers AJA   The short answer to the status of documents such as the Task Force Report and the Heads of Government Agreement is that they were superseded by the EA  In an estoppel case  it is possible to put forward an understanding based on communications which preceded the execution of a written agreement  cf Hoyts  Pty Limited v Spencer   HCA         CLR   see Waltons at      But it seems to me that here any understandings or assumptions based on pre contractual reports or heads could not be reasonable   At its highest  Mr O Rourke s concession  and my view that Messrs Graham and Butcher held a similar assumption  establishes no more than a belief by all concerned that there would be negotiations  That claim runs headlong into the difficulty raised by the Privy Council in Humphreys and reiterated by Brennan J in Waltons   A hope or expectation that an agreement will be reached is not enough  The party asserting an estoppel must go further   The principles are summed up in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at        Parties who are negotiating a contract may proceed in the expectation that the terms will be agreed and a contract made but  so long as both parties recognize that either party is at liberty to withdraw from the negotiations at any time before the contract is made  it cannot be unconscionable for one party to do so  Of course  the freedom to withdraw may be fettered or extinguished by agreement but  in the absence of agreement  either party ordinarily retains his freedom to withdraw  It is only if a party induces the other party to believe that he  the former party  is already bound and his freedom to withdraw has gone that it could be unconscionable for him subsequently to assert that he is legally free to withdraw   As I understand PN s claim under this head  it is that QR was under a duty to inform NRC that it did not intend to proceed with the negotiations  The argument is built upon QR s knowledge that NRC was spending large sums on  or in relation to  the AR terminal   However  I cannot see that this claim has any foundation  PN fairly and properly conceded that the negotiations for a new lease in   were conducted in good faith by QR  The position might have been different if QR had not negotiated in good faith because an argument would then have been available that QR had resiled from an assumption which might  at least on one view  have been created by it  But that is not the case here  The assumption was that QR would negotiate in good faith for a   year lease  That was what took place  albeit the parties were still at odds on a number of fundamental issues when QR had a change of heart   Priestley JA was there applying  although distinguishing on the facts  the principle stated by the Privy Council in Humphreys   His Honour s approach also reflects the principle stated by Brennan J in Waltons which I have set out at   above referred toWinter Garden Theatre  London  Limited v Millennium Productions Limited   AC   The fundamental right given by a lease is a right of exclusive possession  Radaich v Smith   HCA         CLR   at    The nature of access contemplated by cl  a  in order to distinguish it from a lease  must be a right of non exclusive possession  But what is plain from the clause is that the grant of access is to be on commercial terms and conditions agreed between the parties  The extent of the rights of access would be a matter of construction of those terms  as agreed  Winter Garden Theatre  London  Limited v Millennium Productions Limited   AC   citedWood v City of Melbourne     ALR   That is not to say that the state of mind to be attributed to a corporation must always be the state of mind of one particular officer  Brambles at   per Bray CJ  see also Wood v City of Melbourne     ALR   at
