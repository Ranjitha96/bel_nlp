inadmissible  at least to the extent that their opinions went to the construction of the claims  It was argued that in the absence of technical or scientific words or expressions requiring expert explanation  which was said not to be the case here  the task of construction of the claims was for the Court and  as such  this evidence was irrelevant and consequently inadmissible  See  for instance  the recent judgment in Breville Pty Ltd v The Warehouse Group  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCA   at         Clorox also submitted that certain portions of the respondents  affidavit evidence were inadmissible  again on grounds of irrelevance  as it was not for a witness to rewrite or redraft the Patent  I should note that Clorox made further submissions in respect of the admissibility of the respondents  evidence in the context of infringement and I will consider those objections when addressing infringement   The respondents submitted that the evidence to which Clorox raised an objection was admissible on the basis that it responded to the evidence of Clorox s own expert witness  was of assistance to the Court in construing the relevant claims of the Patent  and that the weight to be

skilled in the art before the priority date  would have understood from the language used in the claim  in the context of the specification as a whole  that the patentee intended that strict compliance was an essential requirement of the invention  Catnic at   D cor at   Populin at   Beltreco at     Mr Hess for Clorox submitted that the use of the word   straight  in this context referred to the visual approximation of straight  While Mr Caine submitted on behalf of the respondents that  straight  was used in its geometric sense  he accepted that the term would encompass joinder involving a slight degree of curvature  In this sense  Mr Caine seemed to be accepting and adopting a purposive construction similar to that applied by Lord Diplock in Catnic in relation to the term  vertical   On one level at least the dispute seemed to be about just how much deviation from geometric precision was consistent with the description   straight   This aspect of the debate seems to be what is behind the characterisation of the straight sides requirement as an intermediate term  see     above   As noted above  the Patent is addressed to the hypothetical non inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date  A patent is a public instrument designed to disclose the invention  As such  the term should be given a construction that is consistent with this role  The relevant claims require that the front and rear panels be joined along three straight sides  The claims do not require that these panels be joined along lines that appear to be straight or that the join is displayed as straight  In my view  in this context  straight  must be construed to require that the joins  when the nominal bag is in the laid flat form  are straight in the geometric sense but not so as to restrict the term to absolute or perfect geometric precision  It might  in my view  extend to encompass joinder along sides that display a slight or modest curvature  Ultimately  however  it is not necessary for me to be more precise on this point as  for reasons explained below  I have formed the view that the sides of the Hercules Bag are distinctly curved and do not fall within any possible meaning of straight as used in the Patent specification   Section   of the Act relevantly provides that a patentee has the exclusive rights  during the term of the patent  to exploit the invention and to authorise another person to exploit the invention  The term  exploit  is relevantly defined in Schedule   of the Act as follows      exploit   in relation to an invention  includes       a  where the invention is a product  make  hire  sell or otherwise dispose of the product  offer to make  sell  hire or otherwise dispose of it  use or import it  or keep it for the

at   D cor at   Populin at   Beltreco at   appliedEI Dupont de Nemours   Co v Imperial Chemical Industries plc     IPR   As such  a court can have regard to evidence from experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning  see   above and EI Dupont de Nemours   Co v Imperial Chemical Industries plc     IPR   at      This is not to say that the court is thereby relinquishing its role as the ultimate arbitrator of the proper construction of the claims  The weight that a court gives to such evidence will vary from case to case   In the present proceedings  the terms used in the relevant claims are unusual given the characteristics of plastic bags  see     above  The use of particular terms  especially  straight  must be understood by reference to what the hypothetical addressee would consider the terms to mean  Consequently  in my view the evidence adduced by the respondents provides evidence of the meaning that the notional addressee would ascribe to such terms and the evidence is admissible as relevant to the construction of the claims   Counsel for Clorox accepted that in order to consider infringement a bag must be considered in the laid flat form but contended that this could encompass a laid flat three dimensional form  In my view the concession as to the laid flat form was correctly made  The language of the relevant claims  as set out above  is ambiguous when considered in isolation  The terms chosen by the patentee to describe the monopoly cannot be properly understood without reference to the specification as a whole  In particular  unless the bags are arranged in a laid flat form  it is not sensible to refer to the front and rear panels of the bag or to the sides of the bag  whether straight or otherwise  or even to discuss the shape of the fourth side of the bag  To consider the bags in any other form or arrangement would be to deprive the essential integers of the invention of any content  While  as previously mentioned  a clear and unambiguous claim must not be varied or qualified by statements in the remainder of the specification  in the present context the language chosen is difficult to comprehend without reference to the description of the invention contained in the body of the specification  Thus  in my opinion the relevant claims each import a requirement that the language used is to be understood in light of the invention being in the laid flat form

provided by the questions in Improver   which Mr Hess referred to in his submissions  In particular her Honour said at         I do not consider that utilisation of those questions is helpful other than  perhaps  as a  check  on the conclusion reached as to the characterisation of essential or inessential integers present in the allegedly infringing article  They are no substitute for construction of the claim to ascertain the essential and inessential integers and a determination regarding the presence of those integers for infringement   While the shape of the fourth side might accurately be described as the novel feature of the invention claimed  the patentee has chosen by the language of the claims to make the requirement that the front and rear panels be joined along straight sides an essential feature   In my view  these two issues  both of which involve construction of the claims and the specification as a whole  are necessarily connected  Mr Caine s threshold question about the form in which the refuse bag of the invention is to be arranged in order to understand its features  cannot be addressed properly without considering the context in which there is a requirement that the panels be joined along three straight sides  Similarly  the meaning of  along three straight sides  cannot be determined without reference to the appropriate arrangement

concerned with what the author meant to say  There is no window into the mind of the patentee or the author of any other document  Construction is objective in the sense that it is concerned with what a reasonable person to whom the utterance was addressed would have understood the author to be using the words to mean  Notice  however  that it is not  as is sometimes said   the meaning of the words the author used  but rather what the notional addressee would have understood the author to mean by using those words  The meaning of words is a matter of convention  governed by rules  which can be found in dictionaries and grammars  What the author would have been understood to mean by using those words is not simply a matter of rules  It is highly sensitive to the context of  and background to  the particular utterance   It depends not only upon the words the author has chosen but also upon the identity of the audience he is taken to have been addressing and the knowledge and assumptions

bags  as detailed in the specification of the Patent  from an extruded tube of plastic  Initially therefore  there is no bag  merely a plastic tube  For this reason  Clorox did not claim that this was a case where infringement occurred during the manufacturing process  see  for instance  Pinefair Pty Ltd v Bedford Industries Rehabilitation Association Inc     IPR    After the plastic is blown through the extruder  the resulting tube is flattened  The longitudinal sides are  gusseted  by effectively folding the longitudinal sides towards each other  so that they meet in the centre of the inside of the tube  This  four layered form  is then folded in half again resulting in an eight layered form  that is one quarter the size of the flattened extruded plastic tube  The tube s base  the third side  is then heat welded forming a  star shaped  weld  This feature marks  in essence  the practical difference between the plastic bag described in the Patent s specification and the Hercules Bag   The gusseting of the longitudinal sides and the star shaped welding of the base have both advantages and disadvantages in comparison to the bag described in the specification  For instance  the Hercules Bag has less capacity and uses more plastic material because of the way in which the base is welded  However  an advantage is that the Hercules Bag is able to be sold in packaging that is narrower than would otherwise be the case  This was said by Mr Caine to be attractive to retailers as the package fits in a supermarket basket and occupies less shelf space  It is also the case that the base weld is stronger and the Hercules Bag has greater tear strength  Dr Pullum also gave evidence that fewer manufacturing difficulties arose when cutting and or serrating across a narrower portion of plastic  In other words  to cut or serrate across a portion one eighth the width of the tube is less likely to involve manufacturing difficulties than performing the same action across the entire width of the extruded tube  Dr Pullum also stated that the Hercules Bag could be manufactured in multiple streams   It is also important to note that the Hercules Bag is in an eight layered form when sold  Consequently  in order to be used in the manner envisaged  the bag must  first  be torn from the other bags to which it is attached along the base and top sides  and secondly   opened  up such that refuse or garbage can be placed in the bag through the open top side  This latter action will necessarily mean that  except for the base weld  the bag will no longer be in an eight layered form appliedPopulin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd     ALR   The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date  Welch Perrin

Kirin Amgen   Sachtler at      It is inappropriate  however  to approach construction of the specification with a view to being  fair  to the patentee  Kirin Amgen at   Sachtler at    The fact that the monopoly is granted in consideration for the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society must be recognised  Beltreco at    Indeed  the principles governing a definition of a monopoly operating over the public at large require a description of the claims that  is not reasonably capable of misunderstanding  Martin at    The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct prohibited  British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v A Fussell   Sons Ltd     RPC   at      The public are entitled to be able to design around the monopoly claimed in a patent and therefore they must be able to determine reliably the scope of the claims  Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmat Paper Machinery Inc     RPC   at     I do not accept the applicant s attempt to introduce the concept of an  intermediate  feature  Either the feature is necessary for an article to infringe the Patent or it is not  Mr Hess  submissions qualifying his concession go to the proper construction of the relevant claims  and in particular the meaning of  straight  in this context  rather than to whether this requirement is essential  The construction of the requirement found in the specifications that these sides be  straight  is a separate question and is discussed below  In my view the requirement that the front and rear panels be joined along three straight sides is an essential integer of the relevant claims and the Hercules Bag must possess this element in order for infringement to be demonstrated  On this issue I respectfully agree with Bennett J in Sachtler at   where her Honour said     To the extent that recent judgments of this court have suggested that there may be infringement by taking what is determined to be the substantial idea disclosed by the specification but not the essential integers of the claim  I must respectfully disagree
