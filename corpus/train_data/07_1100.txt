FCR   The third issue raised by the appellant claims that the Tribunal erred in not identifying to him the conflict between the appellant s statement dated   December   and the submissions prepared for him in   relating to his claims  Such conflict was obvious on the face of the documents and arose after the Minister s decision  As such the Tribunal was entitled to rely on such issue in making its finding without expressly informing the appellant that it would be relying on such inconsistencies in reaching its decision  see Commissioner for the Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   at        It is apparent that the issues of concern to the Tribunal were made abundantly clear to the appellant by the first s  A  letter and the second s  A  letter  The

Ukraine  Because of the inadequacy of the appellant s explanation which might provide a link between the alleged corruption and his persecution  there was no obligation on the Tribunal to specifically

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at    distinguishedLiu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Before the Court  the respondent relied upon the decision in Liu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   in support of its submission that the Tribunal was not required to hold a hearing  However the facts in that decision are distinguishable since different statutory provisions applied  The Tribunal member had resigned after the hearing and before delivering any decision  Pursuant to s   of the Act  another person may be authorised to hear evidence in such circumstances  The statutory provision specifically authorised the continuation of the review by another person  In the present proceedings  the decision of the first Tribunal was set aside due to jurisdictional error and the proceedings were remitted for determination according to law  No question arises of another person continuing the same review as is envisaged by s   of the Act   Despite the time limit fixed by the first s  A  letter  the Tribunal sent its second s  A  letter extending the time for submission of further evidence and  due to its own omission from such letter wrote again on   August   extending the time for compliance to   August    The requested information was received by the Tribunal on   August   within the time limit set by the Tribunal  Accordingly the Court is unable to agree with her Honour that the appellant failed to comply with the time limit imposed by the Tribunal and that s  C  of the Act applied to disentitle the appellant from a hearing   By sending the first and second s  A  letters it was clear that the Tribunal required additional information to enable it to determine the application before it  If after the receipt of such further information the Tribunal was still unable to make a decision favourable to the appellant it had an obligation pursuant to s   of the Act to invite the appellant to appear before it  The fact that a previous hearing was held did not discharge this obligation in view of the fact that the Tribunal had requested further information  The Tribunal made its decision in the absence of making further inquiry of Mr Slater as it was invited to do  and without inviting the appellant to appear at a hearing followedApplicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant also submitted that the second Tribunal made its decision based upon documents provided to the first Tribunal hearing  However  there is no reason why documents provided in respect of the first Tribunal hearing could not be used in the second hearing  The second Tribunal s decision clearly indicates that it had sought additional information and considered the further submissions made by the appellant s agent in response  The Tribunal s duty to review the Minister s decision under s   of the Act continues until one of the outcomes described in s   of the Act is reached  see Applicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at      Whilst the appellant made no submissions directly relating to the grounds of appeal referred to in his Notice of Appeal  the Court will nevertheless consider such grounds   As a second issue  the appellant claimed that the Tribunal failed to inform him that one of the reasons that it would find an absence of persecution was because the appellant s letter sent to the Tribunal following the refusal of the Minister to grant a visa dated   April   did not refer to persecution  The appellant was not entitled to assume that the issues considered by the Minister to be critical were the only issues of concern to the Tribunal  The Tribunal was empowered to consider matters in addition to those raised before the Minister  as requested by the appellant  and to make a decision upon them  see Applicant NAFF of     CLR       There is a further consideration  The original decision of the Tribunal  having been set aside had  no operative effect  see SZILQ   FCA    The reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place  The Tribunal s duty required it to seek further information under s  A  and in the absence of a finding in favour of the appellant was required to invite the appellant   to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issuing arising in relation to the decision under review  pursuant to s   of the Act  see Applicant NAFF of     CLR at

Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant submitted that there had been a denial of procedural fairness in light of the principles applied in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR   because the Tribunal had rejected the appellant s claims on five grounds which were not obviously open to it on the material presented to it   Barnes FM found that the Tribunal placed the appellant on notice by both the first s  A  letter and the second s  A  letter that the Tribunal might not have a further hearing and gave the appellant an opportunity to address the issues of concern to the Tribunal  Barnes FM found that there was no error in the exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to not hold a second hearing   Barnes FM found that s  C  of the Act applied because the appellant had been invited to give additional information and had not given it within the time provided  Accordingly  pursuant to ss  c  and     the appellant was not entitled to appear before the Tribunal  Her Honour contrasted the situation in SZBEL   HCA       ALR   to the circumstances in the case before her  observing that in the present case there was no existing obligation upon the Tribunal to invite the appellant to a hearing and to give evidence and present arguments in relation to the issues under review  Her Honour also found that it had not been established that the Tribunal made its decision on the basis of matters not obviously open on the material before it  Accordingly  no lack of procedural fairness was established and Barnes FM dismissed the application   The Notice of Appeal to this Court raises two grounds as follows  The appellant submitted that the Tribunal failed to take into account  when assessing his Application for Review  the fact that he had sent documents to the Tribunal on   August    However it was pointed out to the appellant that the Tribunal s decision referred to the documents which he had forwarded and made specific reference to each of them in its decision   The appellant s first ground of appeal claims that the Tribunal failed to identify to him five bases upon which it made its decision  The first basis for the Tribunal s decision which the appellant claims was not identified to him was the finding that the threat of harm to the appellant in relation to the horse theft was not related to a Convention reason  Barnes FM noted that this issue was raised at the Tribunal hearing and that the Tribunal had written to the appellant informing him that it would listen to the tapes of the first Tribunal hearing and give the appellant an opportunity to comment on that decision  It was clear that the basis for the appellant s claimed persecution was in issue  see SZBEL   HCA       ALR   at      It is apparent that the issues of concern to the Tribunal were made abundantly clear to the appellant by the first s  A  letter and the second s  A

Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   the appellant sought a second Tribunal hearing after the Tribunal s initial decision had been quashed and the proceedings had been remitted to the Tribunal  The appellant provided material to the second Tribunal which included a testimonial from a local pastor attesting to the appellant s religious observance in Australia  The Tribunal denied the appellant s request for a further hearing  In an appeal to this Court from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which affirmed the Tribunal s decision to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant  the appellant claimed that the Tribunal had not complied with its obligations under s   of the Act insofar as that obligation related to the Tribunal s consideration of s  R   The Court upheld the appeal  finding that the right of the appellant to satisfy his onus of proof under s  R  was not afforded  At   the Court said    The RRT took the view  following the Full Court decision in SZEPZ  that it was not necessary to conduct a further oral hearing because  as the review was a continuing one despite the earlier decision being set aside  a hearing had already been held  However  that mistakes the nature of the obligation under s    The RRT itself found it necessary to take a further step to comply with s  A after the earlier decision was set aside  An additional element then emerged  in respect of which the appellant had not been given an opportunity to give evidence and present arguments at an oral hearing  In those circumstances the obligations under s   were not fully met   There is a further consideration  The original decision of the Tribunal  having been set aside had  no operative effect  see SZILQ   FCA    The reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place  The Tribunal s duty required it to seek further information under s  A  and in the absence of a finding in favour of the appellant was required to invite the appellant   to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issuing arising in relation to the decision under review  pursuant to s   of the Act  see Applicant NAFF of     CLR at
