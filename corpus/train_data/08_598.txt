Hamersley Iron Pty Limited v The National Competition Council   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredHamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Hamersley claims that  by reason of certain orders made by Kenny J in Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council   FCA         ALR     First Hamersley Iron   the NCC should be prevented from considering or otherwise dealing with TPI s application   In First Hamersley Iron   a similar application was made by Robe River Mining Co Pty Ltd and a group of associated joint venturers  hereafter described for convenience as Robe River   Kenny J held that the NCC did not have power to recommend declaration of Hamersley s rail track under Pt IIIA of the TPA because it was not a  service  within s  B  That was because the rail track involved  the use of a production process  and therefore fell within the exclusion to the definition of  service  in that section   TPI s application to the NCC  which lies behind this proceeding  involves the same rail track as that featured in First Hamersley Iron  though it extends beyond it  Hamersley claims that the NCC remains permanently bound by her Honour s orders in First Hamersley Iron   and therefore has no power to consider TPI s application or recommend declaration of the service  That is so despite the fact that TPI was not a party to the earlier proceeding   Hamersley invokes the doctrine of res judicata as the central plank of its case  It also relies upon what it says were undertakings given to the Court by the NCC in First Hamersley Iron   which it submits prevent the NCC from entertaining TPI s application   Part IIIA of the TPA contains a statutory regime for regulated access to what may be described as  essential facilities   Introduced in   this regime allows the designated Minister  usually the Federal Treasurer  to  declare  a particular  service  pursuant to s  H  The Minister cannot proceed without a recommendation from the NCC  This means that all declarations must be filtered through the NCC   A declaration of a service overrides what would otherwise be the exclusive rights of the owner of a  monopoly  facility to determine the terms and conditions upon which that owner will supply its services to others  In essence  the focus is upon facilities of national significance  which it would be uneconomic to duplicate and which supply a service  access to which would promote competition  efficiency and the public interest citedBHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council     FCR   The provisions of Pt IIIA are complex and have given rise to difficulty  For example  judges of this Court have differed as to the meaning of the term  the use of a production process  in s  B  Recently  in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council     FCR     a Full Court  by majority  disapproved Kenny J s reasoning in First Hamersley Iron  In March this year  the High Court granted special leave to appeal from that decision of the Full Court   It is well established that the doctrine of res judicata will apply whether or not the decision which is said to give rise to that form of estoppel has itself been overruled  It makes no difference whether the initial judgment was wrong  It follows that I need not concern myself with whether First Hamersley Iron represents good law  The only question is whether it operates in the way for which Hamersley contends   In considering whether First Hamersley Iron operates to prevent the NCC from dealing with the TPI application   it is of course necessary to pay close attention to the issues determined in that case   The facts may be briefly stated  In September   Robe River applied to the NCC under s  F  to recommend that the designated Minister declare the Hamersley rail track to be a  service   The application identified Hamersley as the provider of the service and the owner of the facility to which it related   The Robe River application went on to state as follows            The service to which  Robe  seeks access is the bulk iron ore rail track transportation service provided by the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility  as defined in part   of this application   Rail Track Service    This should be distinguished from any rail haulage service which may be available in relation to this facility                  The Rail Track Service is required for use by both  Robe  trains and by  Robe  hi rails only over that section of the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility described in part   of this application              The Rail Track Service comprises the use of an infrastructure facility  being the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility mainline  yard track and maintenance support road  including the in track fault detection and monitoring systems  and the use of a communications service being the train control systems  inclusive of two way radio                  The access sought by  Robe  is the use of the Rail Track Service by  Robe  trains laden with iron ore from  Robe s  West Angelas minesite  travelling from the minesite to  Robe s  Port Walcott at Cape Lambert  and by empty  Robe  trains on a return journey to the minesite                           Robe  is not seeking the service provided by the  Hamersley  locomotives  rolling stock or hi rails   Robe  will provide its own locomotives  rolling stock  hi rails and all necessary operational personnel       Hi rails are road motor vehicles capable of being driven on rail tracks and are used for maintenance purposes   consideredHope Downs Management Services Pty Ltd v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd   FCA       ATPR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Ultimately  the Full Court held that  having regard to the undertakings offered by Hamersley  no purpose would be served in proceeding to hear the appeals  Hope Downs Management Services Pty Ltd v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd   FCA       ATPR     at     Any possible prejudice to Hope Downs resulting from issue estoppel or res judicata was removed by those undertakings  Accordingly  the Court ordered  at   that the appeals be forever stayed  It added that it should not be taken to have expressed any view as to the correctness or otherwise of the judgment appealed from   Transcript of the proceedings before the Full Court was tendered before me  In that transcript  senior counsel for Hope Downs expressed concern that any future application his client might make for a recommendation in relation to the Hamersley railway track would be met with a claim of issue estoppel or res judicata  Mr Neil Young QC  on behalf of Hamersley  responded by submitting that the appeal had become academic  That was because the issue in the case depended entirely upon the definition of  rail track service  in Robe River s application which was now defunct   Chief Justice Black commented that everything turned upon  the particular application  followedAthens v Randwick City Council     NSWLR   Hamersley next submits that the process of construction must be faithful to the meaning of the order as originally pronounced  A later court cannot make the order it considers the original court should have made  See generally P W Young   Construing Court Orders      ALJ    Nonetheless  it is now tolerably clear  and Hamersley accepts  that in construing an order  regard may be had to the reasons for judgment and to other extrinsic material where appropriate  Athens v Randwick City Council     NSWLR   at     per Santow JA with whom Tobias JA agreed  Moreover  in construing an order  it may be relevant to know what the successful plaintiff or applicant sought by way of relief  I shall return to this issue shortly   Hamersley formulates the issue of construction concerning the orders of Kenny J as follows        Whether  as Hamersley contends  the reference to  Rail Track Service  in the second declaration means  the bulk iron ore rail track transportation service provided by the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility  with the consequence that the NCC has no power to make a recommendation regarding declaration of such a service  or     Whether  as the NCC and TPI contend  the adoption in the second declaration of the defined term  Rail Track Service  from the Robe River application carries an implication that the second declaration merely states that the NCC lacks power to make a recommendation to declare such a service  pursuant to the Robe River declaration application   Hamersley submits that in resolving this issue  there is no need to resort to any extrinsic material  including  it argues  the reasons for judgment  It submits that had Kenny J intended the narrow construction for which the NCC and TPI now contend  her Honour would have said so  It argues that the ordinary meaning of the words used in the second declaration is that the Court declared  once and for all  the position in respect of any recommendation regarding declaration of Hamersley s rail track service   Hamersley says that such a construction is not surprising  On the NCC s construction  the Robe River parties would not have been inhibited by the declarations made by Kenny J from making a further application  even the very next day  for a recommendation regarding the same rail track service  That is because a second application by Robe River would not be  the Robe declaration application the subject of those orders    Hamersley argues that on the NCC s construction  Hope Downs would have been free  immediately following First Hamersley Iron  to apply for a recommendation in exactly the same terms as Robe River had done  It says that would be contrary to principle  It would mean that the declarations made by Kenny J would not have quelled the controversy between the parties  The Court would therefore not have discharged its judicial function   The respondents say that the controversy before Kenny J plainly did not extend to all possible future times and circumstances  Her Honour s orders should not be interpreted as though it did  They say that resort may be had to contextual matters  such as the reasons for judgment and the pleadings  in order to identify the subject matter of the controversy as an aid to interpreting the orders  They refer in that regard to  Yates Property Corp Pty Ltd v Boland     FCR     Owston Nominees No   Pty Ltd v Branir Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at         Athens v

relation to court orders in Yates Property Corp Pty Ltd v Boland     FCR     in which a Full Court of this Court held that in interpreting an order of a court framed in unambiguous language  regard should still be had to the reasons given by the court for making the order because they formed part of the context in which the order was made  See also Australian Energy Ltd v Lennard Oil NL  No

NSW    November   Santow J  A number of the authorities cited by Tarrant are instructive  First  by way of background  in Ecrosteel Pty Ltd t as Packs Business Form Brokers v Pefor Printing Pty Ltd  unreported  Sup Ct  NSW    November   Santow J observed  at   that      orders have to cope with situations not readily foreseen  where their later application  and hence their precise interpretation  may be open to argument   Tarrant notes that there is a debate as to whether it may be appropriate  in certain circumstances  not merely to have regard to the reasons for judgment but also other material in order to interpret a court order  This would include pleadings and affidavits citedMcNair Anderson Associates Pty Ltd v Hinch   VR   Tarrant cites in support of the traditional  and more constrained  view that there must be ambiguity in a court order before the reasons for judgment can be considered  McNair Anderson Associates Pty Ltd v Hinch   VR   at   Repatriation Commission v Nation     FCR   at   and Blanch v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd     NSWLR   at    He notes  however  that in relation to contracts  there has been a movement away from the requirement that there be ambiguity before extrinsic material can be examined  Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas   HCA         CLR    There has been a similar movement in relation to the interpretation of corporate constitutions  Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at       and     To construe Mr Brett s statements in the manner for which Hamersley contends would also be contrary to the NCC s statutory functions and duties under Pt IIIA  Moreover  his words could scarcely form the basis of any application against the NCC for contempt of court  Injunctive orders must be expressed in unambiguous language so that a person subjected to an injunction is entirely clear what conduct is expected of them  McNair Anderson Associates Pty Ltd v Hinch   More importantly  it needs to be emphasised that if Kenny J had in fact contemplated granting an injunction that extended more widely than the application then before the Court  it is reasonable to assume that the NCC and the other respondents would have sought to dissuade her Honour from doing so  The fact that none of the respondents made any submission to that effect suggests that they did not view Mr Brett s statements as tantamount to an undertaking equivalent to a permanent injunction going beyond the bounds of the declarations actually made   If  contrary to my conclusions set out above  Mr Brett s words are to be understood as an  undertaking  rather than as a statement of deference to the declaratory orders foreshadowed  the question remains  what was the NCC undertaking to do  If  as I have indicated  the declarations made by her Honour concerned a specific service defined in a particular application to the NCC  and resolved a controversy that was to be determined on the then current facts  the  undertaking  was surely intended to operate no more broadly than the declaratory relief  Mr Brett s statement was made in response to the foreshadowed declarations and not just the foreshadowed permanent injunction  His statement was that the NCC  would act accordingly   That means  in context  in accordance with the declarations proposed  It does not mean in accordance with any injunction of the kind her Honour might put forward for consideration   In any event  the terms of the foreshadowed injunction employed the expression  rail track service  in a context where that expression had to be understood as defined in the first of the declarations ultimately made   I accept  of course  that an assurance of the kind given by Mr Brett might  in some circumstances  give rise to an estoppel  In Halsbury s Laws of Australia  the doctrine of estoppel by representation is discussed at          The doctrine precludes a party who  by representation  has induced another party to adopt or accept a state of affairs  and consequently to act to that other party s detriment  from asserting a right inconsistent with the state of affairs

point was made in New Brunswick Railway Company v British and French Trust Corporation   AC     where Lord Maugham LC said  at      If an issue has been distinctly raised and decided in an action  in which both parties are represented  it is unjust and unreasonable to permit the same issue to be litigated afresh between the same parties or persons claiming under them  but in my view the doctrine cannot be made to extend to presumptions or probabilities as to issues in a second action which may be  and yet cannot be asserted beyond all possible doubt to be  identical with those raised in the previous action  In the earlier action here the only relevant issue was as to the true construction of the only bond then sued upon      The issue of construction in the second action could indeed be proved in the second action to be similar to that decided in the first  but it related to a different cause of action based on other bonds and could not be asserted to be the same issue  Moreover  it is a matter of common knowledge that such bonds are often issued at different dates and in different countries  matters which might well have a possible bearing on their true construction     Emphasis added  citedCo Ownership Land Development Pty Ltd v Queensland Estates Pty Ltd     ALJR   In general  the identical subject matter requirement has been construed strictly  In Co Ownership Land Development Pty Ltd v Queensland Estates Pty Ltd     ALJR     Walsh J said  at      In order that the principle of issue estoppel may apply it     must be possible to assert without doubt that the issues are identical   In the light of these authorities  Hamersley s estoppel claim must fail  In my view  the TPI application raises different issues to those that confronted the NCC at the time of First Hamersley Iron  The orders that Kenny J pronounced must be construed in the light of her Honour s reasons for judgment as a whole  as well as in the context of the issues which presented themselves at the time   I should  for the sake of completeness  deal with Hamersley s alternative submission  It argues that even if its rail track today is not the same in all relevant respects as that of   its claim of res judicata should still succeed  It submits that no matter how great the differences there may be between the two track systems  Kenny J s orders still speak for themselves  and must stand unless and until they are varied   Hamersley recognises the implications of this submission  It accepts that  over time  conditions may change to such a degree as to warrant reconsideration of whether its railway system still involves  the use of a production process   It says that in that event  it would be open to the NCC to make application  pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules  for a variation of Kenny J s orders  This would be on the basis of  matters occurring after judgment  citedGamser v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

NSWLR   appliedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic     FCR   I am fortified in my conclusion that there is no res judicata by the nature of the legislative scheme under which the NCC exercises its statutory duties  The NCC is not an ordinary litigant  It does not seek to vindicate its own private rights  Prima facie  duties conferred by statute are intended by Parliament to be exercised from time to time as occasion arises  See generally s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  and the well known observations of Gummow J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic     FCR   at   and       It follows that Hamersley s claim of res judicata is not made out   Hamersley next submitted  albeit tentatively  that the NCC was barred from dealing with the TPI application even if Kenny J s orders did not bear the interpretation for which it contended   If a representation is to found an estoppel  it must be clear and unambiguous  See Legione v Hately   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Deane JJ and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic   See also the cases discussed at footnotes   and   to     of Halsbury s  citedPapazoglou v Republic of the Philippines     FCR   It may be that counsel had in mind some notion akin to abuse of process as the basis for this contention  If so  the argument fails  The doctrine of abuse of process  as distinct from various forms of proprietary estoppel  ordinarily operates as a shield rather than a sword  In addition  it is generally confined to curial proceedings and does not operate to prevent investigative or other like processes from being carried out  See generally Papazoglou v Republic of the Philippines     FCR   at       I reject Hamersley s submission that some notion akin to abuse of process can be used to obtain prohibition or injunctive relief of the kind now sought   Hamersley submits that Mr Brett s assurance to Kenny J that the NCC would abide by declaratory orders without the need for any permanent injunction to be granted gave rise to an undertaking to the Court from which the NCC should not now be permitted to resile citedS   M Motor Repairs Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil  Australia  Pty Ltd     NSWLR   Undertakings are often given to a court by one or more parties to a dispute  In many cases  the undertakings do not form part of any court order  Nonetheless  an undertaking has the same effect in law as an injunction  Breach of an undertaking is a contempt of court  Self evidently  the principles that apply to interpreting court orders also apply to interpreting undertakings  S   M Motor Repairs Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil  Australia  Pty Ltd     NSWLR     It is quite common when injunctive relief is sought against the Commonwealth for the court to inquire of its own motion whether an injunction is really necessary or whether an appropriate undertaking will be forthcoming  Typically  in such circumstances  undertakings are readily proffered  The need to grant injunctive relief is thereby avoided   It is less common  though still not unusual  when declaratory and injunctive relief are sought against the Commonwealth for an assurance to be given that it will abide by any declaration and that no injunction is therefore necessary  In such cases  formal undertakings are not normally proffered  It is assumed that the Commonwealth will act in accordance with the law as declared by the Court  The Commonwealth is expected to act as a  model litigant   It is assumed that it will comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law citedHarman v Secretary of State for the Home Department     AC   Hamersley submits that the central feature of an undertaking is nothing more than a commitment to perform a particular duty  It is not necessary for the word  undertake  to be used  Some undertakings are merely implied  See for example  Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department     AC   at    As with an injunction  the terms of an undertaking must be strictly observed  Lade   Co Pty Ltd v Black     Qd R   at   citedLade   Co Pty Ltd v Black     Qd R   Hamersley submits that the central feature of an undertaking is

Proprietary Limited v The Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Hamersley s submissions in this regard have some force  The indication by Kenny J that she would  accept  what was proffered on behalf of the NCC reflects the usual terminology employed by a court that accepts an undertaking from a party in lieu of an injunction  See Thomson Australian Holdings Proprietary Limited v The Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR   at     Having given this matter careful consideration  I have concluded that Mr Brett s statements to Kenny J should not be regarded as amounting to a formal undertaking  The words that he used seem to me to have been casually expressed and spoken without any attention to formality  His  assurance  cannot properly be understood as constraining the NCC forever from entertaining any application made by a different applicant for a declaration recommendation in respect of what might have become a different service appliedCommonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At common law  an estoppel by representation arises only as a result of words or conduct reasonably likely to be understood as a representation of fact and not a mere expression of opinion  Moreover  the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person would accept the representation as an invitation to act upon it in a particular way  It must be causally linked to the decision of the party to whom it is made to act upon it to that party s detriment  See generally Commonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR     Next  it might be thought that any representation embedded in that  assurance  involved a promise as to future conduct and not a statement as to an existing state of

Interstate  Ltd v Maher     CLR   at   per Mason CJ and Wilson J  at   per Brennan J  at   per Gaudron J  and Commonwealth v Verwayen at     per McHugh J  Of course  a statement as to whether a present intention exists may itself be a representation as to an existing fact  However  that is hardly a proper characterisation of Mr Brett s language   It is well recognised that statements as to future conduct may ground equitable estoppel  Equity will come to the aid of a party  who has acted to his or her detriment on the basis of some assumed state of affairs to which the other party to the transaction has contributed  if it would be unfair or unjust not to do so  There are  however  constraints upon the use of equitable estoppel  The applicant must prove that he or she assumed the existence of a particular legal relationship with the respondent  that the respondent induced that assumption  that the applicant acted or abstained from acting on the faith of that assumption  that the respondent knew of the applicant s action or intended the applicant to act in that way and that the applicant would suffer detriment if the assumption were not fulfilled  See Waltons Stores  Interstate  Ltd v Maher    In effect  in order to establish equitable estoppel  it must be shown that it would be unconscionable for one party to resile from the assumed state of affairs on which the other party has relied   In circumstances where it is uncertain as to the form that any permanent injunction might have taken  it is difficult to see how any assurance given by Mr Brett  expressed  it must be said  casually and in informal terms  can make it unconscionable for the NCC to go about performing its statutory duty  It must be remembered that Hamersley was represented by experienced and competent counsel at the time the assurance was given  It could have sought clarification of Mr Brett s remarks but did not do so  If  at the end of the day  Mr Brett had one thing in mind  and Ms Sloss something else  that is unfortunate  However  the test to be applied when determining whether something said by counsel gave rise to an undertaking must be the same as that to be adopted when construing judicial orders  That test is an objective  and not a subjective  one
