 Weekly Times Ltd v Williams and Others   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html   The respondent s alternate submission  that it should not suffer or be put at serious risk of collateral damage or disadvantage through the abuse of the maps  is not made out on the evidence before the Court  Mr Stone gave evidence that the release of the maps bearing the labels applied by Mr Dell  would perpetuate and promulgate this misrepresentation  and create an opportunity for abuse   Presumably this  abuse  would be use of the information in a way designed to influence public opinion  However  it is well established that embarrassing or damaging publicity will not amount to prejudice warranting a departure from the principle of open justice  see Merkel J  with whom Finn and Stone JJ agreed in Herald   Weekly Times Ltd v Williams and Others   FCAFC         FCR   at      Further  the description of the maps as provisional plans rather than  indicative scenario models  or some such title cannot elevate the status of any potential use of this information to that of prejudice to the administration of justice    In any event  the maps which the respondent seeks to protect by this s   application are already protected from inspection without leave of the Court or a Judge  or without the permission of the Registrar by O   r   of the Rules of the Court  As such  the Court will exercise its discretion to prevent access in circumstances where inspection would be prejudicial to the administration of justice  There has been no suggestion by the respondent that the s   order is necessary to prevent prejudice caused by a party other than a third party  Given the existing protection offered by O   r   the s   order is not necessary to prevent prejudice in respect to the administration of justice and the motion fails on this additional ground    The respondent has also applied to the Court for an order under O   r   of the Rules of the Court to prevent the undertakings given by the applicant on   September   from ceasing to apply  This application is brought by the respondent  only out of an abundance of caution and in order to prevent there being any argument about this aspect of the matter   Counsel for the respondent submitted that it was the intention of the respondent  evident from the terms of the undertakings  that those undertakings ensue for its benefit during the proceeding and after the hearing of it
