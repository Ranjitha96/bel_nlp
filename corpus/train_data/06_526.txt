Applicant S  v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedChan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The grounds of what appears to have been a joint application on behalf of both applicants before Mathews J were initially as set out in a letter or memorandum attached to the application  Summarising as best I can they set out the following propositions       In making assessments the  authorities   which I take  for present purposes  to refer to the Tribunal  had failed to take into account an important principle stated in the Handbook published by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees  The relevant principle was that the determination of refugee status will primarily require an evaluation of the applicant s statements rather than a judgment on the situation prevailing in his country of origin  The authorities called upon to determine refugee status are not required to pass judgment on conditions in the applicant s country of origin      The Tribunal failed to implement the law stated by the High Court in Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   namely     If a person gives a coherent credible account of his experience suffered which bring him within the definition of refugee  that at least raises a prima facie case and if there are any matters to the contrary the authorities should put them to the person for his response       This was in fact a quotation from counsel s submissions in the Chan case and not part of the judgment of the High Court         According to the   Refugees Convention  the Convention   a fear of persecution is  well founded  if there is a real chance that the refugee will be persecuted if he returns to his country of nationality   Where an applicant establishes that there is a real chance of persecution then the fear is  well founded   The Tribunal misconceived the Convention by ignoring the applicants  claims and evidence  In this case the applicants had claimed to have suffered discrimination  beatings  numerous threats  intimidation for Convention related reasons and to have been deprived of civil and political rights of protection   The memorandum backing the application set out another group of contentions related to persecution and the application of Article   of the Convention  Definitions of persecution and discrimination were set out  Reference was made to the circumstances in which persecution inflicted by non State agents is  knowingly tolerated by authorities when they refuse or prove unable to order effective protection   It was said to be obvious that the persecution suffered by the applicants in their country of former residence was related to Convention grounds  It was said to be obvious that a person who had suffered such persecution would have a well founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention   It was also said in the memorandum that the Tribunal had failed to take into account another legal principle  namely  in holding that the evidence before it did not support a finding that if the applicants returned to Latvia they would face a real chance of discrimination in that country amounting to persecution  Chan s case was cited to the effect that past persecution gives rise to a presumption of future persecution  Finally it was said that the Tribunal had failed to implement  the benefit of the doubt  provision  Having no evidence to the contrary they found the applicants had no fear of persecution citedIbrahim v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel argued that the Tribunal had erroneously held that persecution under the Convention required a course of systematic conduct aimed at an individual or a group and or a systematic violation of human rights  This formulation was said to be contrary to the decision in Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   and contrary to the proposition that individual acts of persecution could be enough to support an inference of a well founded fear of persecution in the future   Her Honour observed that the Tribunal appeared to have accepted that the husband s fear of persecution was genuine  She cited decisions in the Federal Court which had discussed the meaning of systematic persecution  She considered the Tribunal s reasons  She noted that the mere use of the word  systematic  could not of itself be indicative of error  Whether it was erroneously used would depend on the circumstances  Her Honour said  at      In this case the Tribunal  earlier in its decision  had commented that in appropriate cases persecution may be indicated by single acts of oppression  It therefore cannot be said that the Tribunal was necessarily in error when it referred to  a course of systematic conduct aimed at an individual or a group   The real question is whether the Tribunal erroneously required the applicant to show that there had been a repeated course of persecutory conduct in order to meet this criterion      Upon an analysis of the Tribunal s decision her Honour found it not to disclose any such error   There was another complaint of discrimination based on language law relating to the use of the Russian language in Latvia  A fine was said to have been imposed upon the husband for failing to speak the State language in the course of business  It was submitted to her Honour by the Minister s counsel that persecution would not include the application of a legitimate law of general application  Her Honour said  at      The application of this exception was not discussed by the Tribunal  In the light of the Tribunal s main finding on the matter it was unnecessary to do so  However this consideration provides a further basis  according to Mr Reilly  for concluding that the Tribunal s finding that the law which required that Latvian be spoken in the workplace did not constitute persecution      She further stated  at        This submission is  in my view  well based  However it is unnecessary in the circumstances to have resort to it  For in my opinion the Tribunal was entirely justified in finding that the fining of Latvian citizens  including the applicant  for failing to speak Latvian in the workplace is not  sufficiently serious conduct  to amount to discrimination or persecution   In relation to the wife who was said to have suffered assaults while in Latvia  her Honour said  at      The Tribunal was not satisfied that ethnic Russians as a group were subjected to systematic or sustained human rights violations  There was  some discrimination  and  occasional violence  directed against Russians    Her Honour found  at      Having made this finding it was clearly open to the Tribunal to conclude  as it did  that the mere fact of being an ethnic Russian in Latvia was not sufficient to give rise to such a well founded fear  Nor was it prepared to find that the assaults committed upon the applicant were sufficient to give rise to a well founded fear of persecution  The Tribunal s reasoning could  as I have already commented  have been more transparently stated  However its purport was  in my view  sufficiently clear to display that  given the beneficial construction which this court is required to apply  no error has been shown   In relation to the State protection question her Honour said that  at          the Tribunal noted that it could find no independent reports to suggest that  inter alia   Latvian police do not protect ethnic Russians     She construed that finding as  at         a finding that the applicant would be able to seek the protection of the Latvian police        And added  at       This finding has not been challenged on appeal  nor could it be  It was clearly open for the Tribunal to reach this conclusion on the basis of the evidence before it  The independent evidence on the subject was all one way  The complaints in the applicant s statement about the police reactions to her husband s or her friend s complaints were hardly sufficient to counteract this material  despite the strength of the language she used    For those reasons she found the first ground relied upon by the applicants had not been made out   On the question whether the Tribunal had failed to observe requisite procedures it was submitted on behalf of the wife that the Tribunal had failed to make findings as to whether the attacks were inflicted for a Convention reason  Her counsel urged that the question whether she had been targeted by reason of her ethnicity went to the core of the issue of whether she had a well founded fear of persecution and was a matter upon which the Tribunal was obliged to make a finding   Her Honour accepted that the Tribunal had made no explicit finding that the attacks against the wife were perpetrated for a Convention reason  However  a reading of its decision made clear that the Tribunal accepted this to have been established  It referred to some discrimination against ethnic Russians and observed that occasionally violence is directed against them  Her Honour said  at      It is important to note that the only evidence before the Tribunal as to acts of violence being perpetrated against ethnic Russians was that of the applicant and her husband relating to the attacks upon themselves    She did not consider that a breach of s   of the Act had occurred and she dismissed the application   I mention the basis upon which the matters which were put to her Honour in   and the basis upon which she dismissed the applications for review because the grounds for review at that time were limited to those set out in s   of the Act and it might be argued that  in an application for prerogative relief  wider grounds were available particularly for breach of procedural fairness  other than actual bias which was preserved as a ground of review under the old s    Those grounds were precluded from the scope of judicial review under the previous regime citedMuin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In any event there was no appeal against her Honour s decision by either of the applicants  However  both of them were joined as members of the representative group in the Muin and Lie litigation which led to favourable findings in respect of those two named applicants Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA         ALR    That concerned the application of procedural fairness in the way the Tribunal had dealt with documents transmitted from the Department to the Tribunal and in particular the failure to notify applicants that certain documents believed to be considered by the Tribunal had not in fact been transmitted to the Tribunal   No such determination was made in relation to these applicants who  pursuant to orders made in the representative proceedings by Gaudron J on   November   were given liberty to file individual applications for orders nisi seeking prerogative relief in the High Court on the basis that upon such filing their applications would be remitted instanter to the Federal Court   Applications for orders nisi were filed and remitted to the Federal Court and eventually on   February   Emmett J  in judgments dealing with some hundreds of proceedings so remitted  dismissed the applications for relief  The applications for relief in each case asserted failure of procedural fairness without any particularisation  In dismissing those applications his Honour did indicate that the dismissal was without prejudice to the capacity of the applicants to bring fresh applications for orders nisi for prerogative relief properly supported by affidavit material and appropriately particularised grounds   Assurances were given to Emmett J by the Minister s counsel that the delay which had ensued between the time when each of the applicants was joined as a representative party in the High Court to the time of refusal of an order nisi would not be advanced as a basis for refusing relief in any future application  However  any delay from the time of making the decision by the Tribunal and the joinder of the applicant in the High Court proceeding would still remain to be explained as would any delay from the time of refusal of an order nisi until the commencement of any fresh proceeding   Subsequently each of the applicants lodged an application under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  in the Federal Magistrates Court  Their applications were lodged on   January    Each application asserted firstly that the applicant was not a vexatious litigant and there was no abuse of process and secondly  in the case of the husband  that the Tribunal had failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give him an opportunity to comment on information which was significant to the decision to be made and was specifically about the applicant  Reference was made to contravention of s  A  of the Act which  however  was not in force at the time that the Tribunal made its decision  A similar ground framed slightly differently was expressed in the wife s application   The applicants had filed a written submission in the Federal Magistrates Court in response to the notice of motion  They were not then legally represented  They submitted that the current proceedings were not an abuse of process and argued first that even though their applications were dismissed by the Federal Court  the High Court found that the Tribunal had erred in law and had remitted their matter to the Federal Court  It is true  as the learned Federal Magistrate pointed out  that the applications for an order of review were dismissed by the Federal Court and that the High Court had in the Muin and Lie class action made a finding of error by the Tribunal but not in respect of the applicants  case  Each of the applicants was  as the learned Magistrate pointed out  given the right to file an application for an order nisi in the High Court which was remitted to the Federal Court but that application was subsequently dismissed for a procedural reason   It was submitted to the Federal Magistrates Court that the Federal Court had not examined the Tribunal decision other than in relation to access to documents held by the Minister  As a statement about the decision made by Mathews J in   that contention was  as the Federal Magistrates Court pointed out  incorrect  Her Honour examined the decisions of the Tribunal in detail and dismissed the application for review on its merits  It may be that there was some confusion  on the applicants  part  with the judgment of Emmett J in the later proceedings   A third contention advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court was that after the High Court had remitted the applicants  cases to the Federal Court they had had no opportunity to present their arguments in relation to the Tribunal decision which  according to the High Court  was infected by a jurisdictional error  As the Federal Magistrates Court pointed out  that ground was misconceived  The High Court had not found the decisions relating to the two applicants to be infected by jurisdictional error  The applicants had already presented their arguments to the Federal Court in relation to the Tribunal decision  arguments which were considered and rejected   The Federal Magistrates Court observed that the applicants had not appealed against the judgments of Mathews J in   and expressed the opinion in passing that their joinder in the class action was in itself an abuse of process because their matters had already been decided  I interpolate that this was not necessarily so given the limitation on the grounds of judicial review before Mathews J to those set out in s   and  in particular  the exclusion of natural justice grounds which it was open to raise in the proceedings in the High Court  The learned Federal Magistrate then referred to a number of authorities cited by the applicants and concluded that  at      I t is clear that the applicants were seeking to re litigate an application for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on  th July     The learned Federal Magistrate held that the applicants had raised no new issue since the application for judicial review had been dealt with in    No special circumstances were given as to why any new issue which could have been raised was not raised at the time of the original applications  They were represented by counsel at the time of the original applications
