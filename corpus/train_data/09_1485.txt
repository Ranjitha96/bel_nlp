referred toAustralian Trade Commission v Underwood Exports Pty Ltd     ALD  Mr Kennedy complained that the Panel erred by failing to identify the evidence  if any  it relied on to arrive at the finding that the period of Mr Kennedy s serious misfortune was limited to the periods between February to November   and from July   to April    It was submitted that  had it done so  it may have been possible to discern why it considered that Mr Kennedy had not established his claim for the longer period during which he said he had suffered such misfortune  see Australian Trade Commission v Underwood Exports Pty Ltd     ALD   at    In this Court he tacitly accepted the Panel s finding that the relevant period concluded in May   and confined himself to arguing that the Panel should have found that he was incapacitated continuously from February   to May    To establish an error of law  Mr Kennedy must show that there was no evidence that was accepted by the Panel which supported its finding that the period of serious misfortune suffered by him was limited to February   to November   and from July   to April    The Panel dealt with the period of Mr Kennedy s serious misfortune in paragraphs   and     of its reasons  see at   above  In paragraph   the Panel found that  on the whole of the evidence  Mr Kennedy suffered serious misfortune for these two periods  Implicitly  it did not accept that Mr Kennedy suffered serious misfortune from December   to June   or from May   to May    In the course of its reasons the Panel referred to various parts of the evidence  including appliedBirdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALD  AFMA complains that question  a  lacks precision because it does not specify for what period a permit must be  active   AFMA submits there are four potential periods  active over the whole five year qualifying period   to   inclusive  active over the best two years  active over one year or active over the period of serious misfortune  As a result  an answer to that question could not assist Mr Kennedy  Further  AFMA submits that the resolution of the question in  aa  would give Mr Kennedy no entitlement to relief nor would it identify an error of law  see Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALD   at      In any event  AFMA submits that the Panel did not make a finding upon which

relied upon in support of the orders sought that  in our view  one should expect to find the links between the question of law  the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal   emphasis added   In other cases in which the Court has been confronted with this problem and in which it has determined that it might be possible to frame an appropriate question of law  it has done so itself  see  for example  Birdseye   Under the cover of its objections to the competency of the appeal  AFMA conceded that questions of law could possibly be framed and argued on the substantive issues raised by Mr Kennedy  In the event  AFMA will suffer no prejudice if I attempt to frame questions of law  In my view  it is possible to identify three questions of law  Whether  on the proper construction of s   of the Management Plan  AFMA and the Panel are bound to take into account all permits extant during the period of an eligible person s serious misfortune when determining  the average catch of the species in the fishery under all sequences of that kind  old longline or old minor line  as the case may be  under s  c  Whether on the proper construction of s   of the Management Plan  AFMA and the Panel were bound to take into account all permits extant during the period of an eligible person s serious misfortune when determining  the average number of times a longline was set in the fishery under all sequences of old longline permits  under s  d  Whether there was any evidence before the Panel upon which it was open to it to find that the period of serious misfortune suffered by Mr Kennedy was limited to the periods from February   to November   and from July   to April  Section   is an ameliorative provision which operates to the benefit of an eligible person who has suffered serious misfortune  When a person has suffered serious misfortune  AFMA may calculate  the best two years  catches of a species of fish under the sequence of permits by using  for the period of serious misfortune  the average catch of the species in the fishery under all sequences of that kind  old longline or old minor line  as the case may be  during that period  s  c  and the best two years  sets for the relevant sequence of permits for step   of the definition of set history in s   by using  for the period of the serious misfortune  the average number of times a longline was set in the fishery under all sequences of old longline permits during that period  s  d   set history was not incorporated in the formula for calculating quota SFRs for people who held old minor line permits    Mr Kennedy held an old longline permit  The relevant sequences of permits are therefore sequences of old longline permits  The Panel determined that Mr Kennedy had suffered serious misfortune within the meaning of s    In those circumstances  section   provides that  AFMA may  perform the calculations in s   by using the average catch of the relevant species under all sequences of longline permits  s  c  and the average number of times a longline was set under all sequences of longline permits  s  d  in calculating the number of SFRs to be granted to Mr Kennedy under s    Finally  it was held in Palme that the appropriate remedy  in the event that a tribunal fails to satisfy a statutory obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision  is an order in the nature of mandamus  at    That remedy can  and should  be sought independently of any rights of appeal such as those provided for in s   of the Act  The right of appeal  given by s   is confined by the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law from the decision of the Panel  The question must  therefore  be one which arises from the decision and not from any failure  on the part of the Panel  to satisfy its statutory obligations under s   of the Act  Such a failure  in my view  does not give rise to a question of law relating to the decision itself  Question of law  c  asked whether the Panel had complied with the obligations imposed on it by s  b  of the Act  A negative answer to that question would not  however  have revealed any error affecting the Panel s decision  cf Birdseye at    per Branson and Stone JJ   It could not  therefore  have assisted Mr Kennedy referred toCivil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCA         ALD   at   Perram J  without expressing a concluded view  said that there was  much to be said  for the views of Finkelstein J in Lees   His Honour suggested two additional considerations which supported Finkelstein J s reasons for doubting the correctness of the decision in Dornan   These additional considerations were   First  the reasons which attend an administrative decision are conceptually distinct from that decision and it is the decision  and not the reasons which accompany it  which is the subject of judicial review or  as here  appeal under s    The reasons have no legal consequences in themselves  Rather  they provide material from which arguments about the correctness of the decision may be crafted  Their legal relevance is  therefore  derivative from the decision to which they are appurtenant                   Second  once the derivative nature is understood it must follow that the legal requirements attending the production of reasons need have no necessary connexion with the legal requirements attending the decision  A decision accompanied by perfectly adequate reasons may be riddled with legal errors just as a decision which is accompanied by inadequate reasons may be legal impeccable  The fallacy in the view that the provision of inadequate reasons is an error of law in the decision springs from the conflation of rules concerned with the making of the decision itself with rules concerned with the provision of reasons  a conflation which is  in my opinion  wholly without warrant  This is not to say that questions of law do not arise from the operation of rules about the provision of reasons  It is only to say that such questions arise dehors the decision and cannot be errors in the decision itself  at      There is no reference  in the Full Court s reasons  to either of the High Court s decisions in Yusuf and Palme   Given that it was common ground that  in giving inadequate reasons  the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law  I assume that the Court s attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that  in the primary judge s reasons  His Honour observed  referring to Yusuf   that  it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional  see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCA         ALD   at    Whilst it may be accepted that the failure  on the part of a decision maker  to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision  That position does not change simply because the decision maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons  That circumstance does not  in my respectful opinion  render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside appliedCivil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlAs already

Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALR   at   and  most recently  Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCAFC    These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision  In particular it was not possible to determine whether the correct legal principles had been applied  In Dornan   the Full Court drew on authorities such as Pettitt v Dunkley     NSWLR   in which appellate courts had found that trial judges erred in law if they failed to provide reasons or sufficient reasons thereby depriving the appeal court of the capacity to determine whether a verdict had been reached in accordance with law  In Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCAFC     the Full Court was concerned with an appeal  under s   of the AAT Act  from a decision of the Tribunal to set aside a decision of the Authority to cancel a certificate of approval  Both parties to the appeal accepted that the Tribunal had failed to satisfy the obligation  imposed on it  by s   of the AAT Act  to provide adequate reasons for its decision  It was common ground that such a failure constituted a  question of law  for the purposes of s   of the AAT Act  The Full Court said  at       that   In circumstances such as the present  where it is common ground that there is a statutory entitlement to reasons and where such reasons have not been provided and cannot now be provided by the Tribunal member who made the decision  it is inevitable that the decision itself must be set aside       The primary judge correctly concluded that there had been non compliance with s   and ordered that reasons now be provided by the original decision maker  Compliance with that order is no longer possible  Because of the accepted failure to comply with s   the Tribunal decision must be set aside and the matter remitted for a new hearing

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo     FCR   a Full Court was called on to construe various provisions of the Migration Act    Cth  and the Migration Regulations    Cth   It said  at     The construction of the regulations is to be approached by looking first to the statutory power in exercise of which they were made   As we have indicated  that is found in s   of the Act  This provides that the regulations may make provision that a person is entitled to be granted an entry permit of a particular class if the person satisfies all the prescribed criteria in relation to that class  s    b   The power is expressed as being  subject to sections   and    Section   empowers the Minister to determine that the processing of entry permit applications of a specified class which have been made by persons who have entered and remained in Australia is to stop until a day specified in the notice given by him  Section   provides that an entry permit shall not be granted to certain deportees where an amount is still payable by them to the Commonwealth under s   or s    Section   deals with the costs of deportation  and s   with the costs of keeping deportees in custody       Further  s   imposes upon the Minister an obligation  where the relevant jurisdictional pre condition is established  either to grant or refuse an entry permit  Judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal is confined by s   to an  appeal  which is  on a question of law        The result  if the statute and the regulations are taken as a whole  is to disclose a compromise which represents a balance between various competing interests which are involved  The particular pattern which is set in this way is not to be distorted by treating one element in it other than in accordance with the fair meaning allowed by the language which has been used  There is no reason to give a  broad and generous construction  to reg  A  To do so may detract from the force given in the balance of the legislative scheme to the other interests which are involved  These include the view taken by other branches of government and reflected in the legislative text  being the statute and the regulations  of the social and material interests of the country as a whole in relation to the entry and settlement of aliens  and of the conditions which should be attached to permission to enter and stay in Australia  Robtelmes v Brenan   HCA         CLR   at   Pochi v MacPhee   HCA         CLR   at    emphasis added   It may be accepted that a purpose of s   is to ameliorate the effect of serious misfortune on past catch and activity rates  Section   allows an eligible person to rely on his or her best   years  catches between   and    inclusive   Section   must  therefore  seek to compensate for more than the vicissitudes of commercial fishing which are acknowledged by this part of the formula  The purpose of s   is not to maximise the possible benefit for an individual operator  Nor is it to put the operator in the position he or she would have been in but for the serious misfortune  That is simply not possible  The objects of ss   and   are advanced on the construction contended for by AFMA  notwithstanding that it is not the construction most advantageous to Mr Kennedy s financial interests  In my view  there is nothing in s   that supports Mr Kennedy s submission that the phrase  all sequences  in ss  c  and  d  should be read as excluding inactive permits  It is true that s  c  refers to  all sequences of that kind  old longline or old minor line  as the case may be  which requires the person performing the calculation to limit the sequences to either old longline sequences or old minor line sequences  There is  however  nothing in s   which justifies further limiting  all sequences of that kind  to old longline sequences that were active during the period of serious misfortune  Sections   and   prescribe  with a high degree of specificity  how the grants of quota SFRs are to be calculated when a person has suffered serious misfortune  Section   could expressly have limited the permits that were to be included in the  average catch  and the  average number of times a longline was set  to those permits that had been used during the applicant s period of serious misfortune  It did not do so consideredMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe issue was considered by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR    In that case the Court dealt with a submission that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal should be set aside because the Tribunal had failed to comply with its obligations under s   of the Migration Act    Cth  to provide adequate reasons for coming to the decision  The argument was that the failure of the Tribunal to have regard to certain matters which had been pressed before it rendered its reasons inadequate with the consequence that  on this ground  its decision was a nullity  The Court rejected this argument  Gleeson CJ  at   was prepared to accept that  if a decision maker fails to make a finding on some question of fact in the course of giving reasons  that will indicate that it made no finding on that matter  and that  in turn  may indicate that the Tribunal did not consider the matter to be material   The absence of findings on a particular matter may be indicative of error but the failure to refer  in the course of giving reasons  to findings which were not made does not itself constitute reviewable error   It is impossible to read the expression  the findings  as meaning anything other than the findings which the Tribunal has made   By setting out its findings  and thereby exposing its views on materiality  the Tribunal may disclose a failure to exercise jurisdiction  or error     or may provide some other ground for judicial review   But all the tribunal is obliged to set out is such findings as it has made      at      emphasis added     Other members of the Court made similar observations  see per McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ at     and    The issue was further considered by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  ex parte Palme   HCA         CLR    In Palme the Court held that a failure to discharge the statutory obligation imposed by s  G of the Migration Act    Cth    to give reasons for a decision to cancel a visa  did not mean that the decision could be set aside because it was tainted with jurisdictional error  Four aspects of the reasoning in Palme are of present relevance  First  it is necessary to recognise that a distinction is to be drawn between the decision and the reasons for that decision  see Palme at    An attack on the reasons which seeks to have the decision set aside fails to appreciate this distinction  This is a different attack from one which focuses on a jurisdictional error arising from the failure of the reasons to refer to  for example  a relevant consideration  cf Yusuf at      There is no reference  in the Full Court s reasons  to either of the High Court s decisions in Yusuf and Palme   Given that it was common ground that  in giving inadequate reasons  the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law  I assume that the Court s attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that  in the primary judge s reasons  His Honour observed  referring to Yusuf   that  it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional  see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCA         ALD   at    Whilst it may be accepted that the failure  on the part of a decision maker  to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision  That position does not change simply because the decision maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons  That circumstance does not  in my respectful opinion  render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside appliedMinister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  ex parte Palme  Re   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe issue was further considered by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  ex parte Palme   HCA         CLR

different attack from one which focuses on a jurisdictional error arising from the failure of the reasons to refer to  for example  a relevant consideration  cf Yusuf at      Secondly  it is important to identify precisely what act is being impugned  Palme at    In Palme there was an attack by Constitutional writ on the exercise of the power to cancel a visa  In this case  there is an appeal from the Panel s decision to set aside AFMA s decision and substitute one more favourable to Mr Kennedy because it was not sufficiently favourable to his interests  The word  decision  in this context means the final and operative decision of the Panel as provided for in s   of the Act  Director General of Social Services v Chaney   FCA         FLR    Section   fixes on the decision as the subject matter of the appeal  not on the reasons  Thirdly  the question of whether a failure to comply with a statutory requirement to provide adequate reasons can affect the exercise of power is one of statutory construction  Palme at    There is nothing in the scheme of the legislation which suggests that the provision of inadequate reasons could vitiate a decision of the Panel  On the contrary  given the nature of the Panel s task  the requirement that all operators be parties to the appeal to the Panel  s   of the Act  and the fact that the allocation of SFRs cannot be implemented until after any application to the Panel is dealt with  s   of the Act  it could not readily be inferred that the Act intended that a failure to give reasons should invalidate the decision  Finally  it was held in Palme that the appropriate remedy  in the event that a tribunal fails to satisfy a statutory obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision  is an order in the nature of mandamus  at    That remedy can  and should  be sought independently of any rights of appeal such as those provided for in s   of the Act  The right of appeal  given by s   is confined by the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law from the decision of the Panel  The question must  therefore  be one which arises from the decision and not from any failure  on the part of the Panel  to satisfy its statutory obligations under s   of the Act  Such a failure  in my view  does not give rise to a question of law relating to the decision itself  Question of law  c  asked whether the Panel had complied with the obligations imposed on it by s  b  of the Act  A negative answer to that question would not  however  have revealed any error affecting the Panel s decision  cf Birdseye at    per Branson and Stone JJ   It could not  therefore  have assisted Mr Kennedy  Mr Kennedy submitted that Palme may be distinguished on the basis that there is no equivalent of s  G  of the Migration Act in the Act  Where a decision has been made to refuse to grant a visa to a person or to cancel a visa  s  G of the Migration Act requires the Minister to give the person a written notice which sets out the decision and the reasons for the decision  Section  G  provides   A failure to comply with this section in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision        The relevant parts of the reasoning in Palme do not  however  depend on s  G   As already noted  the Court emphasised the need to distinguish between a decision which is sought to be challenged and the reasons for that decision when determining whether the decision can be impeached for jurisdictional error  In their joint judgment  at   Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Heydon JJ said   The visa cancellation decision may be reviewed in this court for jurisdictional error  Such error may be found from what is disclosed by reasons provided under s  G e   Failure to provide reasons may also be reviewed in this Court and compliance by the Minister with the statutory duty may be ordered  The reasons then provided may furnish grounds for prohibition under s  v   of the Constitution   in respect of the visa cancellation decision  But what is not provided for is for a prosecutor  as in this case  to bypass that earlier step utilising mandamus  and to impeach the visa cancellation decision itself for want of discharge of the duty to provide reasons  There is  as was pointed out in argument  a critical distinction between failure to comply with s  G e  and using that failure to conclude that the visa cancellation decision is flawed by jurisdictional error     See also at      per McHugh J   It was open to Mr Kennedy to seek an order of mandamus to compel the Panel to comply with its obligations under s   of the Act  He did not do so  Instead  he has proceeded to prosecute his appeal to this Court on the basis of the reasons which he  rightly  submits are inadequate  His failure to seek a mandatory order may have been the result of a forensic decision  cf Palme at   or for some other reason  Whatever the reason  the inadequacy of the Panel s reasons cannot  consistently with the decision in Palme   be relied on to impeach the Panel s decision  There is no reference  in the Full Court s reasons  to either of the High Court s decisions in Yusuf and Palme   Given that it was common ground that  in giving inadequate reasons  the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law  I assume that the Court s attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that  in the primary judge s

 of the Act  Section  b  requires the Panel to prepare a written statement setting out the reasons for its decisions  Mr Kennedy complains that first  the Panel made a bald finding on his claim for serious misfortune  second that it did not provide reasons for preferring AFMA s construction of s   to that advanced by him  and third that the Panel did not provide reasons as to how it reached its conclusion that he suffered serious misfortune only during the February   November   and July     April   periods  Mr Kennedy submits that a party is entitled to know why he won or lost  A reading of

reasons are sufficiently detailed to meet the obligation imposed by s  b   Section  D of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  provides that  where another Act requires that a Tribunal give written reasons for its decisions  the instrument giving the reasons shall also set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based   As already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question  It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court s decision in the State Electricity Commission case  Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court  In Dornan v Riordan     FCR     a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision  See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR     Preston v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services     AAR   at   Hill v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALR   at   and  most recently  Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd   FCAFC    These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision  In particular it was not possible to determine whether the correct legal principles had been applied  In Dornan   the Full Court drew on authorities such as Pettitt v Dunkley     NSWLR   in which appellate courts had found that trial judges erred in law if they failed to provide reasons or sufficient reasons thereby depriving the appeal court of the capacity to determine whether a verdict had been reached in accordance with law  No order was sought by Mr Kennedy  in the course of the present appeal  requiring the Panel to provide reasons which satisfied its statutory obligations  This decision was  no doubt  influenced  in part at least  by the fact that one of the two members of the Panel who made the decision  Mr Baston  is no longer a Panel member  Had a mandatory order been made  the Panel probably could not have complied with it because the reasons given must be those of the decision makers and not their successors  cf State Electricity Commission at    The questions of law posed above at   should each be answered  Yes  The appeal must be dismissed  The applicant should pay the first respondent s costs of the application    I certify that the preceding seventy seven   numbered paragraphs are a true

Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR   at   per Gummow J  The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the

CAR  Mr Kennedy contended that s   makes remedial provision for an eligible person who has been disadvantaged by having suffered a serious misfortune  For an eligible person so disadvantaged  s   provides a benevolent scheme  a person who suffered serious misfortune should be no worse off than he or she might have been had the relevant period been worked  Accordingly  once an eligible person

Finance Facilities Pty Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at     Stuart v Kirland Veenstra   HCA         ALR   at    It was submitted that the word  may  in s  c  of the Management Plan confers a power on AFMA which is to be exercised upon its satisfaction of the matters described in ss  a  and  b  see Leach v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at      referred toWentworth Securities Ltd v Jones   AC  AFMA contended that the plain language of s   requires the average of   all sequences of permits to be used   It submitted that the word  all  is to be given work to do and the language does not allow or permit a construction that means less than the total number of permits  The ordinary meaning of the word  all  is  the whole amount  quantity or extent of   It does not mean less than the total  It does not admit of the construction advanced by Mr Kennedy that only a subset of the permits  those that were  active  in a certain period  should be used to calculate the average  Mr Kennedy had invited the Court to read words into s   such that only  active  permits were to be taken into consideration  In such circumstances  it must be possible for the Court to state with certainty what the additional words were that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by Parliament  had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law  see Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones   AC   at    To seek to qualify the word  all  by the word  active  introduces ambiguity  The word  active  is not defined in the Management Plan  AFMA submitted that Mr Kennedy proceeded on an assumption that the Management Plan evinces an intention to maximise the allocation for those who consider themselves active fishers  Such an assumption is inconsistent with the language of the provisions  the portion of the formula which is based on permit value and with a choice of a particular qualifying period  AFMA rejected the significance which Mr Kennedy attached to the words  catch  and  set   Catch describes the product of fishing  rather than the activity of fishing  The words  catch  and  set  do not assist in limiting the class of permit holders in  all sequences of that kind   The construction advanced by Mr Kennedy also ignored the definitions of  old longline permit  in s   of the Management Plan  which does not focus on activity under the permits  but the instrument which authorises fishing  The context and purpose of s   favour the construction advanced by AFMA which was accepted  without elaboration  by the Panel  Section   must be read in the context of the Management Plan as a whole  The Management Plan reflects policy choices on the allocation of commercial fishing rights  in relation to a finite resource  These choices are embodied in the formula in s    The phrase  all sequences of that kind  must be construed in this context
