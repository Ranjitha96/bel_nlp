and   Cheng XI Shipyard v The Ship  Falcon Trident    FCA   at      Accordingly  I would not regard the presence of registered trade marks within the jurisdiction in NVS  at least in this case on the evidence before me  as assets within the jurisdiction against which an order for costs might easily be enforced  Moreover  I do not regard the international disputation which has taken place as an  other factor  in terms of McHugh J s qualification in Chellaram which overcomes the circumstance that the applicant is resident out of the jurisdiction and has no readily isolated assets of any utility within the jurisdiction  easily converted to a fund to satisfy a costs order   However  the real difficulty is that BAT s evidence upon which an informed decision might be made by the Court as to any security to be ordered  is scant  The only evidence put on by BAT in the application is the statement by Mr Stern set out at    The further difficulty is this  NVS has commenced a proceeding by filing a Notice of Appeal which is confined to the question of whether s   of the Act prohibits registration of each mark on the footing that the mark is deceptively similar to BAT s mark identified by the Registrar s delegate  BAT has cross appealed and puts in controversy all of the matters upon which it was unsuccessful and in respect of which it would seek to call evidence  including expert evidence of reputation and other consumer survey evidence  BAT estimates the party and party costs recoverable by BAT in the proceeding as   which necessarily assumes costs both in relation to the appeal and the cross appeal   NVS contends that in an appeal from a decision of the Registrar s delegate not to register an accepted trade mark  the opponent should be characterised as the aggressor and instigator of the controversy with the result that when an appeal is taken to the Federal Court from the delegate s decision  the opponent to registration should be equally regarded as the principle contradictor and aggressor in the proceeding  Thus  it is not appropriate to make any order for security for costs  However  says NVS  in a proceeding which is characterised by an appeal by NVS confined to the question it raises and a cross appeal by the opponent in which a broader field of issues are agitated as part of the controversy  it is not appropriate to order security for costs of the proceeding at large  Any order for security for costs should be confined to responding to the matters put in issue by the appellant  NVS says that it is for BAT to isolate the steps to which it would be put in dealing with the appellant s contentions  identify the evidence it would need to call to do so  and identify the likely costs to be incurred associated with taking responsive steps
