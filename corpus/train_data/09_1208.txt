Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAnsett Transport Industries  Operations  Pty Ltd v Wraith   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs can be seen there is no express obligation  imposed on the Tribunal  by s  B  to refer to all relevant evidence  to set out the basis for conclusions or ultimate findings of fact reached  or to set out its understanding of the relevant law  Counsel submitted that these obligations arose from a gloss which Woodward J  in Ansett Transport Industries  Operations  Pty Ltd v Wraith   FCA         ALR   at   placed on the differently worded s   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the ADJR Act   In submitting that the Tribunal had failed to satisfy the obligations imposed on it by s  B  counsel drew attention to the following matters As a result  so it was submitted  Mr Culley was confronted with statements by the Tribunal which reflected badly on his business acumen and integrity  but was left to guess at the evidentiary basis for this criticism  Because of this he could not defend his good name referred toBirdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALD  Mr Culley appealed pursuant to s   of the AAT Act  Section   provides for appeals to this Court  on a question of law  from any decision of the Tribunal  see TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR   at   Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALD   at      Mr Culley s further amended notice of appeal identified six questions of law  Some are related to others such that they can be dealt with together  Questions   and  referred toComcare v Lees     ALR  Even if it had been established that the Tribunal had not complied with the requirements of s  B  this would not have constituted a reviewable error of law which would justify the setting aside of the Tribunal s decision  see Repatriation Commission v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at      per Brennan J  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR   at    per Kirby J  and see also Comcare v Lees     ALR   at      per Finkelstein J   Counsel for Mr Culley accepted that this was the legal position referred toCullen v Corporate Affairs Commission  NSW      ACLR  The Tribunal then directed particular attention to the fact that three of the companies owed a total of   to the Australian Taxation Office  This debt included considerable sums of unpaid tax instalments deducted from employees  salaries  goods and services taxes and income tax  The debt had accumulated since  at least     The Tribunal noted at   the observations of Young J in Cullen v Corporate Affairs Commission  NSW      ACLR   at     that           In this Court over the last   years at least  Judges have been extremely reluctant to grant adjournments in winding up proceedings where it appears that there is a claim for outstanding group tax because the group tax is part of the employees  wages which have been withheld to be paid to the tax office on behalf of the employees  They are  for all intents and purposes  trust moneys which do not belong to the company  If the company directors use these monies for trading purposes  it shows a complete lack of appreciation of this situation and a serious lack of commercial morality  In England the non payment of such monies has been highlighted perhaps above all other factors as showing that a director is not fit to continue his profession     The Tribunal continued       While Mr Culley may have sought negotiation s  sic  with the Australian Taxation Office it would appear that little or no payments were made to reduce the debt and it was well over two years after much of the debt was due by  one of the companies  before voluntary administration and subsequent liquidation occurred  It was noted that Mr Culley appeared to be of the view that the unpaid tax was not significant in relation to the total of his   year career and taxes paid  It is particularly relevant that  in the case of Austbloom  Mr Culley arranged to pay out local creditors to retain their goodwill for a successor company while leaving   owing in taxes  The Tribunal then turned to an assessment of other matters relating to the various companies of which Mr Culley had been a director  These matters were collected in a single paragraph  The terms in which the Tribunal expressed itself were the subject of criticism during argument and it is  therefore  necessary to set the paragraph out in full  The Tribunal used abbreviated titles for the companies  Oriental Experience Pty Ltd was referred to as  Oriental   Construction Resources Pty Ltd was referred to as  Resources   B M C  Special Projects Pty Ltd was referred to as  Special Projects   B  M  Culley   Associates Pty Ltd was referred as  Associates   It will be convenient to adopt these abbreviations for the purposes of these reasons  The Tribunal said         While Mr Culley may argue that the reason for the insolvency of each company were  sic  beyond his control it is not clear that appropriate action was taken in a timely manner  Mr Culley s evidence was that his primary business had been construction development  However  it would appear that the insolvencies of Resources  Special Projects and Associates resulted from these companies moving away from construction management and becoming head contractors and part owner of developments  In all cases including Oriental and Austbloom it would appear that the companies had inadequate capital to deal with losses  In Oriental and Austbloom there are clear inferences from the liquidators that these  sic  had been a failure in management and record keeping  appliedKardas v Australian Securities Commission     ACSR  Both parties referred to the decision of Heerey J in Kardas v Australian Securities Commission     ACSR    In that case his Honour was concerned with the construction and application of s   of the Corporations Law   the predecessor of s  F  The applicant had brought proceedings under the ADJR Act to challenge a disqualification decision  One of the grounds was that the Commission had failed to comply with an implied obligation that it exercise its power within a reasonable time  In dealing with that ground his Honour said  at     that       Counsel relied on the judgment of O Bryan J in Halliday v CCA   May   SC Vic  unreported   His Honour there held that a delay of almost two years between service of a show cause notice and a decision to prohibit would be too long          A statutory power  such as the power of prohibition under s   conditioned upon the occurring of a certain event  such as the making of a s   report in respect of two or more companies  will often be subject to an implied requirement that it be exercised within a reasonable time  Koon Wing Lau v Calwell   HCA         CLR   at       ALR     Giris Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR     Re Federal Cmr of Taxation  Ex parte Australena Investments Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Repatriation Commission v Morris     AAR   at    I am satisfied that the s   power is subject to such a requirement          Once a liquidator s report in respect of a second  s   company  triggers the power of disqualification  that power  if it is to be exercised at all  should be exercised with reasonable promptness  A person potentially the object of that power should not be kept in an indefinite state of uncertainty  More importantly  since the purpose of a s   disqualification is prophylactic rather than punitive  there should be as little delay as possible in taking steps to protect the public          What is a reasonable time will depend on the circumstances  The affairs of companies vary greatly in their complexity  But the commission does not  as it were  start from scratch  It will  ex hypothesi  have the benefit of a liquidator s report and no doubt the liquidator would usually be willing and able to provide further information and explanation on request  Counsel for ASIC sought to distinguish Kardas on the basis that the two companies involved in that case were not related  In the present case the Tribunal had found that Resources  Special Projects and Associates were related companies  Resources was solely an employer of labour  Special Projects had been formed to act as a head contractor on two projects  one of which failed  Associates acted as construction manager under contract with a developer for a fee  Associates was the principal company in the group  As a result  it was argued  it would have been premature for ASIC to issue a show cause notice under s  F before it had received the liquidator s report on Associates  That did not occur until   April    Accordingly  it was contended  ASIC s compliance with the reasonable celerity requirement should be assessed as if the last triggering event had occurred on   April    The time between then and the issuing of the disqualification notice was one year and   months  This delay was not  so it was submitted  to be regarded as unreasonable  No explanation was given for the delay of three years and five months between the winding up of Associates and the provision of the liquidator s report  There is no evidence of any relevant action being taken by ASIC between its receipt of the liquidator s report on Associates in April   and July    On   July   ASIC wrote to the liquidators of Special Projects and Resources seeking further information about those companies  On the following day a similar request was directed to the liquidator of Associates  The avowed purpose of these requests for further information was to assist ASIC in determining whether to take action against Mr Culley under s  F  The liquidators responded to these requests  The last of these responses was received by ASIC on   September    The reason for the   month delay between the receipt of the liquidator s report on Associates and the despatch of requests for further information is unexplained

and see also Comcare v Lees     ALR   at      per Finkelstein J   Counsel for Mr Culley accepted that this was the legal position citedMurdaca v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALR  Counsel for Mr Culley made the formal submission that the answers to both these questions should be  yes   He conceded  however  that the decision of the Full Court in Murdaca v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ALR   bound me to conclude that the first question should be answered  no  and that the second question did not arise  The concession was properly made  The Full Court held  at   that a delegate of ASIC could rely on material not appearing in the notice to show cause for the purpose of determining whether or not to disqualify a director provided that it accorded the director natural justice  Specifically the Full Court held  at   that      we do not agree that ASIC must refer to and address in the show cause notice all matters upon which it might rely in support of disqualification and we do not agree that ASIC is confined to such matters as are contained in the show cause notice when it comes to consider disqualification  In Murdaca at   the Full Court identified the two preconditions which must be satisfied before ASIC may exercise its powers under s  F of the Act  These conditions  prescribed by s  F a  are that  within seven years immediately before ASIC gives a notice to show cause Both parties agreed that these preconditions  or trigger points  had been met  in the present case  on   October    On that day ASIC received a report under s   of the Act from the liquidator appointed to Resources  The report was dated   October    The liquidator s report contained the following paragraph          The director of the company  sic  Brian Francis Culley and former director of the company  Anne Culley  were directors of the following companies which are now in liquidation         Company Date of   Commencement   B M Culley   Associates Pty Ltd   th November   Construction Resources Pty Ltd   th November   BMC Special Projects Pty Ltd   th May     Accordingly  as the directors have been officers of three companies which are now in liquidation and have not paid creditors in full  the ASIC may consider applying the provisions of Section  F of the Act in seeking an order to disqualify them from acting as directors for an appropriate period  It is to be noted that  although the liquidator referred to Associates having been wound up on   November   no liquidator s report had been provided in relation to that company before   October    The two relevant companies for the purposes of s  F a  were Resources and Special Projects referred toRepatriation Commission v O Brien   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au
