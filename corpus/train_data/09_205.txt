 D cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR   at   to   per Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ No Application seeking leave has been filed in this Court  The proceeding in this Court was commenced by a purported Notice of Appeal as filed on   December    In accordance with Directions given by the Registrar on   January   the purported appeal has been treated as an Application for leave to appeal and the Notice of Appeal as a draft of the Notice that would be filed if leave were granted  The handwritten Grounds of Appeal set forth as follows  without alteration  The single judge of the Federal Magistrate Court in His Honours judgement delivered on     failed to find error of law  jurisdictional error  procedural fairness and relief under section  B of the Judiccery Act    The learned Federal Magistrate has dismissed my application without considering the legal and factual errors contained in the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal    A written Outline of Submissions has  however  been filed by the Applicant  That outline seeks to advance the following contentions  without alteration       His Honours should have found that the Tribunal failed to appropriately deal with the documents in particular the inference that the documents are fabricated thus breaching section  A   Particulars   The Tribunal inferred that the documents that the applicant s submitted were fabrication  The Tribunal has not given the applicant an opportunity in the section  A letter to deal with the claim raised by the Appellant    His Honours should have found that the Tribunal erred by not allowing the appellant to explain the documents and rebut any inference of fabrication breaching section   of the Migration Act      Particulars   The Tribunal has drawn an inference that the independent country information about the prevalence of document fraud in Bangladesh  yet the appellant was not given the opportunity to rebut this inference     Notwithstanding the form of the document filed  it is in effect an application to amend what has been treated as a draft Notice of Appeal   The Applicant appeared before the Court unrepresented  although he did have the benefit of an interpreter  He accepted that the argument set forth in his written Outline of Submissions had not been advanced before the Federal Magistrate  The explanation provided was that the prospect of raising that argument was only raised by a   friend   in conversation subsequent to the hearing conducted by the Federal Magistrates Court  Notwithstanding considerable reservation  it is considered that leave to appeal should be refused  Reservation is occasioned by the manner in which the Federal Magistrate has expressed his reasons for decision  Those reasons occupy some nine pages   of those nine pages  over two pages set out verbatim the submissions of the Minister as to the relevant   background   one page sets out verbatim the grounds of the Amended Application   and a further two pages adopt and set out verbatim the Minister s written submissions on substantive issues  The balance of the judgment   some four pages   sets out the reasons as expressed by the Federal

trial  If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court  tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish         The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters  The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below  but which clearly has merit  is advanced  and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated  Where  however  there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point  and it seems to be of doubtful merit  leave should generally be refused  In our view  the proposed ground of appeal has no merit

austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlAn Application for review of the Tribunal s decision was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on   October   and an Amended Application was subsequently filed on   November    That Court dismissed the Application pursuant to Rule    a  of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules    Cth  on   December   SZMUV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    Rule     of the   Rules provides as follows    Show cause hearing     At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause  the Court may     a  if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed   dismiss the application  or   b  if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed   adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court  or   c  without making an order under paragraph  b  make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application     To avoid doubt  a dismissal under paragraph    a  is interlocutory     As r     expressly provides  the dismissal of an application under r    a  is an interlocutory decision  That difficulty is only compounded by the generality of the submissions previously advanced by the Respondent Minister and thereafter incorporated in the Magistrate s reasons  A principal ground being advanced before the Federal Magistrate by the present Applicant was a denial of procedural fairness   by reaching adverse conclusions that the Tribunal did not find the applicant to be a credible or reliable witness  being conclusions that were not obviously open on the known material  without giving the applicant the opportunity to be heard in respect of those matters    The written submission advanced by the Minister and incorporated into the reasons simply asserted    The particulars of this ground are that the Tribunal s adverse credit findings against the applicant were not  obviously open to it  and that  therefore  it did not give the applicant an opportunity to be heard on those matters  There is no substance in this complaint  The applicant was on notice from the delegate s decision that his credit was in issue  Furthermore  contrary to the applicant s assertion  the adverse credit findings of the Tribunal were obvious inferences from the evidence before it     The Magistrate then concluded that    t he adverse credibility findings made by the Tribunal were open to it on the material before it     FMCA   at     Both the submission and the reason provided are but generalities  In contrast stand the reasons of the Tribunal  The Tribunal expressed its finding as to credibility and then went on to provide instances to support its finding  For example  the Tribunal concluded as follows      I did not find the applicant to be a credible or reliable witness  With respect to the material aspects of his claim I found his evidence to be vague and at times confusing        I do not accept that the applicant is or was a member or office holder in the Chatra League or the Awami League  The applicant s evidence was vague and full of generalities  I would have expected that if he had been a General Secretary or any office holder he would have been able to give me a more detailed account of how he joined the party  the nature of his activities with which he was involved and of his role as office holder  I found his evidence to be confused and lacking in credibility  He claimed that a relative was a Member of Parliament for the Awami League however could not tell me the name of his seat or any other details relating to his candidature  I would have expected that he would have had a better understanding of the organisation of the Awami League and how it operates in the Comilla area and greater knowledge of the structures and organisation of the party  On balance  however  it is considered that the reasons of the Magistrate   i  disclose the reasoning process in fact adopted  and  ii  display no appellable error   Notwithstanding the extent to which the Magistrate has placed reliance upon the material incorporated within his reasons for judgment  the remaining brevity of the language of the Magistrate does indicate that he did give independent consideration to each of the grounds sought to be advanced  The Magistrate correctly concluded that   the applicant failed before the Tribunal because he was not believed     FMCA   at     He then went on to address  albeit briefly  the arguments founded upon an alleged breach of s  A of the Migration Act    Cth  and an allegation of actual bias  The decision in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA       ALD   it was concluded  was to be distinguished  The very process of distinguishing that decision exposes not only an independent consideration of the facts of SZDGC but an independent consideration of the facts of the case then before him and an analysis of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  Obvious care must be taken to ensure that an appeal does not become a vehicle for simply criticising the manner in which the reasons of a judge at first instance have been expressed  Recognition must also be given to the fact that the Federal Magistrates Court is entrusted with a primary role in resolving migration cases  In that Court in   over   migration applications were filed and more than   migration matters were finalised  These figures were higher still in each of the three preceding years  Any review of the reasons as provided by a Federal Magistrate must necessarily take into account the sheer number of the cases that that Court has to resolve  But there is a point below which the economy of language with which reasons may be expressed cannot trespass  In the present proceeding it is unquestionably the case that the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate may have been better expressed and more fully expressed  Had that course been taken  the Applicant may well have continued to express regret   but he would at least feel confident that his case had been thoroughly considered appliedVUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlCentral to the exercise of any discretion is an assessment as to whether it is   expedient in the interests of justice  to allow the fresh argument to be now relied upon  VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    Kiefel  Weinberg and Stone JJ there concluded      In our view  the application for leave to rely upon the sole ground of appeal now raised should be refused  Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so           In Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR     Gibbs CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Dawson JJ observed  in their joint judgment  at      It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial  If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court  tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish         The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters  The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below  but which clearly has merit  is advanced  and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated  Where  however  there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point  and it seems to be of doubtful merit  leave should generally be refused  In our view  the proposed ground of appeal has no merit  There is no justification  therefore  for permitting it to be raised for the first time before this Court     Applied

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThere is equally no injustice to the Applicant in not now entertaining the argument as to the failure on the part of the Tribunal to itself initiate further inquiries  as there is no such general duty imposed upon the Tribunal  In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh     FCR     the Full Court held that there is no duty upon the Tribunal to undertake its own investigation into the authenticity of documents supporting a visa application  Black CJ  von Doussa  Sundberg and Mansfield JJ there noted at     Although we have concluded that there may be circumstances in which the Tribunal s obligation to act according to substantial justice requires it to make inquiries  we are respectfully unable to agree with the primary judge s general proposition that where an applicant produces a document which purports to be an official document issued in a foreign country  its disputed authenticity is a matter appropriate for verification by the Tribunal through official channels     In a particular case the Tribunal may indeed be obliged to verify a document in this fashion  but there is no general rule to that effect     In that case  the purported source of the Tribunal s obligation to make inquiries was s   of the Migration Act   Nor can a duty to enquire be sourced from s  d  of the Migration Act   This provision empowers the Tribunal to make its own inquiries for the purpose of reviewing a decision  but it creates no obligation on the part of the Tribunal  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA       ALD   per Gummow and Hayne JJ at   and Callinan J at   WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural

present case  there is no error in the Tribunal proceeding to make its decision without pursuing further inquiries of its own initiative into the veracity of the Appellant s documentation
