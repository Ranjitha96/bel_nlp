Gargan v Kippin Investments Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toBoston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It has been said that s  A lowers the bar in terms of summary judgment applications  The operation of s  A was considered by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR    I do not think it necessary to enter into the interesting questions of what the particular standard imposed by the new version of s  A might be  This is because whatever the bar is  the current applications pass well beneath it  That is  I find that they are  despite their creativity  devoid of merit  It follows  in my opinion  that there should be orders under s  A  That makes it unnecessary for me to consider the operation of Order   rule   or to consider the operation of Order   rule   in so far as the statement of claim is concerned   Mr Gargan argued that s  A was constitutionally invalid  Normally s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  would impose upon this Court an obligation not to proceed to deal with Mr Gargan s constitutional argument without adjourning the proceeding in order to allow the various Attorneys General for the States and of the Commonwealth a chance to intervene  However  s  B operates on constitutional matters  I do not think that a constitutional argument which is completely devoid of merit amounts to a constitutional matter within the meaning of those provisions  To make good that point  it is necessary to take account of what the argument is   The argument is that s  A operates to  dictate  to the Federal Court what the outcome of the case is  There may well have been an issue if s  A had commanded the Court to dismiss a proceeding which had any of the qualities described in s  A a  or  b   However  the plain text of s  A is that the Court  may  give judgment  There is simply no room to argue whatever that s  A operates as a dictation  Accordingly I reject that argument  The necessary consequence is that there must  on both notices of motion  be judgment for the first and second respondents under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  appliedCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Gargan   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Insofar as the argument is advanced based upon s   of the Crimes Act    Cth  that is  on the common informer provisions  I respectfully adopt what was said by Hely J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Gargan   FCA         FCR     where his Honour dismissed the same argument  I should note for completeness that at   Hely J relied upon what Adams J had said in Gargan v Scott  unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales    October   and I respectfully adopt what Adams J said at    I do not think that the argument based upon s   has any substance whatsoever citedDaemar v Industrial Commission  NSW      NSWLR   Mr Gargan also argued that he had an entitlement to the issue of orders in the nature of mandamus against the Official Trustee  There may be a question in my mind as to whether that kind of right is a right which would vest  or would be property which is capable of vesting  in the Official Trustee  There are decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which indicate that the right to seek mandamus may be a right which vests in the trustee  cf  Daemer v Industrial Commission  NSW      NSWLR   at    However  for present purposes  it is not necessary to explore that proposition  On any view  the duties which are capable of being litigated in a mandamus application are duties of a public kind  I do not think that even if the difficulties in s   could be overcome by Mr Gargan that the duty thereby created could be described as public duty  Accordingly  I do not think that a case for issue of orders in the nature of mandamus has any prospects of success   It is then necessary to say a little bit about the nature of the applications which are currently before the court  The first is an application pursuant to s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth    Section  A of that Act provides        Summary judgment     The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if             a  the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding  and   b  the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding              The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if             a  the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding  and   b  the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding              For the purposes of this section  a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be             a  hopeless  or   b  bound to fail            for it to have no reasonable prospect of success     This section does not limit any powers that the Court has apart from this section referred toGargan v Scott  unreported  NSWSC    October   Insofar as the argument is advanced based upon s   of the Crimes Act    Cth  that is  on the common informer provisions  I respectfully adopt what was said by Hely J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia

whatsoever to the notion that s   imposes affirmative duties  For that reason  I do not think that such a negligence claim  even if articulated  has prospects  In any event  the only real way the

his judgment  were accepted at first instance as reflecting the relevant law referred toKable v Director of Public Prosecutions  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Fourthly  Mr Gargan relied upon the proposition that the Australian Capital Territory Local Court was a State court and that through various procedural alterations to the jurisdictions of State courts over the last   years  they had become unfit receptacles for federal jurisdiction within the meaning of the High Court s decision in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions  NSW    HCA         CLR     This argument is without merit  The Local Court of the Australian Capital Territory is not a State court for the purposes of the doctrine in Kable   Even if it were  Mr Gargan did not point to any provisions of the kind at suit in Kable itself which might give rise to the suggested incompatibility   Fifthly  Mr Gargan placed some reliance upon the Common Law Procedure Act    NSW  which  outside consent matters  gave a right to trial by jury  The short answer is that that Act has been replaced by the Supreme Court Act    NSW   In any event  any application that Act may have had to Local Court proceedings in Canberra or to Federal Court proceedings before Hely J  remains even now  elusive   Finally Mr Gargan relied upon the notion that he was pursuing a civil penalty within the meaning of the Evidence Act    Cth   I do not think that argument has any substance  It follows that I do not think that any of the arguments launched against Hely s J sequestration order have any prospects of success referred toMeriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As to the annulment of the   bankruptcy  this Court has vested in it  by s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy  The meaning of that expression has recently been considered by a Full Court of this Court in the decision of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales   FCAFC    It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine the precise boundaries of the nature of jurisdiction in bankruptcy  It suffices to observe that an application to annul a bankruptcy pursuant to s  B lies squarely within the heartland of that jurisdiction   Section  B provides      Annulment by Court     If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or  in the case of a debtor s petition  that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the Official Receiver  the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy     In the case of a debtor s petition  the order may be made whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the petition was presented   It is apparent from a cursory reading of s  B that there are two elements to it  The first is the satisfaction in the Court of the fact that a sequestration order ought not to have been made  The second is an exercise by the court of a discretionary power if that condition precedent is satisfied referred toRe Gargan  Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy  unreported  FCA  Kiefel J    August   As I understood his submissions  the central proposition was that whilst he accepted he had consented to the making of the sequestration order in   he had done so in circumstances where he was na ve about the operation of the legal system  His admission that the sequestration order had been by consent is recorded in the reasons of Kiefel J in Re Gargan  Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA    unreported  Kiefel J    August    Those proceedings involved an earlier attempt by Mr Gargan to annul the bankruptcy   Her Honour recited an affidavit  at   which had been filed by Mr Gargan and which recorded the fact that he no longer opposed the making of the sequestration order  I did not understand Mr Gargan to cavil with that in the course of argument but instead  as it were  he sought to admit and avoid   Notwithstanding his  at times  ingenious submissions  I am not persuaded that the circumstances surrounding the making of the sequestration order in   are such that I could now be satisfied that it ought not to have been made  It seems  therefore  that the power under s  B to annul the   bankruptcy does not arise   Although it is unnecessary in those circumstances to consider the likely disposition of the exercise of the discretionary power thereby conferred if it had arisen  I should say for completeness  even if the power in s  B had been enlivened  I would not have exercised the discretion in Mr Gargan s favour  This is because first  it is apparent and indeed accepted  that the sequestration order was not ultimately resisted  Whatever else one might say about that  it provides a powerful discretionary reason    years later  not now to undo it   Secondly and  perhaps  related to the first point  is the fact that there has now been an extensive delay of   years  Finally  there is  of course  the fact that a prior application has been made to annul this bankruptcy and has failed  In each of those circumstances  it seems to me that even construing the amended application and statement of claim in the most charitable of fashions  it simply could not be the case that a claim  now to be brought by Mr Gargan to annul the first bankruptcy  would have any prospects whatsoever   The first and second respondents apply for indemnity costs orders in relation to the dismissal which I have just ordered  It seems to me that in the exercise of the costs discretion the following matters are pertinent  First  the current proceeding involves attempts to re litigate a number of matters which Mr Gargan has extensively litigated in the past and unsuccessfully  Secondly  in relation to the annulment application  he has made at least one prior annulment application before Kiefel J and failed  Thirdly  he has sought to articulate an argument based upon s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  which operation has been determined  to his knowledge  in a contrary way by the Full Court in Heinrich    Finally  I take into account as a matter of overall impression  that this proceeding commenced by Mr Gargan  in common with a number of other proceedings commenced by him  involve what appear on their face sometimes to be engaging  if obscure  legal questions  However  those arguments are rarely thought through to their final conclusion  and despite Mr Gargan s protestation of having studied law for two years  seem to indicate a desire more to be involved in the disposition of clever legal arguments in court rather than any focused attention upon what the consequences of his actions might be in relation to the parties against whom he brings his proceedings   I am particularly mindful of the fact that Mr Gargan is an undischarged bankrupt  The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  are  by and large  directed to preventing the bringing of proceedings of the current kind  Although Mr Gargan articulated various ways in which it might plausibly be thought in some obscure circumstances that the current applications might be brought  I have found that those attempts were wholly unsuccessful and meritless  It seems to me that it is appropriate to mark disapprobation of the bringing of these proceedings by the making of the costs orders sought   I certify that the preceding forty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Perram
