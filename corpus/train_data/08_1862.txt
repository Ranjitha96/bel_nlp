au cases cth HCA  html  There is no evidence that enables a factual determination of whether or not it is unreasonable not to have raised the point earlier  Further  in Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR   the High Court stated at   that      Except in the most exceptional circumstances  it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party  after a case had been decided against him  to raise a new argument which  whether deliberately or by inadvertence  he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so referred toPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  SZFMW v Minister for Immigration   FMCA     in which Driver FM dismissed his application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  handed down on   December    the Tribunal decision  on the basis of Anshun estoppel  The Federal Magistrate s orders were interlocutory  rule     of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules    Cth   The applicant therefore requires leave to appeal to this Court  ss  d  and    A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The first respondent opposes the application on the basis that Driver FM s judgment is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant leave to appeal being granted and no substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted   His Honour said that  while the issue was not raised in the earlier court proceedings  the principle of res judicata would still probably apply and that  even if it did not  there was no reason why the issue could not have been raised in the earlier legal proceedings  His Honour said that the applicant was simply seeking to take advantage of a recent Court decision that appeared to favour an argument that could have been raised previously  In his Honour s view  the circumstances gave rise to an estoppel in accordance with the principles in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   and Wong v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR    His Honour said at     Applicants cannot continue to agitate concluded litigation when new court decisions are made that appear to be to their advantage   and dismissed the application   The applicant  who appears in person assisted by an interpreter  was unable to point to any error in Driver FM s decision to dismiss the application on the basis of Anshun estoppel  He reiterates the difficulties with his previous legal representatives and relies upon his lack of appreciation of what could have been advanced before Smith FM   There is no evidence of whether the applicant or his legal advisers were or were not aware of the possibility of reliance upon s  G of the Act at any time prior to the decision of SZIZO   Even if that section could apply in the present case  a later change to the law does not affect the fact that no jurisdictional error was found in the Tribunal s decision  In Wong the Full Court of the Federal Court applied Anshun in the context of judicial review of administrative action  The Full Court stated at   that      In essence  where the issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time  it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceeding between the parties consideredSZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Contrary to the assertion by the applicant  the failure to raise s  G of the Act earlier and the fact that the applicant s solicitors failed to appreciate that the applicant may have had an argument under s  G of the Act does not constitute fraud on the Tribunal within the meaning of SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR     see also Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX   FCAFC         ALR     In any event  the Minister submits that the grant of leave to appeal is futile  He points out that s  A c ii  of the Act provides that the Tribunal may give a document to a person by posting it to the last residential or business address provided by the recipient in connection with the review  The Minister says that the postal address disclosed in correspondence satisfies the requirements of that section  On that basis no breach of s  G of the Act could be made out as the Tribunal sent the correspondence to the authorised recipient at the postal address disclosed in correspondence between the authorised recipient and the Tribunal in respect of the review of the applicant s application referred toSZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Second  Driver FM noted that the applicant sought to take advantage of a recent decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALD   concerning s  G of the Act  His Honour noted at   that the Court documents disclosed      an arguable case in that  while the Tribunal appears to have corresponded with the applicant s authorised recipient at the postal address of the authorised recipient disclosed in correspondence  the Tribunal has apparently not corresponded with the authorised recipient at the office address stipulated in section C of the review application completed by the applicant   There is no evidence of whether the applicant or his legal advisers were or were not aware of the possibility of reliance upon s  G of the Act at any time prior to the decision of SZIZO   Even if that section could apply in the present case  a later change to the law does not affect the fact that no jurisdictional error was found in the Tribunal s decision  In Wong the Full Court of the Federal

In SZKNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALD   the Full Court of this Court considered the meaning of notification for the purposes of s   of the Act  The Full Court concluded that notification occurred when an applicant has physical possession of a decision by any means  It is reasonable to infer that the applicant was in possession of the Tribunal decision at least by the time he filed his application for special leave to the High Court on   September    The applicant submits that the time runs from the date of the decision in SZIZO   That is clearly not correct  The application to Driver FM was made out of time referred toSZKNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALD   In SZKNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALD   the Full Court of this

it determines that  special circumstances  exist  to allow an issue to be raised even where it is found that the point was unreasonably omitted from the earlier proceeding  The applicant does not advance any special circumstances beyond the fact that the argument was not put
