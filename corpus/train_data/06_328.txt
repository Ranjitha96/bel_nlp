Ejueyitsi v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAlin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Finally  Ms Riley referred to Alin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   where Sundberg J indicated that he agreed with what Mathews J had said in Du   His Honour said  at   that the statutory declarations under consideration in Alin did not satisfy the Regulations because they made  no reference to the applicant s state of mind  namely that the violence caused the applicant to fear for or be apprehensive about his personal well being or safety  that being a component of the definition of  relevant domestic violence  in reg    b    However  she noted that in Alin   Sundberg J had distinguished Meroka on the basis that the standard form  which had been used in Meroka   had not been used in Alin   Where the standard form was not used  it was necessary  in Sundberg J s view  for the requisite opinion to be expressly stated  Ms Riley noted that the standard form had not been used in the present case   In these circumstances  and relying upon both Du and Alin   Ms Riley submitted that even an implicit expression of opinion  of the kind for which Mr Horan contended  would not be sufficient  The requisite opinion would have to be clearly expressed   In particular  the question may arise as to whether the distinction that Sundberg J drew in Alin between a statutory declaration on a form approved by the Department  which may contain implicit statements of opinions  and a declaration not in that form  which may not  is correct  It is fair to say that Sundberg J referred to the difference between the form used in Meroka   and that used in Alin   as a basis for distinguishing Meroka   However  his Honour did not explain  in any detail  why the difference in the form of the declarations used warranted a different result  at least in terms of whether an opinion could be  implicit   It is arguable that the broader and more flexible approach taken by Ryan J in Meroka was not intended to be so constrained   It is also arguable that the gloss that Sundberg J placed upon reg     in   of Alin   namely that the competent person must indicate that he or she  was aware of the definition of domestic violence in reg    b  and refer to  the applicant s state of mind  namely that the violence caused the applicant to fear for or be apprehensive about his personal well being or safety  is not warranted by the terms of the regulation itself   In any event  it seems to me that these issues are not properly ones for me to determine  They do not arise directly under the notice of appeal  Their only relevance lies in whether relief should be refused on the basis of futility  For the reasons already given  I do not think that remittal would be futile   The question that next arises is  to which body should this proceeding be remitted  As previously indicated  Mr Horan submitted that the matter should be remitted to the MRT  That would have the obvious advantage  for the appellant  of allowing him the opportunity to file further statutory declarations that may meet the formal requirements of reg      That assumes  of course  that such statutory declarations would be forthcoming  That is an assumption that perhaps should not too readily be made  It may be difficult to persuade a competent person to express the opinions set out in that regulation  at least in circumstances where the declarant has no actual knowledge of the facts said to amount to domestic violence referred toBushell v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In developing that submission  Mr Horan argued that the concept of onus of proof has no place in administrative proceedings  such as those conducted by the MRT  He referred to McDonald v Director General of Social Security     FCR     McDonald   at     per Woodward J      per Northrop J and   per Jenkinson J  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Hughes   FCA         FCR   at   per Merkel J  with whom Carr J agreed  and Bushell v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan J  He submitted that such proceedings are not adversarial in nature  The MRT is an inquisitorial body which has powers to make inquiries and to obtain additional information  It is not a curial body that decides cases in accordance with principles of evidence  or by determining the incidence of the burden of proof referred toCakmak v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The MRT noted that the provisions of Div   had been extensively considered by the Federal Court  and that the Division had been described variously as  a deeming mechanism  Meroka v Minister for Immigration and

mechanical mode of proof  Cakmak v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at    consideredDu v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Ms Riley also referred to Du v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA     where Mathews J said at        The Regulations are in quite specific and peremptory terms  It is not sufficient compliance  in my view  with these Regulations for a competent person simply to note the consistency between a person s presentation and their account of domestic violence  or even the occurrence of domestic violence  The Regulations require that the competent person express an opinion in very specific terms  namely  as to whether relevant domestic violence as defined in reg     has been suffered by a person      This involves not only an opinion that past acts of violence have occurred but also an assessment of the state of mind of the alleged victim  None of this has been complied with here   Finally  Ms Riley referred to Alin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   where Sundberg J indicated that he agreed with what Mathews J had said in Du   His Honour said  at   that the statutory declarations under consideration in Alin did not satisfy the Regulations because they made  no reference to the applicant s state of mind  namely that the violence caused the applicant to fear for or be apprehensive about his personal well being or safety  that being a component of the definition of  relevant domestic violence  in reg    b    In these circumstances  and relying upon both Du and Alin   Ms Riley submitted that even an implicit expression of opinion  of the kind for which Mr Horan contended  would not be sufficient  The requisite opinion would have to be clearly expressed followedHuang v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Mr Horan referred to  and relied upon  what he submitted was an analogous case  Huang v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Huang   at      In that case  Drummond J set aside a decision of the Immigration Review Tribunal  the IRT   the predecessor to the MRT  the reasoning of which had been in very similar terms to that of the MRT in the present case  Mr Horan submitted that  contrary to the judgment of the Federal Magistrate below  the MRT s finding in this case was tainted by its failure properly to grasp the principles applicable to administrative proceedings  at least in relation to matters such as the incidence of the burden of proof   In Huang   the question that arose for determination was whether the IRT s comments  in its reasons for decision  indicated that it had disposed of the case against the applicant by deliberately refraining from making findings on relevant matters  It was said to have done so because it considered that the responsibility for clarifying the relevant facts rested with the applicant  and she had failed to discharge the onus she bore in that regard   The particular passage at   in the IRT s reasons for decision that gave rise to this issue was the following     An applicant for a visa needs to satisfy all of the criteria set out in the legislation for that visa  If the Tribunal is uncertain or unable  on balance  to find whether the facts exist to entitle the Applicant to the visa sought  a decision is to be made against her  see Re Ferreras   IRT Decision     September     The IRT went on to say that the visa applicant   on balance  had been unable to satisfy the particular requirements of the Regulations    Speaking of these passages  Drummond J stated at        The respondent submitted that the significance of what the Tribunal said in par   was to be found in s   of the Act  Before the decision maker  whether that be the Minister  his delegate or the Tribunal  is entitled to grant a visa of the kind sought by the applicant  the decision maker must be satisfied  among other things  that the other criteria  ie  other than the health criteria  for the visa in question that are prescribed by this Act or the Regulations have been satisfied  see s  a ii   It was then submitted that all the Tribunal did by making the comments in par   was acknowledge that the task for it in determining whether to grant the applicant her student visa in accordance with s  a ii  was to determine whether  at the end of the day  it was satisfied that criterion     was complied with  which required it to be satisfied that condition   was substantially complied with  It was said that par   should not be read as a statement by the Tribunal that it approached the case on the basis that the applicant must fail unless she discharged the persuasive burden of proving to the civil standard of proof the facts necessary to show that this particular criterion and this condition had been complied with  ie  the facts necessary to show that she was entitled to the visa she sought      Respondent s counsel  correctly in my opinion  accepted that common law concepts of onus of proof have no role in proceedings in the Migration Review Tribunal  See McDonald v Director General of Social Security     FCR   at         and   Cam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   and cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at         To say that notions of onus of proof are irrelevant is not  however  to say that it is not in some circumstances appropriate for the Tribunal to have regard to common law standards of proof  as opposed to the incidence of the burden of proof  and to reach conclusions of fact on some matters only if satisfied as to the existence of those facts  on the balance of probabilities arising from the available information before the decision maker   See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Epeabaka   FCA         FCR   at             These competing submissions necessarily invite the Court to determine just how the Tribunal reasoned its way to dismissing the applicant s application on this ground  I was reminded that the reasons of an administrative decision maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon judicial review by over zealously seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed  Wu Shan Liang at    This principle of judicial restraint applies to all reviewable administrative decisions including those of the Tribunal  But it does not  I think  apply in the same way to all such decisions  The rigour with which it constrains a court in examining a decision maker s reasons will reflect the nature and role of the particular decision maker  Members of the Migration Review Tribunal perform a significantly different function from public servants in the mainstream of federal executive activity who  from time to time  are called upon to make administrative decisions as part of a range of duties conferred on them  The Tribunal is a specialist decision maker charged with reviewing lower level administrative decisions  The obligation imposed by s   of the Migration Act    Cth  to provide in written form both reasons and findings  in the context of its decisions being subject to judicial review  shows that the Parliament expects the Tribunal to be capable of giving a coherent and informative explanation for how it reaches its ultimate conclusion for or against an applicant  The principle of restraint is one that cautions against too zealous a search for error  It is not a principle that immunises the Tribunal s reasoning from that critical examination which is part and parcel of the function of a court charged with review of the Tribunal s decision to see if it is flawed with reviewable error of the kinds listed in s   of the Act      In Re Ferreras   IRTA     September   the Immigration Review Tribunal reviewed the refusal to grant the applicant a visitor visa  It set out in par   of its reasons the criteria prescribed for the grant of such a visa and  in pars   to   turned to two of those criteria  saying           Criteria J and K comprise what is now commonly classified as the  bona fides  requirement  They effectively prescribe that the Tribunal must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the principal s proposed visit to Australia is  genuine  and not intended to enable her to become a permanent resident of Australia          The Tribunal then went on to consider various decisions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and a decision of Fox J in this Court  It concluded that the effect of these decisions was summed up in a dictum in the Tribunal to the following effect                as a matter of common sense  to use His Honour s words  he who asserts  or seeks a result  must prove  Such proof must make possible a finding  from the whole of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities  of the facts that are fundamental to a claim         This dictum deals with both the incidence of the persuasive burden of proof and the standard to which proofs must rise to justify a finding of fact      The Tribunal noted the decision of the Full Court in McDonald and said  erroneously  that   The result flowing from the Court s dicta however do not appear to be much different from that raised by the decisions referred to above    The Tribunal concluded               When the whole of the evidence has been considered against the statutory requirements and a Tribunal is left in a state of uncertainty as to whether the facts necessary to activate the relevant statutory power have been established it must decide against the exercise of the power  In the context of the instant case if having carefully considered the whole of the evidence  the picture is still unclear as to whether there exists an intention to make a  genuine  visit such that the Tribunal on the balance of probabilities is not able to make a finding in this regard then the criterion has not been satisfied and the application for the visa must fail         However  the tenor of the decision in Re Ferreras is that  though it may be inappropriate to speak of a party bearing a persuasive burden of proof as does a party to litigation in the courts  the practicalities are that in proceedings in the Tribunal the visa claimant has the onus of proving  on the balance of probabilities  the facts fundamental to satisfying the statutory criteria for the visa and will fail if that is not done  For the reasons given  such an approach is wrong      It is difficult to know from the reasons given by the Tribunal just how it reasoned its way to its ultimate conclusion against the applicant  But having referred to Re Ferreras   it may well be that it followed the erroneous approach suggested in that case and regarded the applicant as bearing the persuasive burden of proof to the civil standard of all facts necessary to enable the Tribunal to determine whether it was satisfied that the applicant was entitled to the student visa in question   Mr Horan submitted that the MRT  in the present case  had fallen into exactly the same error regarding the onus of proof as did the IRT in Huang   He submitted that         the error in the Tribunal s approach  and its misunderstanding of the legal principles  cannot be overcome by a  fair reading  of the Tribunal s reasons for decision  The Tribunal impermissibly imposed on the appellant a persuasive burden in relation to establishing that his relationship with the nominator was genuine and continuing at the time of application  The reference by the Tribunal to  the  common sense  burden of establishing facts  was more than simply  unfortunate   It is an indication of serious error made by the Tribunal in performing the task entrusted to it    footnote omitted  Mr Horan next anticipated the reply that the respondent Minister was likely to make  assuming that his primary submission was successful  He recognised that it would be submitted that even if the MRT had fallen into the error identified  it had correctly found that the appellant could not meet the criteria to be satisfied at the time of the decision  under cl     of Sch   which require an applicant for a spouse visa to continue to meet the requirements of the applicable subclause  unless a relevant exception exists  The only relevant exception that could be invoked was that relating to domestic violence  The Minister could be expected to submit that it would be futile to remit this matter to the MRT for rehearing  given that its findings regarding the statutory declarations and the police records were unassailable  In other words  the appellant s application was certain to be rejected because it could not meet the requirements of reg     and reg    a ii    As previously indicated  the Federal Magistrate did not consider any of the grounds of appeal that related to the statutory declarations and police records  That was because his Honour found no error on the MRT s part in relation to the burden of proof  and that put an end to the appellant s case   Mr Horan submitted that if the MRT did err by improperly imposing upon the appellant the burden of proof to establish that his relationship with the nominator was genuine and continuing  at the time of the application  the matter should be remitted to the MRT to be heard and determined according to law  He submitted that it would not be futile to remit the matter because the MRT  acting correctly  might well conclude that the requirements regarding the statutory declarations and the police records had been met   In that regard  Mr Horan noted that the relevant provisions of the Regulations   and in particular cl     of Sch   created an exception to the general requirement that  in order to satisfy the criteria for the grant of a sub class   visa  the applicant must be the  spouse  of the nominator at the time of decision  Normally  this must be at least two years after the date of application   It is difficult to distinguish the reasoning of the MRT that is impugned in the present case from that of the IRT  which was held by Drummond J  in Huang   to be flawed  Indeed  in both cases  the relevant tribunal adopted precisely the same formulation of the law governing the burden of proof in administrative review  see Huang at   and compare   of the MRT s reasons for decision   Ms Riley submitted that Huang did not decide  as a matter of ratio  that the language used by the IRT in that case demonstrated that it had determined the case erroneously  on the basis that the applicant carried a persuasive burden of proof  That was because Drummond J went on to find that the IRT s reasons for decision were also erroneous in other respects  and his Honour did not specifically state that the application for review  that was granted  was allowed on the basis of a mistaken allocation of the burden of proof   I am not persuaded by this submission  Drummond J made it abundantly clear  in Huang   when he concluded that there was reviewable error under s   of the Migration Act    Cth  that the IRT s entire approach to the burden of proof was misconceived  The fact that his Honour found several additional errors in the IRT s reasons for decision  any one of which would have been sufficient to vitiate that decision  does not mean that what he had to say about its treatment of the burden of proof amounted to mere dicta   In any event  even if Drummond J s observations were dicta  they were certainly carefully reasoned  and are worthy of serious consideration  The principle of comity would suggest that I should follow his Honour s analysis unless persuaded that it was wrong  Far from being so persuaded  I consider what his Honour said to have been correct   Ms Riley then submitted that there was an inconsistency between Huang and VSAF   If that were so  I would plainly be bound by VSAF   that being a decision of the Full Court  However  in my view  there is no such inconsistency  In the present case  the MRT analysed the evidence before it through the prism of the burden of proof  In VSAF   there simply was no evidence upon which the MRT could be satisfied of the requisite matters   Of course  the MRT in this case had to be satisfied of the various matters set out in the Regulations before it could grant the appellant the spouse visa that he sought  However  it is one thing to recognise that a statute requires that a state of satisfaction be reached  It is altogether another thing to approach the question whether such satisfaction has been achieved by asking whether an onus of proof has been discharged  The latter reflects an approach that is curial  rather than inquisitorial  As Huang makes plain  a decision maker who adopts such a curial approach asks the wrong question   In my view  the observations of Drummond J at   in Huang regarding Wu Shan Liang apply with equal force to the present case  The MRT was plainly confused about the distinction between the onus of proof in curial proceedings  and how a decision maker determines facts in administrative review  That confusion was most clearly manifested by its discussion at   of its reasons for decision  The reference to  common sense   which is in fact a term used to explain the axiom that  he who asserts must prove  in a curial context  was invoked by the MRT  mistakenly  to explain  and justify  a finding made in an entirely different  and purely administrative context   It follows that I disagree  with respect  with the learned Federal Magistrate who concluded that the MRT s decision  though somewhat confused  could nonetheless be saved by application of the principles set out in Wu Shan Liang   His Honour did not have the benefit  as I did  of being referred to the judgment of Drummond J in Huang   Had that case been drawn to his attention  he may well have come to a different conclusion  I would therefore uphold the various grounds of appeal that raise the MRT s treatment of the burden of proof as the basis for challenge referred toIbrahim v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The MRT noted that the provisions of Div   had been extensively considered by the Federal Court  and that the Division had been described variously as  a deeming mechanism  Meroka v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR     Meroka   at   a  triumph of form over substance  Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Ibrahim   at   and as a  mechanical mode of proof  Cakmak v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at      With regard to the statutory declarations  Ms Riley submitted that there was nothing implicit in them that suggested that the competent person held the opinions required under reg      She referred to Ibrahim at   where Wilcox J observed that if the visa applicant fails to obtain appropriate statutory declarations by the required two competent persons  the visa application has to be refused  That is so even if the decision maker is totally satisfied that the applicant has suffered domestic violence at the hands of his or her spouse   Of course  once the formal requirements associated with the statutory declarations are met  the Regulations do not require or permit the MRT to come to any decision as to whether domestic violence actually took place  The scheme is one of deeming provisions  and as Wilcox J pithily observed  represents a  triumph of form over substance    Ms Riley submitted that if I were to conclude that the appeal should be allowed because of what the MRT had said regarding the burden of proof  and if I were not persuaded that it would be futile to remit the matter for further consideration  it ought to be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court  and not to the MRT  That was because the challenge to the validity of the MRT s decision  regarding the statutory declarations and the police records  had not been determined  The application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court  therefore  had still to be completed   I infer that it did not escape Ms Riley s attention that remittal to the Federal Magistrates Court  rather than the MRT  might preclude the appellant from seeking to rectify any defects associated with the statutory declarations by filing new ones referred toKozel v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The MRT then stated that it was established law that it was not its role  nor that of any decision maker  to assess whether domestic violence had taken place  In the words of Ryan J in Kozel v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR     Kozel   it was  the Tribunal s responsibility to assess whether statutory declarations have been furnished which express the opinions mandated by reg       It should be noted that reg     is in the following terms          Statutory declaration by competent person     A statutory declaration under this regulation         a  must be made by a competent person  and    b  must set out the basis of the competent person s claim to be a competent person for the purposes of this Division  and    c  must state that  in the competent person s opinion  relevant domestic violence  within the meaning of paragraph        b  has been suffered by a person  and    d  must name the person who  in the opinion of the competent person  has suffered that relevant domestic violence  and    e  must name the person who  in the opinion of the competent person  committed that relevant domestic violence  and    f  must set out the evidence on which the competent person s opinion is based   It should also be noted that reg    a ii  provides that the evidence that may be relied upon to support a contention that a person has suffered or committed domestic violence includes     a copy of a record of an assault on the alleged victim allegedly committed by the alleged perpetrator  being a record kept by a police service of a State or Territory    Once again  Mr Horan submitted that it was  implicit  in Ms Fraser s two statutory declarations that she was of the opinion that the appellant had suffered domestic violence committed by the nominator  He submitted that in considering whether a statutory declaration contains the requisite opinion  it must be read fairly  and should not be  scrutinised over zealously with a view to detecting some inadequacy of expression from which error may be imputed  see Kozel at   per Ryan J  He submitted that in many  if not most  cases  the competent person would have no direct knowledge of the applicant s relationship with his or her spouse  and would therefore be in no position to do other than recount the history given by that person  Even if there were objective signs of violence having been inflicted  it would be difficult for a doctor  or a social worker  to proffer an opinion that the injuries in question had been inflicted in the course of domestic violence  still less that a particular person had inflicted them  He submitted that the Regulations should be construed benevolently  having regard to their evident purpose  which was to allow persons who had been subjected to domestic violence  and forced to live apart  to maintain a claim for a spouse visa  He further submitted that the Regulations should not be construed so as to require the competent person to act as an investigative  or fact finding body  a task which many such persons would either eschew  or not be qualified to undertake   In that regard  Mr Horan submitted that Dr Van Dort  in his statutory declaration  had stated that he had been given an account of the domestic violence suffered by the appellant  and committed by the nominator  and that he had been shown corroborating evidence in the form of police reports and photographs  It was in that context that Dr Van Dort stated that the appellant  was distressed and I feel that he was depressed   In those circumstances  Mr Horan submitted  it was by no means difficult to infer that Dr Van Dort was stating an opinion that the appellant had suffered domestic violence  as required by reg     and that he held the opinion that this had been inflicted by the nominator  The same could be said of Ms Fraser s statutory declarations   Mr Horan noted that the conduct of the nominator  as described by the appellant  was capable of amounting to domestic violence within the meaning of the Regulations   It involved violence against the appellant s property  and at least the implicit threat of violence against him  It must have caused him to fear for  or to be apprehensive about  his personal well being or safety referred toLadic v Capital Territory Health Commission     ALN N  The MRT stated  as its reason for refusing the appellant s application       Other than the evidence of the Applicant  there is no independent reliable evidence attesting to the state of the relationship from family or friends  Whilst the Tribunal is satisfied that the Applicant and Ms Khan may have shared some form of a relationship after the Applicant s move to Perth in or around September   and when the marriage broke up at the end of June   the Tribunal finds that the relationship falls short of a genuine and continuing married relationship as required by law  It would be fair to described  sic  as lacking the evidence relating to indices of such a relationship as set out regulation    A of the Regulations          When considering the question of burden of proof in administrative review  the Tribunal is guided by various Administrative Appeals Tribunal  AAT   sic  and the Federal Court on the subject  Whilst acknowledging that an administrative tribunal should not  seek to determine matters     by strict application of the rules related to onus of proof  Senior Member Ballard in Re Caruana and Australian Telecommunications Commission    ALN N  nevertheless said that  regard must be had to the application of those rules     in determining which party has the responsibility of satisfying the Tribunal as to any given fact     See also Re Elkington and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N   His Honour Fox J in Ladic v Capital Territory Health Commission     ALN N  said  at N  that         the term  onus of proof   or  burden of proof      was a legal burden  or requirement and could  as a matter of common sense  be said to have rested with the party seeking the result             This view was endorsed by Deputy President Todd in an AAT decision Re Holbrook and Australian Postal Commission     ALN N  when he said that         as a matter of common sense  to use His Honour s words  he who asserts  or he seeks a result  must prove   Such proof must make possible a finding  from the whole of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities  of the facts that are fundamental to a claim    emphasis added           In McDonald v Director General of Social Security     ALD   the Federal Court was again anxious to avoid the onus terminology  The result flowing from the Court s dicta however does not appear to be much different from that raised by the decisions referred to above  When the whole of the evidence has been considered against the statutory requirements and the Tribunal is left in a state of uncertainty as to whether the facts necessary to activate the relevant statutory power have been established it must decide against the exercise of the power         The Tribunal finds that the Applicant has not discharged the  common sense  burden of establishing the facts necessary to enable the Tribunal to reach a finding on the critical issue  The Tribunal is unable to reach a finding that the Applicant was the spouse of Ms Khan at the time of lodgement of the primary application     emphasis added  Mr Horan recognised that the MRT had expressly acknowledged at   of its reasons for decision that it should not  seek to determine matters     by strict application of the rules related to onus of proof  and had cited authority for that proposition  He noted  however  that that statement  which was itself unexceptionable  was immediately followed by the various references to onus of proof  or burden of proof  set out at   and   of the reasons for decision  He submitted that the MRT s belief that the Full Court s admonition in McDonald to avoid such terminology could be reconciled with the very different approach taken in Re Elkington and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N  and Ladic v Capital Territory Health Commission     ALN N  the cases to which the MRT referred  indicated that it had not understood the full significance of what the Full Court had said upon this subject referred toMcDonald v Director General of Social Security     FCR   The MRT stated  as its reason for refusing the appellant s application       Other than the

considered against the statutory requirements and the Tribunal is left in a state of uncertainty as to whether the facts necessary to activate the relevant statutory power have been established it must decide against the exercise of the power         The Tribunal finds that the Applicant has not discharged the  common sense  burden of establishing the facts necessary to enable the Tribunal to reach a finding on the critical issue  The Tribunal is unable to reach a finding that the Applicant was the spouse of Ms Khan at the time of lodgement of the primary application     emphasis added  Nevertheless  the Federal Magistrate went on to conclude at   and      Reading its reasons carefully  however  and noting that it should avoid the  onus  terminology  see McDonald v Director General of Social Security     ALD   I am prepared to conclude in the present case that the MRT has indeed simply embarked upon its task in a way which led it to a conclusion that it was not satisfied that the evidence before it would allow it to conclude that the relationship in this instance was one of a genuine and continuing married relationship as required by law  Although in paragraph   of its decision the MRT states it is  unable to reach a finding that the applicant was the spouse of Ms Khan at the time of lodgement of the primary application  it did so  unfortunately  in the context of that same paragraph where it referred to the  commonsense burden of establishing the facts   Although that is an unfortunate occurrence in terms of the reasoning and the manner in which the MRT has expressed its findings  I am not prepared to conclude that it has in reality done anything more than indicate that it was not satisfied that the appropriate relationship existed as required by law      It seems to me that that principal finding in paragraph   of the MRT s decision is not tainted or indeed rendered fatal by the subsequent discussion of the law in relation to a burden of proof  Indeed  it may simply be that the MRT was grappling with the concept of burden of proof against the backdrop of correctly reciting appropriate authorities where it is clear that the application of the rules related to onus of proof are not appropriate for the tribunal and where it is clear that in all the circumstances the MRT had after reciting the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant who was represented simply made appropriate findings that it was not satisfied in relation to the key issue to be resolved  namely whether or not the applicant and the nominator were in a relationship of a kind required by law for the purposes of the visa application  It had after all considered the statutory declarations and other material before it and did so in the course of its reasoning as required   Having made the findings set out above  in relation to   of the MRT s reasons  his Honour concluded that it was unnecessary to go any further and consider the remaining grounds of appeal  These additional grounds challenged the MRT s findings regarding the statutory declarations and the police reports  They contended that the MRT had erred in failing to be satisfied that the domestic violence exception was made out   Mr Horan  who appeared on behalf of the appellant  pro bono  referred firstly to the relevant provisions of the Regulations   These are set out at length at   of the Federal Magistrate s reasons for judgment  and it is unnecessary to replicate them here   It is sufficient  for present purposes  to note that cl    a  of Sch   requires that  at the time of application  in this case   April   the applicant must be the spouse of an Australian citizen  an Australian permanent resident  or an eligible New Zealand citizen  Under reg    A  a person is the  spouse  of another person if the two persons are in a married relationship within the meaning of sub reg  A   They must be married to each other under a valid marriage  and the Minister must be satisfied that they have a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others  the relationship is genuine and continuing  and that they live together  or do not live separately and apart  on a permanent basis   In forming an opinion as to whether the two persons are in a married relationship  the Minister must have regard to all of the circumstances of the relationship including  in particular  the matters prescribed by reg    A  relating to the financial aspects of the relationship  the nature of the household  the social aspects of the relationship  and the nature of their respective commitment to each other   Mr Horan submitted that  in the present case  the MRT had been required to make a finding as to whether the appellant was relevantly the  spouse  of the nominator within the meaning of reg    A  That  in turn  required the MRT to make a finding as to whether their relationship was genuine and continuing  as at the time of application  and in doing so to take into account the matters set out in reg    A    Mr Horan submitted that the MRT did not make a finding  on the evidence  as to these matters  It simply concluded that  in the absence of  reliable  evidence  it was unable to  reach a finding on the critical issue  as expressed in   of its reasons for decision  He submitted that when the MRT s reasons for decision were read as a whole  it was apparent that it had impermissibly imposed a burden of proof upon the appellant  and thereby committed jurisdictional error   In developing that submission  Mr Horan argued that the concept of onus of proof has no place in administrative proceedings  such as those conducted by the MRT  He referred to McDonald v Director General of Social Security     FCR     McDonald   at     per Woodward J      per Northrop J and   per Jenkinson J  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Hughes   FCA         FCR   at   per Merkel J  with whom Carr J agreed  and Bushell v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan J  He submitted that such proceedings are not adversarial in nature  The MRT is an inquisitorial body which has powers to make inquiries and to obtain additional information  It is not a curial body that decides cases in accordance with principles of evidence  or by determining the incidence of the burden of proof   Mr Horan recognised that the MRT had expressly acknowledged at   of its reasons for decision that it should not  seek to determine matters     by strict application of the rules related to onus of proof  and had cited authority for that proposition  He noted  however  that that statement  which was itself unexceptionable  was immediately followed by the various references to onus of proof  or burden of proof  set out at   and   of the reasons for decision  He submitted that the MRT s belief that the Full Court s admonition in McDonald to avoid such terminology could be reconciled with the very different approach taken in Re Elkington and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N  and Ladic v Capital Territory Health Commission     ALN N  the cases to which the MRT referred  indicated that it had not understood the full significance of what the Full Court had said upon this subject   Speaking of these passages  Drummond J stated at        The respondent submitted that the significance of what the Tribunal said in par   was to be found in s   of the Act  Before the decision maker  whether that be the Minister  his delegate or the Tribunal  is entitled to grant a visa of the kind sought by the applicant  the decision maker must be satisfied  among other things  that the other criteria  ie  other than the health criteria  for the visa in question that are prescribed by this Act or the Regulations have been satisfied  see s  a ii   It was then submitted that all the Tribunal did by making the comments in par   was acknowledge that the task for it in determining whether to grant the applicant her student visa in accordance with s  a ii  was to determine whether  at the end of the day  it was satisfied that criterion     was complied with  which required it to be satisfied that condition   was substantially complied with  It was said that par   should not be read as a statement by the Tribunal that it approached the case on the basis that the applicant must fail unless she discharged the persuasive burden of proving to the civil standard of proof the facts necessary to show that this particular criterion and this condition had been complied with  ie  the facts necessary to show that she was entitled to the visa she sought      Respondent s counsel  correctly in my opinion  accepted that common law concepts of onus of proof have no role in proceedings in the Migration Review Tribunal  See McDonald v Director General of Social Security     FCR   at         and   Cam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   and cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at         To say that notions of onus of proof are irrelevant is not  however  to say that it is not in some circumstances appropriate for the Tribunal to have regard to common law standards of proof  as opposed to the incidence of the burden of proof  and to reach conclusions of fact on some matters only if satisfied as to the existence of those facts  on the balance of probabilities arising from the available information before the decision maker   See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Epeabaka   FCA         FCR   at             These competing submissions necessarily invite the Court to determine just how the Tribunal reasoned its way to dismissing the applicant s application on this ground  I was reminded that the reasons of an administrative decision maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon judicial review by over zealously seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed  Wu Shan Liang at    This principle of judicial restraint applies to all reviewable administrative decisions including those of the Tribunal  But it does not  I think  apply in the same way to all such decisions  The rigour with which it constrains a court in examining a decision maker s reasons will reflect the nature and role of the particular decision maker  Members of the Migration Review Tribunal perform a significantly different function from public servants in the mainstream of federal executive activity who  from time to time  are called upon to make administrative decisions as part of a range of duties conferred on them  The Tribunal is a specialist decision maker charged with reviewing lower level administrative decisions  The obligation imposed by s   of the Migration Act    Cth  to provide in written form both reasons and findings  in the context of its decisions being subject to judicial review  shows that the Parliament expects the Tribunal to be capable of giving a coherent and informative explanation for how it reaches its ultimate conclusion for or against an applicant  The principle of restraint is one that cautions against too zealous a search for error  It is not a principle that immunises the Tribunal s reasoning from that critical examination which is part and parcel of the function of a court charged with review of the Tribunal s decision to see if it is flawed with reviewable error of the kinds listed in s   of the Act      In Re Ferreras   IRTA     September   the Immigration Review Tribunal reviewed the refusal to grant the applicant a visitor visa  It set out in par   of its reasons the criteria prescribed for the grant of such a visa and  in pars   to   turned to two of those criteria  saying           Criteria J and K comprise what is now commonly classified as the  bona fides  requirement  They effectively prescribe that the Tribunal must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the principal s proposed visit to Australia is  genuine  and not intended to enable her to become a permanent resident of Australia          The Tribunal then went on to consider various decisions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and a decision of Fox J in this Court  It concluded that the effect of these decisions was summed up in a dictum in the Tribunal to the following effect                as a matter of common sense  to use His Honour s words  he who asserts  or seeks a result  must prove  Such proof must make possible a finding  from the whole of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities  of the facts that are fundamental to a claim         This dictum deals with both the incidence of the persuasive burden of proof and the standard to which proofs must rise to justify a finding of fact      The Tribunal noted the decision of the Full Court in McDonald and said  erroneously  that   The result flowing from the Court s dicta however do not appear to be much different from that raised by the decisions referred to above    The Tribunal concluded               When the whole of the evidence has been considered against the statutory requirements and a Tribunal is left in a state of uncertainty as to whether the facts necessary to activate the relevant statutory power have been established it must decide against the exercise of the power  In the context of the instant case if having carefully considered the whole of the evidence  the picture is still unclear as to whether there exists an intention to make a  genuine  visit such that the Tribunal on the balance of probabilities is not able to make a finding in this regard then the criterion has not been satisfied and the application for the visa must fail         However  the tenor of the decision in Re Ferreras is that  though it may be inappropriate to speak of a party bearing a persuasive burden of proof as does a party to litigation in the courts  the practicalities are that in proceedings in the Tribunal the visa claimant has the onus of proving  on the balance of probabilities  the facts fundamental to satisfying the statutory criteria for the visa and will fail if that is not done  For the reasons given  such an approach is wrong      It is difficult to know from the reasons given by the Tribunal just how it reasoned its way to its ultimate conclusion against the applicant  But having referred to Re Ferreras   it may well be that it followed the erroneous approach suggested in that case and regarded the applicant as bearing the persuasive burden of proof to the civil standard of all facts necessary to enable the Tribunal to determine whether it was satisfied that the applicant was entitled to the student visa in question  approvedMeroka v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The MRT noted that the provisions of Div   had been extensively considered by the Federal Court  and that the Division had been described variously as  a deeming mechanism  Meroka v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR     Meroka   at   a  triumph of form over substance  Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Ibrahim   at   and as a  mechanical mode of proof  Cakmak v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at      Ms Riley very properly drew attention to the observations of Ryan J in Meroka   where his Honour said at   and      That is not to say that the Minister  or the Tribunal  can substitute for that of the  competent person  his or its own opinion of whether domestic violence has been suffered          I do not consider that the competent person need state expressly that in his or her opinion relevant domestic violence has been suffered  The requisite statement of opinion may be conveyed by implication having regard to the way in which the standard form directs the attention of the competent person to the definition of  domestic violence  in reg    b    However  she noted that in Alin   Sundberg J had distinguished Meroka on the basis that the standard form  which had been used in Meroka   had not been used in Alin   Where the standard form was not used  it was necessary  in Sundberg J s view  for the requisite opinion to be expressly stated  Ms Riley noted that the standard form had not been used in the present case   The appellant s submissions regarding the statutory declarations obviously face significant hurdles  Nonetheless  an argument can be put to the effect that the MRT erred in its treatment of this issue  Much will depend upon whether the approach taken by Ryan J in Meroka   which recognises the possibility that a statutory declaration may state an opinion  implicitly  is good law   In particular  the question may arise as to whether the distinction that Sundberg J drew in Alin between a statutory declaration on a form approved by the Department  which may contain implicit statements of opinions  and a declaration not in that form  which may not  is correct  It is fair to say that Sundberg J referred to the difference between the form used in Meroka   and that used in Alin   as a basis for distinguishing Meroka   However  his Honour did not explain  in any detail  why the difference in the form of the declarations used warranted a different result  at least in terms of whether an opinion could be  implicit   It is arguable that the broader and more flexible approach taken by Ryan J in Meroka was not intended to be so constrained distinguishedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

well be that it followed the erroneous approach suggested in that case and regarded the applicant as bearing the persuasive burden of proof to the civil standard of all facts necessary to enable the Tribunal to determine whether it was satisfied that the applicant was entitled to the student visa in question   In that regard  Ms Riley sought comfort in the well known passage from the judgment of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at     Ms Riley noted that  at   of its reasons  the MRT had correctly acknowledged that an administrative tribunal should not seek to determine matters by the application of the rules related to burden of proof  She submitted  however  that where an applicant asks the MRT to be satisfied about an aspect of his personal situation  in circumstances where the MRT is under no obligation to seek out material for itself  and there is no opposing party  the only realistic source of material upon which the MRT can achieve the required state of satisfaction is the applicant himself   Ms Riley s submission that Wu Shan Liang should be invoked to salvage the MRT s decision  despite its  unfortunate  use of language  has a powerful resonance  There are many cases  where decisions by administrative tribunals have been affirmed  despite lapses in the language used when addressing matters of  proof   However  a great deal must depend upon the particular circumstances of any given case  Some cases will cross the line  and irredeemably reveal jurisdictional error   In my view  the observations of Drummond J at   in Huang regarding Wu Shan Liang apply with equal force to the present case  The MRT was plainly confused about the distinction between the onus of proof in curial proceedings  and how a decision maker determines facts in administrative review  That confusion was most clearly manifested by its discussion at   of its reasons for decision  The reference to  common sense   which is in fact a term used to explain the axiom that  he who asserts must prove  in a curial context  was invoked by the MRT  mistakenly  to explain  and justify  a finding made in an entirely different  and purely administrative context   It follows that I disagree  with respect  with the learned Federal Magistrate who concluded that the MRT s decision  though somewhat confused  could nonetheless be saved by application of the principles set out in Wu Shan Liang   His Honour did not have the benefit  as I did  of being referred to the judgment of Drummond J in Huang   Had that case been drawn to his attention  he may well have come to a different conclusion  I would therefore uphold the various grounds of appeal that raise the MRT s treatment of the burden of proof as the basis for challenge referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Hughes   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In developing that submission  Mr Horan argued that the concept of onus of proof has no place in administrative proceedings  such as those conducted by the MRT  He referred to McDonald v Director General of Social Security     FCR     McDonald   at     per Woodward J      per Northrop J and   per Jenkinson J  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Hughes   FCA         FCR   at   per Merkel J  with whom Carr J agreed  and Bushell v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan J  He submitted that such proceedings are not adversarial in nature  The MRT is an inquisitorial body which has powers to make inquiries and to obtain additional information  It is not a curial body that decides cases in accordance with principles of evidence  or by determining the incidence of the burden of proof distinguishedMinister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Ms Riley accepted that the notion of proof  as understood in a curial sense  has no role to play in an administrative decision in which the decision maker is asked to be satisfied of a certain matter  However  she submitted that it was also true  as a matter of practical reality  that the decision maker would not be able to be satisfied of a particular matter if there was no evidence  or other material  regarding an important issue  before the decision maker  She referred  in that regard  to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of     FCAFC     VSAF   a case in which the applicant had not attended before the Refugee Review Tribunal  In that case  the Full Court saw no error in the Tribunal having proceeded to make its decision without taking any further steps to enable him to attend  The absence of any evidence in support of the applicant s claim enabled the Tribunal to find that it was unable to be satisfied that he had a genuine fear of persecution  or that he had experienced any particular mistreatment or harm   Ms Riley submitted that  in the present case  the MRT s reference to the  common sense  burden  in   of its reasons for decision  meant no more than that it could not be satisfied  in the absence of sufficient evidence  that the appellant and the nominator were in a genuine and continuing spousal relationship  It did not mean that the MRT had decided the case on the basis of some failure to discharge a curial onus of proof   Ms Riley next referred to the following passage in VSAF   at      We are unable to agree with his Honour s statement that  in the absence of findings as to the facts  either favourable or unfavourable to the  respondent  the Tribunal could not reach the requisite state of satisfaction  or the requisite state of non satisfaction  see    As s   and Wu Shan Liang make clear  the section requires a visa to be rejected in the absence of a positive finding of satisfaction  It does not require the visa to be granted in the absence of an adverse finding  There are many cases showing that findings of fact are not necessarily required to support a state of non satisfaction  In SJSB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   the Tribunal found that the applicant s claims were at  such a general and vague level that the Tribunal cannot establish the relevant facts  and therefore had made no findings either accepting or rejecting the claims  The Tribunal s approach was upheld by a Full Court at            It can be seen from the form of  s   that it does not require the decision maker to reach a decision to refuse to grant a visa only if a particular matter is established  Rather  it requires a refusal if the decision maker is not affirmatively satisfied that the criteria for the visa in question have been satisfied           See also NAQR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   and Applicant A  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Ms Riley submitted that if the appellant did not put before the MRT material sufficient to enable it to be satisfied of a requisite matter  his visa application had to be rejected  She submitted that in the present case  the MRT  though satisfied that the appellant and nominator had  some form of relationship  expressly stated that it was not satisfied that they had been in a genuine and continuing relationship at the time of the application  She submitted that there was nothing in the MRT s reasoning on this issue that suggested it had misunderstood its statutory task  On the material  it was open to the MRT to arrive at the conclusion that it did   Ms Riley recognised that she might be in some difficulty with regard to the burden of proof issue  She frankly acknowledged that the MRT s language had been unfortunate  and that it had been unwise to speak of the appellant having not discharged the  common sense burden  of establishing the facts necessary to enable it to reach a finding on the critical issue  However  she submitted that when the MRT used this terminology  it had merely expressed itself infelicitously  and had done no more than what VSAF expressly contemplated and approved   Ms Riley then submitted that there was an inconsistency between Huang and VSAF   If that were so  I would plainly be bound by VSAF   that being a decision of the Full Court  However  in my view  there is no such inconsistency  In the present case  the MRT analysed the evidence before it through the prism of the burden of proof  In VSAF   there simply was no evidence upon which the MRT could be satisfied of the requisite matters   Subject to what VSAF had to say regarding the meaning of the term  satisfy   in the context of a proceeding in which the applicant did not attend the hearing that had been arranged so that he could present his case  and therefore put no material to the relevant tribunal in support of that case  it is plainly wrong for a decision maker to approach an application for merits review by considering whether a persuasive burden of proof has been discharged   I should add that I do not understand the MRT  in the paragraphs that are impugned  to have been endeavouring  in an incomplete way  to distinguish between a legal and evidential burden of proof  Nor do I understand it to have embarked upon an analysis grounded in the mysteries of presumptions of law and fact  and any differences that arise between them  Its error was more fundamental than that  and simply reflected confusion on its part as to how the process of administrative review was to be conducted referred toRe Elkington and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N  The MRT stated  as its reason for refusing the appellant s application       Other than the evidence of the Applicant  there is no independent reliable evidence attesting to the state of the relationship from family or friends  Whilst the Tribunal is satisfied that the Applicant and Ms Khan may have shared some form of a relationship after the Applicant s move to Perth in or around September   and when the marriage broke up at the end of June   the Tribunal finds that the relationship falls short of a genuine and continuing married relationship as required by law  It would be fair to described  sic  as lacking the evidence relating to indices of such a relationship as set out regulation    A of the Regulations          When considering the question of burden of proof in administrative review  the Tribunal is guided by various Administrative Appeals Tribunal  AAT   sic  and the Federal Court on the subject  Whilst acknowledging that an administrative tribunal should not  seek to determine matters     by strict application of the rules related to onus of proof  Senior Member Ballard in Re Caruana and Australian Telecommunications Commission    ALN N  nevertheless said that  regard must be had to the application of those rules     in determining which party has the responsibility of satisfying the Tribunal as to any given fact     See also Re Elkington and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N   His Honour Fox J in Ladic v Capital Territory Health Commission     ALN N  said  at N  that         the term  onus of proof   or  burden of proof      was a legal burden  or requirement and could  as a matter of common sense  be said to have rested with the party seeking the result             This view was endorsed by Deputy President Todd in an AAT decision Re Holbrook and Australian Postal Commission     ALN N  when he said that         as a matter of common sense  to use His Honour s words  he who asserts  or he seeks a result  must prove   Such proof must make possible a finding  from the whole of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities  of the facts that are fundamental to a claim    emphasis added           In McDonald v Director General of Social Security     ALD   the Federal Court was again anxious to avoid the onus terminology  The result flowing from the Court s dicta however does not appear to be much different from that raised by the decisions referred to above  When the whole of the evidence has been considered against the statutory requirements and the Tribunal is left in a state of uncertainty as to whether the facts necessary to activate the relevant statutory power have been established it must decide against the exercise of the power         The Tribunal finds that the Applicant has not discharged the  common sense  burden of establishing the facts necessary to enable the Tribunal to reach a finding on the critical issue  The Tribunal is unable to reach a finding that the Applicant was the spouse of Ms Khan at the time of lodgement of the primary application     emphasis added  Mr Horan recognised that the MRT had expressly acknowledged at   of its reasons for decision that it should not  seek to determine matters     by strict application of the rules related to onus of proof  and had cited authority for that proposition  He noted  however  that that statement  which was itself unexceptionable  was immediately followed by the various references to onus of proof  or burden of proof  set out at   and   of the reasons for decision  He submitted that the MRT s belief that the Full Court s admonition in McDonald to avoid such terminology could be reconciled with the very different approach taken in Re Elkington and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N  and Ladic v Capital Territory Health Commission     ALN N  the cases to which the MRT referred  indicated that it had not understood the full significance of what the Full Court had said upon this subject
