Limited v New Garage and Motor Company Limited   AC   at     Lord Dunedin said       The question whether a sum stipulated is penalty or liquidated damages is a question of construction to be decided upon the terms and inherent circumstances of each particular contract  judged of as at the time of the making of the contract  not as at the time of the breach      Lord Dunedin said in relation to the task of construction  at          To assist this task of construction various tests have been suggested  which if applicable to the case under consideration may prove helpful  or even conclusive  Such are       a  It will be held to be penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach           b  It will be held to be a penalty if the breach consists only in not paying a sum of money  and the sum stipulated is a sum greater than the sum which ought to have been paid          c  There is a presumption  but no more  that it is penalty when  a single lump sum is made payable by way of compensation  on the occurrence of one or more or all of several events

into on   October provided that the  Free Carry Shares  were only to be issued so long as the respondents  continue to be employed by  the applicant  clause  g   The shareholders agreement also contemplated that the respondents had to achieve the performance criteria themselves so as to be entitled to the issue of the shares under that agreement  In my opinion  regard can be had to those two previous transactions to discern the objective intention of the parties in relation to the circular resolution  HIH Casualty   General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Company     Lloyd s Report   at     The very purpose of performance shares  in my opinion  is to induce the person to whom the shares are given to perform  That was the purpose for their issue in this case because it was important for the applicant to have those who had the responsibility of managing the applicant achieve the performance criteria  The performance shares were issued with the objective intention that the performance criteria in the performance shares would be met by the holders of the performance shares themselves  That means that the respondents had to cause the applicant to achieve the performance milestones   It was contended by the applicant that the respondents had to raise capital with ANZIS in accordance with ANZIS  offer of   November   because that transaction was later embodied in the subscription agreement  Because that particular capital raising did not occur  then that criteria was not achieved  I do not think that the circular resolution necessarily obliged the respondents to raise capital only in accordance with ANZIS  offer of   November    I think the criterion that needed to be met was to raise sufficient capital so as to allow the second criterion also to be met  It did not need to be with ANZIS or  if it was with ANZIS  it did not need to be only in the terms of the offer made on   November    It was only necessary that the respondents raised sufficient capital to allow the second criterion to be met  In any event  that does not weaken the applicant s case because  whatever the criterion was  it was not met by either or both the respondents   In my opinion  the first respondent is not entitled to claim that the performance shares converted to B Class shares after the applicant satisfied the performance criteria in the circular resolution under its new management   It follows that if I am wrong about my conclusion that the resolution contained in the circular resolution should be rescinded and the issue of the performance shares set aside and the first respondent is entitled to the performance shares  the first respondent will never be entitled to have those shares convert to B Class shares because he and the second respondent did not satisfy the performance criteria citedJordan v Avram     ACSR   An application under s  a  is not confined to a procedural irregularity  The subsection clearly has a

is a remedial provision and should be given a liberal interpretation  Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd   FCA         ACSR    The power to validate given in s   and s  E must be exercised by reference to the purposes of the sections in the Corporations Act    The purpose of s   is to empower the Court to relieve a company of the consequences of non compliance with a proceeding under the Corporations Act   It allows the Court to make orders to validate procedures or transactions where there has been non compliance with a provision of the Corporations Act   The power is to be exercised in favour of the company unless  in the case of s     the irregularity which is the subject matter of the application has caused or may cause substantial injustice but cannot be remedied by any order of the Court citedRe Wave Capital     ACSR   Whilst s  E is silent on the question of substantial injustice  in my opinion  no order would be made under s  E unless the applicant could show that no injustice would be caused to any other party  In Re Wave Capital     ACSR   at   French J said     Like the discretion to validate invalid share issues under s  E   the power conferred by s   must be exercised having regard to the requirements of the purposes of the Corporations Act and any other relevant statutes whose application may be in issue  It must also be exercised having regard to the interests of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions  Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief  Re Onslow Salt Pty Ltd     ALR     ACSR   and cases there cited  citedRe Westpac Banking Corporation  ACN         and Others     ACSR   No

   It was contended by the applicant that such an order would not be made because the first respondent has not discharged his obligation of establishing that a validation order would be unlikely to result in a substantial injustice to any person   It was contended that the applicant had given as its particular in its plea in paragraph  E   and paragraph  EE that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person  that the applicant had approved the issue of performance shares on terms no more favourable in the shareholders agreement  and that thereafter any person who had acquired shares did so with knowledge of the agreement to issue those shares  For the reasons already given  that particular has not been made out  The performance shares in the circular resolution were to issue on more favourable terms to the respondents than the performance shares contemplated in the shareholders agreement   The applicant pleaded in reply to the first respondent s defence that the failure to comply with s  B of the Corporations Act has resulted in substantial injustice in that the applicant s shareholders would have or may have refused to approve the issue of the performance shares  No other particular of any substantial injustice is given by the applicant in that pleading citedRing Row Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu
