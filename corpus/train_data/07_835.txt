austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Deatons Proprietary Limited v Flew   HCA         CLR   the question was whether an assault upon a customer of a hotel by a barmaid in the employ of the publican company was committed in the course of her employment  Dixon J said at     In my opinion  however  it is clear that  upon the case made for the plaintiff  a finding could not be supported that the barmaid acted in the course of her employment so that the defendant company would be vicariously liable  For upon the plaintiff s case the assault was as unexplained as it was unprovoked and might have proceeded from private spite on the part of the barmaid or from some other cause quite unconnected with her occupation or employment  So far as the plaintiff s case went to show  nothing occurred which would in any way relate her action to the duties of her office or explain it by reference to anything incidental to what she was employed to do   Williams J said at     The damage to the plaintiff was done by the glass  A barmaid who throws an empty glass at a customer is not doing an act of the class which she is employed to do  To throw the beer  much less the glass  at a customer is not a mode  although an improper mode  of serving a customer with beer  and even less a mode  although an improper mode  of answering his request for a glass of beer appliedNew South Wales v Lepore   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In New South Wales v Lepore   HCA         CLR   the majority of the High Court   Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne  and Callinan JJ  with McHugh J dissenting  held that the liability of a school authority  under its non delegable duty of care over the pupils  does not extend to intentional criminal conduct against a pupil by a teacher employed by the authority   Gummow and Hayne JJ  after referring to the judgment of Sir Owen Dixon in Deatons said  at       First  vicarious liability may exist if the wrongful act is done in intended pursuit of the employer s interests or in intended performance of the contract of employment  Secondly  vicarious liability may be imposed where the wrongful act is done in ostensible pursuit of the employer s business or in the apparent execution of authority which the employer holds out the employee as having      What unites those elements is the identification of what the employee is actually employed to do or is held out by the employer as being employed to do  It is the identification of what the employee was actually employed to do and held out as being employed to do that is central to any inquiry about course of employment   Mrs Barrick knew that Ms Holness was directing money to her bank account from Qantas Catering  She was sharing that money with Ms Holness  She knew that the monies being paid into her accounts by Qantas Catering were greatly in excess of the wages and other payments to which she was entitled  Her claim that she thought the monies included Ms Holness  pay is not true  Mrs Barrick cannot hold Qantas Catering liable for the arrangement she had with Ms Holness appliedByrne v Australian Airlines Limited     CLR   As the High Court make plain in Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited     CLR   at   damages is not available as a separate remedy   Because of the fraudulent scheme orchestrated by the pay mistress  Ms Holness  Qantas Catering did not comply with the requirements of cl  e  of the Award  in my opinion  This failure  however  does not avail Mrs Barrick  because  in my view  she received payslips which indicated what was being paid to her  or on her behalf  to her bank and other loan accounts  those monies were recorded in payslips which she received  and the monies exceeded the entitlements for the hours that she worked   None of the other causes of action has been made out
