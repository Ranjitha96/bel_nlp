federal ct  html  Section   of the ROC Act empowers a party to appeal to this Court  on a question of law  from a determination of the Tribunal  The appeal for which s   provides is a proceeding that comes before the Court for hearing and determination in the exercise of its original  rather than its appellate  jurisdiction  see Employers First v Tolhurst Capital Ltd   FCA         FCR     Employers First   at       per Branson J  The subject matter of an appeal brought pursuant to s   is the question or questions of law on which the appeal is brought  Employers First at       and see generally TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at   per Gummow J   Section   is directed to the nature of the trustee s decision  whereas s   is concerned with the nature of the complaint  see Employers First at        For the Tribunal to have jurisdiction  the decision complained of before the Tribunal must be one made  in relation to a particular member  and the complaint must not  relate to the management of a fund as a whole   The Tribunal determined that it had jurisdiction on the basis that  the Complaints relate to whether the  applicant  has acted appropriately in relation to these  respondents  accounts  not to members  accounts generally   The applicant contends that  by mistakenly asserting the existence of its jurisdiction  the Tribunal erred in law  Craig v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at     The applicant also submitted that the Complaints were excluded from the Tribunal s jurisdiction by s   as they were not relevantly distinguishable from a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of a fund  It relied on the statement by Branson J in Employers First at       that  a  clear example of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole would be a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of the fund    For the reasons set out below  I am satisfied that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to make the Determinations   Most  if not all  of the applicant s arguments on jurisdiction depend on the actions it took  adversely to the respondents  being characterised as a single decision in respect of all members of Division C of the Fund to set an interest rate applicable to members  account balances  The applicant denies that any implementation decisions were taken in relation to each member s account balance  rather  it asserts that the interest rate was applied to each member s account balance by a process more accurately described as an administrative or mechanical function  The necessary factual or evidentiary basis for these contentions is entirely absent   These conclusions are supported by the analysis in Employers First   In Employers First   the trustee issued member statements to a particular member  Mr Barratt  for the years ended   June     and   in which it calculated his retirement benefit by aggregating the defined benefit calculated under r   of the trust deed and the superannuation guarantee contributions that had been paid in respect of his membership of the fund  However  on Mr Barratt s retirement  the trustee notified him that the only lump sum retirement benefit to which he was entitled was that calculated under r   of the trust deed  In the course of her reasons  Branson J concluded that the retirement benefits to which Mr Barratt was entitled were only those prescribed by r   at        But  in the result  Branson J remitted the matter to the Tribunal for rehearing and determination on the ground that Mr Barratt had been denied procedural fairness in the course of the review process   Branson J held that the Tribunal s jurisdiction was not excluded by s    Her Honour said at          It appears that there is no judicial authority on the proper interpretation of s   of the  ROC Act   It seems clear  however  that the subsection is concerned with the nature of the complaint made under the section  rather than with the nature of the determination reached by the Tribunal on that complaint  A clear example of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole would be a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of the fund      In this case Mr Barratt complained about the amount of the lump sum retirement benefit to which the Trustee had decided that he was entitled on his retirement  Mr Barratt founded his complaint upon the Member Statements  The Member Statements were concerned with his particular entitlement under the Plan      I conclude that  on its proper construction  s   of the  ROC Act  did not prohibit the Tribunal from dealing with Mr Barratt s complaint  It is not necessary for me to hazard a comprehensive definition of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole within the meaning of s   of the  ROC Act    Before me  the applicant submitted that Employers First is distinguishable  Alternatively  it submitted that I should find that Branson J s observations concerning s   were wrong or need not be followed on the grounds that they were unnecessary to her decision  I reject these submissions   According to the applicant  Employers First can be distinguished on the basis that the gravamen of Mr Barratt s complaint was that he was entitled to receive a lump sum retirement benefit that was consistent with the information previously provided to him in member statements  at     whereas the gravamen of the respondents  Complaints is that the word  interest  in cl C     of the Deed bears a particular meaning such that it can only be positive  The applicant also submitted that it is unrealistic to characterise each respondent s Complaint as one relating to the debit applied to his or her individual account   In my opinion  the supposed distinctions are fallacious  Each respondent sought to review the applicant s decision to reduce his or her benefits by an amount that was variously said to be a negative investment return or negative interest  Each such decision related to the particular member and to his or her entitlements  That position is not altered or denied by the fact that the respondents argue that the applicant had no power under cl C     of the Deed to effect the debits to their accounts  or to apply a negative investment return or negative crediting rate to all deferred benefit members  Like Mr Barratt  the respondents complain about the amount of their benefits  as notified by member statements  More particularly  they complain that the applicant unlawfully reduced the amount of their benefits   The contention that Branson J s observations need not be followed because they were obiter dicta is unsound  Her Honour s conclusions concerning jurisdiction were integral to her decision and to the order she made remitting the matter back to the Tribunal for hearing and determination according to law   Another reason why s   is inapplicable is that  in my opinion  a Complaint that the Deed has been contravened in a way that directly and adversely affects the financial position of the particular member lodging the Complaint cannot be described as a complaint about  the management of a fund as a whole   This is so even if it be assumed that the Complaints should be characterised in the way the applicant contends  ie as relating only to the question whether the debiting of interest contravened cl C     of the Deed  If the Complaints are upheld and if the applicant has in fact debited interest in contravention of cl C     of the Deed  that action could hardly be described as one relating to the management of the Fund as a whole  The Complaints are substantive and genuine and the applicant did not suggest otherwise  It follows  in my view  that the nature of the Complaints is such that they fall squarely within the Tribunal s jurisdiction   The Tribunal concluded that the word  interest  in cl C     of the Deed does not  on its proper construction  contemplate  negative interest   It was common ground that this construction involves a question of law citedTNT Skypak

ATR   at   per Hedigan J citedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Association   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This approach is not very different from the modern approach to statutory construction  The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Association   HCA         CLR   at         per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ citedCollector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Ltd

approval the statement of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Maunsell v Olins   AC   who said at    Statutory language  like all language  is capable of an almost infinite gradation of  register   ie  it will be used at the semantic level appropriate to the subject matter and to the audience addressed  the man in the street  lawyers  merchants  etc   It is the duty of a court of construction to tune in to such register and so to interpret the statutory language as to give to it the primary meaning which is appropriate in that register  unless it is clear that some other meaning must be given in order to carry out the statutory purpose or to avoid injustice  anomaly  absurdity or contradiction   In other words  statutory language must always be given presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances    The notion of a practical and purposive approach to construction  rather than a detached and literal one  is entirely compatible with the view that language should be given presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances  I propose to approach the construction of the Deed  and the meaning of the word  interest  with these principles in mind   It is convenient to commence with the language  structure and purposes of cl C     of the Deed  Under cl C     a member who resigns his or her employment before attaining   years and who elects to accept a deferred retirement benefit  as each of the respondents did  thereupon becomes entitled to a retirement benefit calculated under cl C     of the Deed  The structure of paragraphs  a  and  b  of cl C     makes it plain that the deferred retirement benefit falls  due  when the employee makes his or her election  However  the benefit does not become payable before the member attains the age of   years  unless one of the conditions set out in cl C    b  is met  This may explain why Mr Poulter s member statement for the year ended   June   referred to his benefit as a  vested benefit    Under cl C    a  the member is entitled to interest   on the amount of that retirement benefit from the date on which that benefit falls due until the date it is paid   my emphasis   The words  the amount of that retirement benefit  refer to a fixed and ascertained sum  namely the benefit referred to in subcl   that has been calculated under cl C     as at the date upon which the member made his or her election citedAdams v Paul s Properties Ltd   NZLR   There is no definition of  interest  in the Deed  As a matter of ordinary language  interest

with caution  see Houssein v Under Secretary  Department of Industrial Relations   Technology  NSW      CLR   at   per Stephen  Mason  Aickin  Wilson and Brennan JJ  see also the authorities collected in Pearce and Geddes  Statutory Interpretation in Australia   supra  at paras           Bearing these reservations in mind and recognising the need to proceed with caution  I have concluded that the contrast between cl C     and these other provisions is capable of providing some support  albeit in a very subsidiary way  for the construction of cl C     that I prefer  The short point is that the drafters of the Deed could have specifically included a provision in cl C     entitling the applicant to deduct negative interest  as defined  from a member s deferred retirement benefit  but they did not do so  However  given the history of the LAS Act and the Deed and the way in which different divisions have been introduced at different times to accommodate different sub schemes  I would treat the point very cautiously   The applicant also sought  somewhat inconsistently  to gather some support for its construction of cl C     from these other provisions  It pointed out that each of cll B     D     G     and H     provided for a crediting of interest at the declared rate  if positive  and a debiting of interest at the declared rate  if negative   It submitted that these provisions show that the Deed contemplates the concept of negative interest  In my opinion  these provisions do not assist the proper construction of cl C      They simply show that it is possible to adopt special definitions that alter the ordinary meaning of a word such as  interest  and to use those definitions for specified purposes
