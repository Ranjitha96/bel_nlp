Health World Limited v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAldi Stores Limited Partnership v Frito Lay Trading GmbH     IPR   The same differences are created by an aural comparison  Here  stress and pronunciation would usually given to the first syllable of the word or mark  see for example Aldi Stores Limited Partnership v Frito Lay Trading GmbH     IPR   at         Thus  an aural comparison of the marks by the person of ordinary intelligence and memory would bear out the impression that Health Plus is concerned with enhanced general health whereas Inner Health Plus invokes improved internal health   I reject Health World s submission that the Health Plus mark should be characterised as two words  at least in a visual sense  Although the word   Plus   is italicised  the usual impression is plainly of one word appliedAristoc Limited v Rysta Limited     RPC   The function of a trade mark is to give an indication to a purchaser as to the manufacture or quality of the goods and an indication of the trade source from which the goods come or through which they pass on their way to market  Aristoc Limited v Rysta Limited     RPC   at       Here  whatever the subjective intentions of the Shin family may have been  the public face of the Health Plus trade mark was that of Nature s Hive  It was

nsw supreme ct  html  In Australian Co operative Foods v Norco Co operative   NSWSC         NSWLR   at     Bryson J took a wide view of the operation of s  c   His Honour proceeded on the basis that the ground is available if the use of the mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion for any reason   In Norco   Bryson J was of the view that there was no likelihood of deception because the packaging of the goods accurately identified the source of the goods and the registered owner of the trade mark  Norco at     In the present case  Health World points to the evidence which discloses that at the date of the commencement of the rectification proceedings  the Health Plus trade mark was used to identify the goods as those of Nature s Hive  and not those of Shin Sun  I will deal with this below   This would give rise to the likelihood of deception or cause confusion because of the failure to identify the registered owner as the source of the goods   Pending consideration of s  c  by a Full Court  or by the High Court  it seems to me that I should follow the approach adopted by Bryson J in Norco   On that basis the s  c  ground is enlivened by the failure to distinguish the Health Plus products as goods of Shin Sun   In dealing  later in my judgment  with Health World s non use application  I give six reasons why the Health Plus trade mark is used to identify the goods as those of Nature s Hive   In summary  the effect of the evidence was that Shin Sun s name has never appeared on the packaging and Nature s Hive procured the manufacture of the products appliedAustralian Woollen Mills Limited v FS Walton   Co Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  These principles are well established  They were stated by Dixon and McTiernan JJ more than   years ago in Australian Woollen Mills Limited v FS Walton   Co Limited   HCA         CLR   at   and reiterated by the High Court in other authorities   Perhaps the most succinct statement of the principles is to be found in the observation of Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills at   that the question is        never susceptible of much discussion  It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs   The Health Plus mark was not being used as at   May    Thus  the comparison which is to be made for the purposes of s   is between the unregistered mark Inner Health Plus and the Health Plus registered trade mark   In my opinion the Health Plus trade mark was not deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark for the reasons set out below distinguishedCA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited     IPR   Those authorities  as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited     IPR   and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited   FCA         FCR   were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron s at       There was nothing to suggest that Shin Sun exercised quality control in the way in which the executors of the estate of Cyril Henschke exercised control over the Henschke partnership  Henschke at     Nor did Shin Sun exercise  financial control  over Nature s Hive s trading activities within the meaning of s    This is because  in my view  the financial control to which the subsection is directed is a legally enforceable power of control which did not exist between Shin Sun and Nature s Hive   Ms Shin s evidence was that Nature s Hive did not have a bank account  I accept this evidence but it does not follow that Shin Sun exercised financial control within the meaning of s    What that subsection requires is evidence of the exercise of financial control over trading activities  perhaps in the way in which a parent company may exercise control over a wholly owned subsidiary  Here  there was no such relationship and any control by Shin Sun was revocable  Henschke at     Nature s Hive and Shin Sun have different shareholders  They have common directors but that has only been the position since July    Of course  in a practical sense  it may be unlikely that Ms Shin would remove her parents as directors of Nature s Hive  But that is not an answer to the separate corporate identity of Shin Sun and the power of Ms Shin as the majority shareholder to revoke any exercise of control flowing from common directorships   The  control  which is contemplated by s   would seem to be as wide as the  connection in the course of trade  to which Aickin J referred in Pioneer at    His Honour said that the connection may be slight  such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary  see also Henschke at     Section   confers a broad discretion on the Court  Henschke at    The discretion is conferred so as to give the Court a sufficient degree of flexibility to give effect to public interest considerations  Ritz Hotel at       In Henschke   the Full Court declined to interfere with the primary judge s exercise of discretion in a manner favourable to the registered proprietor under s    However  I do not consider that the approach taken in that case assists Shin Sun because the primary judge found that there was no public interest adversely affected by the use of the mark  see at     In my view  Henschke was concerned with a very distinctive family business where the members of the family who were using the mark were the persons who gave the mark its value  That was why the primary judge could see no useful purpose to be served by removing the mark so as to compel a fresh application to be made by the  Henschke interests   Accordingly  I would not exercise my discretion in favour of Shin Sun in the present proceedings   Section   in the form in which it stood when Health World filed its non use application provided that a person aggrieved

deceptively similar to INNER HEALTH PLUS   Accordingly  subject to what I say below about the s   ground  which Health World relies upon under s  a  and the s  c  ground  I do not consider that Health

proceeded on the basis that the Act applies as it stood at the time of the hearing  However  the general rule of the common law  and the effect of s   of the Acts Interpretation Act   is that    when the law is altered during the pendency of an action the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun  unless the new statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights  see Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein   Bro Inc   HCA         CLR   at   per Kitto J   All three of the proceedings described were commenced prior to the commencement of the Trade Marks Amendment Act    Cth  on   October    The rectification proceeding was commenced on   February    Health World s non use application was commenced on   July    Shin Sun s non use application was commenced on   September    Thus in the absence of a clear legislative intention to the contrary  the provisions of the Act apply as they stood prior to the   amendments  The relevant provisions are set out below  in their pre amendment form   Section   of the Act deals with the use of a trade mark  It provides      Use of trade mark       If the Registrar or a prescribed court  having regard to the circumstances of a particular case  thinks fit  the Registrar or the court may decide that a person has used a trade mark if it is established that the person has used the trade mark with additions or alterations that do not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark        To avoid any doubt  it is stated that  if a trade mark consists of the following  or any combination of the following  namely  any letter  word  name or numeral  any aural representation of the trade mark is  for the purposes of this Act  a use of the trade mark        An authorised use of a trade mark by a person  see section   is taken  for the purposes of this Act  to be a use of the trade mark by the owner of the trade mark      In this Act      use of a trade mark in relation to

of the Act defines the expression  deceptively similar   The opposed mark must so nearly resemble the other mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  The authorities dealing with the question of whether one trade mark is deceptively similar to another were reviewed by a Full Court of this Court in Crazy Ron s Communications Pty Limited v Mobileworld Communications Pty Limited     IPR   at  ff   The Full Court in Crazy Ron s distilled five legal principles from the many authorities which have dealt with this subject  Their Honours were dealing with the question of deceptive similarity in the context of trade mark infringement but the same principles apply to the test of deceptive similarity in s   as it stood in May     It is unnecessary to set out the five principles stated in Crazy Ron s   It is sufficient to say that the marks are not to be judged by a side by side comparison  they are to be considered by their look and sound  with due allowance for imperfect recollection  The goods to which the marks are to be applied must be considered together with all the surrounding circumstances   Those authorities  as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited     IPR   and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited   FCA         FCR   were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron s at       The effect of those authorities is that the enquiry is not as wide as would be undertaken in a passing off action or in a proceeding under s   of the Trade Practices Act   Rather  the search is to be concentrated on ascertaining the essential element of the mark and the impression taken away by one who looks at it and how it sounds when pronounced  Crazy Ron s at       The essential element of the Inner Health Plus mark is not found in the words  Health Plus   Rather  as I have already said  the idea or essential feature of Inner Health Plus is that it is concerned with internal health  Health Plus embraces a different concept   To the extent that any notoriety of Inner Health Plus is to be taken into account  consumers must be taken to be familiar with it as an improved and more convenient version of Inner Health powder  Crazy Ron s at     Furthermore  there is no tangible danger of deception or confusion  Crazy Ron s at    The Inner Health Plus product and the goods encompassed by the Health Plus trade mark have their own separate attributes  They may be recommended by health professionals  Their purchase is likely to be a considered decision after close appraisal and consideration  Health professionals are usually careful to listen and ensure that their customers select the correct product referred tode Cordova v Vick Chemical Co     RPC   I do not consider that the Health Plus mark

Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd     IPR   The power to order rectification under s   is expressed in discretionary terms  However  in EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Branson J expressed the view that the terms of s   suggest that s   does not vest a true discretion in the Court   In my opinion  there is force in Branson J s view because s   is subject to s   and s   confers a discretion  to be exercised in limited circumstances  not to grant an application for rectification  Nevertheless  this approach has not been taken in other courts  see eg  Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymbaree Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited   FCA   at    appliedFisher v Hebburn Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As Fullagar J stated in Fisher v Hebburn Limited   HCA         CLR   at   a statute is  prima facie   to be construed as not attaching new legal consequences to facts or events which occurred before the commencement of the statute   In my view  Shin Sun s approach to statutory construction is correct  although more accurately it ought to be based on s  a  as it stood when the rectification proceeding was commenced on   February    On that date  s  a  enlivened the power to order rectification of the register on  any of the grounds on which registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under Division   of Part    The pre amendment form of s  a  still requires s   to be applied as it stood when the trade mark was filed on   May    The significance of applying the pre amendment form rather than current form of s  a  is that Health World is precluded from relying on the  contrary to law  ground under s    that provision not being found in Division   of Part     For all these reasons  it follows  in my opinion  that the ground of opposition based upon deceptive similarity is to be determined under s   in its pre amended form referred toHealth World Limited v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd     IPR   In December   Health World filed notice of opposition to the Health Plus trade mark relying inter alia on the ground contained in s    The Registrar of Trade Marks dismissed the opposition but Health World appealed to the Federal Court under s   of the Act  The appeal was heard by Cooper J  His Honour determined the appeal adversely to Health World  see Health World Limited v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd     IPR   referred toHealth World Limited v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The present proceedings are  of course  not an appeal from Cooper J  Nor is Health World estopped from asserting that the Health Plus mark was deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus trade mark at   May   even though Cooper J found on the balance of probabilities that the Health Plus mark was not deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark as at that date  see Health World v Shin Sun  per Cooper J  at     Health World Limited v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     The proceedings before me consist of three separate applications  In the first  Health World seeks expungement of the Health Plus mark under ss  a  and  c  of the Act  This proceeding is sometimes referred to as the rectification proceeding   Section  a  provides that an application for cancellation or removal of a mark may be made on any of the grounds on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under the Act  The grounds on which Health World relies in the rectification proceeding are those contained in ss       and      Indeed  the entire thrust of Health World s launch of the Inner Health Plus capsules was to take advantage of the reputation of the Inner Health Powder and the goodwill attaching to it  This is graphically revealed in Mr Joiner s evidence in the proceedings before Cooper J  as put to Mr Joiner by counsel for Shin Sun in cross examination in the present proceedings  The relevant passage is as follows    I did not want to discontinue the Inner Health line as it had been and was still a successful product  I believed that the fact that Inner Health was an established product in its field gave Health World an excellent opportunity to introduce a new type of probiotic product similar to the existing Inner Health product but in an improved version which could be launched onto the market  My plan was to take advantage of the goodwill which had already been built up in the Inner Health brand   I understood Mr Joiner to accept the accuracy of this evidence when it was put to him in cross examination before me  In any event  its accuracy is fully supported by the promotional and advertising material referred to above   It is true that when Inner Health Plus capsules were introduced they contained bifidobacteria which were not an ingredient of Inner Health powder at that time  But that does not distinguish the reputation of Inner Health Plus from its predecessor   Second  this approach to construction is consistent with the scheme of the Act as discussed by a Full Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   AIPC     at    The Full Court there observed that opposition proceedings are quasi summary and an unsuccessful opponent will have the opportunity to bring an expungement application if the opposition proceeding fails  see also the authorities to which I referred in Health World Limited v Shin Sun Australia Pty Limited   FCA   at         and   referred toIn the Matter of Powell s Trade Mark     RPC

with reasonable certainty  a statute changing the law is not to be understood as applying to facts that have already occurred so as to confer or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law has defined by reference to past events  Maxwell v Murphy   HCA         CLR   at   per Dixon CJ referred toMayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my opinion  there is force in Branson J s view because s   is subject to s   and s   confers a discretion  to be exercised in limited circumstances  not to grant an application for rectification  Nevertheless  this approach has not been taken in other courts  see eg  Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymbaree Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited   FCA   at    appliedNew South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co operative Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to the exercise of discretion under s   the guiding principles would seem to be those that were referred to in the authorities under the   Act  The principal factors would therefore seem to be the public interest and the respective contributions made by the parties to the proceedings in creating the likelihood that the use of the registered mark would deceive or cause confusion  New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co operative Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan J   In my view  these factors point against the exercise of the discretion so that even if I may withhold relief under s   I would not exercise my discretion to do so  In short  it seems to me that the public interest is better served by expunging a mark that has become deceptive in the circumstances of this case   Even though I am satisfied that Health World has made out the grounds for rectification under s  a   the s   ground  and s  c  in my view it does not have standing to seek the relief because it is not an aggrieved person   As I said above  I do not consider that Health World has any genuine desire to use the Health Plus mark  Accordingly  I am not satisfied that it has a real interest in having the Health Plus mark removed  Nor would it be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the mark remains on the register   By reason of my findings on the questions of the reputation of Inner Health Plus and deceptive similarity  I reject the claims of contravention of the Trade Practices Act and passing off against both Shin Sun and Nature s Hive appliedPhilip Morris Products SA v Sean Ngu   ATMO  http www austlii edu au au cases cth ATMO  html  However  there is authority for the proposition that where an applicant for registration has been put on notice that its intention to use the mark was in issue  and has not responded to the opponent s evidence  a finding of lack of intention may be made  Philip Morris

cases cth HCA  html  In Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks   HCA         CLR   at   Aickin J recognised that a mark may be used to indicate a connection with an unidentified person  His Honour said that in those circumstances it must indicate a connection with both the proprietor and the user   In my opinion  that requirement is not satisfied as a matter of fact because the evidence does not demonstrate any connection between the actual use of the mark and the registered proprietor  Shin Sun   Nevertheless  Shin Sun contends that s  c  is not enlivened because Nature s Hive s use of the mark was under the control of Shin Sun so that Nature s Hive was an  authorised user  within the meaning of s   of the Act   However  s   and s   do not limit the meaning of the expression  under the control of  the owner of the trade mark in s   see s    It is therefore necessary to deal with the question of whether Shin Sun exercised quality or financial control over Nature s Hive s use of the mark  or whether it controlled the use in the broad sense referred to by Aickin J in Pioneer at     There is no evidence before me that Shin Sun has exercised quality control over the Health Plus products manufactured for Nature s Hive and supplied under Nature s Hive s packaging   Indeed  in my view  the evidence establishes that Nature s Hive has the relevant obligations of quality control under the Therapeutic Goods Act   Nature s Hive is the sponsor and the certificate of listing for the goods imposes the obligation of quality control on Nature s Hive   The  control  which is contemplated by s   would seem to be as wide as the  connection in the course of trade  to which Aickin J referred in Pioneer at    His Honour said that the connection may be slight  such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary  see also Henschke at     However  Aickin J observed in Pioneer at   that it is essential that the user maintains the connection of the registered proprietor with the goods  That connection is not established on the facts of the present case   It follows in my view that Nature s Hive was not an authorised user of the mark  It also follows that the use of the Health Plus trade mark was likely to deceive or cause confusion within the meaning of s  c  of the Act appliedRegistrar

amended form of the section applies  Health World would not succeed in its application for rectification on this ground   Section  a  as amended would be enlivened because Inner Health Plus had acquired the necessary reputation  But the causal link required under s  b  would not be made out  This is because the reputation of Inner Health Plus was that of a more potent and convenient form of Inner Health powder referred toRhone Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Limited     FCR   Nor do I accept that the letter of   April   from Shin Sun s solicitors constitutes an

to which McLelland J referred in the Ritz Hotel case at       Ms Shin  in her affidavit of   December   stated that Shin Sun conceived the Health Plus mark and that she had taken certain steps on behalf of that company which were consistent with an intention  as at   May   for Shin Sun to use the mark   However  the overall effect of her evidence was that she failed to distinguish between the two separate corporate entities  Shin Sun and Nature s Hive  I cannot be satisfied  and I find that she did not pay attention to which corporation she was representing when she took the steps that she relies upon to support the assertion that Shin Sun intended to use the mark   Section   confers a broad discretion on the Court  Henschke at    The discretion is conferred so as to give the Court a
