Reference may be made also to Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   Anor   ATPR referred toGoldsmith v Sandilands   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  ANZ seeks particulars in two categories   a  particulars of the oral Representations pleaded in paras    A              and   of the ASC  and   b  in respect of each of the subparagraphs of para  D of the ASC  the factual matters said to give rise to the alleged failure on the part of ANZ  In Goldsmith v Sandilands   HCA         ALR   at   Gleeson CJ stated    The facts in issue in a civil action case emerged from the pleadings  which  in turn  are framed in the light of the legal principles governing the case  Facts relevant to facts in issue emerge from the particulars and the evidence  The function of particulars is not to expand the issues defined by the pleadings  but  to fill in the picture of the plaintiff s cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial    Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd     KB   at        Particulars of the Representations pleaded in paras    A              and   of the ASC  In relation to each of the Representations pleaded in the paragraphs identified  ANZ seeks an order that the applicants specify       a  whether the Representation is alleged to have been made orally  and   b  if it is alleged that the Representation was made orally   i  when it was made   ii  by whom it was made             iii  to whom it was made             c  whether the Representation is alleged to have been of a present fact or as to an opinion   I do not think that ANZ is entitled to require the applicants to categorise the alleged Representations as being as to present fact or as to an opinion  No doubt  there will be submissions on the final hearing as to the proper characterisation of particular Representations for the purpose of s  A of the TP Act and s  BB of the ASIC Act   but I do not think that characterisation at this stage is necessary in order to enable ANZ to file its defence referred toHungerfords v Walker   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In principle there is no difficulty in the applicants complaining that  having been induced by ANZ s misleading or deceptive conduct to enter into the Transaction  they lost all the money they paid at the time of doing so  and there is no difficulty in the applicants seeking to recover that money with interest  whether based on Hungerfords v Walker   HCA         CLR   or otherwise  However  the ASC should plead facts showing that the applicants claim that they got nothing in return for the money paid  It is not suggested  for example  that Newco did not become legally indebted to Geomar for the sum of   which it lent to Newco on   May    I presume that immediately following the loan  Newco was able to repay it  Some facts to the effect that Newco ceased to be able to repay the loan at some time should be pleaded    The amounts claimed by the applicants  Paras   and   of the ASC set out the amounts claimed by  the Chapmans   the ASC uses that expression to refer to the applicants   ANZ complains that para   of the ASC is embarrassing because it asserts that the applicants  without distinguishing between them  claim the amount of       In their submissions  the applicants reply that the letter dated   November   from Atanaskovic Hartnell  coupled with the Substitute Table  that is annexed to these reasons for judgment  adequately identifies the amounts claimed by the respective applicants referred toMultigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   Anor   ATPR  I will not discuss the legal principles governing the adequacy of a pleading  I discussed them in Collex Waste Management Pty Ltd v Waste Recycling   Processing Service of New South Wales   FCA   and Australian Automotive Repairers  Association  Political Action Committee  Inc v NRMA Insurance Ltd   FCA    Reference may be made also to Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   Anor   ATPR referred toPolice and Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rowson  WA  Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It has been suggested that in contemporary commercial litigation  where there will inevitably be a direction for the filing and service of affidavits or witness statements  the necessity for lengthy particulars may be viewed with disfavour  Police and Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rowson  WA  Pty Ltd   FCA   at      I have read carefully paras    A              and   of the ASC and I am of the view that the particulars already provided are adequate  In each case  it is said that in so far as the Representations in question were oral  they were made in  a conversation   a discussion   various discussions  or  several discussions  between a named person on behalf of ANZPE and one or more named persons on behalf of the applicants  As well  either a particular date or a confined period is stated   I do not think that ANZ needs more to enable it to file its defence
