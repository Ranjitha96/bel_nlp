citedCommissioner of Taxation v Linter Textiles Australia Limited  In liquidation    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The making of a winding up order changes the control of the affairs of a corporation but does not affect its beneficial ownership of its assets  Commissioner of Taxation v Linter Textiles Australia Limited  In liquidation    HCA         CLR   at         In this regard  the position with respect to corporate insolvency differs from that which prevails in respect of the administration of an individual s bankrupt estate  The effect of s  a  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  is that  when a debtor becomes a bankrupt either by the making of a sequestration order or upon the acceptance of a debtor s petition by the Official Receiver  the property of the bankrupt vests forthwith in the Official Trustee or  if there be a registered trustee of the bankrupt s estate  in that registered trustee   When on   July   this Court ordered the winding up of PMD and appointed Mr Greig as its liquidator he did not become the beneficial owner of Lot    Title to that Lot remained vested in the corporation  It was PMD  not its liquidator  which came to sell Lot    Further  insofar as PMD might be thought then to have been in the business of property development  that business  after Mr Greig decided that it ought to be continued for a short time for the purpose of best preserving and then realising Lot   as an asset of that corporation  remained the business of the corporation  s  a  of the Corporations Act   It did not upon liquidation become Mr Greig s business  Contrary to the submission of the Commissioner  there is no support for any contrary conclusion to be found in s     of the GST Act   It was no more Mr Greig s business than it was not that of the directors of PMD prior to the making of the winding up order  Indeed  I did not understand the Commissioner to suggest that  before the winding up order  s     made PMD s business that of its directors  The only business relevantly conducted by Mr Grieg was the practise of his profession as an official liquidator  which included undertaking the liquidation of PMD  As will be seen  when acting in that latter capacity  he constituted an  entity  and  you  for the purposes of the GST Act  If does not follow from his possession of that status that he is liable to GST in respect of the sale of Lot   citedCommissioner of Taxation v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A description  which I gratefully adopt  of the general scheme of the GST Act in respect of liability to GST and a summary of some presently pertinent provisions is to be found in the recent judgement of the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd   HCA         ALJR   at       to   The GST       Provision respecting the assessment and payment of the GST is made by the statute styled A New Tax System  Goods and Services Tax  Act    Cth   the Act    An important point respecting the nature of the GST was made as follows by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation    FCAFC         FCR   at                In economic terms it may be correct to call the GST a consumption tax  because the effective burden falls on the ultimate consumer  But as a matter of legal analysis what is taxed  that is to say what generates the tax liability  and the obligations of recording and reporting  is not consumption but a particular form of transaction  namely supply                  By way of contrast to the Australian system  counsel for the Commissioner referred to Art   of the first Council directive  Directive   on the harmonisation of legislation of member states of the European Community concerning turnover taxes  this indicates that VAT is a general tax on the consumption of goods and services       Section     of the Act relevantly states that GST is payable on  taxable supplies   The use of the asterisk is a device to alert the reader to the presence of a definition in the Dictionary to the Act    Section     answers a question  what are taxable supplies  posed by a hypothetical taxpayer  by stating that  you make a taxable supply   if  among other criteria not presently relevant   you make the supply for  consideration             The composite expression  a taxable supply  is of critical importance for the creation of liability to GST   In the facts and circumstances of a given case there may be disclosed consecutive acts each of which answers the statutory description of  supply  but upon examination it may appear that there is no more than one  taxable supply             The meaning of  supply  is given in s     and in addition to the general words  any form of supply  in s     par  d  of s     includes  a grant  assignment or surrender of  real property  and  real property  is defined  In the Dictionary provision of s      expansively as including             a  any interest in or right over land  or    b  a personal right to call for or be granted any interest in or right over land  or    c  a licence to occupy land or any other contractual right exercisable over or in relation to land                         Further  par  g  of s     includes  an entry into     an obligation     to do anything       The term  consideration  is defined in par  a  of s     as including             any payment  or any act or forbearance  in connection with a supply of anything               The payment  act or forbearance may be voluntary and need not be by the recipient of the supply  s           The amount of GST on a taxable supply is   per cent of  the value of the taxable supply   s     and in the present case this was assessed as being the consideration represented by the forfeited deposit            Division   lays down rules for the attribution to a tax period of the GST payable on a taxable supply  The general rule  s     is that the supplier becomes liable to pay GST on the earlier of two events  namely the receipt by the supplier of any of the consideration for the taxable supply  and the issue of an invoice relating to that supply  in the present case no invoice was issued by the taxpayer and the only relevant event was the receipt of the alleged consideration       Emphasis added in quotation of paragraph   footnote references incorporated into text of quote for reasons of different style requirements  Given its  critical importance for the creation of liability to GST  it is as well to set out in full the text of s     of the GST Act         Taxable supplies You make a taxable supply if       a  you make the supply for  consideration  and   b  the supply is made in the course or furtherance of an  enterprise that you  carry on  and   c  the supply is  connected with Australia  and   d  you are  registered  or  required to be registered      However  the supply is not a  taxable supply to the extent that it is  GST free or  input taxed   Reading the passage quoted from Reliance Carpet and s     and seized with the knowledge that an order for the winding up of a corporation does not vest its property in its liquidator one might  without more  think that the answer to the question posed in this case was clear  the sale of Lot   could only be a supply by PMD  not by Mr Greig  That is because the  supply  of Lot   was  prima facie   made by PMD and it was that corporation  not Mr Greig  to which the consideration for the sale of Lot   was payable and paid under the contract   This position is submitted by the Commissioner to be affected by the operation of Div   of the GST Act in a way which renders Mr Greig personally liable for the GST payable in respect of the sale of Lot     The nature of the Commissioner s submission is such that the whole of Division   should be set out  Division    Representatives of incapacitated entities         What this Division is about     Representatives of incapacitated entities may be required to register for GST purposes          Representatives are required to be registered           A  representative of an  incapacitated entity is required to be registered in that capacity if the incapacitated entity is  registered or  required to be registered     This section has effect despite section      which is about who is required to be registered          Cancellation of registration of a representative       The Commissioner must cancel the  registration of a  representative of an  incapacitated entity if the Commissioner is satisfied that the representative is not  required to be registered in that capacity      Note  Cancelling the registration of a representative under this subsection is a reviewable GST decision  see Subdivision   F in Schedule   to the Taxation Administration Act            The Commissioner must notify the  representative of the cancellation     Sections     and     do not apply to the cancellation of the  registration of a  representative of an  incapacitated entity          Notice of cessation of representation A  representative who ceases to be a representative of an  incapacitated entity must notify the Commissioner of that cessation  in the  approved form  within   days after so ceasing      Adjustments   If         a  an  adjustment relates to a supply  acquisition or importation that an  incapacitated entity made before a  representative of the incapacitated entity was appointed  and            b  the adjustment arises after that appointment  and            c  in the case of an  increasing adjustment  the representative gives the Commissioner written notice that   i  states that the adjustment has arisen in these circumstances  and   ii  specifies the amount of the adjustment            the adjustment is to be treated as if   d  the representative did not have the adjustment  and   e  the incapacitated entity had the adjustment     This section has effect despite section        which is about the effect of adjustments on net amounts           Tax periods of representatives       If a  representative of an  incapacitated entity is required to be registered in that capacity  the tax periods applying to the representative in that capacity are the same tax periods that apply to the incapacitated entity     This section has effect despite Division    which is about how to work out the tax periods that apply  distinguishedCooper Brookes  Wollongong  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA           CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Cooper Brookes  Wollongong  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA           CLR   was referred to in the course of the Commissioner s submissions as providing an alternative basis upon which to find that a liquidator was personally liable for post liquidation supplies  No doubt if the literal meaning of any of the provisions within Div   produced an irrational or absurd result this case might be called in aid so as to prefer an alternative construction  especially if that construction was evidently intended by an amending Act having regard to the history of the legislation  The difficulty here though is not with the literal meaning of statutory provisions but with the complete absence of basal deeming provisions necessary to achieve the end of rendering a liquidator personally liable in a way which is contrary to the position prevailing under both the general law and the ordinary position under s       Within the GST Act it is s     not any of those in Div   which is the leading provision  The elements within s     are cumulative  To require a liquidator to register is to bring that official within but one of the four elements that cumulatively comprise a  taxable supply  so far as a post liquidation sale of property of the corporation is concerned  The registration requirement does not carry with it the other three  To regard Div   as achieving this is to give its provisions a weight that their language cannot bear  especially so as to create a counter intuitive taxation liability on the part of a liquidator   As the GST Act presently stands  the effect of requiring a liquidator of a corporation to register will be that any supplies which the liquidator makes in that  representative  capacity in the event that any property of the corporation is ordered to be vested in him will become a  taxable supply  by him in that capacity  otherwise the disposal of the property of a corporation  insofar as that constitutes a supply for the purposes of the GST Act  will remain a taxable supply by the corporation and have to be accounted for and paid by it accordingly citedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Broadbeach Properties Pty Ltd   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  No assessment has been raised by the Commissioner in respect of the GST said to owed to the Commonwealth by the liquidator personally as a result of the post liquidation sale of Lot    In these proceedings the tender of such an assessment would have been conclusive evidence of that liability

the language of an enactment does not translate into law a meaning and effect that one might apprehend from secondary materials was intended it is for the Parliament to rectify that by further legislative provision citedHepples v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA           CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  These are not the only principles of statutory construction which are at large in this case  The GST Act is a taxing statute  Giving full measure to the reminders offered in Project Blue Sky v ABA   it remains the case  in my opinion  that the subjection of a person to tax by Parliament requires clarity of language  not inexactitude or indirect references  Especially that is so where the asserted subjection of a particular person to tax is counter intuitive to what one might expect having regard to the prevailing general law position and the otherwise usual incidence of the tax in question  I conceive that the following passage from the judgment of Deane J in Hepples v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA           CLR   at     is indicative of the contemporary approach to take to the construction of a taxing statute  There has been a marked  and justifiable  tendency in recent times for the courts to construe taxation provisions as being directed to the substance as well as the form of transactions to an extent which previously would have been thought to be inconsistent with statements of high authority in cases such as Partington v  The Attorney General   LR   HL   at p   and Inland Revenue Commissioners v  The Duke of Westminster   AC     at pp            Nonetheless  at least in cases where tax avoidance is not involved and where the substance of relevant transactions is not concealed by artificialities of form  the basic  principles of statutory construction  of taxing provisions remain those identified and explained by Rich and Dixon JJ  in their joint judgment in Anderson v  Commissioner of Taxes  Vict     HCA         CLR     at p    It is appropriate to repeat what their Honours there said        In Brunton v  Commissioner of Stamp Duties   AC     at p   Lord Parker of Waddington  speaking for the Privy Council  says   The intention to impose a tax or duty  or to increase a tax or duty already imposed  must be shown by clear and unambiguous language and cannot be inferred from ambiguous words   This rule he again emphasized in Attorney General v  Milne   AC     at p   where he said  in the House of Lords   The Finance Act is a taxing statute  and if the Crown claims a duty thereunder it must show that such duty is imposed by clear and unambiguous words   In Ormond Investment Co  v  Betts   AC     at p   Lord Buckmaster  although differing from the majority of their Lordships and holding that in the particular case the Crown had satisfied the burden lying upon it  described the rule as a  cardinal principle     a principle well known to the common law that has not been and ought not to be weakened   namely  that the imposition of a tax must be in plain terms   He added   The subject ought not to be involved in these liabilities by an elaborate process of hair splitting arguments   Lord Atkinson  who agreed in the decision of the House  expressed the rule as follows  at p    It is well established that one is bound  in construing Revenue Acts  to give a fair and reasonable construction to their language without leaning to one side or the other  that no tax can be imposed on a subject by an Act of Parliament without words in it clearly showing an intention to lay the burden upon him  that the words of the statute must be adhered to  and that so called equitable constructions of them are not permissible    Before proceeding to a more detailed consideration of the provisions of the GST Act it is instructive to consider some aspects of the general position of liquidators   When a corporation is being wound up in insolvency  the liquidator s duty is to take into his custody or under his control all of the property to which the corporation is or appears to be entitled  s   of the Corporations Act   Control of the corporation concerned is removed from the hands of its director or directors and vested in the liquidator for the purposes of the winding up of the corporation in insolvency in accordance with the provisions of the Corporations Act   s  A  of the Corporations Act  citedOil Basins Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Where an assessment has not been made  this Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief in an appropriate case against the Commissioner in respect of a Commonwealth revenue law controversy  s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act    Cth  Oil Basins Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR    Thus  even though the relief sought by the liquidator  insofar as declaratory relief is sought against the Deputy Commissioner  might be thought to extend beyond the bounds of the provision of directions under the Corporations Act   there is ample jurisdiction nonetheless to grant it  As to the cross claim for declaratory relief made by the Deputy Commissioner  s  B A a  of the Judiciary Act is a source of jurisdiction   Jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is one thing  whether or not as a matter of discretion such relief ought to be granted is another  The Taxation Administration Act   makes comprehensive provision for the resolution of Commonwealth revenue law controversies  That Act contemplates that  ordinarily  the Commissioner s view of the meaning and application of a Commonwealth revenue law will be reflected in an assessment with the recipient of the assessment then being granted  by the provisions of Part IVC of that Act  a right of objection and  if dissatisfied with the Commissioner s objection decision  an ability to challenge the objection decision either by way of review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  AAT  or on a so called  appeal  heard in the original jurisdiction of this Court   Unlike income tax  where liability to pay that tax is not complete until the making of an assessment  liability to pay GST is not dependent on the making of an assessment by the Commissioner  Even so  by s     in Sch   the Taxation Administration Act anticipates that a person whom the Commissioner asserts to be subject to a liability to GST may require the Commissioner to make an assessment  thereby initiating the process that may lead to external merits review by the AAT or the exercise of original jurisdiction by this Court in a taxation appeal citedMuroa Pty Ltd v O Meara     ACLC   It is possible for a liquidator to secure from this Court or another invested with jurisdiction under the Corporations Act an order vesting in him in his official capacity some or all of the property of a corporation being wound up in insolvency  s   of the Corporations Act   However  as is noted in the definitive Australian text on corporate insolvency law  McPherson s Law of Company Liquidation  p     such applications are uncommon given the wide powers conferred on liquidators by the Corporations Act   At least in some jurisdictions  one circumstance which might prompt a liquidator to seek such an order is a need in the course of a liquidation to lodge a caveat  Re Application by the Liquidator of Haupiri Courts Ltd   NZLR   Muroa Pty Ltd v O Meara     ACLC   citedPlatypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   In this case  exceptionally  it seems to me appropriate  as a matter of discretion  not to withhold the granting of declaratory relief  I do so for these reasons  The declaratory relief has been sought in this Court  which unlike these days a State or Territory Supreme Court  is the usual forum for the resolution of Commonwealth revenue law liability controversies  The point raised is novel  controversial not only between the parties but evidently also in academic literature  see Anderson and Morrison  GST and Insolvency Practitioner Liability  Who are you      Revenue LJ   and one of pervasive significance to corporate insolvency administration  The latter factor was recognised by the Deputy Commissioner in submissions and evidenced by his disposition  exceptionally  to pay the liquidator s taxed party and party costs of and incidental to the application in any event and  equally exceptionally  by his obviously considered decision not to make and tender an assessment  which would be the usual course for the Commissioner to adopt in a proceeding such as this in either this Court or  a fortiori   in a State or Territory Supreme Court  see  e g  Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR    NSW Court of Appeal   There is no evidentiary controversy  Further  and as was also conceded on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner in submissions  the point is one always destined for this Court even in the event of assessment with the raising of the same and determination of an objection and attendant delays and related expenses only serving  in the circumstances  further to diminish such funds as may be available for distribution to creditors  principally  the Commissioner on behalf of the Commonwealth    I turn then to consider the substantive revenue law liability question raised in the proceeding citedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In their joint judgment in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at       to   McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ offer an authoritative reminder that consistency as between the relevant statutory provision and the language and purpose of all provisions of the statute is the primary object of statutory construction and of the correlative need to construe a statute as a whole  not piecemeal  with careful regard to context  purpose and with the object of giving sensible meaning to all of the language employed by Parliament  Their Honours also remind that the reconciliation of conflicting provisions may well require the ascertainment of which is the leading provision to which others in apparent conflict should yield so as to achieve  if possible  a conformity of meaning  I accept readily the Deputy Commissioner s submission that these principles
