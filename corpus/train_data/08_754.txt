SZLHM v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAttorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is important for those who apply to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking review of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal  and who subsequently seek to appeal to this Court  to understand that it is the Tribunal that resolves questions of fact  It is no part of the role of a court conducting judicial review to trespass into the realm of reviewing the merits of an administrative decision the subject of review  Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR    Brennan J there observed at     The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository s power  If  in so doing  the court avoids administrative injustice or error  so be it  but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error  The merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant power and  subject to political control  for the repository alone   The confined jurisdiction entrusted to the Federal Magistrates Court is unequivocally set forth in s   of the Migration Act    Cth    The Appellant s grievance  however  need not be resolved upon that basis  It may be more directly answered by reference to the findings of the Tribunal  A reading of those reasons for decision denies any conclusion that it did not assess the claims advanced and the evidence relied upon   The Tribunal held a hearing on   June   and the now Appellant appeared  The Tribunal s reasons set forth the evidence relied upon by the now Appellant  the questions asked of him at the hearing and his responses  Those reasons also record that an opportunity was sought to provide the Tribunal with further documents and that that opportunity was extended  Those reasons also record that no further documents were in fact provided discussedMuaby v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Unreported  Federal Court of Australia  Wilcox J    August   The problems faced by unrepresented litigants have of course long been recognised  eg  Managing Justice  A Review of the Federal Civil Justice Scheme  Australian Law Reform Commission  Report No     at          Indeed  regrettably  it would appear that little may have changed in a period extending over a decade since the inception of that inquiry  In Muaby v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Unreported  Federal Court of Australia  Wilcox J    August   Wilcox J observed  The number of applications filed in the New South Wales District Registry for judicial review of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal is running this year at a rate more than twice that of last year  It is the experience of my colleagues  as well as myself  that a large proportion of these matters are commenced by a stereotyped form of application that is uninformative and bears little relationship to what the applicant says at the hearing  It seems the filing of an application for review has become an almost routine reaction to the receipt of an adverse decision from the Tribunal  The solution is not to deny a right of judicial review  Experience shows a small proportion of cases have merit  in the sense the Court is satisfied the Tribunal fell into an error of law or failed to observe proper procedures or the like  In my view  the better course is to establish a system whereby people whose applications are refused have assured access to proper interpretation services and independent legal advice  If that were done  the number of applications for judicial review would substantially decrease  Those that proceeded would be better focussed and the grounds of review more helpfully stated  If applicants cannot afford legal advice  as is ordinarily the case  it ought to be provided out of public funds  The cost of doing this would be considerably less than the costs incurred by the Minister under the present system  in instructing a solicitor  and usually briefing counsel  to resist all applications  a substantial number of which have no merit and are ill prepared  That is to say nothing about the desirability of relieving the Court from the burden of finding hearing dates for cases that should not be in the list at all    The difficulty  it is respectfully considered  is not to be answered merely by the provision of greater access to legal advice  Challenges to decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal may not be motivated in all cases by a careful consideration of the relevant legal principles and an assessment of the prospects of success  Those challenges  it is suspected  may in some cases be driven more by a determination to remain in Australia for as long as possible  whatever may be the ultimate prospects of success in the courts  And even more disturbing is the potential that some challenges may be pursued by unrepresented litigants who have been given ill considered advice as to their prospects   The problems posed by unrepresented litigants are not theirs alone  The unrepresented litigant also presents this Court with peculiar problems  and those problems are not helped by repeated applications being brought with grounds of review or appeal which have little  if any  correlation with the facts of a particular case   An Affidavit filed in the proceedings sought a fixed costs order in the sum of   in the event that the appeal was dismissed  The estimate as to costs did not include such additional costs as would necessarily be incurred by reason of the Court seeking the further assistance of Counsel for the Minister on a number of issues raised during the course of the hearing  Such additional costs were estimated in oral evidence to be a further     of which was sought to be added to the fixed costs order otherwise sought    namely  a further sum of approximately   citedSZLAH v Minister for

application for leave to appeal and attached a draft notice of appeal to the application  The grounds of appeal there stated were as follows                That the Appellants submitted the evidence

grant the visa  That decision of the Tribunal was affirmed by the Federal Magistrates Court on   January   SZLHM v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA     The Appellant now appeals to this Court  He appeared at the hearing of the appeal unrepresented but with the assistance of an interpreter  He had previously filed written submissions  as had the Respondent Minister  At the request of the Court  further submissions were also filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister on   May    All submissions have now been considered   The Grounds of Appeal are set forth in the Notice of Appeal  without alteration  as follows  GROUNDS OF APPEAL   Specify grounds of appeal     That the Learned Federal Magistrate simply dismissed the application by not assessing the applicants claim which are purely based on the Refugee Convention of the religion   The applicant produced the bundle of the evidence   which was not considered by the learned Federal Magistrate  The learned Federal Court committed the legal errors coupled with the jurisdictional errors by not taking the evidence in to account      That the Appellants submitted the evidence to the effect the amount of the persecution which has been committed to the applicant  the RRT did not gave any consideration  the RRT even did admitted the facts and verified the circumstances of the applicant from different sources   The appellant made out a case which really requires the judicial inference of this honorable Court to meet the ends of justice      That the Respondents have failed to assess the claims and the evidence

focussed source of advice being proffered to unrepresented litigants  being advice which is merely   pro forma   in nature and divorced from the merits of an individual case  it may be appropriate for costs to be ordered against those providing such advice rather than the unrepresented appellant  SZJJC v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA    Even more fundamental issues may emerge if advice were being provided contrary to legal practitioners  legislation   Reference was also helpfully made by Counsel for the Respondent to ss  E  K of the Migration Act    Cth   Section  E provides in part that   a person must not encourage another person     to commence or continue migration litigation in a court if the migration litigation has no reasonable prospects of success    And s  F provides an additional and more specific power to order costs against a person who contravenes s  E  At some stage  and in an appropriate case  consideration may have to be given to invoking that power
