au cases cth FCAFC  html  Smith FM noted that it was not necessary for the Tribunal to discuss the chance of harm occurring which it found was less than probable  provided the Tribunal made findings of fact which permitted a conclusion that the fear of persecution was not well founded  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam and Others   FCA         FCR   at     Applicants A  of   v Refugee Review Tribunal   FCAFC   at         His Honour noted that such a factual finding had been made by the Tribunal  and accordingly found that the Tribunal had not failed to appreciate or apply the  real chance  test referred toChan Yee Kin v The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     CLR   Under this ground  three separate issues are raised  Firstly  the appellant submits that the Tribunal erred by failing to consider whether there was a real chance that the appellant would suffer persecution if he returned to Lebanon  The appellant submits that the Tribunal s finding that      those targeted were easily identifiable members of SLA  mostly from Southern Lebanon     did not take account of former SLA members who do not satisfy such profile  It is submitted that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct test because it did not take account of a person who did not have the characteristics relied upon by the Tribunal to reach its conclusion that there was no chance of persecution  and that its finding left open the possibility that the appellant could be the subject of persecution  The appellant submits that the Tribunal accordingly failed to apply the test in Chan Yee Kin v The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     CLR   where Mason CJ said at     If an applicant establishes that there is a real chance of persecution  then his fear  assuming that he has such a fear  is well founded  notwithstanding that there is less than a   per cent chance of persecution occurring followedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang and Others   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Smith FM was not persuaded that the Tribunal failed to apply the  real chance  test  His Honour  in rejecting the appellant s submissions  observed that the appellant had concentrated attention on particular parts of the Tribunal s reasoning in isolation from its general expression  His Honour noted that such approach had been discouraged in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang and Others   HCA         CLR   at    The Court is unable to find any error in his Honour s reasoning

noted that such a factual finding had been made by the Tribunal  and accordingly found that the Tribunal had not failed to appreciate or apply the  real chance  test appliedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant relies upon SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another   HCA         CLR   in which the High Court of Australia held that the Tribunal erred because it did not challenge or express any reaction to answers provided by the appellant and later rejected claims which had been accepted by the delegate      In SZBEL the High Court of Australia said at     The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal  But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive  and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is  the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are  the issues arising in relation to the decision under review    Smith FM said at     The present case has no direct parallel with SZBEL  since the Tribunal s finding which is complained of did not concern an issue of credibility which appeared uncontentious in the delegate s decision  In the present case  the applicant first presented his full claims to the Tribunal  and in particular his claim to fear reprisal from individuals in whose arrest he had been involved more than   years previously   Contrary to such finding  and the Minister s submission that SZBEL only relates to issues of credibility  the Court finds that SZBEL does apply  The decision in SZBEL makes it plain that if the Tribunal is to determine the application before it adversely to the applicant for a specific reason  it is obliged to put that circumstance to the applicant and to invite the applicant to respond  The Court in SZBEL said at     But where   there are specific aspects of an applicant s account  that the Tribunal considers may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt  the Tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and ask the applicant to explain why the account should be accepted   emphasis in original  The Tribunal letter addressed the appellant s claims relating to his fear of persecution including his claim that he feared persecution from individuals whom he had arrested  and invited the appellant to comment on such claims generally  It was necessary for the Tribunal to put directly to the appellant that one of its concerns was his inability to identify the persons who might harm him if the Tribunal was going to make a factual finding adverse to the appellant on that issue  Since the Tribunal had not specifically asked for the identity of the relevant persons at the hearing and had not requested details of such in the Tribunal letter  the appellant was not placed on notice that unless he provided such detail  the Tribunal might make an adverse finding against him   The Court is satisfied that the  issues to which those reasoning processes were directed   see SZBEL at   were not adequately notified to the appellant  The Tribunal s finding that the appellant could not  name or identify those persons  was a finding in respect of an issue upon which the appellant had not been afforded an opportunity to respond   The Court is satisfied that a breach of s   of the Migration Act has occurred  It follows that the appellant s appeal is upheld  The first respondent is to pay the costs of the appellant    I certify that the preceding forty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the

the appellant submits that the Tribunal considered the risk of persecution in the past and present but did not consider that the appellant could suffer harm in the future  The appellant relies upon the decision of this Court in SZGHS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at       which held that the Court must have an  adequately forward looking analysis   see SZGHS per Allsop J at   when considering the prospects of persecution   The Tribunal s reasons show that in reaching its conclusion it considered external information together with information supplied subsequent to the hearing in a letter from the appellant s adviser  Such letter included an extract from an Amnesty International report which referred to the possibility of reprisal attacks by Hezbollah against former Israeli collaborators  The Tribunal found    The adviser argued that Hezbollah was subjecting former SLA members to persecution and the threat of harm has increased significantly since the outbreak of hostilities with Israel in    The adviser referred the Tribunal to several reports dealing with reprisals against SLA members who were suspected of collaborating with Israel before and after the   conflict  The adviser argued that the applicant will be at risk of imprisonment and denied protection by the State because he was with the SLA      The Federal Magistrate excerpted the above passage and concluded that the Tribunal had considered whether  in the future  the appellant would be subjected to the same risk citedSZHBX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Smith FM said at       In my opinion  it should have been apparent to him  the appellant  and his advisers when doing so  that the Tribunal might draw inferences from the absence of any identification of particular persons who were feared  or of incidents or circumstances which suggested that there were particular persons who had an interest in pursuing him after   years  compare Bennett J in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   at   and SZHBX v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   at        In my opinion  the obligations on the Tribunal under s   to warn an applicant as to the issues in the review did not  in the present case  require it to alert the applicant to the possibility that it might draw an inference from his evidence that he could not name or identify the persons whom he claimed to fear citedSZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Smith FM
