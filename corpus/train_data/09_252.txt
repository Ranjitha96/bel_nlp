Garrett  as Trustee for the Garrett Family Trust   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toUniversal Holidays Pty Ltd v Tseng   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Universal Holidays Pty Ltd v Tseng   FCA     Lander J dismissed an application by Mr Garrett to be joined in the cross claim in the proceeding as the sole trustee of the Garrett Family Trust  The sole issue upon that application was whether in fact the Garrett Family Trust  of which Mr Garrett claimed to be a trustee  had ever existed  After a detailed consideration of the evidence Lander J concluded relevantly that there is not  and never has been  a separate entity called the Garrett Family Trust of which Mr Garrett was one of the trustees     His Honour held that the expression  the Garrett Family Trust  when used in certain  transactional documents  was a reference to the Andrew Garrett Family Trust which was then the only relevant trust in existence  The application was accordingly dismissed  Mr Garrett sought leave to appeal against the orders of Lander J dismissing his application  That application was refused by Lander J on   September    In dismissing the application for leave Lander J observed that Mr Garrett was in effect seeking to re litigate before the Full Court on different terms and on different evidence than the application which has previously been before him  Garrett v Macks   FCA   at    referred toGarrett v Macks   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlMr Garrett sought leave to appeal against the orders

purpose  when the issue to be determined is divorced from the facts to which it relates  A general declaration  in air  which is unrelated to specific facts  may not resolve the dispute between the parties  Martin v Taylor   FCA    Nor is the case  real  if by granting a declaration the Court will be acting in an advisory way and will not be quelling an existing controversy or establishing any immediate right  duty or liability between the parties  Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner   FCA         FCR   citedBass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     the majority observed that one crucial difference between an advisory opinion and a declaratory judgment was the fact that an advisory opinion is not based on a concrete situation and does not amount to a binding decision raising a res judicata between parties  They then adopted  with apparent approval  what is found in Zamir   Woolf   The Declaratory Judgment      nd Ed where it was emphasised that where the dispute is divorced from the facts it is considered hypothetical and not suitable for judicial resolution by way of declaration or otherwise  In my opinion such is the situation here  The declarations sought are not directed to a resolution of the complex factual matters adverted to by Mr Garrett in his correspondence addressed to Fosters Group Ltd although in a very limited way they may relate to them  The affidavit does not clarify the interest which is said to be the subject of the declarations sought  Furthermore the application filed by Mr Garrett does not name any respondents citedWilliams v Hunt     KB
