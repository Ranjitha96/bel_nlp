properly instructed could reach a verdict for the plaintiff  That test was authoritatively stated by the Judicial Committee in Hocking v Bell     CLR   at           ALR   at       Hocking   approving the following statement from the dissenting judgment of Latham CJ   Hocking v Bell   HCA         CLR   at       Hocking                 If there is evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff  unless that evidence is so negligible in character as to amount only to a scintilla  the judge should not direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant  nor should the Full Court direct the entry of such a verdict  The principle upon which the section is based is that it is for the jury to decide all questions of fact  and therefore to determine which witnesses should be believed in case of a conflict of testimony  But there must be a real issue of fact to be decided  and if the evidence is all one way  so that only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable  there is no function left for the jury to perform  so that the court may properly take the matter into its own hands as being a matter of law  and direct a verdict to be entered in accordance with the only

Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones  No     FCA   at   where his Honour said that that judgment may be made          by reference to evidence put on in support of an application under s A which reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the claim or defence will be able to be established   Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules empowers the Court  inter alia  to order that a proceeding be dismissed if satisfied that it is frivolous  vexatious or an abuse of process   The Council s grounds for summary dismissal are  as I have said  layered  The first two grounds relate to the competence of the purported s   application  The first ground is that Mr Wilkshire is not a  person aggrieved  the second  that his application has not enlivened any of the grounds

impropriety  be it of the Delegate  the Council s witnesses  or both parties  lawyers  While accepting he may be able to point to inconsistencies in evidence relating to events long prior to the preparation of the declarations of witnesses for the Council  or to the non production of documents created over a decade earlier  he has provided no plausible justification at all for the regularly made and  at first flush  seemingly preposterous consequential allegations of impropriety  I note in passing the standard of proof s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  provides for such allegations  see Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama   FCAFC   at          Importantly there is nothing at all to suggest that the very specific matters which were central to his case and in particular the discrepancies in the evidence on the Council s use of its mark as between April and June   were themselves material  or of any causative significance  in the Council obtaining registration of that mark  The supposedly tainted evidence had no bearing on the Delegate s decision   I refer to these matters because what would be involved in allowing Mr Wilkshire to amend his application would be the articulation of an  as yet  indiscernible claim  possibly under s  A  and a claim  moreover  which there is no reason to believe on the material before me will have any substance  legal or factual citedRe South American

Council has sought to outflank these decisions by contending that Mr Wilkshire s proceeding can  in the circumstances  properly be characterised as an abuse of process  The power of the Court to prevent such abuses extends beyond  the strict limits  of res judicata   issue estoppel and the Anshun doctrine  SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         FCR   at         A considerable body of material was put on to support the contention that Mr Wilkshire was engaging in  unjust harassment of the Council     with respect to the subject matter of this litigation    Given the view I have already taken of the prospects of this application  I do not intend to enter upon the controversies raised above    The undertakings  The final ground  which only came into sharp focus at the hearing of the motion  is a foreshadowed defence to Mr Wilkshire s application  It is founded on the consent undertakings noted with the consent orders  It is appropriate to reiterate their terms at this point        The applicant undertakes to the Respondent as follows           a  not to interfere in any way with the Respondent s application to register trade mark number    the  Respondent s mark  and          b  not to threaten the Respondent  any of the Respondent s licenses  whether current or future  or any other person with any form of action  including action for trade mark infringement under the Trade Marks Act     passing off  breach of section   or   of the Trade Practices Act   or related State and Territory Fair Trading Legislation and or a breach of copyright  in relation to the use of the Respondent s mark  This undertaking applies to existing and future use of the Respondent s mark in relation to all goods and services  For the avoidance of doubt  nothing in this undertaking restricts the Applicant s right to use trade mark no    in relation to the services for which he is registered appliedNokia Corporation v Liu   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As I will indicate below  the undertakings are contractual in character and  no less so than the Court orders  they are binding on the parties  In construing the consent orders and the undertakings  like principles are applied and in particular  evidence of the surrounding circumstances  or context  is admissible  see Nokia Corporation v Liu   FCAFC   at          I earlier noted that Mr Wilkshire s legal advisers accepted an offer of compromise made by the Council s solicitors on   March    While there may be an outstanding question whether that compromise included a non disclosure undertaking  there is no doubt that it included the above two undertakings  Whether or not Mr Wilkshire s advisers exceeded their authority in acting as they did is not presently relevant  There can be no doubt that  in the circumstances  they acted within their ostensible authority to compromise the action  Equally there is no doubt that Mr Wilkshire was prepared to accept the compromise in the form offered in the letter of   February   from the Council s lawyers  It was  in substance  what is contained in the consent orders and undertakings  Both the evidence and legal principle point in one direction  Whatever grounds for complaint  if any  Mr Wilkshire has against his advisers  he was bound by the consent orders and he remains bound by his contractual undertaking   The remaining question is whether  by the undertakings given  he contractually bound himself not to initiate the present proceedings appliedGrundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Council contends that cl  b  created an estoppel by convention which barred Mr Wilkshire for instituting the present proceeding  I have some difficulty in understanding how this species of estoppel  on which see generally Handley  Estoppel by Conduct and Election   Ch     in this setting assists the Council beyond the assistance which it properly can derive from the construction of the undertakings themselves in their setting  The context does provide quite clear indications as to how the language of the undertakings should be interpreted but that conclusion is arrived at by well accepted processes of interpretation  It does not in this matter seem to suggest that the parties adopted some assumption as the  conventional basis  upon which they entered into their compromise and from which Mr Wilkshire should not now be allowed to depart  Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   citedMasterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  As Allsop P indicated in Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd   NSWCA   at             the identification of ambiguity is not a precondition for examining contextual and background material otherwise legitimate to examine in furtherance of the construction and interpretation of a written contract   It is in my view quite clear that considered together with the consent orders  which  unfavourably to Mr Wilkshire  brought to an end the proceeding that was then on foot  the manifest intent of the two undertakings was to  a  secure that Mr Wilkshire would not interfere with the Council s obtaining registration of its mark  cl  a  and  b  thereafter he would not interfere with the Council s use and enjoyment of its registered mark  directly or indirectly  cl    b   Likewise the manifest intent of the consent orders  when considered in the context of the undertakings  was not simply to bring to an end a proceeding of  a quasi summary nature   Put shortly  the combined effect of the orders and undertaking was that their dispute over the mark was to be at an end then and thereafter  Order   and Undertaking  a  were to secure for the Council its registered mark vis   vis Mr Wilkshire  Undertaking  b  was to secure the use and enjoyment of that registered mark undisturbed by actions  threatened or initiated  by Mr Wilkshire  In aggregate the parties  compromise agreement was more than the bare compromise on an opposition appeal  In this setting  not to threaten     with any form of action  manifestly was intended to comprehend  the initiation  of an action  Similarly any action in relation  to the use of  the registered mark encompassed an action in relation to its use as a registered mark   In its setting cl  b  is not in my view to be construed as some adaptation of the s    threat action   Rather  it can  and should be  interpreted as I have indicated above  As such  it could be relied upon as a complete defence to the prosecution of the present application  It provides yet another basis for summary judgment against him under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act
