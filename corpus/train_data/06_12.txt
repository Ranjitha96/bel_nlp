Rush v Commissioner of Police   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedHooper v Kirella   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Order  A rr   and   of the Federal Court Rules provide respectively for what is colloquially known as  identity discovery  and  information discovery  see generally Hooper v Kirella   FCA         FCR    I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where  i  an applicant  having made reasonable inquiries  is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person  and  ii  it appears that some other person has  has had  or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is   Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought  It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered  These are that       a  there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained       b  after making all reasonable inquiries  the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief  and      c  there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision   Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court  Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be  a  within federal jurisdiction and  b  in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects  There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements  some at

    Before outlining the factual setting of this matter I should indicate that it has undergone a significant transformation since the hearing of the application  I gave the applicants leave to file supplementary submissions directed primarily to the prospective causes of action they might wish to pursue  They have acted upon this leave and  in quite some degree  have recast their cases for present purposes  This explains why matters which received some attention at the hearing are only dealt with cursorily in these reasons   Much in the detail of what follows relates only to the first applicant  Scott Rush  and gives rise to potential claims unique to him  As will become apparent  the cases of the other three applicants arise from their involvement in events in which Scott Rush as well was implicated  The evidence in this matter was given by way of affidavit and without cross examination  In relation to Rush s case I should also indicate that a number of affidavits have been read which expose significant conflicts of evidence between witnesses  I should indicate that I have not been asked in the circumstances to make findings in relation to contested issues of fact in the

legislative choice  citedBarton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I do not consider that the applicants have made out any reasonable cause to believe they have an arguable case for the reading down of s   of the AFP Act   I should add for the sake of completeness that it may be the case that  even if the AFP Act were to be read down as contended for  it would not prevent members of the AFP from making the request they did in the absence of legislative authority  cf Barton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at    It is unnecessary to express any view on this   A distinct way in which the applicants had proposed challenging the propriety of the AFP members  conduct in making the two requests was to contend that that conduct did not comply with the requirements of the Death Penalty Charge Guide such that  arguably  those members committed disciplinary offences under reg   of the Australian Federal Police  Discipline  Regulations    It was not made at all apparent how  even if such disciplinary offences could have been made out  this would have availed the applicants   As I understand the applicants  supplementary submissions they no longer rely upon breach of the Guide and Discipline Regulations  However  I should make the following comments in any event  First  and subject to what I later say  the Guide  on its face  may well be only of indirect relevance in this matter in that its substantive content is directed to how AFP members are required to act in relation to requests for assistance made of it by a foreign country  It is silent on requests made by the AFP of an overseas law enforcement agency  Secondly even if the standards prescribed in the Guide  with appropriate adaptation  be taken as the operative ones when a request is made by the AFP and I consider this was probably their intendment the conduct of the officers concerned in this case  whoever they may have been beyond Mr Hunniford  could not properly be said to have been relevantly in breach of the Guide as it related to  police to police  cooperation  The requests made and the information provided pre dated the INP investigations and the arrests and detention of the applicants  In consequence it pre dated any  charges being laid which may attract the death penalty  irrespective of how the term  charges  should be interpreted in the Guide as it applied to the formalities of the Indonesian legal system  Finally there was  as I have indicated  authority for the AFP members to make their request under the AFP Act and that in turn was translated into a practical arrangement with Indonesia in the Police Cooperation MoU under which  according to Mr Watson  the actual requests were made  The MoU is not in evidence before me for the reasons I earlier gave  Nonetheless  counsel for the applicant was provided with the opportunity to inspect the MoU or to have the Court inspect it  but declined to take either course  Counsel for the Commissioner has nonetheless indicated to the Court that the terms of the MoU contemplated the very provision of information by the AFP in circumstances such as in this matter and it could properly be said of the MoU that there was a standing request by Indonesia for such assistance  In the above circumstances  I am prepared to accept  a  that the applicants cannot claim reasonably to believe that the information provided to Indonesia was totally unsolicited and  b  that  possibly  the AFP in providing the information was acting upon a general request by Indonesia  However  for the reasons I gave above  I do not consider it to be of any consequence whether the request was made by the AFP or by Indonesia  The AFP members acted in conformity with the Death Penalty Charge Guide   Despite their various and varying formulations of a potential cause of action based on what compendiously I have called acting without lawful authority  I am not satisfied that the applicants have been able to identify or articulate any reasonable cause to believe that they are or may be entitled to obtain relief in this Court under this rubric notfollowedNg Siu Tung v Director of Immigration     HKCFA   The potential cause of action advanced here is not one it is open to me to entertain as Australian authority now stands  The invitation held out to me is to embrace

Australian judicial thinking to bring about an adoption of the English approach to substantive protection of legitimate expectations      Aust Jo of Admin Law   at     For present purposes all I need note of the  doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation  is what was said of it in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration at      The doctrine recognizes that  in the absence of any overriding reason of law or policy excluding its operation  situations may arise in which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive outcome or benefit  in which event failing to honour the expectation may  in particular circumstances  result in such unfairness to individuals as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court  Generally speaking  a legitimate expectation arises as a result of a promise  representation  practice or policy made  adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority

to himself  Lam   at    As I understand it  from the applicants  supplementary written submissions  no reliance is now being placed by Scott Rush on a possible claim so framed   In light of the decisions of the High Court in Teoh and in Lam it is clear that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is for the present not part of Australian law  For present purposes I need only refer to the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Lam at        The doctrine of  legitimate expectation  has been developed in England so as to extend to an expectation that the benefit in question will be provided or  if already conferred  will not be withdrawn or that a threatened disadvantage or disability will not be imposed  This gives the doctrine a substantive  as distinct from procedural  operation              The earlier English decisions with respect to  legitimate expectations  were discussed by Mason CJ in Attorney General  NSW  v Quin and by McHugh J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   In Quin   Mason CJ observed           In the cases in this Court in which a legitimate expectation has been held entitled to protection  protection has taken the form of procedural protection  by insisting that the decision maker apply the rules of natural justice  In none of the cases was the individual held to be entitled to substantive protection in the form of an order requiring the decision maker to exercise his or her discretion in a particular way  The prevailing view in this Court has been  as Stephen J observed in Salemi  v MacKellar  No     that   t he rules of natural justice are  in a broad sense a procedural matter  echoing the words of Dixon CJ and Webb J in Commissioner of Police v Tanos                      That remains the position in this Court and nothing in this judgment should be taken as encouragement to disturb it by adoption of recent developments in English law with respect to substantive benefits or outcomes  citedR v North and East Devon Health Authority  Ex parte Coughlan   QB   For present purposes all I need note of the  doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation  is what was said of it in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration at      The doctrine recognizes that  in the absence of any overriding reason of law or policy excluding its operation  situations may arise in which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive outcome or benefit  in which event failing to honour the expectation may  in particular circumstances  result in such unfairness to individuals as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court  Generally speaking  a legitimate expectation arises as a result of a promise  representation  practice or policy made  adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority      This in turn drew upon the reasons of Lord Woolf MR  for the court  in R v North and East Devon Health Authority  Ex

of Northumbria Police   QB   What is immediately apparent in the above is that it attempts neither to locate the alleged duty to Scott Rush in the context of an ongoing AFP investigation nor to justify the imposition of the duty in such a context  Rather  it addresses the question whether the circumstances of Lee Rush s providing information to the AFP founded a reasonable expectation in Lee Rush that the AFP would not use  and an implied undertaking  though to whom is not stated  not to use  that information in a particular way  While that inquiry may be a step in the fashioning of an action for breach of confidence by Lee Rush  or a possible duty of care to Lee Rush  if  hypothetically  the unauthorised disclosure of the information would expose Mr Rush to a reasonably foreseeable risk  cf Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police   QB   it does not lead necessarily or obviously to potential relief for Scott Rush in a negligence action by him  At best it hints at Lee Rush s having put the AFP in a position of power over Scott Rush  a position which carried with it an obligation not to exercise that power adversely to him  What I should emphasise as well is that whatever claims  if any  Lee Rush might be able to mount against an officer or officers of the AFP in consequence of their dealings and I do not suggest that the present circumstances suggest he might have any such claims he is not a party to this application appliedTame v New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I referred above to the absence of reference

Municipal  County  School and State Tort Liability  SSSS    such attempts have been unsuccessful   The progenitor of this principle was the decision of the House of Lords in Hill   After concluding that  in the circumstances of that case  the ordinary principles of negligence would not admit of a duty of care to a victim of crime  Lord Keith went on to indicate  at   that there was  another reason  why an action for damages in negligence should not be against the police in the circumstances of that case and that was  public policy   His Lordship then observed     The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime  From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function  but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it  In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind  The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded  Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done  with the result that he went on to commit further crimes  While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation  as indeed the present action would seek to do  The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion  for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources  Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question  yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so  A great deal of police time  trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial  The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function  that of the suppression of crime  Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed  not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted  I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ  in his judgment in the Court of Appeal   QB     in the present case  was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley   UKHL         AC   were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court   It is  in my view  unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether  as in England  a special though not unqualified  immunity rule applies to police activities  in the investigation and suppression of crime  Costello s case at   or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and  if relevant  common law functions  see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan   I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail  However  I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating  reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire     has been thought to lay down  on the immunity of police  cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police   at     and   and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity  see e g  Costello   Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon   Somerset Constabulary   EWCA Civ     tell in

Vincent at     Cran v State of New South Wales   at   ff  but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo     VR   a decision which pre dated Sullivan v Moody    Sullivan v Moody did not involve an allegation of negligence against police officers  Its concern was with whether medical practitioners and social workers who had examined children for evidence of sexual abuse by their fathers in the setting of a statutory regime containing provisions for the protection of children  including mandatory reporting to a government department of reasonable suspicion of child abuse  owed a duty of care to protect such fathers in the conduct of their examinations  investigations and reporting  It was held unanimously by the High Court that they did not  The plaintiff fathers had alleged that  as a result of negligent examination  diagnosis and reporting  they had suffered shock  distress  psychiatric injury and consequential personal and financial loss  Unsurprisingly  given the opinions expressed by the Court  Sullivan v Moody has been influential in this country in later decisions and judicial commentary on police liability for negligence in the conduct of investigations   In rejecting the duty of care argued for in Sullivan v Moody the Court observed             A duty of the kind alleged should not be found if that duty would not be compatible with other duties which the respondents owed         How may a duty of the kind for which the appellants contend rationally be related to the functions  powers and responsibilities of the various persons and authorities who are alleged to owe that duty  A similar problem has arisen in other cases  The response to the problem in those cases  although not determinative  is instructive         In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire   the House of Lords held that police officers did not owe a duty to individual members of the public who might suffer injury through their careless failure to apprehend a dangerous criminal  Lord Keith of Kinkel pointed out that the conduct of a police investigation involves a variety of decisions on matters of policy and discretion  including decisions as to priorities in the deployment of resources  To subject those decisions to a common law duty of care  and to the kind of judicial scrutiny involved in an action in tort  was inappropriate                 The circumstance that a defendant owes a duty of care to a third party  or is subject to statutory obligations which constrain the manner in which powers or discretions may be exercised  does not of itself rule out the possibility that a duty of care is owed to a plaintiff  People may be subject to a number of duties  at least provided they are not irreconcilable  A medical practitioner who examines  and reports upon the condition of  an individual  might owe a duty of care to more than one person  But if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations  that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists  Similarly  when public authorities  or their officers  are charged with the responsibility of conducting investigations  or exercising powers  in the public interest  or in the interests of a specified class of persons  the law would not ordinarily subject them to a duty to have regard to the interests of another class of persons where that would impose upon them conflicting claims or obligations                  The statutory scheme that formed the background to the activities of the present respondents was  relevantly  a scheme for the protection of children  It required the respondents to treat the interests of the children as paramount  Their professional or statutory responsibilities involved investigating and reporting upon  allegations that the children had suffered  and were under threat of  serious harm  It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty  breach of which would sound in damages  to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm  The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily  either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents  or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount  As to the former  the functions of examination  and reporting  require  for their effective discharge  an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons  As to the latter  the interests of the children  and those suspected of causing their harm  are diverse  and irreconcilable  That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child has been abused  only a suspicion that it may have happened  The interests of the child  in such a case  would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled  the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect  emphasis added   As I earlier noted  the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at   above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation  Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame   In its apparent endorsement of Hill at   in the above quotation  Sullivan along with Hill and D Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above  have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as

Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation   There is a short answer to the alleged duty  Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act  or had acted  in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so  neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the Myer Patching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged  The proposed duty would be inconsistent with the duty owed by the AFP to the public at large in the conduct of its investigations into the Bali drug trafficking operation  cf Sullivan v Moody at     I have already indicated that the AFP officers concerned did not act in contravention of the AFP Act in deciding to  and in making  the   and   April   communications to the INP  They were acting in performance of their functions under the AFP Act and consonantly with ministerial directions  The communications made had a proper and rational purpose in the furtherance of that police investigation  The proposed duty would only qualify and impede the conduct of the investigation embarked upon by the AFP  It would elevate the interests of Scott Rush over the public interest that the AFP was serving under its legislation to the extent that the two collided  as it did in the making of the request to the INP   If  as the other applicants seem to suggest albeit faintly  a like duty was owed them its obvious effect would have been to compromise the investigation itself in an important respect  No assistance of the type sought could have been asked of the INP notwithstanding that the investigation involved transnational criminal activity and that the assistance in fact sought  as I have noted  was for a proper purpose in furtherance of the AFP s statutory functions   In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned  the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in  and the policy directive they were  apparently  implementing  cf Sullivan v Moody at    Accordingly  to adopt Santow JA s observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at   the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants  Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it  that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question consideredBrooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis   UKHL         WLR   Before I express my own views on this  I should emphasise the following  Bearing in mind that this is an application for preliminary discovery where information about the possible commission of a tort is being sought  exceptional caution must be exercised before reaching a conclusion that  whatever the information that might be disclosed as a result of an order for information discovery  that information could make no difference for the reason that the duty contended for could not even arguably be imposed on AFP members when conducting the drug trafficking investigation in question  cf the observations of Lord Bingham in Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis   UKHL         WLR   at      As noted earlier  there are conflicting versions as to the substance of the conversations between Robert Myers  on behalf of Lee Rush  and Mr Patching of the AFP  The alleged duty of care is premised upon acceptance of Myers  version of what transpired  For present purposes  and dealing with the matter on the basis most favourable to the applicants  I am prepared to assume the correctness of that version for the purposes of this application  Nonetheless  I am satisfied from what is already known about the circumstances surrounding Myers  communications with Patching  that the negligence claim as it has been framed would in any event be unarguable irrespective of any further information relevant to it that might conceivably be forthcoming if an order for information discovery were to be made  Accordingly  I am satisfied for the purposes of O  A r   that no such proceeding for negligence could properly be brought in this Court and  for the purposes of O  A r   there is no reasonable cause to believe that Scott Rush may have a right to obtain relief on the basis proposed   What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above  including that of England  is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that  particularly in cases of omissions to act  the police may nonetheless have  or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a  special relationship  with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her  see e g  Brooks v Commissioner of Police at   and   Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ  in US jurisdictions the  special relationship  exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity  see e g  Eaton  above at SS    see also   Am Jur  d  above  at SS  ff  What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular  operational  context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist  Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody  Hall v Whatmore   above  and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at     see also Cran v State of New South Wales   above  or in preventing a breach of the peace  Thompson v Vincent   above   It is  in my view  unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether  as in England  a special though not

effectiveness of particular police functions  and notably the conduct of investigations and the suppression of crime  and to avert their compromise or undermining by the imposition of a duty to an individual  or individuals  over and above that owed to the public  In English law this has led to the adoption of an exclusionary principle  or immunity  which is often cast in broad terms  So  for

ff   rd ed    Eaton  above   ALR   th     It is  in my view  unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether  as in England  a special though not unqualified  immunity rule applies to police activities  in the investigation and suppression of crime  Costello s case at   or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and  if relevant  common law functions  see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan   I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail  However  I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating  reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire     has been thought to lay down  on the immunity of police  cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police   at     and   and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity  see e g  Costello   Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon   Somerset Constabulary   EWCA Civ     tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police  while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law  cf Doe     DLR   th at       First  it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function  i e  the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth  The particular subject of the inquiry transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking   fell within areas of  special emphasis  in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on   August    As the   April   letter to the INP reveals  the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of  inter alia  the applicants  That letter indicated the AFP s purpose in making its request was that  t he AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers  other than CHAN  in Australia   In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request  If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care  this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible  cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at     Secondly  there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely   The Myer Patching communications were directed to Lee Rush  not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular  I assume for the purposes of this application  that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence  I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence  However  it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers  Rather it appears to be said that  having regard  a  to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush  and  b  the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rush s departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given  the AFP s failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia  Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court distinguishedCostello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police     All ER   I will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on

law of common law countries illustrated above  including that of England  is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that  particularly in cases of omissions to act  the police may nonetheless have  or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a  special relationship  with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her  see e g  Brooks v Commissioner of Police at   and   Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ  in US jurisdictions the  special relationship  exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity  see e g  Eaton  above at SS    see also   Am Jur  d  above  at SS  ff  What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular  operational  context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist  Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody  Hall v Whatmore   above  and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at     see also Cran v State of New South Wales   above  or in preventing a breach of the peace  Thompson v Vincent   above   It is  in my view  unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether  as in England  a special though not unqualified  immunity rule applies to police activities  in the investigation and suppression of crime  Costello s case at   or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and  if relevant  common law functions  see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan   I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail  However  I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating  reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire     has been thought to lay down  on the immunity of police  cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police   at     and   and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity  see e g  Costello   Cowan v The Chief

       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is unnecessary to enlarge here on the question whether this Court would have jurisdiction in any event to entertain such a suit in negligence in the Northern Territory against members of the AFP as Commonwealth officers  I simply adhere to the affirmative view I expressed on a similar question arising in the Australian Capital Territory in O Neill v Mann   FCA         FCR    My reasoning in that case is  equally applicable to the Northern Territory  ALRC Report   The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth        The proposed negligence claim could well be described as a mutated form of breach of confidence action with the important difference that the duty said to be owed by the AFP officers was not owed to the supplier of the information  i e  Lee Rush  but to the subject of it  i e  Scott Rush  Furthermore the limitation on the use of that information proposed by the applicants is a narrow one  It is not that the AFP could not use the information supplied at all  Rather it could not be used in a way that would put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia citedCorrs Pavey Whiting   Byrne v Collector of Customs     FCR   It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia  The disclosures related to apprehended serious criminal misconduct  cf Corrs Pavey Whiting   Byrne v Collector of Customs     FCR   esp at    And a court would not enforce any contractual or equitable obligation relating to such information  the effect of which would have been

      CLR   citedSanders v Snell  No     FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss the elements of this tort in any detail  They were recently essayed by the Full Court of this Court in Sanders v Snell  No     FCAFC         FCR    I would note  though  that the tort can take two forms  In one form  that of  targeted malice  it must be shown that the public officer in question has acted as such with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons  In its alternate form it must be shown either that the officer has actual knowledge both that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury or else that the officer has acted with reckless indifference both to the possibility his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury  see generally Sanders v Snell  No   at       The applicants  contentions in relation to this tort require that close attention be given to the requirements of O  A r   in particular  I emphasise this for this reason citedL  a child  v Reading Borough Council   EWCA Civ         WLR   The essence of the misfeasance tort in either of its forms is the  dishonest abuse of power  L  a child  v Reading Borough Council   EWCA Civ         WLR   at    I am in complete agreement with the submissions of the respondent that there is no basis at all in the material before me to suggest any reasonable cause to believe that Mr Hunniford or other AFP officers acted with the reckless indifference asserted in the applicants  supplementary written submissions  What is being advanced is at best  a mere possibility   The evidence does not  incline the mind  towards assenting to the proposition asserted  cf St George Bank Pty Ltd v Rabo at     I have already indicated that the actions of the AFP officers concerned with the decisions and actions which led to the applicants  arrest were not of themselves ultra vires  There is no reasonable cause to believe that the decisions or actions were invalid because they were improperly motivated or that the officers were recklessly indifferent to the possible lack of power or validity in making those decisions or actions  Rather  on the evidence  they were referable to the Police Cooperation MoU with Indonesia  And while it was a foreseeable and likely consequence of the   and   April letters to the INP  that the applicants would be arrested in Indonesia and in that sense be exposed to harm in the sense of being put at risk of the death penalty  there is again no material at all which could objectively incline me to the proposition that the likelihood of that harm was other than a possible consequence of what was in the circumstances a valid exercise of official power
