Skinner v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedBaxter v Obacelo   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe applicant claimed to derive assistance from Baxter v Obacelo   HCA         CLR    That case concerned s  b  of the Law Reform  Miscellaneous Provisions  Act    NSW  which provided in part that      Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort      b  if more than one action is brought in respect of that damage by or on behalf of the person by whom it was suffered     against tortfeasors liable in respect of the damage  whether as joint tortfeasors or otherwise  the sums recoverable under the judgments given in those actions by way of damages shall not in the aggregate exceed the amount of the damages awarded by the judgment first given          The Court held that the provision applied only to cases where there was more than one proceeding  and thus did not preclude recovery against more than one defendant sued as joint tortfeasors in the one proceeding  Baxter   HCA       CLR   did not involve a limitation provision  I am unable to see how it assists the applicant  For the above reasons I am of the view that the Magistrate s decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by this Court  If  contrary to my opinion  the Magistrate s order was a final order  I would dismiss the appeal for the same reasons I would refuse leave to appeal assuming the order to be interlocutory   I certify that the preceding fourteen

austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe applicant accepted that but for the provisions of Part VIA of the Act  his proceeding was out of time  He submits that that Part permits his otherwise out of time claim  Part VIA deals with Proportionate Liability for Misleading and Deceptive Conduct and was introduced into the Act in    Its purpose was explained by Finkelstein J in BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at     Part VIA consists of ss  CB to  CI  Section  CB  limits the operation of the Part to a claim for damages under s   for economic loss or damage to property caused by conduct in contravention of s    This type of claim is called an  apportionable claim   Section  CD establishes proportionate liability for an apportionable claim  Subsection   provides      In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim           a  the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant s responsibility for the damage or loss  and   b  the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount       The expression  concurrent wrongdoer  is defined in  CB  as a person who is one of two or more persons whose acts or omissions caused  independently of each other or jointly  the damage or loss that is the subject of the apportionable claim  Section  CF provides that a defendant against whom judgment is given as a concurrent wrongdoer cannot be required to contribute to the damages recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer or indemnify any such wrongdoer  Section  CG  provides      In relation to an apportionable claim  nothing in this Part or any other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss  The applicant claims to bring himself within s  CG  by reason of a settlement of his claim against Stillwell in October    This is the proceeding referred to in the first paragraph of the passage quoted at    The settlement occurred as the result of a mediation  The County Court proceeding was struck out by consent with no order as to costs  Accordingly s  CG  does not apply for want of  judgment recovered   However  quite apart from this  Part VIA does not seem to me to provide any assistance to the applicant in displacing the limitation period in s   appliedD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe applicant appeared in person  Although he made no express application for leave  I will treat him as seeking it  Leave to appeal is only granted if the applicant establishes that the decision at first instance is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by an appellate court and substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision to be wrong  D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Magistrate went on to note the High Court s caution in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at   that it is undesirable for limitation questions of the kind under consideration in that case to be decided in interlocutory proceedings except in the clearest of cases  His Honour was of the view that this was the clearest of cases  The applicant had no reasonable prospect of succeeding  His claim was clearly out of time  The applicant has appealed against the Magistrate s dismissal of his application  By motion notice of which was filed on   October   the respondent seeks an order that the appeal be dismissed  for failing to identify any legal  factual or discretionary error in the judgment under appeal   It contends first that the Magistrate s decision was interlocutory and no leave to appeal has been sought  It then contends  as per the motion  that the applicant has identified no error in the decision
