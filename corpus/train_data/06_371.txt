respondent s state of mind became an issue when the respondent introduced it  see at   and     AMP further submits that if AACo s submissions are accepted  the consequence would be that in any case in which an applicant placed the respondent s state of mind in issue  the respondent would risk waiving privilege if it did any more than file a mere denial to the claim made against it  AMP submits that such result would be absurd   AMP submits in the alternative that if the Court should find that there has been a waiver of privilege  such waiver cannot extend to advice received throughout the whole of the tender process  since only a limited period is referable to the defence   Many decisions of this and other courts have considered circumstances in which  by its pleadings  a party waives its legal professional privilege  In Fort Dodge   the respondent  in its defence to a claim of misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to a contract  alleged that it had entered into the contract on

that the pleading of the state of mind was inconsistent  with the continued maintenance of confidentiality of contemporaneous legal advice as to those matters   see at     However  I cannot accept the submission of AACo that any positive defence mounted by AMP which raises its state of mind necessarily constitutes a waiver of privilege  In my opinion  in order to waive privilege a party must assert a belief which is likely to have been  or is explicitly said to have been  materially dependent upon legal advice given to that party  In that case the proof or otherwise of the belief is dependent upon the legal advice and accordingly privilege is waived  This is the position in cases where the dispute relates to a party s understanding of its legal position at a given point in time  such as Thomason   Rio Tinto  Ampolex and Fort Dodge  referred toMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  AMP submits that the decision in Telstra v BT and other cases propounding a  state of mind  test should not be relied upon in view of the subsequent decision of the High Court in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   which established the inconsistency test  Additionally  AMP says the  state of mind  test only arises in circumstances where the issue of state of mind was raised by the party claiming privilege  which is not the position in the present case   AMP says that the observations in the dissenting judgment of McHugh J in Mann v Carnell at   which are relied upon by AACo are inconsistent with the reasons of the majority at   and   of that decision   Since these proceedings are interlocutory  common law principles with respect to legal professional privilege apply  see Mann v Carnell at               and     and DSE  Holdings  Pty Limited at       The test for waiver of legal professional privilege at common law was enunciated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell   In that case  a majority of the Court at      It is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege   The Court added at      What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of fairness  perceive  between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large   Prior to the decision in Mann v Carnell   the leading authority of this Court relating to waiver of legal professional privilege was Telstra Corporation v BT Australasia   In that case  Branson and Lehane JJ observed  at      A party who initiates an undue influence case puts in issue in the proceeding the quality of his or her consent or assent     The quality of such consent or assent will ordinarily be affected by relevant legal advice received by the party  The principle that requires that in such circumstances the party not be entitled to maintain the confidentiality of such advice is one of fairness which goes to the integrity of the legal process  To allow a party to put in issue the quality of his or her consent or assent whilst  at the same time  withholding evidence relevant to that issue  would be to allow him or her unfairly to handicap the opposing party to the proceeding  and to compromise the ability of the court realistically to determine the issue   The effect of Mann v Carnell upon the ratio in Telstra was considered by Allsop J in DSE  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc   where his Honour said  at            I have come to the view that the authorities in this Court may require me to be guided by what the majority of the Full Court said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v BT Australasia Pty Ltd     FCR   as necessarily modified by Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at     and             My own view is that Mann v Carnell evinces more than a modification of the approach of the majority in Telstra and amounts to a rejection of that approach and that the notion of inconsistency of conduct by the holder of the privilege and the maintenance of the confidence in question  though informed where relevant by notions of fairness  works a narrower and more confined operation for implied waiver than as expressed by the majority in Telstra    I respectfully agree with his Honour with respect to the effect of Mann v Carnell   To the extent that Telstra suggests that fairness is the overriding consideration  it should not be followed  It is clear that following Mann v Carnell   inconsistency of conduct should be the guiding principle in determining whether legal professional privilege has been waived  although fairness remains an element for consideration in determining whether conduct is inconsistent   In respect of AACo s second submission  namely that AMP waived its privilege by communicating its legal advice to Rabo  I consider that the applicant must also fail  In Mann v Carnell   the majority observed that the reasoning of all members of the Court in Goldberg v Ng   HCA         CLR    was inconsistent with the proposition that any voluntary disclosure to a third party necessarily waives privilege  see Mann v Carnell at      The majority also noted the observations of Jordan CJ in Thomason at   where his Honour said     The mere fact that a person on some one occasion chooses to impart to another or others advice which he has received from his solicitor indicates no intention on his part to waive his right to refuse on other occasions to disclose in evidence what that advice was  and supplies no sufficient reason for depriving him of a form of protection which the law has deemed it specially necessary to throw around communications between solicitor and client   In view of these authorities  the disclosure of legal advice in confidence to a commercial adviser cannot  in my opinion  be considered inconsistent with the retention of privilege  In this respect  McHugh J s observations in Mann v Carnell at   are inconsistent with the majority reasoning   For the above reasons  the Court orders that     The applicant s notice of motion be dismissed      The applicant pay the respondents  costs of the motion   I certify that the preceding thirty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of

v Nature Vet Pty Ltd   FCA   at     BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at       In Rio Tinto   Sundberg J stated  at          the question whether the respondent has acted in a manner inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege remains  In my opinion  however one approaches the question  as to which see   and   he has so acted  The inconsistency arises from the combination of the following three facts          the respondent has  by his Statement  raised as an issue in the instant proceedings his states of mind      the respondent has  by his response to the applicant s request for particulars of his Statement  disclosed that the privileged scheduled documents had a bearing on those states of mind  and     the respondent has refused to produce those documents in answer to the first notice to produce   The above authorities establish that the conduct of a party will be inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege if the nature and extent of legal advice has been raised  whether directly or by necessary implication  by that party as an issue in the proceedings  This will usually occur where a state of mind has been positively pleaded in circumstances where legal advice given would be specifically pertinent to the formation of that state of mind or where a party s understanding of their legal position is critical to their defence   In the present case  the belief pleaded by AMP is not intimately connected with the legal advice given to it at the time  cf Ampolex per Giles CJ Comm D at  F

In Thomason v The Council of the Municipality of Campbelltown     SR NSW    the New South Wales Court of Appeal was required to decide whether privilege was waived in respect of advice concerning the legal remedies available to the plaintiff  where the exclusive election of a particular remedy was only binding if a person had knowledge of their other options at the time the election was made  In respect of the privilege Jordan CJ said  at        Hence  in effect  one of the issues in the case was what advice if any the plaintiff had received from her legal advisers as to her alternative legal rights  In these circumstances  since the fact and nature of the advice is an issue in the case  I am of opinion that privilege cannot be raised to prevent the proof of the advice   However  I cannot accept the submission of AACo that any positive defence mounted by AMP which raises its state of mind necessarily constitutes a waiver of privilege  In my opinion  in order to waive privilege a party must assert a belief which is likely to have been  or is explicitly said to have been  materially dependent upon legal advice given to that party  In that case the proof or otherwise of the belief is dependent upon the legal advice and accordingly privilege is waived  This is the position in cases where the dispute relates to a party s understanding of its legal position at a given point in time
