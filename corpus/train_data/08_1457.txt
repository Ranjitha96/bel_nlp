au cases cth HCA  html  It is clear that the power to issue shares must be exercised for a proper purpose  In Ashburton Oil NL v Alpha Minerals NL   HCA         CLR   at   Gibbs J said as follows  However powers conferred on directors by the articles of association of a company must be used bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole and not to obtain some private advantage  Directors are not entitled to use their power of issuing and allotting shares merely for the purpose of defeating the wishes of an existing majority of shareholders or maintaining their own control of the company discussedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  First  as to the question of standard of proof  the defendants submitted that the allegations that the directors acted with improper purpose were serious and that the principles in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   at     apply  It was submitted the Court must be satisfied that the allegations are made out having regard to the gravity of the matters alleged and that such satisfaction must not be produced by  inexact proofs  indefinite testimony or indirect inferences    It is undoubtedly plain as stated in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   at   that the principles in Briginshaw do not create any different or intermediate standard of proof between the civil standard of on a balance of probabilities and the criminal standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt  Clearly where there is an allegation of impropriety or criminal or fraudulent conduct then a court should not lightly make a finding of a person being guilty of such conduct  However  the essential task always remains of looking at the evidence in its totality and determining whether a party has proved on the balance of probabilities the factual matters required for that party to succeed referred toHarlowe s Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside  Lakes Entrance  Oil Company NL   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Harlowe s Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside  Lakes Entrance  Oil Company NL   HCA         CLR   at   Barwick CJ  McTiernan and Kitto JJ said the following about the power vested in directors to issue new shares  The suggested corollary is that an exercise of the power cannot be maintained as having been bona fide in the interests of the company unless the company had at the time of the exercise an immediate need of the capital to be paid up on the new shares  In many a case this may be true as a proposition of fact  but in our opinion it is not true as a general proposition of law   Further on  at   their Honours said as follows  The principle is that although primarily the power is given to enable capital to be raised when required for the purposes of the company  there may be occasions when the directors may fairly and properly issue shares for other reasons  so long as those reasons relate to a purpose of benefiting the company as a whole  as distinguished from a purpose  for example  of maintaining control of the company in the hands of the directors themselves or their friends  An inquiry as to whether additional capital was presently required is often most relevant to the ultimate question upon which the validity or invalidity of the issue depends  but that ultimate question must always be whether in truth the issue was made honestly in the interests of the company   And further on  at     their Honours said as follows  But if  in making the allotment  the directors had an actual purpose of thereby creating an advantage for themselves otherwise than as members of the general body of shareholders  as for instance by buttressing their directorships against an apprehended attack from such as Harlowe  the allotment would plainly be voidable as an abuse of the fiduciary power  unless Burmah had no notice of the facts   Further  I accept that even an honest and good faith exercise of power by directors may nevertheless be improper   Thirdly  I make some observations on the factual enquiry necessary in identifying the purpose for which a power may be exercised  It may be possible to conclude on a collective reason or purposes of a board comprising multiple directors  even though each statement by a director of his or her reasons or purposes may differ  see eg Langton v Forsayth Mineral Exploration NL     ACLR    This is not to say that each director s position must not be analysed separately  but I must determine the substantial purpose of the directors  if necessary the majority of directors  which is causative of the decision being made to allot the shares  see Harlowe s   HCA       CLR   and Re Southern Resources Ltd  No       ACLR    Obviously  I must have regard to the circumstances surrounding the decision in question  as well as the evidence of the directors themselves   In Harlowe s   CLR   in determining whether an allotment of shares had been made for an improper purpose  Barwick CJ  McTiernan and Kitto JJ said at   Directors in whom are vested the right and the duty of deciding where the company s interests lie and how they are to be served may be concerned with a wide range of practical considerations  and their judgment  if exercised in good faith and not for irrelevant purposes  is not open to review in the courts   Similarly in Idameneo  No   Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd     ACSR     at   Lindgren J stated  There is a well known line of authority to the general effect that it is the province of directors  not the courts  to identify where the interests of a company lie  and that the courts do not exercise a supervisory function over the business judgments of directors  see  for example  Harlowe s Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside  Lakes Entrance  Oil Co NL   HCA         CLR   at   Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd   AC   at   referred toHoward Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd     NSWLR   Similarly  in Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd     NSWLR   at   the Privy Council stated that      it would be wrong for the court to substitute its opinion for that of the management  or indeed to question the correctness of the management s decision  on such a question  if bona fide arrived at  There is no appeal on merits from management decisions to courts of law  nor will courts of law assume to act as a kind of supervisory board over decisions within the powers of management honestly arrived at   Similarly in Idameneo  No   Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd     ACSR     at   Lindgren J stated  There is a well known line of authority to the general effect that it is the province of directors  not the courts  to identify where the interests of a company lie  and that the courts do not exercise a supervisory function over the business judgments of directors  see  for example  Harlowe s Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside  Lakes Entrance  Oil Co NL   HCA         CLR   at   Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd   AC   at   referred toIdameneo  No   Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd     ACSR   Similarly in Idameneo  No   Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd     ACSR     at   Lindgren J stated  There is a well known line of authority to the general effect that it is the province of directors  not the courts  to identify where the interests of a company lie  and that the courts do not exercise a supervisory function over the business judgments of directors  see  for example  Harlowe s Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside  Lakes Entrance  Oil Co NL   HCA         CLR   at   Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd   AC   at   followedJones v Dunkel     CLR   It was also submitted that I should draw an inference that this email of   July   was part of the overall plan to consolidate the directors  control of the company  reinforced by the failure to call Mr Baguley  reliance was placed to this end upon the principle in Jones v Dunkel     CLR    Of course  the failure to call evidence may  not must  lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted a party s case  The application of the principles in Jones v Dunkel must be applied in the context of the evidence that is presented to a court  Assuming that the defendants were in a position to call Mr Baguley  I do not regard the email as of sufficient significance to consider Mr Baguley to be a witness expected to be called  Further  on the evidence presented by Bell IXL  I would not otherwise require an explanation of the email of   July   in circumstances where the main issues of fact relate to the events in May    In this hearing  all of the directors and Mr Waller gave evidence and were subject to cross examination on all the issues raised for determination between the parties  including the existence of some impermissible arrangement between the defendants   I am not saying the email of   July may not be relevant to showing  on Bell IXL s case  an overall strategy of improper purpose  However  in the end  the conclusion I have reached is that irrespective of the wording adopted in the   July email  the purpose in making the allotment was not that described by Bell IXL  I have reached this conclusion on the basis of all the evidence before me including the evidence of all the actual persons involved in the decision making in May and June     In view of the above

        CLR   at     the High Court said of the power to issue shares  The power must be used bona fide for the purpose for which it was conferred  that is to say  to raise sufficient capital for the benefit of the company as a whole  It must not be used under the cloak of such a purpose for the real purpose of benefiting some shareholders or their friends at the expense of other shareholders or so that some shareholders or their friends will wrest control of the company from the other shareholders   It was submitted by Bell IXL that the expression  under the cloak of such a purpose  was an apt description of the allegedly false reasons for the placement given by LFE s directors citedRe Southern Resources Ltd  No       ACLR   Thirdly  I make some observations on the factual enquiry necessary in identifying the purpose for which a power may be exercised  It may be possible to conclude on a collective reason or purposes of a board comprising multiple directors  even though each statement by a director of his or her reasons or purposes may differ  see eg Langton v Forsayth Mineral Exploration NL     ACLR    This is not to say that each director s position must not be analysed

HCA       CLR   and Re Southern Resources Ltd  No       ACLR    Obviously  I must have regard to the circumstances surrounding the decision in question  as well as the evidence of the directors themselves   This is not to say that the court cannot examine the objective commercial justification of a course of action to assess the credibility of assertions by the directors as to their motives and purposes  see Re Southern Resources Ltd  No     ACLR     Ultimately  each case must turn on its facts  after an assessment of all the evidence  which includes the documentary material  but read in light of other admissible evidence which may impact upon the meaning to be given to documentary evidence and the context of such documentary evidence and the proper inferences that may be drawn  The evidence of directors must be considered and evaluated  always in the context of the other evidence before the court  In some circumstances a court may reject the evidence of directors  not because it is intentionally false  but because in the circumstances the overwhelming context is to the contrary  which leads the court to conclude that the evidence of the directors is more reconstruction than recollection   Each director and Mr Waller gave evidence and was subjected to cross examination and an attack upon their credit  I have come to the view that I should accept the evidence of each of the directors and Mr Waller of Aegis  They all answered the questions asked of them directly and without prevarication and  in my view  honestly  For the reasons given in the course of this judgment  I do not accept that the context of the allotment of shares is overwhelmingly against the evidence given as to the purpose of the allotment  There was a commercial basis for the allotment and  in my view  it was appropriate as a matter of business judgment for the directors in view of the history of LFE and potential future activities   One attack upon the credibility of the directors was based upon the lack of any proper board papers and lack of documents evidencing any real search for the placement of the shares   Bell IXL s contention was that the lack of any proper board papers and the lack of documents evidencing any real search for a placement was the best evidence of the improprieties of the directors  However  as I have said  I am satisfied that it was not the practice of these directors to record in writing  whether by diary note or otherwise  the content of ongoing discussions amongst themselves or with third parties  The directors did not run LFE by recording or minuting each step of every transaction  Of course  it is not the function of the board minutes to confirm decisions  such as the decision taken on   May   to meet with Mr Booth on   May   to discuss the placement  The fact that the directors so acted is consistent with the circumstances of the directors assuming their defacto  executive  roles at a critical time for LFE  where it had no staff in Australia  and where the directors were compelled to perform all the executive and non executive functions in order to assist the management of the company citedWhitehouse v Carlton Hotel Pty Ltd
