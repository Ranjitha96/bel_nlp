Wiegand v Comcare Australia  No     FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldisapprovedWiegand v Comcare Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   November   I gave judgment in this matter in which I dismissed an appeal brought by Mr Wiegand under s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  Wiegand v Comcare Australia   FCA    His application related to an unsuccessful claim for compensation under the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    Cth   In the following week I caused Comcare to be called on not to enter judgment  I then foreshadowed the possibility that I would exercise my power to set aside my judgment  then allow Mr Wiegand s application  set aside the Tribunal decision in question and remit the matter to the Tribunal to be reheard and determined  see O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    My reason for so acting can be shortly explained  On   November   I heard a matter in another judge s docket which involved an appeal under the AAT Act  this time by Comcare  raising an issue of construction of the definition of  disease  in s   of the SRC Act which was contrary to that assumed to be  or else accepted by Comcare as  correct in the earlier matter and on which I had relied  Different counsel appeared in each matter   It was only during the hearing of the latter matter that I became aware of the dictum of French and Stone JJ in Comcare v Canute   FCAFC         FCR   at       with which  with respect  I agreed  but which nonetheless was inconsistent with the test that I had applied in Wiegand  followedComcare v Canute   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It was only during the hearing of the latter matter that I became aware of the dictum of French and Stone JJ in Comcare v Canute   FCAFC         FCR   at       with which  with respect  I agreed  but which nonetheless was inconsistent with the test that I had applied in Wiegand    The question of construction I decided in Sahu Khan concerned the proper construction to be given the phrase  in a material degree  in the definition of  disease  in s   of the SRC Act  Put shortly  disease  is defined to mean any ailment or aggravation of any ailment suffered by an employee  that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee s employment by the Commonwealth   In conformity with the dictum in Canute   I held that the phrase imposed a more demanding requirement of contribution than had conventionally been considered to be the case  largely because of misplaced reliance upon observations made in Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission     FCR   at    a decision under earlier and differently worded legislation  citedComcare v Sahu Khan   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   January   I delivered judgment in the latter matter  I upheld the construction of the s   definition propounded by Comcare  but dismissed the application on the basis that it would be futile to remit the matter having regard to the findings made by the Tribunal  Comcare v Sahu Khan   FCA     I subsequently heard the parties in this matter on the question whether my judgment should be set aside and the orders made that I had foreshadowed  On   February   I made those orders  Accepting that the discretion to set aside a judgment not entered should be exercised with caution  I am satisfied that the circumstances of this matter warrant the course I have taken  A miscarriage of justice is being averted   The question of construction I decided in Sahu Khan concerned the proper construction to be given the phrase  in a material degree  in the definition of  disease  in s   of the SRC Act  Put shortly  disease  is defined to mean any ailment or aggravation of any ailment suffered by an employee  that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee s employment by the Commonwealth   In conformity with the dictum in Canute   I held that the phrase imposed a more demanding requirement of contribution than had conventionally been considered to be the case  largely because of misplaced reliance upon observations

reliance upon observations made in Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission     FCR   at    a decision under earlier and differently worded legislation    It clearly was the case in the present matter that Dr Coyte  the medical practitioner whose evidence the Tribunal accepted  gave his evidence concerning what matters contributed in a material degree to Mr Wiegand s condition after being directed by the Tribunal in accordance with the less exacting Treloar test  That direction was given after Dr Coyte had been asked by Mr Wiegand in oral examination about whether his employment did or did not contribute materially to his condition  to which Dr Coyte replied   one would have to define what degree of contribution is material    I am satisfied that Dr Coyte s evidence was contrived by the Treloar direction  I am not satisfied that it would not have been different and more discerning if he had been properly directed  Given the significance attributed to Dr Coyte s evidence in the Tribunal s reasons  I am not prepared to say that it would be futile to remit the matter to the Tribunal because if it applied the proper test it would nonetheless be driven ineluctably to the same conclusion   Accordingly  I have made the orders I earlier foreshadowed  I would add that  in my view  Comcare should have appropriate procedures in place to ensure consistency
