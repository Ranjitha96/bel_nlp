Drew v Repatriation Commission   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedFogarty v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         AAR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html   On   December   for reasons that it then published  the Tribunal  constituted by Mr Kenny  Member  affirmed the decision under review     Section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  enables an appeal to be brought to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal on a question of law  The questions of law identified in the notice of appeal which has been filed in the court are as follows    whether the Tribunal erred in law by failing to       a  consider the written statement of the Applicant in evidence before it  exhibit   or   b  evaluate the sworn evidence given by the Applicant in his statement  exhibit   against that given viva voce when determining whether the applicant experienced  intense fear  helplessness or horror  for the purposes of the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder      whether the Tribunal erred in law by failing to refer in its reasons for decision that the Tribunal had regard to the sworn statement of the Applicant contained in exhibit       whether the Tribunal erred in law  and failed to comply with its obligations under section    B  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act     by failing to explain how it treated the Applicant s viva voce evidence of his reaction to the alleged stressor as against the description of said reactions given by the Applicant in his sworn statement  exhibit       Section   of the Veterans  Entitlements Act renders the Commonwealth liable to pay a pension to a veteran where the veteran has become incapacitated from a war caused injury or disease  The circumstances in which a disease or injury is taken to be war caused are set out in s     subs   of the Veterans  Entitlements Act       The standard of proof to be applied by the Commission and on review by the Veterans  Review Board or the Tribunal to the question of whether a disease is a war caused disease is provided for in s   of the Veterans  Entitlements Act   Section   of that Act provides materially      Where a claim under Part II for a pension in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a veteran  or of the death of a veteran  relates to the operational service rendered by the veteran  the Commission shall determine that the injury was a war caused injury  that the disease was a war caused disease or that the death of the veteran was war caused  as the case may be  unless it is satisfied  beyond reasonable doubt  that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination    Where a claim under Part IV   a  in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a member of a Peacekeeping Force or of the death of such a member relates to the peacekeeping service rendered by the member  or  b  in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a member of the Forces  or of the death of such a member  relates to the hazardous service rendered by the member  the Commission shall determine that the injury was a defence caused injury  that the disease was a defence caused disease or that the death of the member was defence caused  as the case may be  unless it is satisfied  beyond reasonable doubt  that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination    In applying subsection   or   in respect of the incapacity of a person from injury or disease  or in respect of the death of a person  related to service rendered by the person  the Commission shall be satisfied  beyond reasonable doubt  that there is no sufficient ground for determining   a  that the injury was a war caused injury or a defence caused injury   b  that the disease was a war caused disease or a defence caused disease  or  c  that the death was war caused or defence caused  as the case may be  if the Commission  after consideration of the whole of the material before it  is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person    Except in making a determination to which subsection   or   applies  the Commission shall  in making any determination or decision in respect of a matter arising under this Act or the regulations  including the assessment or re assessment of the rate of a pension granted under Part II or Part IV   decide the matter to its reasonable satisfaction    In Fogarty v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         AAR   at   paragraphs   and   Kenny J  with the agreement of Spender and Tamberlin JJ  observed the following in relation to s   and its impact on the standard of proof to be applied by administrators in respect of the determination of claims or their external review  The authorities establish that  where there is an issue as to whether or not a veteran is suffering from a claimed injury or disease  then the commission  and  on review  the board or the AAT  must decide the issue to its reasonable satisfaction  as required by section   of the Act  see Benjamin v Repatriation Commission   FCA         AAR   at   per Moore  Emmett and Allsop JJ  Repatriation Commission v Cooke     FCR   at       AAR   at     per French  Drummond and Carr JJ  Repatriation Commission v Budworth   FCA         FCR   at       FCA       AAR   at   per Ryan  Marshall and Conti JJ  Repatriation Commission v Hill   FCAFC         ALD   at     per Black CJ  Drummond and Kenny JJ  and Repatriation Commission v Gosewanckel   FCA         ALD   at     per Weinberg J  As the Full Court said in Benjamin  at           Section   of the Act assumes the existence of a relevant injury or disease and provides a standard of proof for the determination of whether that injury or disease was war caused  When the commission  or the tribunal on review  is required to determine whether a veteran is suffering from a particular injury or disease  that issue must be decided to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision maker  in accordance with section   of the Act  see Repatriation Commission v Budworth   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       AAR   at           Although the AAT is not bound by the rules of evidence the Full Court held in Repatriation Commission v Smith     FCR   at     AAR   at   that the requirement in section   that the AAT must be  reasonably satisfied  imports the civil standard of proof    This is a case where there was at issue in the proceeding the threshold question as to whether or not the Applicant was suffering from an injury or disease  In particular  that threshold question came to be whether or not he was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  Accordingly  the question of whether he was suffering from that condition fell for determination as required by s   of the Veterans  Entitlements Act according to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tribunal in the way explained in the passage which I have quoted from Fogarty    In the submissions on behalf of the Applicant  much was made of the following passage in Fogarty at para   I accept that the AAT was bound to take the report into account in the sense explained by Mason J in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited   HCA         CLR   at   in deciding whether or not the veteran suffered from a generalised anxiety disorder  Providing it did so  it was for the AAT to determine what weight should attach to the report  There is  however  no mention of the report in the AATs reasons  On account of this  and on account of the AATs failure at the outset to address the diagnosis issue by reference to the evidence  and on account of the  methodological confusion   as the respondent termed it  in the AATs reasons generally  I will infer that the AAT indeed failed to have regard to the report  In the circumstances of the case this failure constitutes a material error of law   The report in that case was a medical report  but the submission made on behalf of the Applicant was that there was no relevant distinction to be drawn in terms of principle as between the medical report in that case and the written statement to the accuracy of which Mr Drew swore in his oral evidence before the Tribunal  It is true that there is no explicit reference to that statement in the Tribunal s reasons  I was though very helpfully provided  on behalf of the Respondent  with what one might term a  matrix  in which analysis is made of the Tribunal s reasons and corresponding references in the written statement which became part of the evidence before the Tribunal  It is quite plain from that that the Tribunal has had regard to the written statement and  indeed  adopted particular passages from it in its reasons   Assuming  therefore  that the written statement might  in terms of the Peko Wallsend case  be classified as a relevant consideration  I am quite satisfied that the Tribunal did have regard to it in reaching its decision   His Honour observed  As it is now well understood  any court reviewing a decision of the tribunal cannot turn  a review of the reasons of the decision maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration for merits of the decision  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at    Those quite  proper principles  do not allow a doubtful fact finding to be characterised as an error of law  As Kenny J commented in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingim   FCA         FCR   at    a tribunal does not commit an error of law merely because it finds facts wrongly or upon a doubtful basis or because it adopts unsound or questionable reasoning   Likewise those  proper principles  do not require that it be shown that all matters raised in the proceeding before the tribunal are dealt with in the reasons  For the purposes of section  B  of the AAT Act  the tribunal is not obliged to give a  line by line refutation  of an applicant s evidence either generally or in those respects where there is evidence contrary to find things that material fact made by the tribunal  Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Durairajasingham     ALD       ALR   see generally  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         ALD       ALR     Though I have  in the manner indicated earlier  some difficulty with the reference by the Tribunal in para   of its reasons to the statement of principles  it is tolerably clear from that paragraph that the Tribunal has  against the background of the written statement before it  gained particular assistance from the oral evidence which Mr Drew came to give in addition to that written statement  As it happened  that oral evidence put the Tribunal in the position of not being reasonably satisfied that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder  The Tribunal s chain of reasoning on matters of fact appears to have been this  There was a consensus of medical opinion that a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder ought to be made  having regard to criteria in DSM IV  Those criteria concern matters of primary fact  In particular  one of those primary facts was that described in paragraph  a ii  of the DSM IV publication  and as it happened  the Tribunal  in taking account of all of the evidence before it  and particularly the oral evidence  was not satisfied as a matter of fact that the experience in response of the veteran met the description in  a ii   It followed from this that having regard to the medical opinion as to the utility of DSM IV  no factual foundation for a finding of post traumatic stress disorder was present   That process of reasoning seems to me to have been both logical and reasonably open on the evidence before the tribunal citedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   Only if it were concluded that the veteran was suffering from the claimed condition of post traumatic stress disorder would the reasonable hypothesis process of reasoning  derived from ss   and     of the Veterans  Entitlements Act   as those provisions are affected by the statement of principles regime  and involving the four steps as elucidated in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR     arise for consideration   The Tribunal had the benefit of evidence from two specialist psychiatrists  Dr Likely and Dr Mulholland  There was a consensus as between those two gentlemen that  in terms of accepted medical practice  a diagnosis as to whether or not a person was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder ought to be made by reference to a publication known as DSM IV  Each of those psychiatrists had had regard to the diagnostic criteria in that publication as well as an account of the applicant s service  In the result  Dr Likely had formed the view that the applicant was indeed suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  He was the treating psychiatrist  Dr Mulholland had a different view   The difference between those gentlemen was not one of the apt diagnostic criteria  but rather one of the application of those criteria to the facts as related and understood by them concerning the applicant s war service  That service  as related by the Tribunal in the Reasons at para   was as follows  The applicant was   years of age when he joined the RAN and celebrated his  st birthday on route to Vietnam on HMAS Vampire  During that voyage  he and other young sailors were subjected to story telling by various experienced sailors about what to expect when they arrived in Vung Tau Harbour  In those stories  the North Vietnamese were credited with controlling vessels  junks  modified to enable them to achieve high speeds and deliver torpedo strikes against Australian vessels  Additionally  they were credited with the capacity to manoeuvre close to Australian vessels and to drop divers armed with mines to damage them  Mr Drew and the others were also told that their time in Vung Tau coincided with the birthday of Ho Chi Minh and that the North Vietnamese were intending to capture Vung Tau Township as part of his birthday celebrations  On hearing these stories  Mr Drew was not greatly concerned but  as the Vampire approached Vietnamese waters  he became apprehensive and the information provided to him  started to get under his skin  citedGerzina v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Gerzina v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC   at   a Full Court  Black CJ  Heerey and Bennett JJ  made the following observation in respect of that publication  We agree with the submission of senior counsel for the respondent that the interpretation of the criteria  a ii  in DSM IV in this case did not raise a question of law  There was before the tribunal evidence from appropriately qualified medical specialists  both of whom used DSM IV as the appropriate framework for making a diagnosis  No other framework or criterion was suggested  It was in this setting that the tribunal had to reach a conclusion about the question of the appellant s diagnosis  This was a question of fact   Neither party in this appeal suggested that DSM IV had any greater role to play in the proceedings before the tribunal than in providing an accepted framework on the evidence by reference to which a finding of fact might be made  As it transpired  Dr Mulholland had  on the evidence that he had considered  formed the view that post traumatic stress disorder was not a diagnosis open on the basis that criterion  a i  was not met  On the facts before it  the Tribunal reached a different view in relation to that particular criterion  The Tribunal found that  though there were differences or inconsistencies in the medical evidence  the criterion  a i  was met  The Tribunal went on to find that it was not satisfied in relation to Mr Drew s response at the time for the purposes of satisfying criterion  a ii    The critical paragraph in the Tribunal s reasoning in that regard is paragraph   which is in the following terms  The tribunal in Budworth described this as an extremely high level of reaction to extremely traumatic stressors  at para    I agree with that description  Dr Likely referred to intense fear and Dr Mulholland referred to panic and fear and this enabled them to conclude that criterion  a ii  was met  Clearly  these descriptions of his feelings are what Dr Likely and Dr Mulholland were told by Mr Drew yet that was not the evidence of Mr Drew given on oath at the hearing  He gave that evidence in a calm manner and described himself at the relevant time on Vampire as being  agitated   concerned about safety   feeling afraid  and being  relieved  when the ship eventually weighed anchor  Even when he described his feelings on seeing the stricken USS Evans  he said this had no effect on him except to make him think about what might have befallen the Vampire  While Mr Drew s feelings of being afraid  of agitation and of concern are understandable  I am reasonably satisfied that they lack the intensity of response required in the diagnostic criterion  a ii  in DSM IV and the statement of principles  On the evidence that he gave  I am satisfied that his reactions do not constitute a response which involved intense fear  helplessness  or horror appliedWillcocks v Comcare     ALD   There was also criticism made of the Tribunal s reasons in terms of the conclusion reached that the veteran was not suffering post traumatic stress disorder because  on the facts  that the necessary diagnostic criterion   a ii  was not met  In Willcocks v Comcare     ALD   at   para   Finn J very helpfully summarises the authorities germane to the Tribunal s obligation to give reasons for the findings of fact that it comes to make
