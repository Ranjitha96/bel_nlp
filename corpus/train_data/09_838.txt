fundamental to the imposition and continuation of anti dumping measures  The CEO and the Minister had to give a reason to eliminate any factors other than dumping as being likely to cause such an

 No other reason supported the conclusion that the threat of material injury to Qenos would be caused by Siam s dumping  or dumping of Thai exports  alone if the measures were allowed to expire  The

Tribunal  Ex parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThus  the formation of the requisite state of satisfaction by the CEO under s  ZHF  is an essential precondition to the Minister being able to exercise his or her power under s  ZHG  to decide whether or not to secure the continuation of the anti dumping measures  And  the CEO s report under s  ZHF   including the CEO s satisfaction  findings of fact  particulars of the evidence relied on and reasons to support the recommendations in accordance with s  ZHF  and   must be considered by the Minister in arriving at a decision under s  ZHG    together with any other information he or she considers relevant  The discretion of the Minister in s  ZHG  is expressed in wide terms  Nonetheless  it must be exercised within proper limits as Stephen  Mason  Murphy  Aickin and Wilson JJ explained in The Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   where they said that     Here the problem lies in ascertaining what are the proper limits of the discretion  In the absence of some positive indication of the considerations on which a grant or refusal of consent is to depend  the discretion is  unconfined except in so far as the subject matter and the scope and purpose of the statutory enactments may enable the Court to pronounce given reasons to be definitely extraneous to any objects the legislature could have had in view  to use the words of Dixon J in Browning     CLR at p    In that case his Honour went on to remark   as he had done earlier in Swan Hill Corporation v Bradbury   HCA         CLR   at p    on the impossibility  when an administrative discretion is undefined  of a court s doing more than saying that this or that consideration is extraneous to the power   Here  the limits of the discretion  are to be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of Pt XVB of the Act and  in particular  in the requirement of s  ZHG  itself  that the Minister must consider the report of the CEO  In that consideration  the Minister must also consider  as a fundamental matter in exercising his or her discretion  the central finding of the report that  in accordance with s  ZHF    the CEO was satisfied that the expiration of the measures would lead or be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of both the dumping and the material injury that the anti dumping measure is intended to prevent  Thus  a review under Div  A of Pt XVB is not intended as a complete replication of the process under Div   involved in the initial imposition of anti dumping measures  But  the continuation review under Div  A is still directed to the purpose of preventing material injury or the threat of such an injury caused by dumping  So  in exercising his or her discretion under s  ZHG    I am of opinion that the Minister must consider whether the existing measures are appropriate and adapted to achieve the purpose served by the measures identified in s  ZHF  if they are to be continued discussedUnited States Sunset Review of Anti Dumping Duties on Corrosion Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan  AB    Siam argued that the reasoning in Report   recording the CEO s satisfaction as to the matters set out in s  ZHF  was the product of hypothesising about the impact of unknown and undefined future events that bore no causal relationship to the expiry of the measures  Siam contended that  the conclusions in Report   that the expiration of the measures would lead or be likely to lead to the occurrence or recurrence of both dumping and material injury  and particularly the likelihood of dumping causing or threatening material injury  were not sufficiently causally connected in a reasoning process in the Report to justify the decision to continue the measures against Siam  Siam argued that the respondents had used speculation rather than a rigorous examination of a kind envisaged by the WTO Appellate Body in United States Sunset Review of Anti Dumping Duties on Corrosion Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan  AB     at    The respondents argued that the terms of s  ZHF  were materially similar to Art     of the implementation agreement  They argued that the considerations identified by Report   provided a reasoning process that was open to  and sufficient for  the CEO and the Minister  They referred to the finding in the Report that Siam had continued to dump the product in Australia even while the existing measures were in force  as leaving it open to the CEO and the Minister to conclude that it was likely that such activity would continue if the measures did not remain in place  The respondents accepted that the CEO was not empowered to make a recommendation under s  ZHF  on the mere possibility of dumping or on no more than speculation  but contended that the CEO had had a more solid foundation for the recommendation and had correctly applied the relevant test  The respondents contended that the CEO s conclusion that imports from Thailand actively competed on price with the product produced in Australia was open on the other findings in the Report notwithstanding that Siam s product was of a higher grade than Qenos   They pointed to the findings that the average price of Thai imports at the end of   was only slightly higher than Qenos  prices  despite Siam s being of a higher quality  and that the removal of duty from   January   would only have improved the competitive position of Siam s products  if measures were not in place  They referred to the fact that Report   had ascertained a non injurious price for Siam s products  They also relied on the Report s finding that Siam s product had a degree of substitutability that could cause injury to the Australian industry discussedUnited States Sunset Reviews of Anti Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina  AB    The respondents argued that s  TAE B  had a limited role  and operated only in the situation in which there were no measures in place  They argued that s  TAE B  had no relevance to an assessment of dumping  as opposed to material injury  The respondents contended that s  ZHF  stated its own test for the purposes of a review under Div  A of Pt XVB   and it was not constrained by  and applied in a different situation to  the test for imposing the measures originally under s  TG    using s  TAE B   In addition  the respondents argued that they had considered the changes in market conditions  including that the market had continued to slow  in assessing that injury was likely  not merely threatened  They argued that there was also evidence of current pricing that would cause injury but for the measures and that sales at dumped prices would be below the non injurious price  They relied on the decision of the WTO appellate body in United States Sunset Reviews of Anti Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina  AB     at     as supporting the approach that they had taken  ISSUE THREE   Should the respondents have excluded any factor other than Siam s exportation to Australia in considering whether any injury to Qenos was threatened Siam argued that the CEO made no findings in Report   about Siam or its relationship to any material  or other  injury to Qenos from dumping  Rather  Siam complained that the Report merely asserted  without any analysis or reasoning  that Customs had not attributed any potential injury from other factors as increasing any potential injury from dumping  It contended that s  TAE A  required the respondents  first  to consider whether any other factors were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the Australian industry and  secondly  not to attribute that injury to any such factor  The WTO Appellate Body found that it was necessary to conduct an analysis that rested on a sufficient factual basis in order for the anti dumping agency to determine the likelihood of an injury based on  reasoned and adequate conclusions  Oil Country Tubular Goods  AB     at    In arriving at a conclusion under s  TAE  the Minister must take account of the matters prescribed in ss  TAE B  and  TAE A   Thus  the question of the foreseeability and imminence of the threat of material injury must be addressed by eliminating factors other than the exportation of Siam s dumped goods in considering whether that dumping alone would be likely to lead to material injury to Qenos if the measures expired  The other aspect of a consideration whether an injury is caused or threatened is that the injury under consideration must be  itself  material  Once again  the imposition of measures is not authorised unless there is more than just a mere injury actual or threatened  Part XVB requires that the injury have the character of materiality to an Australian industry producing like goods  Thus  in arriving at a reasoned and adequate conclusion based on sufficient facts for the purposes of imposing or reviewing the existing or continuation of measures  the Minister must address the question of the materiality of any injury that is under consideration  Here  Report   adverted to a number of relevant changes in circumstances  First  it noted the removal of Customs duty from   January    This factor could impact on the market in Australia immediately following the period of review ending in the December   quarter  And  Report   noted that regional markets had begun to slow  which  it suggested  was likely to create an environment where Qenos was more susceptible to injury caused by dumping  It also concluded that Qenos  performance showed some signs of deterioration towards the end of the five quarters examined
