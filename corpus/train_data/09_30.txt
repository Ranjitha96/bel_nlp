 French J  as he then was  in Cabal and Another v United Mexican States and Others  No     FCA         ALR     Cabal   at     said      The requirement that the grounds for believing there to be an

were cited with approval by the Full Court in Cabal and Another v United Mexican States and Others   FCA         FCR     Cabal   at      The extent of the phrase  material that was before the magistrate  was considered by French J in Cabal   at   where his Honour said      Upon review by this court under s   the material proffered to the magistrate by the parties and received in evidence is plainly material that was before the magistrate for the purposes of s  d   So too  in my opinion  is material that was proffered to the magistrate and was rejected by her  At   French J said      In summary  I have come to the following conclusions in relation to the materials before the magistrate which may be considered by the court upon review under s    It is not suggested that these are exhaustive propositions  but they are reached in the light of the particular debate in this case      The materials before the magistrate comprise the testimony  documents and things which were received by the magistrate in evidence and those which were tendered to the magistrate but not accepted in evidence      The court upon review is not limited to consideration of material received by the magistrate in evidence but may have regard to other material tendered to the magistrate but not received in evidence  On appeal to the Full Court in Cabal   there was no issue between the parties that the material which could be considered by the reviewing court comprised material which had been rejected by the Magistrate  Accordingly  this question was not determined by the Full Court  However  their Honours expressed concern at some of the difficulties that may arise from French J s interpretation  stating at       Both at first instance and on appeal the parties proceeded on the basis that the review required to be heard by the Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory was in the nature of a rehearing  but subject to the provisions of s  d  of the Act which confine the Court hearing the review to the material which was before the magistrate  Likewise the parties agreed that when s  d  referred to the material  that was before the magistrate  that included not only material which the magistrate had admitted into evidence  but also material tendered by either the extradition country or the person in respect of whom the extradition application was made  which  for whatever reasons  was rejected by the magistrate and accordingly not taken into account by her  At least the latter of these propositions is not self evident  if only because it would permit the judge conducting the review to consider material not capable of being tested by cross examination or which might  had it been admitted  have led to the calling of other evidence  Clearly s  d  would not permit any cross examination on that evidence to take place or further evidence to be considered  However  as the parties proceeded on that basis before us we are content to accept for the purposes of the appeal the correctness of this construction of s  d   In Cabal   at   French J was not constrained by the provisions of the Evidence Act    Cth   the Evidence Act   in determining what material was admissible in a review under s   of the Extradition Act   His Honour said      In considering whether there are substantial grounds for believing that an extradition objection is made out for the purposes of s     neither the court nor the magistrate is limited to evidence admissible  according to the rules of evidence  to demonstrate that the fact constituting the objection exists  The Court is mindful of the observations of French J in Cabal   at   where his Honour said      The very nature of those objections  the objections are referred to in s  b  and  c  of the Extradition Act   is such that the evidence relied upon to make them out or to show substantial grounds for believing that they exist may be indirect or circumstantial in character     French J s observations must be read in the context of his finding at   namely that this Court is not bound by the rules of evidence in conducting a s   review  As discussed above  the Full Court decisions in Cabal   and Dutton v O Shane have established that this Court is bound to apply the provisions of the Evidence Act when conducting the review  Although the evidence essentially relates to the applicant s apprehension rather than to any facts  the Court is mindful of the observations of French J in Cabal   at    The Court considers that such evidence should be admitted given the nature of the application before the Court  The Court admits those portions of paragraphs         and   which were before the Magistrate subject to the deletion from paragraph   of the section commencing  Gotovina has been indicted     and concluding     in the Milosevic trial  which is not relied upon by the applicant  Statement of Savo Strbac Paragraphs   to   and    except for the last sentence  of the statement of Savo Strbac are relied upon by the applicant  Mr Strbac is a former Magistrate in the Local Court in Benkovac and a former Judge of the District Court in Zadar  In   Mr Strbac founded Veritas  a non government organisation which monitors the treatment of Serbians by Croatian authorities in the territory of the Republic of Croatia and the former Republic of Serbian Krajina  The respondent objects to the admission of the above paragraphs on the grounds of opinion and relevance referred toDamir Travica v The Government of Croatia   EWHC    Admin The Court also notes the decision of the High Court of Justice in Damir Travica v The Government of Croatia   EWHC    Admin  in which Lord Justice Laws considered an issue under s  d  of the Extradition Act    UK  which is in substantially the same terms as s  c  of the Extradition Act  In such decision Laws LJ observed at   that the Extradition Act    UK  could not be construed as conferring such a wide power of judgment over the practices of a foreign state as to warrant refusal of an extradition where an applicant will face a fair trial but complains that members of other groups would not have to face trial at all  Accordingly  any discrepancy between the number of Croatians and Serbians prosecuted in the Republic of Croatia is irrelevant in this Court s consideration of whether the applicant would suffer prejudice at his trial by virtue of his race  nationality or political opinion  The applicant s contention does not lead to the conclusion that he would not be afforded a fair trial in the Republic of Croatia  As to the alleged disparity in convictions between Serbians and Croatians  the Court observes that such alleged disparity may be a consequence of the disproportionate number of prosecutions against Serbians compared to Croatians  It is not possible to infer prejudice by the Croatian judiciary based upon the conviction data provided by Mr Strbac since the judiciary has not been involved in the prosecution process which has resulted in the disproportionate number of Serbian convictions  As considered above  discrepancy in the number of prosecutions is irrelevant to the review before the Court  Similarly  any discrepancy in convictions which results from discrepancy in prosecutions is also irrelevant  The Court would need to have before it evidence that the disproportionate number of convictions arose independently of the number of prosecutions before it could be satisfied that there might be a basis for finding prejudice by the judiciary  Reversal of convictions In Travica Laws LJ observed at   that the conflict between Serbia and the Republic of Croatia and its after effects have been  especially acute In the Krajina region    However  Laws LJ also observed at   that such circumstance did not by itself constitute a claim of prejudice  not least when set against the signs of improvement in the conduct of prosecutions which I have surveyed  and which cannot have failed altogether to touch the Krajina region    At   Laws LJ also made comment of the  signal progress made in Croatia towards a justice system which meets international standards    His Lordship s observations are consistent with the evidence contained in the reports referred to above  Ground     Conclusion The Court has considered the applicant s evidence and finds that there is no specific evidence of pre trial bias against the applicant  nor is there a nexus established between the applicant s apprehension and the question of whether he would be prejudiced at his trial  Further  the evidence before the Court establishes that the Croatian judiciary is capable of providing a fair trial to the applicant  The Court is not satisfied that the evidence establishes that there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant may be prejudiced at his trial or otherwise prejudiced as provided by s  c  of the Extradition Act  Ground   Abuse of processreferred toDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Edelsten  unreported  Burchett J    March  The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process was traditionally exercised to prevent its jurisdiction being used  for a purpose other than that for which the proceedings are properly designed and exist    see Spautz v Williams     NSWLR   at   per Hunt J  In Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Another   FCA         FCR     Burchett J at     quoted his decision in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Edelsten  unreported  Burchett J    March   where his Honour  having reviewed the authorities said      These authorities unite in seeing as crucial the purpose for which the process is used  It is the illegitimacy of the purpose that makes the abuse followedDutton v O Shane and Another   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Dutton v O Shane and Another   FCAFC         ALR   the Full Court considered whether the Magistrate s rulings as to the admissibility of documentary evidence were reviewable by the Court  Finn and Dowsett JJ at   said      As we understand it in light of the second respondent s additional submissions  the magistrate s rulings  which cover about   pages of transcript  were made in light of her consideration of the contents of the documents themselves and of the character of the material in question  that is   relevance   unqualified opinion   unfairly prejudicial  etc   Though finding the  excluded  material not to have utility in the resolution of the question before her  the magistrate nonetheless engaged in  an active intellectual process  in relation to that material  cf Tickner v Chapman     FCR   at   Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health and Medical Research Council     FCR   at  ff    ALR   at   in and for the purposes of the s   determination  In light of her rulings  the magistrate may not have regarded the material as  admissible evidence  on the issue she had to determine  However  those rulings did not rob that material of the character of  material that was before the magistrate  for s  d  purposes  They merely made it material that was disregarded  In view of the above authorities  it is now established that the Court may take into account as constituting  material that was before the magistrate  any material that was admitted by the Magistrate as well as any material that was rejected by the Magistrate provided that in the course of rejecting the material the Magistrate had engaged in  an active intellectual process  in relation to that material  The Evidence Act However  in Cabal   the Full Court found that although the magistrate is not bound by the Evidence Act   the reviewing court is  At   the Full Court said      Proceedings for review brought in this Court under s   of the  Extradition Act  are subject to the operation of the provisions of the  Evidence Act  notwithstanding the fact that those provisions are not applicable to the initial proceedings brought before a magistrate under s   of the  Extradition Act      The Court observes that the Full Court in Dutton v O Shane at   confirmed that the reviewing court is bound to apply the Evidence Act   A review under s   of the Extradition Act is in essence a rehearing subject to the limitation posed by s  d  of the Extradition Act   see Cabal   at   Dutton v O Shane at    However  if a magistrate and the reviewing court are subject to different legislative regimes governing admissibility  and in particular if the reviewing court is subject to the regime of the Evidence Act   the ability of that court to consider material that was before a magistrate may be significantly restricted  An extradition objection framed under s  c  of the Extradition Act requires an applicant to demonstrate  inter alia  that there are substantial grounds for believing that the extradition country s judiciary may be prejudiced against that applicant  Given the nature of such a task  it is possible that the evidence available to an applicant would be scarce  It seems incongruous that sections of that applicant s evidence should be excised in a court that is ostensibly conducting a rehearing based on the material that was before the magistrate  The Court is mindful of the observations of French J in Cabal   at   where his Honour said      The very nature of those objections  the objections are referred to in s  b  and  c  of the Extradition Act   is such that the evidence relied upon to make them out or to show substantial grounds for believing that they exist may be indirect or circumstantial in character     French J s observations must be read in the context of his finding at   namely that this Court is not bound by the rules of evidence in conducting a s   review  As discussed above  the Full Court decisions in Cabal   and Dutton v O Shane have established that this Court is bound to apply the provisions of the Evidence Act when conducting the review  French J in Cabal   held that material that was accepted by the magistrate constituted material that was before the magistrate  As the Magistrate did not reject the reports it is accordingly not necessary to consider whether he engaged in an  active intellectual process  in relation to such reports  see Dutton v O Shane at    In these circumstances  the Court accepts the submission of the applicant that such reports constituted material which was  before the magistrate    The respondent also objects to the tender of the Amnesty Report on the basis that such report contains remote hearsay  Such report is relied upon by the applicant as  background  to the Serbian and Croatian dispute  The Court finds that the Amnesty Report contains hearsay and anecdotal material and therefore does not comply with the requirements of the Evidence Act   Accordingly the Amnesty Report is not admitted referred toJago v The District Court of New South Wales and Others   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe applicant relies upon the judgment of Mason CJ in Jago v The District Court of New South Wales and Others   HCA         CLR    In those proceedings the question arose whether a permanent stay should be granted in view of a delay in the prosecution of six years after the defendant had been charged with certain offences  The High Court of Australia held that the Court s power to prevent abuse of process in criminal proceedings extends to a power to prevent unfairness to the accused  At     Mason CJ stated      The continuation of processes which will culminate in an unfair trial can be seen as a  misuse of the Court process  which will constitute an abuse of process because the public interest in holding a trial does not warrant the holding of an unfair trial  Finally  it should be observed that the applicant s reliance upon Jago is misplaced as the current proceedings do not relate to a criminal trial  see Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth of Australia and Others   HCA         CLR   at    Jago was concerned with the power of the High Court to prevent abuses of process in criminal proceedings  This Court is only concerned to determine whether the order of the Magistrate that the applicant is eligible for surrender to the Republic of Croatia in relation to the extradition offences should be upheld

an abuse of process can be sustained under Chapter III of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act    Cth   the Constitution   since at no earlier stage prior to the institution of these proceedings has the judicial power of the Commonwealth been invoked  see Pasini v United Mexican States and Others   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  The Court observes that even if a stay of proceedings could have been warranted of the present proceedings before this Court on the ground of delay  it would not affect the determination of the Magistrate that the applicant was eligible for surrender pursuant to s   of the Extradition Act  nor would it affect the order under s   that the applicant be committed to prison to await surrender  see Pasini at   per Kirby J followedRahardja v Republic of Indonesia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Rahardja v Republic of Indonesia   FCA   the Full Court at   found that even if Indonesian authorities were more disposed to not prosecute a non Chinese Indonesian rather than a Chinese Indonesian  such fact did not establish that  there are substantial grounds for believing that Mr Rahardja may be prejudiced at his trial or punished by reason of his race   emphasis in original   The Full Court held at   that the question whether persons of a different ethnic background would have a better chance of avoiding trial is not a relevant consideration  as    t  he question is what will happen at trial or on sentence   referred toRe Colina and Another  Ex parte Torney   HCA

usually  fall into three categories  namely where the Court s procedures are invoked for an illegitimate purpose  where the use of the Court s procedures is unjustifiably oppressive to one of the parties  and where the use of the Court s procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute referred toSankey v Whitlam and Others   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe extradition offences with which the applicant is charged cannot be characterised as offences against a Commonwealth law since the offences do not arise under a law made by the Commonwealth Parliament  In Sankey v Whitlam and Others   HCA         CLR     the High Court confirmed the need for an exercise of power by the Commonwealth Parliament in enacting legislation before a law can be said to be a Commonwealth law  see Gibbs ACJ at     Stephen J at   Aickin J at    Any similarity between the offences with which the applicant is charged in the Republic of Croatia and the possibility of the existence of an equivalent criminal offence in Australia is irrelevant  Section   of the Constitution does not apply because the applicant has not been charged with a Commonwealth criminal offence  It follows from the above finding  namely that s   of the Constitution does not apply  that there is no requirement under Australian law that the applicant be tried by jury  Accordingly the submission that the applicant has the right to be tried by jury  and that such right will be lost to him if he is tried in the Republic of Croatia  is rejected  It follows that the submission of the applicant that there is no evidence that the Republic of Croatia has the facilities to accommodate a jury trial is irrelevant referred toSpautz v Williams     NSWLR  The inherent
