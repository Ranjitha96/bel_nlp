followedClark v ING Life Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs I observed in Clark v ING Life Ltd   FCA   at   it is not the function of the Court to make a prediction as to the outcome of a hypothetical case  Both parties urged on   April   that the proceedings cease  At that time  the proceedings were treated by the parties as being under Pt IVA  I was not prepared to grant leave to discontinue on the scant evidence as it then stood or to exercise any power under s  V   After the applicants indicated that they wished to discontinue  it was reasonable for both them and the State to have conducted themselves as they did  I am not satisfied that Mr Wotton acted unreasonably in bringing these proceedings in his own right  Mrs Wotton s position received no separate attention in any party s submissions  I am not in a position to conclude that she acted unreasonably  It is appropriate to treat Mrs Wotton s position cognately with that of her husband  This is because of her relationship to Mr Wotton  his circumstances as revealed in the evidence and the absence of any suggestion by the respondents that Mrs Wotton in her own right acted unreasonably  I am not satisfied that Mr Wotton had no reasonable prospect of obtaining an extension of time in respect of his own claims  given his involvement in the criminal proceedings  his subsequent conviction and incarceration  However  that issue has not yet been determined  The proceedings were more complicated than necessary  Because of the overlap of the foreshadowed representative proceedings and the misconceived joinder of the other respondents Mr and Mrs Wotton should bear some costs of those complications but not the costs of the whole proceedings citedCollins v The Queen   HCA         CLR

application to allow further time under s  PO  would not preclude a further application  although it would be difficult to imagine that  in the ordinary course  any such further application would have any prospects of being granted unless some significant new matter had come to light since the earlier refusal  There is  of course  a distinction between an application for leave or special leave to appeal to a court and one to extend the time within which proceedings under s  PO  might be brought  In the former case the parties  rights have been determined already by the judgment or order which is to be the subject of an appeal if leave or special leave were granted  cp Jackamarra v Krakouer   HCA         CLR   at           per Brennan CJ and McHugh JJ  An order under s  PO  allowing an extension of time in which to make an application under s  PO    if granted  entitles the affected person to have his or her allegation of unlawful discrimination heard and determined by the Court  If an extension of time is not allowed  then a respondent to the complaint before the Commission cannot be sued under s  PO in respect of the alleged unlawful discrimination  Hence  unless and until  the Court allows further time under s  PO  to make an application more than   days after the issue of a notice of termination  proceedings of the kind brought by the applicants here are in the nature of a mere application to the Court for permission to commence proceedings  That permission is given if the Court allows further time under s  PO  to file a substantive application alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more respondents  If the Court does not allow further time under s  PO    there is no application made invoking the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the allegation of unlawful discrimination within the meaning of s  PO  notwithstanding the form of the initiating process or application filed  Thus  I am of opinion that the applicants have not made an application under s  PO  at this time  Rather  they have made an application under s  PO  seeking further time in which to bring proceedings under s  PO   The jurisdiction that the application filed on   March   invoked was confined to the issue in the last clause of s  PO   That jurisdiction required the Court to hear and determine only whether the applicants should be allowed further time  beyond   days after   September   in which to make an application alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint appliedMobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v

HCA  htmlIn my opinion this argument should be rejected  The onus of establishing an abuse of process is a heavy one  Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and McHugh JJ  Most proceedings are brought to obtain a vindication of rights either by a judgment of the Court or a negotiated settlement  I am not satisfied that there has been an abuse of the process of the Court by the applicants in bringing proceedings to seek to achieve such an outcome in the present case  There was no improper purpose of the applicants identified in their submissions  nor any abuse of the process of the Court  If the applicants did have an underlying basis for their claim of unlawful discrimination  they would be entitled to compensation either from a judgment or a settlement  And  merely because the applicants  solicitors recently concluded that the conduct of a representative proceeding would be difficult without the support of the Council  this did not entail that a settlement necessarily could not benefit group numbers  Next  the State argued that the proceedings had been brought in the New South Wales Registry of the Court when Moore J  in the earlier proceedings brought by Mr Wotton  had ordered the transfer of those proceedings to the Queensland Registry  The State argued that these proceedings should be seen as a continuation of the previous interlocutory application and that Mr and Mrs Wotton had flouted Moore J s direction to transfer the proceedings to the Queensland Registry  I reject this argument  These proceedings are new proceedings  The proceedings before Moore J concerned an early stage in the complaint process prior to the Commission having dealt with the complaint  These proceedings arise out of rights said to flow from the rejection of the complaint  In addition  the solicitors for the applicants and their counsel  who are in Sydney  are acting pro bono  I infer that it would be more difficult for them at this stage to conduct the proceedings in Brisbane or elsewhere in Queensland  even though they have travelled to Palm Island to assist the applicants in this and other matters  At the moment I am not satisfied that there was any abuse in commencing the proceedings here  although I have considerable sympathy with the proposition  implicit in the State s submissions  that a venue for trial of the proposed representative proceedings in Queensland would be likely to be more convenient and satisfactory than here  I am not satisfied that the State has established any improper purpose for the institution of these proceedings  On the evidence  the applicants appear to have had a proper purpose to vindicate the rights claimed  I reject the application for indemnity costs citedWong v Silkfield Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere is a further reason why the application under s  PO  for an extension of time would not amount to representative proceedings  That is because s  C c  requires that the claims of all of the group members give rise to a substantial common issue of fact or law   Substantial  in s  C c  means  real or of substance  Wong v Silkfield Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Callinan JJ  There is no evidence that the personal circumstances of Mr and Mrs Wotton  or the reasons why they did not make their application  even as a representative proceeding  within   days of   September   or now seek an allowance of further time to do so  involve any  let alone  substantial  common issue of fact or law that applies to all other group members  The only issues in this matter under s  C c  would be factual ones going to why the further time was required  I am not satisfied any substantial common question of fact or law exists so as to satisfy s  C c  that the present application to allow further time could be a proceeding under Pt IVA  It has not been argued or suggested that further time could have been allowed because of the late discovery of a factual or legal ground citedWotton v State of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn   March   shortly before his trial was to commence Mr Wotton lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  as the Australian Human Rights Commission was then called   The complaint alleged  among other matters  that the arrest  charging and prosecution of Mr Wotton contravened or would contravene the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   Mr Wotton sought an ex parte injunction under s  PP of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to restrain the holding of his criminal trial  Wotton v State of Queensland   FCA    Those proceedings purported to be instituted as representative proceedings under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act   In refusing the ex parte relief  Moore J noted that there had been considerable delay in the lodging of the complaint with the Commission  Wotton   FCA   at         His Honour said that he would express no view about whether those proceedings could have been brought as representative proceedings  Subsequently  at his trial Mr Wotton was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment  The complaint had been lodged with the Commission on   March   by Mr Wotton s solicitors  Messrs Levitt Robinson  It purported to have been made on behalf of Mr Wotton  his co accused and  all the black residents of Palm Island who were residents of the place on and between   and   November    The solicitors later supplemented the complaint with further submissions  The Commission accepted the complaint as being a representative complaint made on behalf of class members other than the unnamed co accused  The complaint was made against the State of Queensland  including the Queensland Police Service  the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Queensland Court of Appeal  It is not necessary to outline any matter in relation to the Queensland Court of Appeal since nothing was raised in the present proceedings in respect of that court  Some allegations made by Mr Wotton to the Commission were  subsequently  withdrawn by him  On   September   the then President  the Hon John von Doussa QC  signed a notice of termination pursuant to s  PH  of the Act on the grounds that he was satisfied that some aspects of the complaint were lacking in substance and or misconceived  in relation to one aspect of the complaint  some other more appropriate remedy was reasonably available to each of the complainants and the subject matter of one aspect of the complaint had been dealt with adequately by another statutory authority  He terminated the complaints against the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Queensland Court of Appeal on the basis that he was satisfied that those complaints were respectively lacking in substance and misconceived
