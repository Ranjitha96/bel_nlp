describe this business sale agreement as  the Mentone BSA   The second agreement  which was said to be partially written  and partially oral  was entered into on or about   September    That agreement  between Franklins and the applicant  involved them in jointly bringing proceedings  in the Supreme Court of Victoria  against the Lessor for unreasonably withholding consent to the assignment of the

To  Joanne Turner   Cc  Roger Stansfield  Jim Rush  Natalie Wilson   Subject  Mentone  Blake     Jo    Could you please let me know when you have managed to get Coles to call Susan Herbert  Landlord Solicitor     about advising her client that Coles have no interest in this property  As advised on Friday  this looks like going full on legal if we don t quash their perceived options    thanks    Alan  There is then a handwritten note on the print out of the email saying  John Kop please call   As previously mentioned  Mr Kop was the project manager for Project Lincoln within Coles   Under this is another handwritten note which states as follows     Alan    Mary has spoken to Coles  Coles have done a deal in principle here  based on vacant possession  Mary has told Coles that Franklins is going to litigate   hopefully scared them off with the threat of tortious interference   let alone jeopardising our deal with Coles on the whole     Jo    emphasis added  Many of the documents upon which the applicant relied in support of its circumstantial case were prepared by people who would not have been directly involved in any negotiations that took place between Franklins and Coles  and may not have known what was happening at the level that counted  For example  the Turner document  though capable of having the sinister connotation that the applicant placed upon it  it also perfectly capable of being read in an innocent light  One interpretation of the document is that Ms Turner did not appreciate that the agreement to sell the first tranche of stores to Coles had already been finalised ten days earlier  and that was the  deal with Coles on the whole  to which she was referring  The fact that Ms Turner was not called to give evidence lends some support to the applicant s case regarding the interpretation to be given to this document  See generally Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR    However  that does not  in my view  override the highly favourable impression that I formed of Mr Cornell as a witness in this proceeding   It is arguable that the applicant has a stronger case in relation to its claim that the November   dealings constituted a breach of Franklins  contractual obligations  The real substance of this claim is that Franklins  jumped the gun  in terms of seeking the ACCC s consent to sell the Mentone store to Coles  and in concluding an agreement with Coles to do so  It did both these things  according to the applicant  while it still owed obligations  both contractual and fiduciary  to the applicant   The Mentone BSA and the litigation agreement were both still on foot on   November    Notice to terminate these agreements was not served until   November    The Mentone BSA required seven business days notice to be terminated  Accordingly  the Mentone BSA remained on foot until   December    However  in relation to the litigation agreement  the applicant accepts that it came to an end on   November

Constructions  ME  Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works     NSWLR   In Renard Constructions  ME  Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works     NSWLR     Renard   Priestley JA commented upon the notion of implications on an ad hoc basis  His Honour said  at        Questions of construction and different kinds of implication tend to blur together  In recent years terms implied in contracts have been said to fall into two classes the first of which has come to be called  somewhat misleadingly  implication in fact  the second  implication by law  The so called implication in fact is really implication by judge based on the judge s view of the actual intention of the parties drawn from the surrounding circumstances of the particular contract  its language  and its purposes  as they emerge from the language and in the circumstances  This has been called implication ad hoc  see Professor Lucke  Ad Hoc Implications in Written Contracts        Adelaide Law Review   a usage I will

 The applicant contends that this term is to be implied by operation of law or  alternatively  on an ad hoc basis  It referred to Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments

relation to the implied term not to deprive a party of the benefit of that agreement  the applicant relies upon Shepherd v Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   where Dixon J stated that the express promise of the appellant to use his best endeavours to obtain fabric orders for the respondent fabric manufacturer  necessarily includes an obligation not to hinder or prevent

obligation not to hinder or prevent fulfilment of it citedUnited Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant relied upon the following passage in United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason  Brennan and Deane JJ to support its case     In particular  a fiduciary relationship with attendant fiduciary obligations may  and ordinarily will  exist between prospective partners who have embarked upon the conduct of the partnership business or venture before the precise terms of any partnership agreement have been settled  Indeed  in such circumstances  the mutual confidence and trust which underlie most consensual fiduciary relationships are likely to be more readily apparent than in the case where mutual rights and obligations have been expressly defined in some formal agreement  Likewise  the relationship between prospective partners or participants in a proposed partnership to carry out a single joint undertaking or endeavour will ordinarily be fiduciary if the prospective partners have reached an informal arrangement to assume such a relationship and have proceeded to take steps involved in its establishment or implementation   The relationship between Franklins and the applicant was not one of  mutual trust and confidence   The arrangements between Franklins and the applicant concerning the efforts to obtain the consent of the Lessor to the assignment of the Mentone store lease had a singularly fragile quality  They could be terminated on short notice  At the first directions hearing in the Supreme Court proceedings on   October   counsel then appearing for the applicant and Franklins submitted  in support of the application for expedition  that there was  nothing to stop the parties walking away   When counsel spoke of  the parties  he was referring to the applicant and Franklins  He also said that it was  a fair inference  given the nature of the commercial dealings between the parties  that the matter is quite fragile   That was an accurate statement of the parties  legal position vis a vis one another   The reality of the litigation agreement was that Franklins lent its name to the Supreme Court proceedings  but the applicant s solicitors  Mason Sier Turnball  and counsel conducted the proceedings  and the applicant funded them  However  at the same time  Franklins retained HWL to maintain what Mr Colbran QC  counsel for Franklins  described as a  supervising brief  over the proceedings
