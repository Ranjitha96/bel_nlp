cases cth FMCA  html  This is an appeal from a decision of Jarrett FM of   October     Gauci v Kennedy   FMCA   where his Honour summarily dismissed a claim of Mr Gauci  the appellant  for relief against the second respondent for a breach of Pt II Div   Sex Discrimination Act    Cth   SD Act    The claim was dismissed by the learned Federal Magistrate pursuant to Federal Magistrates Court Rules  FMCR  r     which reads as follows    The Court may order that a proceeding be stayed  or dismissed generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding  if it appears to the Court that   a  no reasonable cause of action is disclosed in relation to the proceeding or claim for relief  or   b  the proceeding or claim for relief is frivolous or vexatious  or   c  the proceeding or claim for relief is an abuse of the process of the Court   The notice of appeal then contains several pages of submissions in relation to the issue of alleged sex discrimination by the second respondent  paras      The appellant is not however appealing against this part of the decision of his Honour   indeed  his Honour found in favour of the appellant on this issue in the context of the summary dismissal application brought by the second respondent  Gauci   FMCA   at         In my view the issues raised by the appellant in paras     of his notice of appeal are not properly the subject of appeal  and are not relevant to the matter before me   Finally however  the appellant does appeal against the finding of his Honour that the conduct of the first respondent was not sexual harassment of the appellant  and accordingly that even assuming that the first respondent was at all material times an employee or servant of the second respondent  there were no facts alleged that would or could amount to sexual harassment by the first respondent of the appellant   Gauci   FMCA   at       In relation to this issue  his Honour found as follows       His evidence is that the first respondent persistently pursued his romantic attention  There is no claim in his material  however  that the first respondent subjected him to an unwelcome sexual advance or made to him an unwelcome request for sexual favours  At best  she asked him to go for coffee on two occasions  pizza on one occasion and to a movie on a fourth occasion  Apart from the comment made soon after their first meeting that the applicant had nice eyes  the conversation between them was unremarkable     The making of a complaint of sexual harassment against the applicant to the second respondent cannot in the circumstances relied upon by the applicant  amount to sexual harassment for the purposes of the SDA  It might be the case that the first respondent was intent on pursuing an intimate  indeed sexual  relationship with the applicant and when he spurned her she became difficult   but that is not prohibited by the Act  It might be the case that the first respondent s actions could amount to harassment within the ordinary meaning of that word  but that is not enough to establish a breach of the SDA     Thus  even making the assumptions I have set out above in favour of the applicant  it seems to me that this aspect of the claim against the second respondent is bound to fail   The grounds of appeal in this respect are that         His Honour erred in his determination that the alleged acts against him by the first respondent did not amount to sexual harassment  and     His Honour did not properly interpret s  A SD Act    In response the second respondent submitted that        Jarrett FM was correct in finding that the alleged conduct of the first respondent was not capable of amounting to sexual harassment within the meaning of s  A SD Act   and accordingly there was no conduct in respect of which the second respondent could be liable    even if that were not so  the learned Federal Magistrate s orders should be upheld on the alternative basis that it is not alleged and it is not open on the facts to conclude that the university is vicariously liable for the alleged conduct of the first respondent under s   SD Act     the other matters that the applicant seeks to raise in the appeal are not properly the subject of the appeal   The proceedings before me do not directly involve the first respondent  However the first respondent has also filed written submissions before me  in which she denies the alleged unlawful sexual harassment and submits that as the complaint of sexual harassment against her has been properly dismissed by Jarrett FM  there is no conduct in respect of which the second respondent can be liable   While I concur with the observations of his Honour that the conduct of the first respondent could constitute harassment  I disagree with his Honour s conclusion in Gauci   FMCA   at   that the harassment was clearly such that it did not breach the SD Act    Sexual harassment  is defined in s  A of the Act as follows      For the purposes of this Division  a person sexually harasses another person  the person harassed   if         a  the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance  or an unwelcome request for sexual favours  to the person harassed  or   b  engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed        in circumstances in which a reasonable person  having regard to all the circumstances  would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended  humiliated or intimidated    In this section      conduct of a sexual nature   includes making a statement of a sexual nature to a person  or in the presence of a person  whether the statement is made orally or in writing relatedGauci v Kennedy   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   July   I granted the appellant leave to file and serve out of time a notice of appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM  and leave to appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM  Gauci v Kennedy   FCA    The background and facts of this matter are set out in that decision  and I explained in some detail principles referable to summary dismissal  It is unnecessary to repeat those principles here  other than to acknowledge that the power to dismiss an application summarily must be exercised with great caution and only in the clearest of cases   In relation to the application for summary dismissal by the second respondent  the learned Federal Magistrate recognised the caution with which such applications should be approached  His Honour examined the relevant legislation  in particular ss          A    F         and   of the SD Act    His Honour was satisfied that        no conduct of the second respondent constituted sexual harassment of the appellant  and    while conduct of the first respondent could amount to harassment of the appellant within the ordinary meaning of the word  that conduct was not enough to establish a breach of the SD Act   Therefore even assuming that the first respondent was at all material times an employee of the second respondent  this aspect of the claim against the second respondent was bound to fail   However  his Honour did not accept the submissions of the second respondent that the appellant s claim of sex discrimination should be summarily dismissed  and this aspect of the appellant s claim remains currently before his Honour   His Honour made the following substantive orders        That the applicant s claim for relief against the second respondent for a breach of any provision of Part II Division   of the Sex Discrimination Act   be dismissed  and    That otherwise the second respondent s application filed on   November   be dismissed   At the hearing before me the second respondent was represented by solicitors  Neither the appellant nor the first respondent were legally represented   A number of the submissions of the parties went to the issues for determination before the Federal Magistrate rather than the issue of whether the learned Federal Magistrate was correct to summarily dismiss the application  The question before me is whether any submissions made at the appeal persuade me that this matter should not be revisited in full by the Federal Magistrates Court   Consideration of the issue whether the conduct of the first respondent did constitute sexual harassment within the meaning of s  A SD Act did  in my view  give rise to a real question to be determined between the parties  In this respect  I repeat the observations I made in Gauci   FCA   at      Having heard the submissions of the parties I consider that the case against the appellant was not so very clear as to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent him submitting his case for determination  Accordingly  in my view the learned Federal Magistrate should not have summarily dismissed the applicant s claim against the second respondent in respect of Pt II Div   SD Act   to the extent that no facts were alleged that would or could amount to sexual harassment by the first respondent of the appellant   The matter should be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court to be heard in full by his Honour and determined on the submissions of the parties at trial   THE COURT ORDERS THAT         The appeal be allowed      The decision of Jarrett FM delivered on   October   that the appellant s claim for relief against the second respondent for a breach of any provision of Pt II Div   of the Sex Discrimination Act    Cth  be dismissed to the extent that no facts were alleged that would or could amount to sexual harassment by the first respondent of the appellant  be set aside      The application be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for directions and determination    I certify that the preceding

austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Rana v University of South Australia   FCA         FCR   in considering an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate to summarily dismiss an application  Lander J made a number of observations which are applicable to the case before me  His Honour said at        The need for caution must be even more obvious in the Federal Magistrates Court when considering an application to summarily dismiss a claim for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action    There are no pleadings  There is  therefore  no concise document from which one can easily discern the existence or otherwise of a cause of action       The Court  on hearing an application under FMC Rules      c  and     could not be expected to weigh the evidence of the parties to determine whether the applicant had disclosed a reasonable cause of action  Again  that would amount to a trial of the action  What the applicant must disclose is a reasonable cause of action   not that on the evidence presently available the applicant will succeed on that cause of action        Summary dismissal  should only be adopted when it is clear  beyond any doubt  that the applicant has not  and cannot  articulate in writing a reasonable cause of action  As I have already said  the philosophy of the Federal Magistrates Court is to provide inexpensive justice and a streamlined dispute resolution process  Litigants will often be self represented and the documents they rely on as founding their claim will no doubt often be imprecisely articulated  In those circumstances  there is even more reason for the Federal Magistrates Court to be cautious before summarily dismissing an applicant s claim  citedre Morton  ex parte Mitchell Products Pty Ltd     ACSR
