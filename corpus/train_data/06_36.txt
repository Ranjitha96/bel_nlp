would be appropriately exercised  there were two obvious candidates for such exercise   cases in which the history of non compliance     is such as to indicate an inability or unwillingness to co operate with the Court and the other party or parties in having the matter ready for trial within an acceptable period and cases     in which the non compliance is continuing and occasioning

cases cth federal ct  html  When applying these principles  the Court must balance the need for the expeditious conduct of litigation  particularly in a court committed to a case management system  and the  the strong reluctance of courts to prevent litigants having a proper opportunity to present their cases  KM   A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung   FCA   per Tamberlin J  Ms Wu s motion must also be considered in light of the other powers of the Court to sanction non compliance  such as the use of costs orders   The history of this matter is troubling  The first and second respondents have been in default numerous times in the course of this proceeding  They filed their first lists of discoverable documents on   February   over three months after the original deadline and over a month after orders by consent that they be filed by   January    Moreover  these lists were filed only after Ms Wu brought two motions for compliance  Subsequent to this  Ms Wu has been required to take extraordinary steps to secure inspection of documents   In addition  it is clear that Ms Wu has been frustrated by other action  or inaction  by these respondents  even if not amounting to non compliance with court orders  The application for substituted service  the initial failure to seek to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss  the failure of the respondents personally to attend mediation  the resignation of Barry Armitage from office in Avin  and the frequent changes in legal representation are matters that have undoubtedly caused Ms Wu vexation and have made the conduct of litigation more difficult than it would otherwise have been  Having regard to their conduct  I find that the first and second respondents have failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence  They are therefore in default for the purposes of O  A r  h  of the Rules referred toAustralian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Despite this conclusion and the unsatisfactory history of the proceeding  I would not at this stage make orders precisely in the terms of the present motion  Instead  pursuant to O  A r  e  I would order that judgment for   and interest thereon against the first and second respondents be given under O  A r  c  if the first and second respondents do not comply with the costs order that I propose to make  see below   I would not order that judgment be entered without more because  following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss  there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents  part  If Barry Armitage s evidence is accepted  there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents  Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena  Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss  custody  Ultimately  the credibility  or lack thereof  of Barry Armitage s claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial  see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Nicholson J  Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation   I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays  These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation  Moreover  although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu s solicitor  they have filed their defence  various affidavits responding to Ms Wu s claims and lists of discoverable documents  They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor  Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss  in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents  discovered documents   In these circumstances  any prejudice caused to Ms Wu can  at this stage  be met by an appropriate costs order  subject to an entitlement to enter judgment in the event of non compliance with such an order  Plainly enough  this is not to condone the delay occasioned by Avin and Barry Armitage  and this is not an invitation to them to continue to litigate this matter in the unsatisfactory manner they have thus far done  As indicated below  it is appropriate that they pay Ms Wu s costs of the motion on an indemnity basis  and  since they are in fact in default  that there be orders of the kind contemplated by O  A r  e   I also note that there is again apparently no solicitor on the record  The repeated last minute retainer of solicitor and counsel to is mischievous since it militates against the efficient conduct of the litigation  The evidence of Mr Liberogiannis about the Armitages  failure to cooperate with their legal advisers is concerning  Nothing in these reasons would preclude Ms Wu from bringing fresh
