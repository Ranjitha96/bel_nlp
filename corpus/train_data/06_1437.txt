Vintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited  No     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedJennings v Credit Corp Australia Pty Ltd   NSWSC         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  I also note that in Jennings v Credit Corp Australia Pty Ltd   NSWSC         NSWLR   an assignment of the legal ownership of a debt was made after the expiry of the limitation period  The Court permitted the substitution of the new legal owner   The question is whether Errol Nominees  if it were the trustee  is added or substituted as a party  It is not uncommon for trustees to be changed  In ordinary circumstances it should not follow that questions of limitation thereby arise  If in such a case  the new trustee were added rather than substituted  the beneficiaries would lose their rights to bring proceedings  Consistent with the provisions of the Trustee Act and the authorities I have cited  I am of the view that the amendment sought is best characterised as a substitution   The fact  however  is that the condition that gives rise to amendment under O   r   has not occurred as there has not yet been a passing of interest by assignment or otherwise  The occasion has not arisen to make the order for substitution sought citedVintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As set out in Vintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited   FCA   at     Vintage  No     the further amended statement of claim was filed with the leave of the Court  which leave  obtained in November   and prior to the expiry of the limitation period  did not extend to joining Mr Johnston  I gave leave for that joinder on   May   and no further order was sought from the applicants as to leave to file a second further amended application and statement of claim   The submission now is that  despite the decision in Vintage  No     this is the first amendment to the application and statement of claim to effect that joinder  so that the proposed second further amended statement of claim discloses a new  and statute barred  cause of action as against Mr Johnston   In Vintage  No     I granted leave to join Mr Johnston to the proceedings  That is  he was joined to the proceedings as pleaded in the pleadings filed on   December    Those pleadings constitute the original claim against him  The circumstances  put shortly  were that an amended application and further amended statement of claim were filed within the limitation period naming Mr Johnston as a respondent  Leave that had been given to file the amended documents did not extend to leave to include Mr Johnston as a respondent  nor to include allegations or orders against him  Many of the arguments put by Ms Richards were canvassed in Vintage  No     It is the case  as I noted at   and   that leave was not sought further to amend the amended statement of claim to permit the pleading against Mr Johnston  as pleaded in the further amended statement of claim  However  as I discussed at   the further amended statement of claim filed within time may be considered as a fresh pleading as against Mr Johnston  It was put in Vintage  No   that Mr Johnston should not be joined because it was a futility as the limitation period would apply because the proceedings had not commenced on   December   but would only commence on the date of joinder  I rejected that submission citedWorrell v Westpac Banking Corporation     FCR   The rights of Errol Nominees do not extend back to the date on which proceedings were commenced  cf Worrell v Westpac Banking Corporation     FCR    Indeed the rights of the proposed party have not yet come into existence  What is proposed  however  is that the rights of the new trustee will substitute for the rights of the existing trustee  which do extend back to the date on which proceedings were commenced   A new trustee may by registered deed be appointed in place of a trustee  s   Trustee Act    NSW    Trustee Act    Section   provides that a new trustee appointed under this section may in all respects act as if the new trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument creating the trust  Errol Investments submits that this is reflected in O   r   which should therefore be applied citedYorkshire Regional Health Authority v Fairclough Building Ltd     All ER   In Yorkshire Regional Health Authority v Fairclough Building Ltd     All ER   the United Kingdom Court of Appeal considered the meaning of a  new claim  in s   of the Limitation Act    UK  and O   r   of the Rules of the Supreme Court  UK  as those provisions then provided  Order   r   relevantly provided        Where a party to an action dies or becomes bankrupt but the cause of action survives  the action shall not abate by reason of the death or bankruptcy                Where at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter the interest or liability of any party is assigned or transmitted to or devolves upon some other person  the Court may  if it thinks it necessary in order to ensure that all matters in dispute in the cause or matter may be effectively and completely determined and adjudicated upon  order that other person to be made a party to the cause or matter and the proceedings to be carried on as if he had been substituted for the first mentioned party   The Court observed that the rule of court  which is cast in similar but not identical terms to O   r   of the Rules contains no reference to limitation and commented  t  his is as it should be  since the circumstances in which the rule may be invoked do not give rise to any question of limitation    at    The Court recognised that the new party is substituted because he or she has succeeded to a claim or liability already represented in the action and sues or is sued in respect of the existing cause of action  It concluded that   the expiry of the limitation period is completely irrelevant    at    While the English O   r   specifically provided for   the proceedings to be carried on as if he had been substituted for the first mentioned party   and those words are not present in O   r   of the Rules  the logic of the Court of Appeal is persuasive
