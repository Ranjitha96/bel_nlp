cases cth federal ct  html  The respondents point out that ss   and   are to be contrasted  Section   does not authorise the Commission to delegate its statutory functions and powers to its own staff members  It may only delegate those functions and powers to a member of the Commission  see also the definition of  Commission  in s   which includes a member of the Commission or a Division of the Commission performing functions of the Commission  By referring to a member of the Commission or a Division of the Commission  the definition is referring to members to whom a power has been delegated under s   and a Division established under s   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd  No      FCA         FCR   at      The respondents say that the Act has expressly regulated the extent to which the Commission may delegate the exercise of its powers and functions  Certain powers are expressly conferred on a member of the Commission  as opposed to the Commission acting in a meeting  e g  issuing a notice under s    Otherwise the powers and functions vested in the Commission are intended to be exercised by members of the Commission acting in a meeting at which a quorum is present or through a Division established by s     or through a member acting under a delegation under s     The conclusion  the respondents submit  is that the Act contains a clear statutory indication that the Commission is not to delegate to one or more members of its staff the power to decide whether to institute proceedings under Pt VI  This is consistent with the Commission s published documents  For example  in a public statement in   the Commission said   Decisions to start court action  to approve or reject a major merger  or to authorise anti competitive behaviour if it is shown to be in the public interest  are only made by the Commission  appliedMeridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission     AC   The reasonable anticipation test is not a question of the exercise of some power by the Commission  such as the power to commence litigation  It is rather concerned with a state of mind which may or may not exist at a particular point in time

principle now endorsed by the High Court in Esso at   is that of the minority judgment of Barwick CJ in Grant v Downs   HCA         CLR   at    A  document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author  or of the person or authority under whose direction  whether particular or general  it was produced or brought into existence  of using it or its

complaint was made as to the ACCC s original list of documents dated   July    The ACCC served a revised list on   November   which included  as requested  information setting out  whether the statements were prepared by the ACCC or the AGS or counsel   The ACCC submits  and I accept  that it is not obliged to state the name of the author of each individual discovered document  No authority was cited for that proposition  The purpose of the requirement that a document be described is simply that the other party may know from the description whether or not it should be inspected and so that it can be identified subsequently  Australian Flight Test Services Pty Ltd v The Minister for Industry  Science and Technology   FCA   at      These requirements have been met in the present case  I note that the number of documents in question in this case is comparatively modest  The descriptions of them in the ACCC s list of documents suggest that the respondents would not be in any

case   Tamberlin J at   in agreeing with Beaumont J  strongly endorsed  the need for exercise of restraint in discovery  The judgment in Reading is binding on me   In the present case  everyone knows that critical witnesses for the ACCC have been granted immunity  That fact can be  and no doubt will be  used by the respondents as a legitimate basis for an attack on credibility the witnesses  The effectiveness of such an attack cannot be predicted  However  documents which do no more than evidence that fact are relevant only to credit and are not discoverable   On   January   the respondents filed an amended defence to the ACCC s second further amended statement of claim  It included some new sub paragraphs to par    These were not introduced pursuant to leave  This is not a criticism  since the respondents had to plead to the ACCC s amended statement of claim  However the question of leave needs to be considered now  The new sub paragraphs are as follows         aa  that in or about late January or February   the Amcor Group formed the belief that it has a higher cost structure than Visy Board in its corrugated fibreboard packaging division and was significantly uncompetitive with the corrugated fibreboard packaging business conducted by Visy Board      Particulars       The Amcor Group s belief arose by reason of the fact that a former employee of Visy Board  John Alan Morriss   Morriss   provided the Amcor Group with  and the Amcor Group received  confidential information of Visy Board concerning Visy Board s CFP business  including a copy Visy Board s Managing Director s Report for the CFP Division dated June     the   Report    The   Report covered Visy Board s sales and included a detailed analysis of all major costs areas by month  year to date performance against budget  and the previous year  It included statistics on volumes  credit notes  employee numbers and conversion cost per unit of volume and per employee  Morriss provided extracts of the   Report and other Visy Board confidential information relating to Visy Board s costs and sales figures in respect of the CFP business to Peter Brown of the Amcor Group                      ab  that in or about November   Morriss obtained a copy of the Visy Board Managing Director s Report CFP Division for October       Report  showed Brown  then the Managing Director of Amcor Australasia  the summary of the key financial data contained in the   Report  and discussed the data with Brown        Particulars       The   Report covered an analysis of volumes  employee numbers  costs and production statistics and profitability of each Visy Board Manufacturing plant for Visy Board s CFP business                     ac  that during the period of his employment with the Amcor Group  approximately January   until January   Morriss disclosed to Amcor Group personnel  including Brown and Hodgson  confidential information of Visy Board concerning customers  volumes of CFP products sold  and Visy Board s costs of producing CFP products       ad  that the Visy Board confidential information referred to in the particulars to paragraph  aa  and in paragraphs  ab  and  ac  above   the Visy Confidential Information   was used by the Amcor Group           i  to evaluate the relative efficiency of the Amcor Group s processes and costs in comparison with the corresponding processes and costs of Visy Board       ii  in the development of the Amcor Group s business strategies and plans to compete with Visy Board s CFP business  including as the basis of capital expenditure requests to the Board of Amcor Limited  and      iii  to target Visy Board s customers        Particulars        A  Morriss provided information in the   Report to members of the Executive Management Team of Amcor s CFP business including Brown  Peter Reichler  David Ley  Tony Myles  Max Fitzgibbons  John Crawford  Hodgson and Laidlaw at an Amcor strategy meeting in March   at which the relative CFP cost structures of Visy and Amcor were discussed  Jones  then the Managing Director of Amcor Limited  visited during the meeting and was briefed on strategy developments  including the significance of the information in the   Report       B  Brown and Morriss from time to time during the Period of Service attended the Amcor Group s Camberwell offices to discuss issues about the CFP business with Jones  During these meetings  Morriss  Brown and Jones discussed the competitive position of the Amcor Group s CFP business and discussed information derived from the   Report       C  Information derived from the   Report was used by Morriss at Board meetings of Amcor Limited that occurred in   during the course of which Morriss made presentations to the Board of Amcor Limited in the context of making capital expenditure requests to upgrade facilities at the Amcor Group s corrugated factory at Brooklyn       D  The Visy Confidential Information  or parts of it  were cited in presentations made to Jones  as Managing Director of Amcor Limited  to verify submissions as to the true competitive position of the Amcor Group and Visy Board  and in presentations made to Jones in support of additional injections of capital to fund a restructure of the corrugated fibreboard packaging division of the Amcor Group  These presentations were made by Brown  Morriss and others in or about the first half of   and later by Hodgson to Brown and Jones at the Amcor Group s Rocklea offices in or about mid to late    The presentation by Hodgson was made to support his request for a new corrugator and supporting infrastructure modernisation in order for the Amcor Group to compete more effectively with Visy Board s CFP business       E  The Amcor Group restructured its CFP business to reduce costs and pursued increased market share by a  breadth  strategy  including bundling CFP products with other primary packaging which Visy Board did not offer at the time  This was agreed at the March   strategy planning meeting referred to in sub paragraph  a  above and ultimately approved by the Board on Amcor Limited and implemented           ae  that despite incurring and continuing to incur significant expenditure aimed at regaining competitiveness in its CFP business  in or about late   or early   senior management of the Amcor Group  including Jones  Brown  and Hodgson  devised an alternative strategy   described by the Amcor Group as  price recovery  namely attempt to pursue collusive arrangements with Visy Board concerning prices and competition in respect of the supply of CFP       af  that the Amcor Group s attempts to pursue the collusive arrangements referred to in paragraph  ae  were unsuccessful   Sub pars  aa  to  ad  raise allegations far removed from the numerous serious issues of fact and law already present in this case  They have the potential of raising countless side issues as to the rights and wrongs of the conduct of Mr Morriss and the effect of that conduct on Amcor  Such evidence would be likely to be excluded as resulting in an undue waste of time  Evidence Act    Cth  s    c    Such pars  ae  and  af  stand on a different footing  The respondents put them as an alternative  In the end the respondents did not object to the provision of further particulars   There will be orders as follows           The first to fifth respondents
