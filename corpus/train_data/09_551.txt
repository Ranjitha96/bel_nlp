Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australialink Pty Ltd  No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedGeneral Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt is not in dispute that the power summarily to dismiss a pleading as disclosing no reasonable cause of action is a power to be exercised with special caution  and only in the clearest of cases  General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR     General Steel    Applying the General Steel test  in my judgment the contentions by the ACCC that the documents convey the alleged representations are at least arguable  with the consequence that those impugned paragraphs should not be struck out  This view is buttressed by the heading of the document  and the failure to refer to the absence of any previous communication between the recipients of the LAN documents and Australialink  The impugned paragraphs in relation to the Notice of Intention document are set out in par   of the Statement of Claim        that Australialink had instituted or was in the process of instituting court proceedings against the Responding Recipient          that the Notice of Intention was an official court form  rather than a form created by Australialink          that the Notice of Intention was issued as part of court proceedings          that a date had been fixed by the court  or alternatively Australialink  for the filing of a plaint with the court          that the Responding Recipients  rights were affected by the issuing of the said Notice of Intention              that the court process required the Notice of Intention to be executed by a person on behalf of the creditor and witnessed by another person  and these steps had occurred  While the representation pleaded in     does not to me appear to be as clear as the other representations in that paragraph  the representations alleged by the ACCC in par   and which are sought to be impugned  are in my opinion at least arguable  This conclusion is justified by the formatting and the subheading  Notice of Creditors Commencement of Proceedings at a Magistrates Court  which is expressed not as a future possibility but as a fact citedImobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFor the purposes of deciding a strike out motion  or whether the pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action  the Court is obliged to assume the truth of the allegations in the Statement of Claim  and draw all inferences favourable to the party against whom the strike out motion is brought  This is because the question is whether the allegations in the Statement of Claim  even if proved  cannot succeed as a matter of law  Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd   FCA         ALR   per Finkelstein J  at    From the Statement of Claim and the annexures thereto  the applicant  the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  the ACCC  makes the following allegations         Australialink publishes business directories on the internet  and sells listings in those directories to persons and businesses throughout Australia           The method by which Australialink primarily markets its services to potential clients and obtains listing orders is as follows           Since at least January   Australialink has obtained details of potential customers by purchasing customer lists from third party suppliers and from the online version of the Yellow Pages directory           Australialink sends  by post or facsimile  a document called a  Listing Advice Notice    LAN   to various businesses called   Recipients   using the contact details obtained as described above  A copy of a LAN is Annexure A to the statement of claim           A slightly different version of the LAN is sent to Recipients located in Queensland  This version  the   Qld LAN   includes the following warning statement across the top of the document      THIS IS A SOLICITATION  NOT AN INVOICE FOR A DEBT INCURRED BY YOU  PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY PAYMENT WHEN RETURNING           An example of a Qld LAN is Annexure B to the statement of claim          There will have been no dealings between Australialink and a Recipient prior to Australialink sending the document  other than that Australialink may have previously sent a LAN or Qld LAN to that business and not have received any reply          When a Recipient signs and returns the LAN  Australialink then issues a tax invoice to the Recipient  called a Responding Recipient  claiming payment for a directory listing fee  If the Responding Recipient does not pay the invoice  after several subsequent reminder notices Australialink sends a letter of demand purporting to be from a commercial collection agency          If the Responding Recipient does not comply with the letter of demand then Australialink sends a document entitled  Notice of Intention Notice of Creditor s Commencement Proceedings    Notice of Intention    A copy of a Notice of Intention is Annexure C to the statement of claim  No court proceedings have been instituted at the time a Notice is sent by Australialink  The respondents attack paragraphs of the Statement of Claim which relate to the representations which the ACCC alleges are made by the sending out of the LAN documents and by the Notice of Intention document  which are annexed to the Statement of Claim
