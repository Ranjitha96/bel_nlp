Kawasaki  Australia  Pty Ltd  ACN       v ARC Strang Pty Ltd  ACN        Corrigendum dated   April     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedLyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees   AC  The applicants submitted that the object of cl     when considered in the context of the Shareholders Agreement as a whole  was that any shareholder desirous of transferring the legal or equitable interest therein should inform the company and offer the other shareholders an opportunity to participate in the transfer on a pro rata basis  In support of this submission  the applicants relied on Lyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees   AC     and in particular the passage at    If I may express my view of the article in the most general sense  I think the prohibitory part of the article is the sanction which prevents a shareholder from carrying through a transfer of shares without complying with the machinery of transfers set out in the second part of the article  And I think a shareholder who has transferred  or pretended to transfer  the beneficial interest in a share to a purchaser for value is merely endeavouring by subterfuge to escape from the peremptory provisions of the article  A share is of no value to anyone without the benefit it confers  A sale of a share is the sale of beneficial rights that it confers  and to sell or purport to sell the beneficial rights without the title to the share is  in my opinion  a plain breach of the provisions of article      However  that passage must be understood in the context of the findings of fact in that case to which I refer later  The respondents submitted that   a  The evidence demonstrated that ARC Strang was not desirous of transferring the PrixCar shares  as if it was so desirous it could not achieve the outcome it sought  namely  avoiding triggering the provisions of cl     of the Shareholders Agreement  Rather  the shareholders in ARC Strang were desirous of selling their shares in ARC Strang     b  There was no change of control clause in the Shareholders Agreement  that is there was no clause which regulated or related to a sale or transfer of shares in the companies whose assets included shares in PrixCar  The evidence demonstrated that all parties proceeded on the basis that cl     was not triggered when shares in a joint venturer were sold  as distinct from a sale of shares in the joint venture company  PrixCar  itself  The applicants attempted to achieve a change of control in ARC Strang in favour of themselves previously  but did not proceed when they formed a view about the problematic impact of the trust structure    c  On the proper construction of cl     it is concerned only with transfers of legal interests  not beneficial interests  This follows textually from the words of the Shareholders Agreement  It is the sale of the shares that is relevant  not the equitable obligations pursuant to which ARC Strang held its assets  The initial issue to be determined is whether on   May   and prior thereto ARC Strang was a person  desiring to transfer  its shares in PrixCar within the meaning of cl     of the Shareholders Agreement  ARC Strang had withdrawn its transfer notice given in its letter dated   July   on   November    At that time  ARC Strang s desire to transfer its shares in PrixCar terminated  Was that desire resurrected thereafter  I do not consider that it was  During December   Mr Robert Strang had discussions with Kawasaki and Toll interests about a proposal that the shares in ARC Strang be sold  It does not follow from this fact that ARC Strang was desiring to transfer its shares in PrixCar  Indeed  the proposal that the shares in ARC Strang be sold was for the reason that Kawasaki and Toll did not want the pre emptive provisions of cl     of the Shareholders Agreement triggered by any proposal or desire by ARC Strang that its shares in PrixCar be transferred  Although a sale of the shares in ARC Strang would change the ultimate ownership and effective control of the shares ARC Strang held in PrixCar  a desire by the shareholders in ARC Strang to sell the shares they held in it does not  of itself  demonstrate a desire by ARC Strang to transfer its shares in PrixCar  Indeed  if the concern of all relevant parties was to avoid triggering the pre emptive provisions in cl     of the Shareholders Agreement  a proposal by the shareholders in ARC Strang to sell the shares they held in it made it clear that ARC Strang did not desire to transfer its shares in PrixCar  The applicants placed particular emphasis upon observations in Lyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees  supra   In that case the relevant article of association of the company contained pre emptive provisions which were activated by a shareholder  who is desirous of transferring his ordinary shares   An offer was made to the shareholders in the company offering to purchase their shares for a specified amount  The consideration was payable on receipt of valid and effective transfers of the shares and a general proxy in favour of the purchaser s nominees  Some shareholders in the company accepted the offer by completing and returning the form of acceptance and a form of proxy  In their acceptance they agreed to sell their shares  authorised the use of the proxy  and agreed to deliver up their share certificates and to sign transfer deeds when called on in exchange for the price  The House of Lords concluded that the actions of the shareholders were such that it could be inferred that they were  desirous of transferring  their shares within the meaning of the article containing the pre emptive provisions  Viscount Simonds said at      In my opinion  it is not open to a shareholder  who has agreed to do a certain thing and is bound to do it  to deny that he is desirous of doing it  I wish to make it quite clear  for it goes to the root of the matter  that I regard Scott s trustees as desirous of transferring their ordinary shares unless and until their agreement with Mr  Fraser has been abrogated      I have already indicated that a shareholder who has agreed to sell his shares and has received the price is to be deemed to be desirous of transferring them    Lord Reid said at      I have come to the conclusion without difficulty that on their own admissions the respondents are in breach of article    The purpose of the article is plain  to prevent sales of shares to strangers so long as other members of the company are willing to buy them at a price prescribed by the article  And this is a perfectly legitimate restriction in a private company  But the respondents argue that  whatever may have been the intention  the terms of the article are such that it has only very limited application  They say that  transfer  and  transferring  only apply to a complete transfer of the ownership of shares by acceptance and registration of deeds of transfer  and that a shareholder who agrees to sell his shares is quite entitled to do so and to receive the price and vote as the purchaser wishes so long as he is not desirous of having a transfer registered  I see no reason for reading the article in that limited way  Transferring a share involves a series of steps  first an agreement to sell  then the execution of a deed of transfer and finally the registration of the transfer  The word transfer can mean the whole of those steps  Moreover  the ordinary meaning of  transfer  is simply to hand over or part with something  and a shareholder who agrees to sell is parting with something  The context must determine in what sense the word is used  That case and the reasoning in it is of no assistance to applicants  In that case it was found as a fact that the shareholders were desirous of transferring their shares because of the actions they had taken  The shareholders had entered into an agreement to sell their shares and had received and retained the sale price and had agreed to sign transfer deeds when called on to do so  Their abstaining from delivering executed transfer forms did not displace the finding that they were desirous of transferring their shares  I have made no such finding in this case  Rather  I have found that the evidence does not support such a finding  It may be accepted  as the applicants submitted  that the documentation and transactions entered into on   May   delivered to Toll Holdings and its associate Toll  FHL  control of the interest in PrixCar held by ARC Strang as a matter of substance  But it does not follow from such a conclusion that cl     was triggered by what occurred on   May    The applicants submitted that the provisions of cl     of the Shareholders Agreement would have no substance if the shareholder could transfer its beneficial interest in PrixCar to a third party as was done in this case  In this context  the applicants relied on the observation of Lord Keith in Lyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees  supra  set out in par   above  That observation must be understood in the context of the facts as found  namely that there had been an agreement to sell the shares which were the subject of the pre emptive provisions  Lord Keith was saying no more than if a shareholder sells its whole interest in a share  which includes its legal interest and its beneficial interest  the withholding of the delivery of an executed transfer of the share  in the circumstances which obtained in that case  does not mean that the shareholder is not desirous of transferring the share as contemplated by the relevant article  The applicability of Lord Keith s observation depends upon the extent to which the provisions of cl     of the Shareholder s Agreement have been triggered  In Lyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees  supra  the relevant article was triggered because of the finding that the shareholders were  desirous of transferring  their shares in the company  That is not a finding which I have made in the present case  I am satisfied that on its proper construction cl     of the Shareholders Agreement does not extend to  or cover  a transfer of shares in a company which includes within its assets shares in PrixCar  Clause     does not include within its terms  nor is it appropriate to imply into its terms  a change in control of shareholder provision  There is no part of the transactions entered into on   May   which falls within cl     of the Shareholders Agreement or which triggers its operation  Clause     is not triggered by the sale by Mr and Mrs Strang of their shares in ARC Strang  the shareholder whose assets include shares in PrixCar  nor is it triggered by the deed of assignment whereby ARC Strang as trustee transferred the beneficial interest in the PrixCar shares to itself  The expression  transfer  in cl     of the Shareholders Agreement refers to a transfer of the legal interest in the shares and not to a transfer of the beneficial interest  I reach this conclusion as result of a textual analysis of cl     and on the basis of principles found in authorities  My conclusion that in the context in which it appears in cl     of the Shareholders Agreement the expression  transfer  means a transfer of the legal interest or estate in shares from one person to another person and not a transfer of the equitable or beneficial interest in the shares is supported in a number of cases  Such a connotation or definition of the expression  transfer  is implicit in the reasoning in Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National Westminster Bank     WLR   Scotto v Petch     BCLC   on appeal   BCC   Lyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees  supra  Coles Myer Limited v Commissioner of State Revenue     VR   citedLion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Limited     ALR  The applicants submitted that the Court should look at the surrounding circumstances of the Shareholders Agreement  namely that PrixCar was a closely held joint venture corporation and that the purpose or the object of the Shareholders Agreement was that specified persons should carry on business together and only control the joint venture vehicle in specified portions  It was submitted that with this in mind the Court should give the Agreement a commercially  sensible construction  In this context  Kawasaki referred to Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Limited     ALR   where Weinberg J  at     and Kenny J  at   considered the principles which apply to the construction of commercial documents  These principles of construction may be accepted but they do not entitle the Court to distort the language used in an agreement or imply into the provisions of an agreement terms which are not there  The applicants submitted that the parties should be taken to have desired no change in the effective ownership and control of PrixCar unless all members first had a pro rata opportunity to participate in that change of ownership or control  However  that desire in those terms was not translated into a specific provision in the Shareholders Agreement nor is it to be implied from the terms used in the Shareholders Agreement  The parties to the Shareholders Agreement turned their minds to the nature of the pre emptive rights which they wanted to enshrine in the agreement but they did not include a change in control of a shareholder provision consideredSafeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National Westminster Bank     WLR   on appeal     WLR  My conclusion that in the context in which it appears in cl     of the Shareholders Agreement the expression  transfer  means a transfer of the legal interest or estate in shares from one person to another person and not a transfer of the equitable or beneficial interest in the shares is supported in a number of cases  Such a connotation or definition of the expression  transfer  is implicit in the reasoning in Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National Westminster Bank     WLR   Scotto v Petch     BCLC   on appeal   BCC   Lyle   Scott Ltd v Scott s Trustees  supra  Coles Myer Limited v Commissioner of State Revenue     VR    In Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National Westminster Bank  supra  the Court was concerned to construe an article of association of a company which provided that   A member shall not be entitled to transfer an ordinary share except     in accordance with the following provisions   a           b  Except where the transfer made is pursuant to article   hereof  in order to ascertain whether any member is willing to purchase an ordinary share  the proposing transferor shall give notice in writing  hereinafter called  the transfer notice  to the company that he desires to transfer the same          The Court held that  transfer  in this article meant a transfer of the legal interest in the shares and did not refer to the transfer of the beneficial interest in the shares  Vinelott J said at      A  transfer of a share  in the ordinary sense of that expression is a transfer of the legal title to the share with the rights and liabilities attaching to it  on registration of the transfer the transferor ceases to be and the transferee becomes a member of the company in right of that share  A member who desires to transfer a share will carry his intention into effect by executing a transfer and lodging it for registration  At that stage the restrictions in the pre emption provisions come into operation  To treat the references to the transfer of a share as comprehending a transfer or disposition of a beneficial interest in a share is to give the expression  transfer of a share  a meaning wider than it would ordinarily bear        Vinelott J s reasoning was upheld by the Court of Appeal  Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National
