Canpoint International Pty Limited v Anar International Pvt Ltd   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlapproved  Paisley Street Footscray Pty Ltd v Vineyards Estate Pty Ltd   FCA    unreported  Olney J    August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Mr Bova s submission that the dispute was confined to the issues identified in the affidavit as read at the hearing does not take into account the purpose of the requirement in s  G  that the supporting affidavit not only be filed within   days of the demand but also that  within that same period  a copy be served on the party making the demand  As Olney J stated in   Paisley Street Footscray Pty Ltd v Vineyards Estate Pty Ltd   FCA   at     the  purpose of the affidavit contemplated by s  G  is to tell the creditor why it is said that the demand should be set aside   It follows that  if the discrepancy between the affidavit as read at the hearing and the affidavit that  in its entirety  had been served on the defendant  is such as to put forward materially different bases for seeking to set aside the statutory demand  the question whether the requirements of s  G  have actually been met must arise   Another difficulty with the affidavit is that it does not distinguish between the defendant and the partnership  It indicates in paragraph   that the defendant company will be referred to as  Anar  and then proceeds to refer to dealings with  Anar   for instance in paragraph   that took place before the defendant was incorporated  I can only assume that in such cases Dr Chisholm is referring to the partnership   The dispute between the parties centres on the supply of a particular dye  known in the industry as Direct Blue    This dye is a discrete chemical compound which was developed by Ciba Specialty Chemicals in the  s  Ciba s patent over the compound expired in the late  s  In early   the plaintiff negotiated with Mr Choksi with a view to sourcing a chemical copy of Direct Blue    In April of that year   Anar   presumably the partnership  sent a sample dye to the plaintiff  The sample was apparently labelled  Direct Blue    Accompanying the sample was a material safety data sheet which also identified the product as  Direct Blue    Dr Chisholm asked Mr Choksi to carry out stability work on the dye  to ensure the product was stable under Indonesian conditions

oral evidence as to the different profit margins on products from different sources sold in Indonesia  and  as I have noted  has annexed to his second affidavit a print out of a spreadsheet from the plaintiff s accounting software detailing sales and profits relating to Pindo Delhi  The Court thus has sufficient evidence to say that the claim is genuine  whilst not seeking to assess the merits of the claim   Mr DeBuse argued that any loss in business suffered by the plaintiff would not have been caused by the presence of Direct Blue   in the dye manufactured by the defendant  but rather by the plaintiff s own delay in informing Pindo Delhi of its presence  Dr Chisholm has given evidence that the plaintiff was aware of the presence of Direct Blue   from July   but that Pindo Delhi and IndoAsia only discovered this when informed by a Japanese buyer in January    Whilst there may be some substance to the submission that the plaintiff s failure to warn its clients contributed to any subsequent loss of business  I cannot say that it is it is  implausible and extremely unlikely  that any loss resulted from the defendant s conduct  Edge Technology   ACSR at    Accordingly  I am not

Section  G a  states that an application to set aside a statutory demand can only be made if an  affidavit supporting the application  is filed within   days of service of the demand  Unless such an affidavit is filed and served in time  there is no application under s  G and  consequently  s  H will not apply  If there is no application  the Court has no jurisdiction and the situation cannot be

further affidavits may be filed to supplement the case made in the initial supporting affidavit  Graywinter Properties at    The defendant submits that the affidavit filed on   December   does not set out a genuine offsetting claim and is therefore not a supporting affidavit for the purposes of s  G a   Consequently  it is submitted  the Court s jurisdiction to set aside the statutory claim is not enlivened   The leading authority on the question of the minimum requirements for an affidavit to be a  supporting affidavit  as required by s  G a  is generally accepted as being the decision of Sundberg J in Graywinter Properties  His Honour observed at     In order to be a  supporting affidavit  an affidavit must say something that promotes the company s case  An affidavit which merely says  I am a director of the company but am too busy at present to make a full affidavit  and I will do so later  would not support the application  It would in no way advance  further or assist the company s cause  which is to have the notice set aside  At the other extreme  the affidavit need not detail  in admissible form  all the evidence that supports the contention of a genuine dispute

plaintiff submits that its offsetting claim amounts to USD   The defendant has taken issue with the amounts claimed by the plaintiff  asserting that they are not supported by the evidence  The defendant relies on Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd   NSWSC     In Macleay Nominees at   Palmer J was explicit that perceived frailties of evidence will not prevent a claim from being a  genuine claim  for the purposes of s  H  His Honour held at   that both the cause of action and the amount claimed must be advanced in good faith  His Honour continued     Good faith  means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful  In a claim for unliquidated damages for economic loss  the Court will not be able to determine whether the amount claimed is claimed in good faith unless the plaintiff adduces some evidence to show the basis upon which the loss is said to arise and how that loss is calculated  If such evidence is entirely lacking  the Court cannot find that there is a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of s  H  and s  H    Clearly  the evidence in relation to each component is not overwhelming  however  as Palmer J held at   in Macleay Nominees   NSWSC         Many such claims at this stage of proceedings would appear to be tenuous  but if they are genuine then

quoting from the judgment of Windeyer J in Olsson v Dyson   HCA         CLR   at     Novation is the making of a new contract between a creditor and his debtor in consideration of the extinguishment of the obligations of the old contract  if the new contract is to be fully effective to give enforceable rights or obligations to a third person he  the third person must be a party to the novated contract   In Olsson   Barwick CJ and Windeyer J dissented from the decision of the majority  Kitto  Menzies and Owen JJ  in finding  on the facts  that there had been a novation of a contract of loan  Nothing in the reasons of the three majority judges detracts from Windeyer J s discussion of the history and principles of novation   The fact that the defendant company  apparently  took over the business of the partnership does not  in itself  indicate that it assumed the obligations of the partnership  As Windeyer J makes clear  for there to be a novation that released the partnership from its obligations and imposed equivalent obligations on the defendant company the partnership  the defendant company and the plaintiff would have to be parties to the contract  The fact that Dr Chisholm was unaware of the incorporation of the defendant company and the fact that it was supplying the dyes is evidence that tends against  rather than in support of  an implied novation   Whether the partnership was dissolved following the incorporation of the defendant company is presently irrelevant as are any rights the plaintiff may have against the partnership  If the plaintiff is to succeed in this action to set aside the statutory demand of the defendant company it will be necessary for it to show that it has an offsetting claim against that company discussedProcess Machinery Australia

Australia  Pty Ltd     ACSR   Dr Chisholm attests in his first affidavit that he was required to travel to Indonesia in June   to  supervise the thinning of the blue Anar dye  and  a number of times  in   to discuss the revelation that the dye included Direct Blue    Mr DeBuse took issue with the costs claimed by the plaintiff for business class travel  As Mr Bova correctly argued  whilst this may be a question of mitigation  it cannot affect the existence of a genuine claim  The task of this Court is  to identify the genuine level of an offsetting claim  not the likely result of it  Re Morris Catering  Australia  Pty Ltd     ACSR   at     As noted above  certain paragraphs of Dr Chisholm s first affidavit concern transactions with the defendant s predecessor partnership  I have rejected the plaintiff s assertion that these transactions can give rise to a genuine claim against the defendant  Dr Chisholm states that  in addition to his trip in June   he made an earlier trip to Indonesia in August   to deal with a similar problem of dye thickening  I am not prepared to assume that the second trip  following soon after the incorporation of the defendant  related to dye supplied by the defendant  Accordingly  I disregard the USD  travel claim relating to the thickening  I accept the claim of USD  for travel to Indonesia to address the problems caused by the presence of Direct Blue   as a genuine claim   There is no evidence as to how the two amounts claimed for accommodation were calculated  Nevertheless  there is evidence that Dr Chisholm was required to travel to Indonesia  and such travel necessarily involves some accommodation expenses  Given that the nine nights of accommodation attributed to the thickening involves both of Dr Chisholm s trips  I can only accept that the USD  which is related to the Direct Blue   is claimed in good faith followedRoyal Premier Pty Ltd v Taleski   WASCA  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  html  In Royal

Constructions Pty Ltd v Concrite Quarries Pty Ltd     ACLC   While the defendant correctly states that the plaintiff has not identified a specific cause of action with which it pursues its claim  it is apparent from the circumstances described by the affidavit that the claim would be in the nature of breach of contract or of consumer protection legislation  Adopting the language of Emmett J in Sacon Constructions Pty Ltd v Concrite Quarries Pty Ltd     ACLC   at   the affidavit attempts both to explain the nature of the cross claim and to quantify it  In Sacon   Emmett J held that the supporting affidavit was insufficient  although his Honour observed in obiter at   that  had supplementary material been filed in time  it would have probably satisfied the requirements of s  G  That material asserted the offsetting claim in that case with significantly less detail than is present in Dr Chisholm s first affidavit in the present application   The next issue is raised by the plaintiff s decision not to read certain paragraphs of the affidavit that was filed and served on the defendant  As discussed above at   if the case that was notified to the defendant by the affidavit served upon it was materially different from the case put to the Court  then it would be arguable that there was no compliance with the subsection  in that the affidavit relied on to support the plaintiff s application had not been served on the defendant company  The paragraphs omitted from the affidavit as read at the hearing are relevant to the resolution of this question and therefore admissible when tendered by the defendant   In the omitted paragraphs Dr Chisholm refers to specific orders for dyes including Direct Blue   that were placed with  Anar  in August   March   and June    As  according to the affidavit of Mr Choksi  the defendant company was incorporated on   May   the former order is likely to have been placed with the partnership and the latter with the defendant company  The orders were for direct shipment of the dyes to Indonesia  they arrived there in May and August   respectively followedScanhill Pty Ltd v Century   Australasia Pty Ltd     FCR   This brings me to consider the claim made in the application filed on   December   and in the supporting affidavit of Dr Chisholm sworn and filed on that date  the  first affidavit   In this process it is necessary to bear in mind the strict requirements imposed by s  G a  and  b   Those requirements must be understood in the context of Division   of Part      As Beazley J noted in Scanhill Pty Ltd v Century   Australasia Pty Ltd     FCR   at   Part     has its origins in the Corporate Law Reform Bill    Cth   The explanatory memorandum to that Bill makes it clear at   that a key purpose of Division   of Part     is to avoid technical arguments and to facilitate speedy resolution of disputes  by requiring debtor companies to raise genuine disputes  about  for example  whether a debt is owed  at an early stage    Although not established to the standard expected at final trial  it can reasonably be assumed  given the nature of this application  that the dye supplied by the defendant in early   is the dye that generated problems from the middle of    Given the difficulties that arose with this dye  I am thus satisfied that the plaintiff s claim to have an offsetting claim raises  a serious question to be tried  Scanhill   FCR at    The threshold that the plaintiff must cross  is not a high one  Federico s Restaurant Pty Ltd v Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd     ACSR   at    I am satisfied that the plaintiff has done more than simply assert a claim and some basis for it without more  Chadwick Industries  South Coast  Pty Ltd v Condensing Vaporisers Pty Ltd     ACSR   at     In cross examination of Dr Chisholm  Mr DeBuse made much of the fact that the only written correspondence describing the thickening problem is an email of   June   from Dr Chisholm to Mr Choksi  a copy of which is annexed to Dr Chisholm s second affidavit  which describes the dye as  good except the layer of High viscosity which caused me big headache  There is no record of any attempt made by Canpoint to recover the USD  it lost through the thickening from the defendant  and it is not in dispute that the plaintiff continued to trade with the defendant following the incident  Dr Chisholm was quite emphatic that  many telephone conversations  had taken place in which the plaintiff had requested some discount from the defendant  but that the defendant refused  asserting it was prevented from offering such discounts by Indian law  Dr Chisholm further testified that he did not feel taking legal action to recover the debt was practical  and that the plaintiff refrained from doing so as it was attempting to  build up a relationship  with the defendant  Even if I were minded not to accept this evidence   failure to complain at an earlier point of time      of itself is not sufficient to demonstrate that the claim made by the applicant is not genuine  Scanhill   FCR at     Dr Chisholm has attested that in his experience international companies require written confirmation that Direct Blue   is not used in paper production  It is his evidence that he was told that Pindo Delhi was making a claim against the plaintiff for USD  for paper that had been returned because of the presence of Direct Blue    Annexed to his second affidavit is a letter dated   September   on the letterhead of IndoAsia  the plaintiff s agents in Indonesia  asserting that they had been advised that Pindo Delhi planned a claim against the plaintiff for both the costs of the paper returned and loss of its export business  The plaintiff has not put forward any amount in relation to Pindo Delhi s anticipated claim for loss of business   In his first affidavit  Dr Chisholm attests to a conversation with representatives of IndoAsia in which total sales to the Sinar Mas Group were said to be worth  USD year  with a potential for us to obtain sales of USD  million   Although it is unclear from the affidavit whether these figures refer to sales of the plaintiff or of IndoAsia  it is clear from Dr Chisholm s report of the conversation in his second affidavit that the figures refer to IndoAsia  As noted above  annexure  F  to the first affidavit estimates the value of the plaintiff s business with the Sinar Mas Group as  USD    million   Dr Chisholm also attests that he advised Mr Choksi that shipment of the wrong dye had damaged the plaintiff s reputation and endangered its business in Indonesia  which he valued at USD    million per year  Although this evidence was admitted only for a limited purpose  a strict approach to admissibility is not appropriate in these matters  see Scanhill   FCR at    Finally  annexure  O  to Dr Chisholm s second affidavit  a print out from the plaintiff s book keeping database  shows total sales to Pindo Mill of USD    in   and USD    in     Accordingly  I am willing to accept that the plaintiff s business with Sinar Mas was worth approximately USD  million per year  It is Dr Chisholm s evidence that Canpoint has not received any orders to supply dyes to Pindo Delhi in either   or   through IndoAsia or otherwise  There is no evidence relating to any sales to other parts of the Sinar Mas group   Beazley J s observations in Scanhill   FCR at   are apposite    It must be remembered that s  G requires that the supporting affidavit be filed and served within   days  This time period reflects the expeditious mode which the legislature has determined is to be the manner of staying the operation of a statutory demand  That is not to say  however  that the mere assertion of the amount of loss  or the amount of the claim  however based  is sufficient to satisfy the Court of the amount of the offsetting claim  One would normally expect that there would be reference to at least some primary material in the affidavit to enable the Court to have the requisite satisfaction for the purposes of s  H   It follows from the above that the plaintiff has a genuine claim against the defendant in the amount of USD      As noted above  the  admitted total  of the defendant company s debt for the purposes of s  H is USD     As I am satisfied that the plaintiff has an offsetting claim of USD    there is an  offsetting total  in that amount  The offsetting total exceeds the admitted total by USD    and accordingly the  substantiated amount  is less than the statutory minimum of   and the statutory demand must be set aside  s  H  followedSMEC International Pty Ltd v CEMS Engineering Inc   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The entitlement of the plaintiff to rely on affidavits filed outside the   day period is an issue in this case  In SMEC International Pty Ltd v CEMS Engineering Inc   NSWSC         ACSR   at   Austin J noted that the authorities accepting such an entitlement do so  provided that the application has otherwise been instituted validly   His Honour further commented that this proposition        must imply that later affidavits can expand and supplement the factual grounds upon which the plaintiff will rely at the hearing  subject perhaps to the qualification that the initial supporting affidavit must indicate the general nature of the plaintiff s case  eg that the plaintiff asserts a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the debt rather than  or as well as  an offsetting claim    The plaintiff also relied on a supplementary affidavit of Dr Chisholm filed on   August    Annexed to this affidavit are purchase orders  bills of lading and invoices relating to the dye supplied by the defendant in early    The affidavit provides additional factual detail in support of the plaintiff s claim to have an offsetting debt  Given that the first affidavit had clearly indicated the general nature of its case it is entirely legitimate for the plaintiff to expand the factual grounds on which it relies in this way  SMEC International   ACSR at   Graywinter Properties   FCR at   consideredTito v Waddell  No     Ch   This submission is fatally flawed  Under Australian law  in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary  the burden  as distinct from the benefit  of contractual obligations cannot be assigned  There are  of course  some well established exceptions as where the obligations run with an estate in land  as in a lease  or they  touch and concern  land  as in the case of covenants restricting the use of land  but no such exceptions are suggested to apply here  There are also two possible exceptions raised by Sir Robert Megarry V C in Tito v Waddell  No     Ch   however they have attracted little if any support in England and none in Australia  In any event neither is relevant here  The fundamental principle of the non assignability of contractual obligations is so well established that it should need no authority however  if authority is sought  the principles and the relevant authorities are discussed in Chapter   of Carter JW  Peden E and Tolhurst GJ  Contract Law in Australia   th ed  LexisNexis Butterworths    especially at       In the alternative  Mr Bova suggested that the defendant company became subject to the partnership obligations by an implied novation  While it would be possible for the defendant company  by contract  to assume obligations equivalent to those undertaken by the partnership  no evidence was adduced to show that this had occurred  Mr Bova referred to evidence given by Dr Allan Chisholm  a director of the plaintiff  to the effect that he was unaware of the change in the supplier of the dyes and that  in his purchase of dyes  he had not differentiated between the partnership and the company  Dr Chisholm said that he always dealt with the same persons  at the same email and business addresses and used the same telephone number to contact Mr Choksi followedTopfelt Pty Limited v State Bank of New South Wales Limited     FCR   As noted above  I consider that Dr Chisholm s first affidavit satisfies the requirements of s  G a   Accordingly  it is entirely legitimate to supplement it with Dr Chisholm s second affidavit  Topfelt Pty Limited v State Bank of New South Wales Limited     FCR   at    In these two affidavits  and Dr Chisholm s oral testimony  the plaintiff adduces evidence relating to each of these components  It is convenient to address some of these components together
