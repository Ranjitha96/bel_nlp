Woolf LJ and Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd   FCR     Medtel   at   per Sackville J  appeal allowed in Medtel Pty Ltd v Courtney   FCAFC         FCR   but not on this point  Medtel concerned s  D of the TPA  but its discussion of  merchantable quality  is relevant in the present context   Rogers v Parish provides some limited guidance as to an appropriate approach in this context because it too concerned a road vehicle  although not a heavy commercial vehicle  Although roadworthy  the vehicle in question  a Range Rover  misfired at all road speeds  had excessive noise emitting from the gear box and substantial defects in the body work  The judge at first instance held that the vehicle was of merchantable quality because it was roadworthy and capable of proceeding from one place to another  This finding was set aside on appeal  Mustill LJ said at     Starting with the purpose for which  goods of that kind  are commonly bought  one would include in respect of any passenger vehicle not merely the buyer s purpose of driving the car from one place to another but of doing so with the appropriate degree of comfort  ease of handling and reliability and  one might add  of pride in the vehicle s outward and interior appearance  What is the appropriate degree and what relative weight is to be attached to one characteristic of the car rather than another will depend on the market at which the car is aimed   Plainly enough  the purpose for which a commercial vehicle of this kind is commonly bought would include the purpose of being used to transport heavy loads of goods over long distances interstate safely  reliably and efficiently  The loads carried by the truck in this case were not said to be other than within the common range  Indeed  Mack conceded that the interstate long distance haulage of loads of the kind allegedly carried by the truck in the course of the Lowes  business was a  purpose for which trucks  such as the Lowe truck in question  would commonly be utilised   Thus  the first issue to arise under s   was not in dispute   In this connection too  the observations of Mustill LJ  in Rogers v Parish at   though apropos a different kind of vehicle  are helpful      To identify the relevant expectation one must look at the factors listed in the subsection  The first is the description applied to the goods  In the present case the vehicle was sold as new  Deficiencies which might be acceptable in a secondhand vehicle were not to be expected in one purchased as new  Next  the description  Range Rover  would conjure up a particular set of expectations  not the same as those relating to an ordinary saloon car  as to the balance between performance  handling  comfort and resilience  The factor of price was also significant  At more than    pounds  this vehicle was  if not at the top end of the scale  well above the level of the ordinary family saloon  The buyer was entitled to value for his money      With these factors in mind  can it be said that the Range Rover as delivered was as fit for the purpose as the buyer could reasonably expect  The point does not admit of elaborate discussion  I can only say that to my mind the defects in engine  gearbox and bodywork  the existence of which is no longer in dispute  clearly demand a negative answer   The critical question is whether the applicants  truck suffered from some or all of the defects the applicants allege  The outcome of the case very much depends on the answer to this question  For this reason  in this case  s   and   give rise to substantially the same question   Mack accepts that the applicants made it known to it that they were acquiring the truck for interstate long haul goods transport  This entitles them to rely on s   as well as s    Indeed  Mack accepts that it assured them that the truck was fit for this purpose  It is common ground  therefore  there was an implied condition under the contract for supply that the truck was at the time of supply reasonably fit for this purpose  As noted  Mack did not seek to argue at trial that s   was unavailable to the applicants because they did not rely on Mack s skill and judgment or the skill and judgment of Mr Kumnick   Although the notion of reasonable fitness for purpose is not precisely the same as the concept of merchantability  in this case there is no significant difference  There is here an overlap in the operation of s   and   and  under both  the real question is whether or not the truck was fit for the purpose of interstate long haul goods transport  At trial the applicants and Mack accepted that this was so  and the applicants relied on the same facts to demonstrate a failure on Mack s part to meet both s   and     Of course  even if the applicants establish that the truck was not fit for the purpose of interstate long haul goods transport  there is a further question whether or not they are entitled to the relief they seek   As already noted  besides their unmerchantability or unfitness for purpose claim  the applicants also retained a limited claim under s   of the TPA  This was to the effect that Mack s representations  via its salesman  Mr Kumnick  that        the truck would provide safe  reliable and efficient service for at least   kilometres  and     driving the truck was like driving a car    were misleading and deceptive  or likely to mislead or deceive  in contravention of s   of the TPA  As it happened  there was no great dispute as to whether Mr Kumnick made these statements to the applicants  Mr Kumnick admitted making the second statement and that he said something like the first  Thus  in an affidavit sworn before trial  he said that he told Mr Lowe that the truck should prove to be  safe and reliable  for about   kilometres  He also told Mr Lowe that the truck would be ideally suited for his purpose of interstate haulage  Mr Kumnick emphasized that he made this latter statement and the observation that the trucks  drive like cars  in the context of talking to an experienced heavy vehicle driver   Section   of the TPA prohibits a corporation from engaging in conduct in trade and commerce that is misleading or deceptive  or that is likely to mislead or deceive  The words  engage in conduct  include the making of representations about a past  present or future matter  It is not in issue that  for the purposes of s   of the TPA  the respondent is a corporation engaged in trade and commerce citedCourtney v Medtel Pty Ltd   FCR   Subsection   of the TPA provides that goods are of merchantable

confirm my conclusion that  as the applicants  counsel said  this cause of action can in fact add little to the applicants  primary case   Mr Lowe s evidence was critical to the applicants  case  Mr Lowe was forty nine years of age when he acquired the truck  He was a qualified mechanic and an experienced truck driver  He had more than twenty years  experience of driving a number of different heavy prime mover vehicles in long haul interstate transport operations  Mr Lowe and his wife had begun their long haul goods transport business over twenty years before the purchase of the truck  He had owned and operated numerous different model trucks prior to March   including three Mack trucks  In September   some months before the purchase of the truck in March   he and his wife purchased a new Tautliner semi trailer  The truck was to be used to transport this semi trailer  loaded with goods   On or shortly before Friday    March   Mr Lowe spoke to Mr Kumnick at Mack s Adelaide office about buying a new truck to replace the Mack CHR he was operating at that time  Mr Lowe and Mr Kumnick had regular dealings with one another at this time  In this circumstance  Mr Kumnick knew that the replacement truck was for use in interstate haulage  Mr Kumnick made an appraisal of Mr Lowe s Mack CHR and looked into what Mack might offer by way of a replacement appliedHG v The Queen   HCA

weight to be given to his or her opinion  see FGT Custodians Pty Ltd v Fagenblat   VSCA     FGT Custodians   at   per Ormiston JA  with whom Chernov and Eames JJA agreed   None of these factors by itself would deprive Mr Lambert of the independence desired of an expert witness  I do not consider that Mr Lambert s involvement with Mr Haire would necessarily have affected the evidence he gave  I note too that Mr Morrison was also involved as an expert in other proceedings though for the truck manufacturer  Involvement in other proceedings in the same or similar interest need not affect independence  It was  moreover  clear that Mr Lambert gave evidence of opinions he genuinely held  Nonetheless  it was equally clear that Mr Lambert was inclined to  side  with the applicants  His apparent commitment to the applicants  position indicated more than intellectual attraction to their position  Precisely why Mr Lambert was so disposed is unclear  As the respondent noted  he had not seen  eye to eye  with the Roaduser s management or with Mr Wallace from Mack  I doubt  however  that this is a sufficient explanation  It is enough to say that Mr Lambert impressed me as a witness who had  for whatever reason  become somewhat overly involved in the interests of a party to the litigation  As Ormiston JA s discussion in FGT Custodians at   makes clear  this circumstance may diminish the weight accorded an expert s opinion  Here  it lessened to some degree the weight I might otherwise have given Mr Lambert s opinion  In the end  however  my preference for Dr Morrison s opinion to that of Mr Lambert s was more affected by considerations other than this  I would add that there was no occasion to exercise my discretion under s   of the Evidence Act    Cth    There were a number of other matters that also tended to diminish the weight to be attached to Mr Lambert s evidence  including that  in cross examination  it became apparent that much of his technical opinion was not based on any actual testing of the applicants  truck  Thus  for example  Mr Lambert conceded that he had done no testing to establish the relative torsional rigidity of trailers  Instead  his opinion was based on the fact that he had  a very good eye for observing vehicle behaviour   Further  Mr Lambert stated he used his  own observation and measurements  to establish the chassis was bent  When asked whether he established first whether the ground surface was flat  he conceded  Well  I didn t check it in an absolute sense  no     I have got a very good eye for flat surfaces    Notwithstanding these reservations  I have found it necessary to consider Mr Lambert s evidence carefully citedUnited Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  In the present context  the respondent also drew attention to s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  which confers a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might   a  be unfairly prejudicial to a party   b  be misleading or confusing  or  c  cause or result in undue waste of time  It seems that the failure of a witness to comply with relevant  Guidelines for Expert Witnesses  may be a factor weighing in favour of the exclusion of his or her evidence  since the expert s opinion is infected by failure to understand his or her responsibilities as an expert  compare United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at       per Campbell J   The respondent objected to the admissibility of the opinion of Dr McLean on the basis that   a  he lacked the requisite  specialised knowledge  and or       b  he purported to give opinion on matters outside any  specialised knowledge  he may possess as a result of his training  study or experience  and or   c  his evidence demonstrated fundamental flaws in its factual basis or in its process of reasoning     The respondent argued that Dr McLean s evidence should be excluded entirely  alternatively  admitted only for the purpose of providing expert opinion on matters relating to the alleged vibration problems of the Lowes  truck   It was apparently common ground that  as at May   Dr McLean was a senior lecturer in the School of Mechanical  Materials and Mechatronics Engineering  in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Wollongong  A University of Wollongong website stated Dr McLean s research activities to be  Bulk solids  Handling and Physical Processing  and his  area of

disadvantage he has suffered in consequence of altering his position under the inducement of the respondent s misrepresentation  That general principle applies to other claims  such as those brought by lenders or mortgage insurers who have entered into transactions in reliance on false or misleading representations     a person induced to enter a transaction by misrepresentations  generally speaking  must show that the losses claimed are related to the misrepresentation  It is not enough simply to show that the transactions was induced by the representation and the losses would not have occurred but for the transaction  The loss must flow directly from the inducement     where property acquired in a transaction induced by a misrepresentation subsequently declines in values  damages are not awarded in respect of the decline if it is attributable to an independent  extrinsic or supervening cause     if the applicant would have entered into the relevant transaction  even if the

respondent s misrepresentation  That general principle applies to other claims  such as those brought by lenders or mortgage insurers who have entered into transactions in reliance on false or misleading representations     a person induced to enter a transaction by misrepresentations  generally speaking  must show that the losses claimed are related to the misrepresentation  It is not enough simply to show that the transactions was induced by the representation and the losses would not have occurred but for the transaction  The loss must flow directly from the inducement     where property acquired in a transaction induced by a misrepresentation subsequently declines in values  damages are not awarded in respect of the decline if it is attributable to an independent  extrinsic or supervening cause     if the applicant would have entered into the relevant transaction  even if the misrepresentation had not been made  any losses flowing from the transaction as such cannot be said to flow directly from the inducement  In such a case the applicant would have been exposed  in any event  to the precise risk that ultimately eventuated     See more recently Zuvela v Geiger
