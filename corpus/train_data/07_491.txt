federal ct  html  Application has been made by the applicant to restrain Ms Dominque Saunders and Russell Kennedy  a firm  from acting on behalf of the first respondent in these proceedings  The form of order has not been precisely articulated by the applicant  but I will proceed on the basis that an order is sought that the firm Russell Kennedy and Ms Saunders be restrained from acting as solicitors for the first respondent in these proceedings  The background to these proceedings and the role of each of Ms Saunders and Russell Kennedy have been set out in my judgment delivered on   March   see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria  No     FCA    Essentially  Russell Kennedy are the solicitors on the record representing the first respondent  and Ms Saunders is a solicitor in the employ of Russell Kennedy and has been involved in these proceedings  Other relevant circumstances are referred to later in these reasons citedBlack v Taylor     NZLR   The Court s jurisdiction to

absolutely required in the circumstances of the case  Further  the Court should be mindful that sometimes applications for restraining legal practitioners may be misused or quite inappropriately pursued by a party to proceedings  In Freeman v Chicago Musical Instrument Co   F d     the Court observed at     We do not mean to infer that motions to disqualify counsel may not be legitimate  for there obviously are situations where they are both legitimate and necessary  nonetheless  such motions should be viewed with extreme caution for they can be misused as techniques of harassment

practitioner to cease to act may provide a reason for refusing to grant relief  Geelong School   FCA   at     Kallinicos v Hunt   NSWSC         NSWLR   Black v Taylor     NZLR   and Bowen v Stott   WASC     Justice Young in Geelong School   FCA   recently set out the relevant legal principles to be applied when considering whether to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a particular party to litigation  there being three possible grounds for so restraining a legal practitioner       a  the danger of misuse of confidential information  Geelong School   FCA   at        b  breach of a fiduciary duty of loyalty not to act against a client or against a former client in the same matter or a closely related matter  Geelong School   FCA   at     and    c  the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control the conduct of legal practitioners as officers of the court  Geelong School   FCA   at       and     In relation to both Ms Saunders and Russell Kennedy  the determination of the questions of whether there is a danger of misuse of confidential information and whether there is a breach of any fiduciary duty can be readily dealt with by me  It would appear that the applicant is concerned that Ms Saunders was a member of the Public Interest Law Clearing House  PILCH  in   when PILCH refused to assist the applicant to bring proceedings against the first respondent  and in the process of considering the applicant s request to PILCH Ms Saunders obtained  confidential documents  from the applicant   The only evidential basis of the applicant s complaint derives from   of her affidavit affirmed on   October       Mrs D  Saunders was on PILCH in   and PILCH refused to assist me against the  first respondent  and instead collected many confidential documents from me which then were liked  sic  to Mrs Saunders  I have circumstantial evidence of that   I now turn to consider the issue of the Court s inherent jurisdiction to restrain legal practitioners from acting in a particular case as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction over its officers and to control its process in aid of the administration of justice  where such a course is required in the interests of justice  Geelong School   FCA   at       and    The crucial question is whether  on the evidence before the Court  a fair minded  reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that the legal practitioner be restrained from acting for its client in the proceedings  Geelong School   FCA   at      I deal first with the position of Ms Saunders  Serious criminal allegations have been made against Ms Saunders by the applicant  They are denied by Ms Saunders  For the purposes of this application I do not regard it as necessary or appropriate to rehearse in these reasons the details or merits of the allegations  I have  however  come to the view that there is a real likelihood that in these proceedings  assuming the matter proceeds to trial  the conduct of Ms Saunders will require evaluation and assessment and she may well feel compelled to justify or defend her conduct citedGrimwade v Meagher   Ors     VR   The Court s
