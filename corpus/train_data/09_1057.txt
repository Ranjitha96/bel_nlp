au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe requirement that there be   a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based   has received arguably less consideration than other aspects of s    It is  however  clear that the requirement that there be   a reference to the evidence   does not impose a requirement that the Tribunal refer to every piece of evidence relevant to a particular finding  cf Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       ALD   at   per French  Sackville and Hely JJ  And the

compliance with the requirements imposed by s  B   The mere fact that an administrative tribunal refers to information or evidence does not of itself mean that the tribunal has given that evidence proper consideration  SZGYT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per Edmonds J  But s  B  does not impose any constraint as to the manner in which the Tribunal is to make   reference   to either evidence or other material upon which it proceeds to   base   its findings  The greater the conflict in the evidence  the greater may be the need for the Tribunal to make   reference   to the conflicting evidence and to set forth that evidence upon which it proceeds to   base   its findings  and to set forth its reasons for rejecting some evidence and accepting other evidence  Copperart Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALD   per Hill J  Although there is no necessity for the Tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence adduced before the Tribunal

observed by French  Sackville and Hely JJ in Applicant WAEE   supra         It is plainly not necessary for the tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in its written reasons  It may be that some evidence is irrelevant to the criteria and some contentions misconceived  Moreover  there is a distinction between the tribunal failing to advert to evidence which  if accepted  might have led it to make a different finding of fact     and a failure by the tribunal to address a contention which  if accepted  might establish that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  The tribunal is not a court      It is an administrative body and not a court and its reasons are not to be scrutinised  with an eye keenly attuned to error   Nor is it necessarily required to provide reasons of the kind that might be expected of a court of law       A failure to refer to material which is   fundamental   may lead to a

Communications Pty Ltd  No     ACompT       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth ACompT  htmlNor  it is considered  was the Tribunal in its reasons for decision attempting to narrow down its finding to either  the resolution of a claim founded upon a   twisting   movement  or the resolution of the claim as strictly described in the account given by Ms Hughes of the events of   January     Paragraph   of its reasons unquestionably exposes the fact that the Tribunal was aware of the difference between   abduction   and   adduction    Indeed  given the expertise of the medical member of the Tribunal  it would be surprising if such a distinction was not well understood  Section  b  of the   Act provides for the appointment of persons to the Tribunal who have   experience     in     the practice of a profession       and such a member is   entitled to use his or her experience in interpreting and weighing the material and in reaching conclusions on technical matters   cf Application by Chime Communications Pty Ltd  No     ACompT   at       ALR   at    But the reference by the Tribunal to the difference in the nature of the physical movements to which reference had been made in the evidence is not a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the Tribunal was thereafter confining its attention to the resolution of a claim founded upon that difference alone and to the resolution of a claim for compensation in respect of an injury different to that originally claimed in February   and as identified in the statement of issues as filed by the parties  It should finally be noted that there is not considered to be a clear distinction as between the claim as made by Ms Hughes and her description of the manner in which the accident or injury on   January   occurred  Both the claim and the description are but a means of communicating to a decision maker a description of the injury for which compensation is claimed and how that injury occurred  Either may give content to the other and the two should be read together citedAustralian Postal Corporation v Sellick   FCA       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlTo the extent that the Corporation in the present appeal seeks to raise a contention as to whether or not there was   any evidence   in support of particular findings  it may be noted that in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick   FCA   at       FCA       ALD   at   Bennett J observed that    a  decision made under an enactment is invalid if there is a total absence of evidence to satisfy an essential element of the decision    Section   of the   Act provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation   in respect of an injury suffered by an employee        Section   requires notice to be given   of the injury

employee within   days after the date of the assessment of the amount    But not every failure to hear and resolve every submission necessarily gives rise to such a question  In Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at   to   Jenkinson J expressed the position as follows      There is also the further possibility that the tribunal s failure to mention either the submission or the questions of fact which it raises was the result of a failure  by inadvertence  to consider the submission when the tribunal was engaged in deciding the reference  Not every failure by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to mention a contention advanced on behalf of a party will amount to a failure to comply with the requirements of s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act     or demonstrate that the contention was not considered in deciding the matter before the tribunal  But this submission concerning the ascertainment of profit was worthy of serious consideration and was seriously advanced to the tribunal  It ought  therefore  to be inferred that the submission was inadvertently overlooked by the tribunal either when the reference was being decided or when the reasons for the decision were being committed to writing  cf Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   at    In either event there has been  in my opinion  an error of law by the tribunal  so that

consider and determine each question of law and fact relevant to the determination of the reference to it of the respondent s decision  or the failure to carry out the duty imposed by s   of that Act  as the case may be  has brought about a miscarriage of justice by preventing this court from affording the parties a determination whether the tribunal s decision was vitiated by error of law  see

Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v House   FCA   at   per Collier J  No separate submissions were advanced on behalf of either the Corporation or Ms Hughes as to whether it was appropriate for the Corporation to file both an appeal pursuant to s   and also rely upon s   of the   Act  No submission  for example  was advanced on behalf of Ms Hughes that applications may not be made pursuant

manner  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR    In a passage which has often been repeated  Brennan CJ  Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ there referred to the earlier decision of the Full Court of this Court which was the subject of the appeal  and continued at   to   as follows      When the Full Court referred to  beneficial construction  it sought to adopt an approach mandated by a long series of cases  the best exemplar of which is Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic     FCR    In that case  a Full Court of the Federal Court  Neaves  French and Cooper JJ  collected authorities for various propositions as to the practical restraints on judicial review  It was said that a court should not be  concerned with looseness in the language     nor with unhappy phrasing  of the reasons of an administrative decision maker     FCR   at    The Court continued     FCR   at    The reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error           These propositions are well settled  They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed  See McAuliffe v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         ALD   at    In the present context  any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the

appliedBrown v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe jurisdiction being exercised is nevertheless constrained by the requirement that the appeal be   on a question of law    In Brown v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR   at   Bowen CJ  Fisher and Lockhart JJ observed in respect to this constraint      The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal  rather  it and it alone is the subject matter of the appeal  and the ambit of the appeal is confined to it  In the present proceeding  the Questions of Law as formulated in the Notice of Appeal were identified as follows       a  Whether the Tribunal failed to comply with its duty to give reasons for its decision    b  Whether the Tribunal made findings that were not supported by any evidence    c  Whether the Tribunal failed to consider a submission worthy of serious consideration       Each of these Questions of Law and each of the three Grounds of Appeal was intended to raise for resolution whether or not there was any evidence to support  or whether the reasons provided by the Tribunal adequately explained  how the account of the injury as provided by Ms Hughes gave rise to the injury for which compensation was awarded  In summary form  the Corporation contended that the account of the injury provided by Ms Hughes could not have caused the particular injury as found by the Tribunal  The jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the present   appeal   was not put in question

has been jurisdictional error  WAFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Lee  Carr and Tamberlin JJ citedComcare Australia v Lees     ALR  But what must be shown to establish   no evidence   remains unclear  For example  in Comcare Australia v Lees     ALR   at   to   Finkelstein J expressed his views as follows      The first ground alleges that there was no evidence before the tribunal to support its finding that the respondent had suffered an injury that resulted in an impairment to his legs  Generally speaking  a finding of fact is not reviewable by the court  But it has long been established that an insupportable finding of fact may be set aside  This is because the question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law  Further  whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts is also a question of law  In the province of judicial review the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law  Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at       HCA       ALR   per Mason CJ  Precisely what must be shown to make out a case of  no evidence  has been the subject of much judicial comment  In a recent decision in the Supreme Court of Victoria  Roads Corp v Dacakis     VR   at   Batt J said that a finding of fact will only be open to challenge as an error of law if there was no evidence to support it and that such a finding would not be open to challenge merely because it was not reasonably open on the evidence  Batt J went on to say that an inference will be open to challenge if it was not reasonably open on the facts  There is no doubt that the first proposition is correct  It follows directly from what was said by Mason CJ in Bond as well as many other cases in Australia although the position might be different in England  Most of the important cases are collected in the judgment of Phillips JA in Powley v Crimes Compensation Tribunal  CA Vic    December   unreported   It is not clear whether the second proposition accurately states the law and I notice that Batt J himself had some doubt about it  The difficulty comes about from a passage in the judgment of Mason CJ in Bond at CLR   where his Honour said that  an inference will be reviewable on the ground that it was not reasonably open   In my view there is a very real possibility that the use of the word  reasonably  in the passage quoted was not intended to make less onerous the task of challenging  as an error of law  the drawing of an inference  Certainly Phillips JA did not think so in Powley   see his reasons at      For present purposes  however  it is unnecessary to further clarify what is meant to be conveyed by a submission that there is   no evidence   to support a finding  Irrespective of the precise test to be applied before finding there is   no evidence   evidence exists to support the Tribunal s findings in the case at hand  The Corporation s first Ground of Appeal focused attention upon the following two paragraphs of the reasons for decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal        We accept that both Professor Fearnside and Dr Maxwell accepted that the incident caused the gluteal injury  Ms Hughes  description of events around the injury involved adduction  away from the midline  of her left leg rather than adduction  towards the midline   Both Professor Fearnside and Dr Maxwell considered gluteal tendinopathy to result form  sic  an adduction of the leg rather than abduction  There was some evidence relating to twisting  Professor Fearnside presumed that there had been a twisting from the manner of the fall  Dr Maxwell said in effect that if she  sic  was any twisting at that point that could have caused the injury          We find that as at   April   Ms Hughes continued to suffer from the effects of the injury to her lower back and left hip joint sustained during the course of her employment on   January    She was asymptomatic before the incident on   January   and continues to experience symptoms  Australia Post therefore continues to be liable for the effects of the injury

movement and her description of having done the   splits   it is perhaps understandable that the Corporation accepted Ms Hughes  account and did not question her as to whether there was any   twisting   movement involved  The Corporation may have wished to confine her account of the events to as narrow a factual description as possible  But the task of the Tribunal  however  was to reach the   correct or preferable   decision  And  in discharging that task  s  AA  of the   Act imposes upon the person who made the decision under review the responsibility of using   his or her best endeavours

potential significance of a   twisting   movement or   adduction   as opposed to   abduction   was a matter that did not emerge only during the course of the hearing before the Tribunal  It was a matter of significance that had been identified as early as   November   in a report provided to the Corporation by another orthopaedic surgeon  Dr Horsley  His report stated in part      The injury as described to me by Ms Hughes is of her doing the  splits   This  if anything  would tend to stretch the adductor tendons  In this position  in fact  the gluteus medius and minimus tendons are relaxed  I find it difficult to understand why there would be mild tendinosis with the type of injury she describes       The distinction having been thus highlighted  it is surprising that there was no further questioning   either in chief or in cross examination   of Ms Hughes as to the description she had provided  The failure to further question Ms Hughes as to the movement experienced during the accident on   January   did little to   assist   the Tribunal affirmedHughes v Australian Postal Corporation   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  htmlOn   January   she was injured

to compensation for permanent impairment pursuant to sections   and   of the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    Cth   the   Act   The conclusion of the Tribunal as to permanent impairment is not in issue in this appeal  In the hearing before the Tribunal  Ms Hughes gave evidence  Her claim was sought to be supported by medical evidence from Dr Fearnside  a neurosurgeon  and Dr Ginnane

pain  She has developed a variety of symptoms  She told Dr Fearnside in October   she has continued to experience back  left buttock and left hip pain  also that she had developed left sided sciatica with referred pain to the foot  She also described having alternate cold and burning feelings in the left hip and buttock region and had experienced some paraesthesia in her right buttock and thigh

 Nonetheless since late August   she has worked   hours   minutes each work day and does     hours overtime most days            She said she has had several experiences of her left hip locking and her left leg giving way  That might occur once a month  although it occurred three times one month       These paragraphs may be taken as an account of the symptoms claimed to be suffered by Ms Hughes

material  in the expression  material questions of fact  must mean  objectively material   Even if that were right  it would by no means follow that the Tribunal was bound to set out findings that it did not make  But it is not right to read  material  as providing an objective or external standard of materiality  A requirement to set out findings and reasons focuses upon the subjective thought processes of the decision maker  All that s  c  obliges the Tribunal to do is set out its findings on those questions of fact which it considered to be material to the decision which it made and to the reasons it had for reaching that decision            It is not necessary to read s   as implying an obligation to make findings in order for it to have sensible work to do  Understanding s   as obliging the Tribunal to set out what were its findings on the questions of fact it considered material gives the section important work to do in connection with judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal  It ensures that a person who is dissatisfied with the result at which the Tribunal has arrived can identify with certainty what reasons the Tribunal had for reaching its conclusion and what facts it considered material to that conclusion  Similarly  a court which is asked to review the decision is able to identify the Tribunal s reasons and the findings it made in reaching that conclusion  The provision entitles a court to infer that any matter not mentioned in the s   statement was not considered by the Tribunal to be material  This may reveal some basis for judicial review by the Federal Court under Pt   of the Act  or by this Court in proceedings brought under s  v  of the Constitution   For example  it may reveal that the Tribunal made some error of law of the kind mentioned in s  e  of the Act  such as incorrectly applying the law to the facts found by the Tribunal  It may reveal jurisdictional error  The Tribunal s identification of what it considered to be the material questions of fact may demonstrate that it took into account some irrelevant consideration or did not take into account some relevant consideration       See also  Lang v Comcare   FCA   at       ALD   at    Given a statutory requirement to set out   findings on material questions of fact   the absence of any reference in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal to those findings of fact material to the decision to be reached may preclude a conclusion that the Tribunal impliedly took various considerations into account  Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   citedZoia v Secretary  Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlBut not every failure to hear and resolve every submission necessarily gives rise to such a question  In Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at   to   Jenkinson J expressed the position as follows      There is also the further possibility that the tribunal s failure to mention either the submission or the questions of fact which it raises was the result of a failure  by inadvertence  to consider the submission when the tribunal was engaged in deciding the reference  Not every failure by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to mention a contention advanced on behalf of a party will amount to a failure to comply with the requirements of s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act     or demonstrate that the contention was not considered in deciding the matter before the tribunal  But this submission concerning the ascertainment of profit was worthy of serious consideration and was seriously advanced to the tribunal  It ought  therefore  to be inferred that the submission was inadvertently overlooked by the tribunal either when the reference was being decided or when the reasons for the decision were being committed to writing  cf Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   at    In either event there has been  in my opinion  an error of law by the tribunal  so that the power of this court which s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   confers to decide the appeal  on a question of law  is available  The failure of the tribunal to carry out the duty to consider and determine each question of law and fact relevant to the determination of the reference to it of the respondent s decision  or the failure to carry out the duty imposed by s   of that Act  as the case may be  has brought about a miscarriage of justice by preventing this court from affording the parties a determination whether the tribunal s decision was vitiated by error of law  see Pettitt v Dunkley     NSWLR         Woodward and Foster JJ agreed  Subsequently  in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick   supra   at   Bennett J also referred to the need to address a submission of   substance   or a submission which would have   affected the outcome    See also  Zoia v Secretary
