Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedGrant Thornton Services  NSW  Pty Limited v St  George Wholesale Distributors Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs to the stricture present in relation to the granting of leave  found in s  S  of the Act  there is some difference of judicial opinion evident on the authorities as to the meaning and effect of the word  material  which appears in that subsection  A convenient summary of the authorities  and the differences of views  is to be found in Grant Thornton Services  NSW  Pty Limited v St  George Wholesale Distributors Pty Limited   FCA    hereafter Grant Thornton   where at paras       Perram J  states  However  it seems to me that I should accept that the authorities show that  material  means that an applicant  under s  S   must show that the debt in respect of which it is seeking leave is pivotal to the question of solvency  That is  the defendant must demonstrate that if the debt exists then the company will be insolvent and if the debt does not exist  then the company will be solvent  In my opinion  that is the better reading of the reasons of Spigelman CJ in Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at      I accept that  at first blush  paragraph   can be read the other way  however  for two reasons I do not think that passage should be so interpreted   First  it is apparent  for the reasons given by the Chief Justice in that judgment at         that the evident statutory intention which underpins s  S is very much directed to diminishing  rather than expanding  the circumstances in which debts are to be debated  Put another way  as the Chief Justice demonstrated in that case  the previous situation which obtained prior to the introduction of the predecessor to s  S   where it was common  frequent and unwelcome for debates about debts to take place at the time of the winding up petition  was to be expunged by that provision  It is consistent with that interpretation  or that understanding  of the intention underpinning  S to interpret materiality in a way which is circumscribed   Secondly  the learned Chief Justice indicated at     that he did not propose to follow the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Bayview Holdings Pty Ltd  in liq  v Zan Holdings Pty Ltd  unreported  Supreme Court of Western Australia  Ipp  Wallwork and Steytler JJ    October    The Full Court had there adopted a somewhat liberal approach to materiality  It seems to me that a fair reading of the reasons of the Chief Justice is that the proper approach to materiality is the narrow one  For completeness  it should be noted that in my opinion two justices of this Court have approached the matter on the more narrow view and have certainly thought themselves to be implementing the position in Switz  see HVAC Construction  Qld  Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd     ACSR   at     per French J  Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd   FCA   at       per Besanko J  That would be sufficient for me to feel obliged to approach the matter on the same basis   Mr Davidson drew my attention to a decision of White J in Radiancy  Sales  Pty Ltd v Bimat Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ACLC   where at     his Honour said this   The question is not whether the debt demanded by Radiancy  Sales  is determinative of Bimat s insolvency  The question is whether it is material to proving the company is solvent  If the debt is owed  the company is undoubtedly insolvent  If it is not owed  the company may be solvent if Mr Colosimo s evidence as to the payment of creditors is accepted  Accordingly  s  S  is satisfied in relation to the grounds that Radiancy  Sales  is not a creditor  or that the alleged debt is genuinely disputed  Reflecting upon the evident intent of s  S    the reasons for judgment of Spigelman CJ in Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd     NSWLR    hereafter Switz s case  and those of Perram J in Grant Thornton and the other authorities to which his Honour refers in the passage quoted  it seems to me that I  too  ought  with all respect to those who may have a different view  to adopt the more narrow view of materiality  Section  S is in the nature of a safety net  That is not to say in any way  though  that it is a substitute for  or an invitation for agitation in respect of a debt which ought to have been the subject of an application for the setting aside of a statutory demand citedPerpetual Nominees Ltd v Masri Apartments Pty Ltd  No     NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlSection  S has been the subject of considerable attention by the courts  As I understand the authorities  their effect is that the ground of opposition proposed must be such that it was actually not available to be asserted according to the facts and circumstances which existed at the time of the winding up  see  in this regard  Perpetual Nominees Ltd v Masri Apartments Pty Ltd  No     NSWSC         ACSR   at pages   to   para    In other words  the effect of s  S is to prevent a party opposing a winding up application on a ground that the company could have relied on  for the purposes of setting aside a statutory demand  but did not so rely  If that ground was actually available  the prohibition in s  S would be engaged consideredSwitz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd     NSWLR  As to the stricture present in relation to the granting of leave  found in s  S  of
