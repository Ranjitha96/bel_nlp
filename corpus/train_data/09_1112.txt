Austcorp International Limited v Owers  No     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedAckers v Austcorp International Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe matter has been before me on a number of occasions in connection with the appellant s attempts to overturn the decision of Rares J given on   May     Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd   FCA   which found reflection in orders made by his Honour on   May    The nature and timing of the applications before me provide some of the context for my consideration of the present application  I shall briefly refer to some matters of history later in these Reasons  On   September   Ms Monnox  who is the solicitor for the respondents  telephoned Mr Tzovaras  who is the solicitor for the appellant  and inquired of him as to whether the security for costs ordered by me was going to be provided and  if so  when  Mr Tzovaras  response was noncommittal  In effect  he did not inform Ms Monnox of any concrete proposal concerning the provision of the security  On   September   Ms Monnox followed up Mr Tzovaras who was at that time unavailable  She left a message for him to contact her urgently  Mr Tzovaras did not respond  Later that day  Ms Monnox wrote a letter to Mr Tzovaras in which she pointed out that the security had not been provided as ordered  She drew Mr Tzovaras  attention to the fact that her clients  undertakings not to enforce the judgment debts were now extinguished and that the respondents proposed to issue creditor s statutory demands to the appellant in respect of the judgment debts which each of the respondents had against the appellant  In that letter she also foreshadowed an application that the appeal be dismissed for want of prosecution  In that letter  Ms Monnox made very clear that she was instructed to take steps to have the appeal dismissed  The appellant originally sought leave to appeal from the decision of Rares J because it believed that that decision was not a final judgment  After argument  I made orders on   July   granting leave to appeal from the decision of Rares J should that leave be necessary and extending the time within which a Notice of Appeal could be filed in the event that  as I thought  the judgment of Rares J was in fact a final judgment  see Austcorp International Limited v Owers   FCA   relatedAustcorp

Export   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs submitted by the solicitor for the respondents  the discretion which the Court might exercise to order security under s   of the Federal Court Act is broad and unfettered but must be exercised judicially   Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export     FCR   at      A similar approach should be taken to the power to dismiss an appeal pursuant to s    The Court should have regard to all of the circumstances of the case in exercising its discretion citedTruth about Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI have already referred to the relevant circumstances in some detail  and it seems to me that  in the absence of any attempt at all by the appellant to explain itself or to provide assistance to the Court as to when security might be provided  the only appropriate course is for me to dismiss the appeal pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act  As Hely J said in Truth about Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd   FCA       It is a serious thing to terminate proceedings when there has not been a hearing on the merits       But in circumstances where there has been an unexplained failure to comply with an order of the Court  which itself was made in the circumstances which I have outlined  it seems to me that the proper exercise of the Court s discretion is to make the orders sought  Accordingly  pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act  I dismiss the appeal and I order the appellant to pay the costs of the respondents of and incidental to the Notice of Motion filed by the respondents on   September   and of the appeal  I also order that  to the extent necessary  the respondents be released from the undertaking given to the Court and noted in paragraph   in the orders of the Court made on   August    I should add that my present view is that that undertaking became spent according to its terms when the appellant failed to provide the security for the respondents  costs of the appeal which it had been ordered to provide  that is to say  at     pm on
