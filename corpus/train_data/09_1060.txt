Stawiczny Family Trust Pty Ltd  in the matter of Global Maintenance Consulting Pty Ltd v Dunford   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt is important to remember that a right to interlocutory relief depends upon the moving party being able to establish that there is a right to final relief  I consider that if the meeting on   August   was ineffective to remove Mr Stawiczny as Managing Director of the Company and from participation in the management of the Company and that the resolution to remove him as a director of the Company proposed to be put to the meeting of members of the Company on   September   is not a resolution that can properly be put having regard to the terms of the Shareholders  Agreement  then those matters give rise to an entitlement to relief under s   of the Act  cf Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at    Mr Anderson gave notice of the meeting of directors on the morning of   August    His notice stated that the meeting was being called for    am on the following day and that  if a quorum is present at that time  the meeting will proceed whether or not you are there  This is consistent with the process as per our Company Constitution    Later that day Mr Stawiczny sent an email to Mr Anderson in which he said that it was not convenient for him to meet at that time  The meeting did not occur at    am on   August   as Mr Stawiczny was not present  It will be recalled that cl  c  of the Shareholders  Agreement provided that a quorum for meetings of directors was all directors  As I have noted earlier  what occurred on   August   is controversial  There is no doubt that at some time after    am    am the three directors were present in the one room and that there was a dialogue about issues which particularly concerned Mr Anderson and Mr Dunford  Mr Anderson s evidence as to what occurred is disputed by Mr Stawiczny  I have referred earlier to the evidence of Mr Stawiczny and Mr Anderson
