Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland Proserpine Whitsunday Branch Inc v Minister for the Environment  Heritage   Ors   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMinister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  I have proceeded upon the basis that greenhouse gas emissions consequent upon the burning of coal mined in one of these projects might arguably cause an impact upon a protected matter  which impact could be said to be an impact of the proposed action  I have adopted this approach because it appears to have been the approach adopted by Mr Flanigan  However I am far from satisfied that the burning of coal at some unidentified place in the world  the production of greenhouse gases from such combustion  its contribution towards global warming and the impact of global warming upon a protected matter  can be so described  The applicant s concern is the possibility that at some unspecified future time  protected matters in Australia will be adversely and significantly affected by climate change of unidentified magnitude  such climate change having been caused by levels of greenhouse gases  derived from all sources  in the atmosphere  There has been no suggestion that the mining  transportation or burning of coal from either proposed mine would directly affect any such protected matter  nor was there any attempt to identify the extent  if any  to which emissions from such mining  transportation and burning might aggravate the greenhouse gas problem  The applicant s case is really based upon the assertion that greenhouse gas emission is bad  and that the Australian government should do whatever it can to stop it including  one assumes  banning new coal mines in Australia  This case is far removed from the factual situation in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc   FCAFC         FCR     In the circumstances the application must be dismissed  I will hear submissions as to costs     I certify that the preceding seventy three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett   Associate Dated    June   Counsel for the Applicant  S Keim SC C McGrath     Solicitor for the Applicant  Environmental Defenders Office     Counsel for the First Respondent  M Hinson SC M Swan     Solicitor for the First Respondent  Australian Government Solicitor     Counsel for the Second Respondent D Jackson QC D Rangiah     Solicitor for the Second Respondent Allens Arthur Robinson     Counsel for the Third Respondent D Gove QC D Clothier     Solicitor for the Third Respondent Clayton Utz     Date of Hearing    October       Date of Judgment    June         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
