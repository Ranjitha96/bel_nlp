ALR       FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Leave to amend was opposed by Counsel for the Respondent Minister upon the basis that the ground raising   jurisdictional error   was unparticularised  other than alleging a further unidentified   error of law   and that the grounds either raised no issues different to those in the existing Notice of Appeal   or had no prospects of success  An amendment  such as that proposed  which is ambiguous and raises nothing of substance  will not be permitted  Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish   FCA         ALR       FLR     Those submissions of Counsel for the First Respondent were accepted and leave to amend was consequently refused   A further reason for refusing leave to amend was the concern of the Court that the proposed amendments were obviously drafted by someone other than the Appellant  who  not surprisingly  had no knowledge of either what was intended to be conveyed by the concept of   jurisdictional error   or the   information   which  it was contended  should have been conveyed pursuant to s  A  The Appellant could thus provide no assistance to the Court as to what was intended to be embraced by the proposed amendments which was not otherwise within the existing Notice of Appeal followedLiu v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases
