Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw  No     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedInspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  There was no serious dispute that the first respondent  who had been convicted of theft  breached his duties as a trustee  Thus  the declarations were not controversial  Rather  at the first hearing of this matter on   September   the key question was whether the Commonwealth was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond or only for compensable loss  see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA     Bradshaw   at   and following   At the first hearing  the Commonwealth did not attempt to prove any costs incurred in relation to the investigation and prosecution of the first respondent  Rather  the Commonwealth pursued its claim that it was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond regardless of the amount of loss  I rejected this contention and held that the Commonwealth was entitled to recover only that which was proven to be its compensable loss  see Bradshaw   at     I also stated that I would not dismiss the application before giving the applicants an opportunity to adduce further evidence as to the quantum of the Commonwealth s loss  see Bradshaw   at    I adjourned the further hearing of the proceeding to allow the Commonwealth this opportunity discussedInspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  At the second hearing  the respondents  primary submission  which I ultimately accepted  was that the applicants should not be permitted to reopen their case to prove the quantum of loss  see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA     Bradshaw   at    Accordingly  I made the declarations sought by the applicants but their application of   August   was otherwise dismissed  The issue of costs now falls for determination referred toRe Smith  ex parte Inspector General in Bankruptcy   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicants submitted that the respondents should pay their costs on a party and party basis up to and including   April    the date I delivered reasons for judgment in Bradshaw      They conceded that they must bear the respondents  costs thereafter  although only on a party and party basis  There was  they said  nothing in their conduct of the case that warranted a departure from the usual course  because their reliance on Re Smith  ex parte Inspector General in Bankruptcy   FCA     Re Smith   was not unreasonable and  in respect of the application to reopen  the Court had itself considered  as at   April   that the applicants should be given an opportunity to quantify their loss   The applicants contended that  even though no monetary order was made in their favour  they were partially successful in the proceeding  They noted that    the respondents had not admitted that the first respondent breached the bond    the first respondent argued unsuccessfully that the applicants  claim was statute barred  and   the second respondent argued unsuccessfully that it had revoked its surety  The applicants observed that they had in fact established liability under the bond and as surety  although the applicants properly conceded that arguments   and    did not occupy a great deal of the court s time    The respondents contended that the making of the declarations was never controversial and that the real question in dispute was whether  the bond was  in effect  a good behaviour bond  forfeitable without proof of loss   They sought their costs on a party and party basis until   April   after which they sought costs on an indemnity basis  They argued that costs incurred after   April   were incurred unnecessarily because evidence quantifying loss could have been led at an earlier stage  They contended that they would not have incurred any costs subsequent to   April   had the application to reopen not been made  In written submissions  the second respondent said that  t he  special or unusual  circumstances warranting an order for indemnity costs are the loss of time to the parties and the Court by the Applicants taking the approach that they did    I am of the view that the justice of the case warrants an award of indemnity costs in the respondents  favour for the period after   April    The decision in Re Smith may explain the applicants  conduct at the first hearing but it does not explain their conduct thereafter  Further  whilst it is true to say that  as at   April   the court itself considered that the applicants should be given an opportunity to quantify their loss  the court formed the contrary view when it was informed of the circumstances known to both parties and relevant to the issue   As already stated in Bradshaw   at   these circumstances showed that the applicants should be taken to have opened and closed their case at the first hearing on the basis that they would not quantify their loss  Although there were factors militating in favour of a grant of leave to reopen  they were outweighed by contrary considerations  These considerations included that    the applicants deliberately chose not to quantify the Commonwealth s loss at the first hearing    prior to the first hearing  the applicants had plainly led the respondents to believe that the applicants were proceeding on the basis that quantum was irrelevant and  in any case  that the loss could not be quantified    the applicants did not make any application for a split trial  although it was open to them to do so    before the first hearing  the applicants knew that it would be said against them that they could not succeed without evidence quantifying their loss  and   whilst there were no pleadings  the issue in debate was clearly addressed in the correspondence between the parties prior to the first hearing  These considerations are also relevant to the respondents  application for indemnity costs   Had had the applicants so chosen  they might have led evidence as to quantification at the first hearing  Had they done so  they could have argued that the Commonwealth was entitled to the amount of the bond but they could also have sought to quantify their loss in the event that the court preferred the respondents  submission on the point to theirs  Had the    applicants done this  then there would have been no occasion for any subsequent hearings  The applicants took the stance  however  that the quantum of the loss was irrelevant and the loss could not be quantified  In my view  the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing  The costs incurred by the respondents after   April   when Bradshaw   was delivered  should be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis  I reiterate that although  as at that date  I was minded to give the applicants a further opportunity to quantify their loss  I formed a clear contrary view once I was informed of the circumstances known to both parties  though not the court  as at that date referred toCalderbank v Calderbank     All E R   The first respondent made an alternative claim for indemnity costs for the period following   June    On that day  the applicants rejected a settlement offer  made by letter of   June   for    in full and final settlement of all the Applicants  claims in this matter  exclusive of costs  being the total sum of all disbursements you have claimed   Referring to Calderbank v Calderbank     All E R   the first respondent submitted that he should receive costs on an indemnity basis after that date   As the first respondent noted  costs may also be awarded on an indemnity basis where a proceeding is unduly prolonged by an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise  see Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at   per Sheppard J  The rejection of a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order of indemnity costs  even if the offeree fails to secure a more favourable outcome in the proceedings  In order for there to be an indemnity costs order  the respondents must show that the applicants  rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs  see  e g   Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc  No       ALR   at     per Hely J  In this case  the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing  In my view  the rejection of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances because  as at   June    after the directions hearing of   June   the applicants should have appreciated that they would not be able to quantify the Commonwealth s loss unless granted leave to reopen their case  and that there were serious doubts that such leave would be forthcoming  This alternative basis would also support an award of indemnity costs in the first
