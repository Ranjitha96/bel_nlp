Irani v Hollyburton UK Limited   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAdams v Lambert   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In order to determine the issues in this appeal  it is useful to refer to the recent decision of Snelgrove v Roskell     FCR    In that case  Jacobson J considered whether an incorrect reference to the legislation  which was the statutory source of post judgment interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice  resulted in the bankruptcy notice being invalid  In determining the correct principles to apply  his Honour held  at       The High Court said in Adams   v Lambert     HCA       ALR   at   that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Act or the Bankruptcy Regulations   Cth  the Regulations  the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s    If it is  it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court  It must be borne in mind that these are separate and distinct questions      The first question  that is  whether the defect or irregularity is formal  involves two levels of enquiry  These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   and applied in Adams   HCA       ALR   at   ff      The relevant enquiry is  does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations  or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  see Kleinwort Benson   CLR at   Adams   ALR   at     In determining what is an essential requirement one is guided by the High Court in Adams v Lambert   HCA         ALR   at           In some cases the answer to that question may be easy  In others  a difficult question of judgment may be involved  The matter for judgment was identified by this court in Kleinwort Benson   CLR   at      In that case  the majority contrasted the concept of a formal defect or irregularity with a defect or irregularity that renders a bankruptcy notice a nullity that cannot be saved by s    To describe a defect as merely formal  or to describe a notice as a nullity  is  of course  to state a conclusion  rather than the reason for reaching that conclusion  Even so  it is necessary to identify the question that arises for judgment  The majority  referring to James   v FCT   HCA         CLR   at     and Pillai v Comptroller of Income Tax   AC   at     summarised the exclusionary aspect of the meaning of  a formal defect or an irregularity  by saying  at             The authorities show that a bankruptcy notice is a nullity if it fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Act  or if it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice          The question of construction raised by the words  a formal defect or an irregularity  is one to be decided by reading s   in the context of the whole Act  informed by the general purpose of the legislation  and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices  It is similar to the question that  in former times  would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory  In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority     HCA       CLR   at     it was said          A better test     is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of  a  provision should be invalid     In determining the question of purpose  regard must be had to  the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute    The High Court then considered whether the defect constituted a breach of an essential requirement of the Act  at      footnotes omitted    The other exclusionary aspect of the expression  a formal defect or an irregularity  in s   was said to consist in a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act  Here again  the word  essential  in its application in a particular case  involves a conclusion  If a requirement is made essential by the Act  then a failure to meet that requirement is not a formal defect or an irregularity within the meaning of s    Whether a requirement is made essential is to be decided by a process of statutory construction undertaken in the manner described above  The majority in Lewis   FCR   regarded the error in that case as involving a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act      To describe an error or a deficiency in a bankruptcy notice as involving a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act is to state a conclusion reached after a consideration of the legislative purpose and an evaluation of the significance or importance of the error or deficiency in the circumstances of the case  That question is not answered by observing that there has been a failure to meet a requirement  In this respect  the majority in Lewis placed undue emphasis on the imperative terms of the Act and Regulations  If there were no failure to meet a requirement  there would be no defect or irregularity  Furthermore  as noted earlier  the fact that the requirement is expressed by the use of the term  must  is not conclusive  How otherwise might a requirement as to form be expressed      The misdescription of the relevant section of the District Court Act was not capable of misleading the respondent as to what he had to do to comply with the notice  This is not a matter of dispute  The question is whether the misdescription involved a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act  On the true construction of the Act  is it essential that there be no misdescription of the relevant section  Is it the purpose of the legislation that any slip  such as giving a reference to the statutory provision governing pre judgment interest when what is intended is a reference to the provision governing post judgment interest  should invalidate the notice  Is this so no matter how clear it might be from other parts of the notice that the claim is for post judgment interest  The High Court then decided that the defect fell within the scope of s   of the Act  at     Section   in its application to bankruptcy notices  makes it plain that some instances of non compliance with the requirements as to the form of a notice will not invalidate the notice  The practical significance of an error or deficiency could vary according to the circumstances of each particular case  Errors or deficiencies in compliance with requirements as to form may involve questions of degree as well as of kind  At the same time  the decision in Kleinwort Benson shows that an error may be covered by s   even though it involves a substantial misstatement of an amount of money  It was essential that the bankruptcy notice state the amount claimed  Was it essential that the amount be correct  Section   made it clear that an overstatement  even a large overstatement  would not necessarily invalidate the notice  This court concluded that it was not the legislative purpose that a substantial understatement should necessarily invalidate the notice  That is to say  accurately stating the amount of interest owing was not a matter of such importance that error necessarily resulted in invalidity  In the present case  overstatement or understatement of the amount of post judgment interest owing would not necessarily have invalidated the notice  That is part of the context in which legislative purpose is to be considered in deciding whether the reference to s  A rather than s   was fatal   Before me  the appellant contended that the calculation of interest requirement is made essential by the Act because        the purpose of the requirement is to enable the debtor to verify that the amount claimed is in fact due    the information required to be provided  namely an interest calculation  is of far greater importance than the requirement under consideration in Adams   HCA       ALR    to give a precise identification of the provision under which interest is claimed    in the usual case  the omission has the potential to  reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  in the event of an overstatement  the debtor is entitled to pay the actual amount of the debt and not the overstated amount    in the usual case the omission has the potential to prejudice the debtor s ability to exercise rights under s   in the event of an overstatement  a notice of overstatement must give sufficient information for the creditor to identify what is said to be alleged misstatement   Each of the above submissions is presented in the abstract and without consideration of the basis of the claim for interest in the Notice  I do not consider it helpful to compare and contrast different types of information that may be included in a notice  and attribute to them lessor or greater importance  The task I have is to consider the legislative purpose of the Act and make  an evaluation of the significance or importance of the error or deficiency in the circumstances of the case   Assuming that the Notice does not comply  substantially or otherwise  with the requirement to give details of the calculation of the amount of interest  or fails to specify the actual interest rates over the relevant period  in my view it is not an essential requirement of the Act that such details be provided having regard to the following particular circumstances of this case      there is and can be no dispute about the amount of interest claimed      an order of the Supreme Court of Victoria binding on the debtor has determined  and calculated  the amount of interest claimed      the Notice accurately sets out the basis of the claim for interest  namely pursuant to the Supreme Court Act   and has been determined  and calculated  by the Supreme Court of Victoria in the   Orders  and     there is  and can be  no suggestion that any interest is claimed in the Notice itself otherwise than as set out therein   I cannot envisage that the legislative purpose of the Act would be served by concluding that the failure to adhere to the form in the way alleged by the appellant would lead to the Notice being a nullity  It would be a classic situation of preferring form over substance to conclude that the Notice was a nullity  The whole purpose of the essential requirements of the Act is to inform the debtor clearly and simply of the basis of the debt said to be owed  and this has been achieved   In any event  in my view  the calculation of interest in itself is not necessarily an essential requirement of the Act  irrespective of the circumstances of this case   The High Court of Australia in Adams   HCA       ALR   considered all judgments of the court in Lewis   FCA       FCR    After considering the minority decisions of Gyles and Lee JJ  the court approved their approach and applied the legislative purpose test applied by Gyles and Lee JJ  at   to    I do not conclude  however  that the High Court necessarily approved the comments of Lee J concerning Re Bankruptcy Act     Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd     ALR    Further  his comments in this regard were made concerning the old notice prescribed pursuant to s   of the Act as it was prior to the amendments made in   where there was no requirement in the same terms as note   of the new form of the bankruptcy notice  although reflections were made by his Honour on the new notice which impacts upon his views as to what would be expected by the new notice   In light then of the approach to the legislative purpose adopted by Lee and Gyles JJ  as approved by the High Court  in my view nothing in the Act indicates that now the calculation itself must be included in the Notice  In fact  if it were not a requirement prior to the   amendment  the tendency would be towards the view that providing such information is not now a statutory requirement in the Kleinwort Benson   HCA       CLR   or Adams   HCA       ALR   sense  if one adopts the approach of Gyles J as referred to above   Justice North did not have the advantage of the reasoning in the subsequent cases referred to in this judgment  particularly Adams   HCA       ALR   Lewis   FCA       FCR   and Snelgrove   FCR    With the benefit of the reasoning in these decisions  North J would have needed to have undertaken an analysis of the failure to comply with note   of the Schedule to the form in the context of the Act to determine whether it was an essential requirement  Merely equating such a failure to a failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice without the further analysis now required  would not be sufficient  In the circumstances  I do not regard the decision of North J as one I should follow  In any event  the circumstances of the case before me are quite different from those confronting his Honour  for he did not have a binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria declaring the amount of interest payable which was the basis of the interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice citedAmerican Express International Inc v Held   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The High Court found that the mistake in the bankruptcy notice was not a breach of an essential requirement of the Act and that s   applied to remedy the default  at       In Lewis  at     Gyles J accurately identified the question as whether correct completion of the form prescribed by the regulations in every respect is a requirement made essential by the Act  Bearing in mind that  in the present case  the error could not have misled the respondent as to what it was necessary to do in order to comply with the requirements of the notice  it is difficult to understand how  consistently with Kleinwort Benson   the respondent could succeed without an affirmative answer to that question  In their dissenting reasons in Lewis   Lee J and Gyles J both gave a detailed account of the   amendments to the Act and Regulations  It is unnecessary to repeat what they said in that respect  Lee J concluded  at             Properly construed  the Act and Regulations do not express an intention to create a new regime of strict compliance imposed on a judgment creditor issuing a bankruptcy notice  The tenor of the Act and Regulations is not consistent with that conclusion  An attempt has been made to recast the process of issue of a bankruptcy notice in terms more understandable to a judgment debtor  but the essential requirements of a bankruptcy notice remain as they have been stated by bankruptcy legislation over many years         Lee J also said  at             It cannot be correct that amendments to the Act that left undisturbed s   and   which state that a notice that demands payment of a sum that is unjustified or excessive is only invalid if a debtor gives notice within a prescribed period  introduced a new regime in respect of bankruptcy notices under which a judgment debtor could have such a notice set aside where the amount claimed is due in fact and there is no prospect that the debtor could be misled as to the steps to be taken to comply with the notice  The amending Act could not have contemplated that a mistaken citation of the source of entitlement to claim interest would be a substantive defect or irregularity in the notice so as to exclude the operation of s   of the Act         That view of the legislative purpose is persuasive  The effect of the majority view in Lewis is to attribute to the legislature an overwhelming preference for form over substance  That should not be done  Given that s   relieves against the invalidating consequences of some mistakes in the preparation of bankruptcy notices  the mistake that was made in this case falls within its terms   In Bendigo Bank Ltd v Gard   FCA         FCR   North J in an ex tempore decision considered an appeal from a decision of the registrar regarding the failure to make a sequestration order for non compliance with a bankruptcy notice  by reason that the notice was defective in that it did not include an interest calculation  His Honour considered the decision of Kenny J in American Express International Inc v Held   FCA         FCR   where her Honour found that failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice was a breach of an essential requirement of the Act  At   North J held that even though there was no precise analogy

between the parties in the proceeding before Whelan J  as was noted by the federal magistrate  at     In this case the respondent has not produced a schedule explaining how the figure set out in the

in accord with the relevant statutory provisions that apply to judgments of this type in Victoria  However  it is conceded that the declaration of Whelan J is binding  There has been no appeal  nor is

 In Re Spurr  Ex parte Werner     FCR   Heerey J considered the validity of a bankruptcy notice which stated the amount of interest due but not the rate of interest applied  The notice also contained inconsistencies as to whether payment was to be made by the debtor in   or   days  His Honour dismissed the creditors  petition and held that the notice was invalid by reason of the inconsistencies in the notice  As to the calculation of interest  his Honour held at     It seems to me that as long as the bankruptcy notice correctly states the amount of interest which is in fact due  the notice is valid and the debtor fails to pay that amount at his peril  No authority was cited which suggests there is any requirement to include in the notice all the information which would be necessary for the debtor to be able to recalculate the amount of interest to his own satisfaction   The decision of Heerey J is consistent with the position observed by Lee J and the view I have arrived at after a review of the authorities  The position adopted by his Honour is  in my view  currently the correct one discussedSnelgrove v Roskell     FCR   In order to determine the issues in this appeal  it is

declaring the amount of interest payable which was the basis of the interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice discussedThe Australian Steel Company  Operations  Pty Ltd v Lewis   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Apart from the reference to the Regulations in the last paragraph  to which see Gyles J at   in The Australian Steel Company  Operations  Pty Ltd v Lewis   FCA         FCR   referred to later which correctly indicates that the task is to focus on the Act not the Regulations  in my view Jacobson J correctly states the matters relevant to the inquiry whether the defect or irregularity in the Notice is a formal defect or an irregularity   However  a preliminary matter to consider is whether the Notice was defective or irregular in any event by reason of a failure to include an interest calculation in accordance with note   having regard to the circumstances of this case and to the operation of s  C of the Acts Interpretation Act   This preliminary matter was raised by the respondent  the federal magistrate having found  in favour of the appellant  that there was a relevant defect or irregularity in the Notice   If there was such a defect or irregularity  then the only remaining issue that I have been asked to determine is whether the Notice failed to meet a requirement made essential by the Act  The appellant did not contend that the failure to include an interest calculation could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what was necessary to comply with the Notice  but said that this was not relevant to determining whether there was a failure to comply with a requirement made essential by the Act  I agree  The relevant inquiry as described by Jacobson J consists of two aspects  which need to be addressed separately  and to the extent the federal magistrate treated both aspects together  in my respectful view he fell into error   However  I turn first to the preliminary matter as to whether the Notice substantially complied with the requirements of the form prescribed by the Regulations  In my view  the Notice does provide an equivalent to the required details of the calculation of the interest claimed as is necessary and prescribed  in the unusual circumstances surrounding the Notice   The following information is contained in or can be derived from the Notice      The   Orders were made on   June   in

of     pursuant to the PIR Act and according to the calculation made by the binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria     No further interest was claimed   In Lewis   FCA       FCR   Lee J considered the amendments to the Act  which were enacted in   reviewed the legislation and considered whether the calculation of interest was a necessary requirement of a bankruptcy notice  His Honour held at         Under s   as it now stands  the Act goes no further than restating that which was formerly provided in s     namely that a bankruptcy notice be in accordance with the form prescribed  Nothing turns on the fact that the old form was prescribed by rules and the new form prescribed by regulations  On its face  therefore  the amendment has made the Act less prescriptive in operation than it was before the amendment      In the old notice  identification of the judgment relied upon was essential and was provided for in the form  As a matter of practice  costs and interest could be included as part of the sum owing under the judgment provided they were sums for which the creditor could enforce payment by execution  but no further identification of the source of the obligation  other than the judgment  was necessary   See Kleinwort Benson at   Re Manion  Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at     Identification of the authority to claim costs or interest flowed from identification of the judgment or order relied upon and provision of information in respect of costs and interest was not essential for the debtor to obtain an understanding the requirements of the bankruptcy notice  It was suggested in CBC Sydney at   that inclusion of particulars of the calculation of interest in the bankruptcy notice was essential to the validity of the notice  It is not clear on the authorities referred to in CBC Sydney that such particulars were ever an essential requirement  It would appear that there was no greater requirement than that the amount claimed for interest be calculated accurately and recited in the notice and not be claimed as an uncalculated amount   See Re Davis  Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ABC   Re McDonald  Ex parte Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd     ALR   at         The new notice does not require the judgment or order relied upon to be identified in the body of the notice but par   of the substantive part of the notice directed to the debtor states that a copy of the judgment or order relied upon by the creditor is attached  It may be said  therefore  that the attachment referred to now performs the essential requirement of the old notice that there be identification of the judgment or order relied upon  It can be seen that if a notice does not recite in the body thereof  particulars of the judgment or order relied upon  it may be necessary to provide a copy of the relevant judgment or order for the debtor to understand the requirements of the notice   See Haros v National Australia Bank Ltd   unreported  Federal Court  Ryan J   No   of     November     However  where a creditor is instructed by a note endorsed on the new notice to attach other documents that relate to matters of costs and interest  it does not follow that such an endorsement expresses the intention of Parliament that provision of that material become an essential requirement of the notice      Furthermore  the only document required to be lodged with the Official Receiver pursuant to reg     other than the draft bankruptcy notice and additional copies thereof  is the sealed or certified copy of the judgment or order  The Regulations do not require the person applying for the issue of a bankruptcy notice to lodge with the Official Receiver a certificate of the taxed costs or a document showing how interest was calculated if the draft bankruptcy notice includes a claim for costs or interest  As noted earlier  the form of bankruptcy notice in force before the amending Act was enacted did not refer to external documents  As noted above  reg     does not require more than one sealed or certified copy of the relevant judgment or order be lodged with the Official Receiver and is silent on whether the Official Receiver retains that document or returns it to the party seeking the issue of a bankruptcy notice  Paragraph   of the new notice  which seems to place greater reliance on its substance than form  states that a  copy  of the judgment or order relied upon is  attached  and does not state that the  attached  document is a sealed or certified copy of the judgment or order   See St George Bank Ltd v Klintworth     FCR   at     Emphasis added  Justice Gyles agreed with the views of Lee J  and made additional comments at     It is suggested that the   amendments can be construed by reference to the new regulations  I do not agree  The regulations do not control the construction of the Act in any way  The   amendments to the Act itself have nothing new  or relevant  to say concerning the required content of bankruptcy notices  As I have said  the only material change to the Act was to make the position less  rather than more  prescriptive than previously  The circumstance that the form now provides for much more information and is more complicated than hitherto would tend against a conclusion that the correctness and completeness of all information is a statutory requisite in the Kleinwort Benson sense  The varying nature and importance of the contents of the form which appears from the analysis by Lee J supports this conclusion  Delegated legislation is  of course  binding  That proposition is of no assistance in deciding whether strict compliance with a form prescribed by delegated legislation is made essential by the Act within the meaning of the majority judgment in Kleinwort Benson   Consideration of what was said by the majority at   of Kleinwort Benson shows that the phrase  made essential by the Act  in this context means what it says  and does not encompass the effect of a form prescribed by the executive government   The High Court of Australia in Adams   HCA       ALR   considered all judgments of the court in Lewis   FCA       FCR    After considering the minority decisions of Gyles and Lee JJ  the court approved their approach and applied the legislative purpose test applied by Gyles and Lee JJ  at   to    I do not conclude  however  that the High Court necessarily approved the comments of Lee J concerning Re Bankruptcy Act     Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd     ALR    Further  his comments in this regard were made concerning the old notice prescribed pursuant to s   of the Act as it was prior to the amendments made in   where there was no requirement in the same terms as note   of the new form of the bankruptcy notice  although reflections were made by his Honour on the new notice which impacts upon his views as to what would be expected by the new notice   Justice North did not have the advantage of the reasoning in the subsequent cases referred to in this judgment  particularly Adams   HCA       ALR   Lewis   FCA       FCR   and Snelgrove   FCR    With the benefit of the reasoning in these decisions  North J would have needed to have undertaken an analysis of the failure to comply with note   of the Schedule to the form in the context of the Act to determine whether it was an essential requirement  Merely equating such a failure to a failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice without the further analysis now required  would not be sufficient  In the circumstances  I do not regard the decision of North J as one I should follow  In any event  the circumstances of the case before me are quite different from those confronting his Honour  for he did not have a binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria declaring the amount of interest payable which was the basis of the interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice
