on   July   and as such the applicants can only rely on their claim under this section in relation to the events alleged to have taken place after this time  Pursuant to s  AC b  of the Act the Court is entitled to take into account circumstances existing prior to the commencement of the section but is not entitled to take into account alleged conduct prior to the commencement of the section in determining post commencement breaches  see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leelee Pty Ltd and Anor   ATPR     at       Section  AC  of the Act sets out a non exhaustive list of factors to which a court may have regard in determining whether a corporation has contravened s  AC   They include the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the business consumer as defined and whether  as a result of the supplier s conduct  the business consumer was required to comply with conditions not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the supplier  Other factors include the capacity of the business consumer to understand documents relating to the supply or possible supply of goods or services and whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on  or unfair tactics used against  the business consumer  Also relevant is the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the business consumer any intended conduct that might affect the interests of the business consumer and the risk involved  The extent to which the supplier was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of any contract for the supply of goods or services with the business consumer and the extent to which the supplier and the business consumer acted in good faith are also relevant factors   The relevant conduct for the purposes of s  AC a  relied upon by the applicants must be in connection with the supply or possible supply of services to a person  For the applicants to succeed in a claim within this section

Limited v Amadio and Another   HCA         CLR   Mason J referred to the underlying general principle applicable where one party takes unfair or unconscientious advantage of an opportunity created by the special disadvantage of another  Mason J said at       I qualify the word  disadvantage  by the adjective  special  in order to disavow any suggestion that the principle applies whenever there is some difference in the bargaining power of the parties and in order to emphasise that the disabling condition or circumstance is one which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to his own best interests  when the other party knows or ought to know of the existence of that condition or circumstance and of its effect on the innocent party   Section  AC of the Act proscribes unconscionable conduct in business transactions  The relevant prohibition is found in s  AC a      A corporation must not  in trade or commerce  in connection with         a  the supply or

 CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Court is also guided by the observations of the High Court of Australia in Fox v Percy   HCA         CLR   at   where the High Court referred to the preference for courts to make findings on the basis of contemporary materials  objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events rather than on the appearances of witnesses at the hearing   The detail contained in the affidavits provided by Mr Yang is carefully constructed and suggests recent invention in English  The same observation can be made of the other witnesses for the applicants  In this case the translation from Mandarin to English and the grammatical and semantic nuances lost in that process engender too much scope for uncertainty and do not establish the precision necessary for a finding of misrepresentation  The claimed representations by Ms Chen and Ms Lin were allegedly made to Mr Yang in Mandarin  The Court is not satisfied that any representations were made by them as alleged referred toIngot Capital Investments Pty Ltd and Others v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd and Others  No       ACSR   The Court is required to distil from the facts a version of the events which it considers is established by the evidence  In doing so the Court refers to the observations of McLelland CJ in Watson v Foxman and Others     NSWLR   at

   it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court    what the alleged conduct was  and   circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading  Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation  it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances   See also Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd and Others v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd and Others  No       ACSR   at   referred

edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second basis upon which the applicants claim unconscionable conduct on the part of AIA is in relation to the events leading up to the resignation of Mr Yang on   January    AIA accepts that a strict application of legal rights may be unconscionable if exercised harshly  oppressively or capriciously  see Legione and Another v Hateley   HCA         CLR   at    However there is nothing to suggest that the effective termination  by resignation  of Mr Yang was exercised by AIA harshly  oppressively or capriciously  The dishonesty of Mr Yang in relation to the issue of the receipts in respect of Mr Xu s policies  the false completion of the application forms for Mr Xu  the false representations to the AIA clerk on   December   the false alteration of the receipt presented to AIA and the false versions of events given to Mr Chinnery in January   together with the choice of resignation offered to Mr Yang  support a conclusion that the cessation of Mr Yang s agency was not in any way brought about by the unconscionable conduct of AIA but rather by the conduct of Mr Yang himself consideredMoukhayber v Camden Timber and Hardware Co Pty Ltd   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  The only alleged oral representations made in English were made by Mr Juneau to Mr Yang  The Court is guided by the judgment of Heydon JA in Moukhayber v Camden Timber and Hardware Co Pty Ltd   NSWCA   where his Honour said  at    the risks of misunderstanding   were doubtless increased by the plaintiff s lack of skill in speaking English    Given Mr Yang s very limited grasp of the English language  the Court is not satisfied that the alleged representations of Mr Juneau were in fact made   The representation alleging indemnity by AIA to Mr Yang and the evidence in support of such alleged representation lacks the required precision to constitute a representation  In summary the Court is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any representations were made to Mr Yang by Ms Lin  Ms Chen or by Mr Juneau as alleged   The terms relied upon by Mr Yang as constituting part of the representations  namely   security for life  and   guaranteed for life    exemplify the language difficulties and imprecision associated with the representations alleged in these proceedings  Identical words are contained in AIA s brochures but in an entirely different context to that claimed by Mr Yang  Such phrases are published by AIA in brochures for the benefit of clients  not for its agents  The brochure entitled  Security for Life  states  inter alia   AIA has the strength and international resources to provide  Security for Life  to its much valued customers    The brochure published solely for use by agents entitled  A Career for Life  states  inter alia   In Australia  we give our clients  Security for Life  we will always be there to help them when they need us no matter where they might be    The brochure does not suggest that the term  security for life  was to be interpreted as applying to agents  Rather it clearly applies to  clients   followedLouth v Diprose   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  For conduct to be actionable as unconscionable under s  AA it must be unconscionable under the unwritten law  The requirements of a finding of unconscionability in equity were described by the High Court in Louth v Diprose   HCA         CLR    At   Deane J said    It has long been established that the jurisdiction of courts of equity to relieve against unconscionable dealing extends generally to circumstances in which  i  a party to a transaction was under a special disability in dealing with the other party to the transaction with the consequence that there was an absence of any reasonable degree of equality between them and  ii  that special disability was sufficiently evident to the other party to make it prima facie unfair or  unconscionable  that that other party procure  accept or retain the benefit of  the disadvantaged party s assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he or she procured or accepted it  Where such circumstances are shown to have existed  an onus is cast upon the stronger party to show that the transaction was fair  just and reasonable followedQueensland Aggregates Pty  Ltd  and Another v Trade Practices Commission     FLR   As discussed above  for the applicants to succeed in a claim under s  AC of the Act the services provided by AIA to the applicants must be in connection with the supply or possible supply of services to the applicants  The Court accepts AIA s submission that the principal  right  acquired by the applicants under the various agreements is the right to be paid remuneration in the form of commissions and other benefits  In Queensland Aggregates Pty  Ltd  and Another v Trade Practices Commission     FLR   at   the Full Court held that a payment of money does not comprise a supply of services under the Act  Such  right  to remuneration is not a connecting factor for the purposes of s  AC a  of the Act  Accordingly the requirements of s  AC have not been met   As such the applicants have not made out their claim under either ss  A   AA or  AC of the Act and the Court dismisses the application with costs   I certify that the preceding one hundred and
