European Community v Commissioner of Patents   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedTitan Mining   Engineering Pty Ltd v Arnall s Engineering Pty Ltd     NSWLR   I have before me the following exhibits to the affidavit of Douglas Charles Carter  sworn   April        a  the patent application dated   March      b  the advertising of the acceptance of the application on   December      c  the notice of opposition dated   March   and    d  the decision of the delegate of the Commissioner of Patents dated   December     These are the requisite documents to found the jurisdiction of the Court in an appeal under s   see Titan Mining   Engineering Pty Ltd v Arnall s Engineering Pty Ltd     NSWLR     Titan    at   per McLelland J   The patent application in issue is entitled  Ruminal Bolus for Electronic Identification of a Ruminant   The specification relates to a bolus or large pill which is to be used in identifying ruminant animals  The device comprises a solid body composed of aluminium oxide which encloses electronic transmitting components  It is designed to be swallowed by the animal so that electro magnetic data can be transmitted and then used for tracking and other management purposes   The original respondent in the appeal  Aleis International Pty Ltd  Aleis  did not appear at the hearing  By affidavit sworn   March   Mr Ian David Hughes  a partner of Deacons  the solicitors for Aleis  deposed that he had been instructed that Aleis wished to withdraw its appearance and take no further part in the appeal  Aleis instructed Deacons to file a notice seeking leave to do so  Mr Hughes also deposed that he held instructions to institute revocation proceedings in respect of any patent that might be granted to the appellant as the result of a successful appeal  Those revocation proceedings  according to Mr Hughes  are likely to raise various grounds of invalidity including fair basing  manner of manufacture and inventive step  prior use  prior publication and such other grounds as may be advised   These submissions are made good by a number of authorities to which I was referred  Titan at     Caroma Sales Pty Ltd v Philmac Pty Ltd     ALJR     Caroma    at   per Walsh J  Brickwood Holdings Pty Ltd v ACI Operations Pty Ltd     VR     Brickwood    at     per King J  In Titan  McLelland J set out at     the approach that should be followed by the Court     Proceedings in the court on  appeal  from a decision of the Commissioner pursuant to s   are original proceedings and not an appeal in any technical sense  The duty of the Court in such proceedings is to exercise de novo the function of the Commissioner under s    The Court must exercise that function only on the basis of the evidence adduced in the proceedings before it  The material before the Commissioner or his delegate when he made the decision appealed from is not to be treated as being before the Court unless it is tendered and admitted in the proceedings before the Court  cf the Supreme Court Rules   Pt     r    Evidence which was not before the Commissioner may also be admitted before the Court      The Court  exercising the function of the Commissioner  may take into account a ground of opposition specified in s   whether relied on by the opponent or not  see s    This recognises that a decision under s   has a public aspect going beyond the mere resolution of a contest between the applicant and the opponent  This public aspect is further recognised by s   of the Act which contemplates active intervention by the Commissioner before the Court  with leave  in such proceedings as this  The non appearance  or withdrawal  of the opponent provides an obvious occasion for such intervention where there are matters to which  in the public interest  the Commissioner desires to have the Court direct its attention      Where a ground of opposition depends on some fact being established  the onus of proof of that fact rests upon the party seeking to establish that ground of opposition  that is  the opponent or the Commissioner  as the case may be        Subject to its jurisdiction being established  the issue for the Court is  as it was for the Commissioner  whether the patent  if granted  would be clearly invalid on one of the relevant grounds  Unless invalidity on such a ground is clearly shown  the application should be allowed to proceed to a grant and the validity of the patent left to be determined in infringement or revocation proceedings   Mr McGowan has drawn my attention to the fact that the grounds available to the Court to refuse a patent application are all those available to an opponent  whether relied upon by the opponent or not  see s   of the Patents Act and Titan at    However  I agree with his submission that the grounds available can only be those which are supported by evidence or which do not require evidence  The only ground of opposition taken below was that of prior user  and no evidence capable of supporting that ground has been adduced before me  Nor has any cross contention been filed that would raise any other issue   I have also taken into account that s   of the Patents Act makes it clear that the grant of a patent is no guarantee of validity  Here  indeed  Mr Hughes  affidavit indicates that the original opponent intends to institute revocation proceedings  In those circumstances  there is  in my opinion  no reason why the Court need examine the merits of the opposition  That is particularly so where the Commissioner of Patents  who would normally raise public interest factors for the assistance of the Court  has indicated that it does not oppose the orders sought in the appeal   Accordingly  I propose to make the orders sought by the appellant  There is no need  having regard to the authorities  for this Court to embark upon a consideration of the merits of an opposition that has not been pursued      I certify that the preceding nineteen   numbered

issue for decision would be whether  if granted  the patent would be clearly invalid  The authorities dealing with the issues that arise in an appeal and the onus of proof are canvassed by Emmett J in Hoffman La Roche   particularly at          Emmett J arrived at the following conclusion at        The language employed in the cases to which I have referred suggest that it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent  if granted  would not be valid   The appellant submitted that the appeal should be allowed and the patent application should proceed to grant essentially because the onus is on the now withdrawn opponent to make out the opposition and  in this proceeding  the opponent has neither tendered nor adduced any evidence before this Court capable of discharging its onus  In those circumstances  the accepted patent application stands unchallenged and it was submitted that it must be allowed to proceed to grant followedCaroma Sales Pty Ltd v Philmac Pty Ltd     ALJR   These

there was then no way in which the issues raised in the opposition proceedings could be put before the Court  and the Court had before it an accepted application which it was proper to require the
