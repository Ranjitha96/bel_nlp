the conclusion that these proceedings in the name of Lynne Maree Rogers have been instituted  and then resurrected  because earlier proceedings brought by the applicant s husband were the subject of

austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  By coincidence  in the ordinary operation of this Court s docket system  it has fallen to me  in QUD  to decide whether to grant to Mrs Rogers leave to appeal in respect of some of her litigation namely  proceeding QUD  Rogers v Asset Loan Pty Ltd and Ors   FCA       November   Collier J  There was no objection made to my having each matter  Nonetheless  I have expressly considered whether  in light of that coincidence and the conclusion reached by me in the preceding paragraph  I ought not to hear one of the applications made with respect to Mr and Mrs Rogers  respective proceedings with the other being transferred to another judge to hear and determine  In my opinion  the rules of natural justice do not require that course to be taken   In the substantive application filed in this proceeding Mr Rogers seeks the following relief   a  orders under s  GF of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act    Cth    ASIC Act   being damages for  psychological stress  pain and suffering or mental damage  for breaches of the following sections of the ASIC Act        i  unconscionable conduct s  CA CC   ii  undue harassment and

In my reasons for judgment in relation to Mrs Rogers  leave to appeal application I describe the ultimate origins and chronicle the course of the other litigation which Mr Rogers and later his wife have come to institute or with which they have come to be involved in this and other courts  I have studied the affidavit which Mr Rogers came to swear and file in this proceeding on   November   in support of the substantive application  In that affidavit he deposes to a series of alleged  events   Having regard to that affidavit and to the other evidence before me in this proceeding  it is evident that the substantive application and Mrs Rogers  leave to appeal application have like ultimate origins and that the course of the other litigation is likewise relevant  So as to make these reasons for judgment self contained I have  instead of just incorporating my description and a related chronology by reference from the reasons for judgment in Mrs Rogers  case  again reproduced them

   Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD  against the First to Seventh Respondents in which she seeks leave to appeal against the decision of Justice Collier in QUD    In one of those earlier cases  Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   Greenwood J commented  at   It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding  a claim might emerge which  in terms of its material facts  reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss      AC or   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee  At the moment the material does not establish any such right  The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee   This comment was made with reference to that class of property which s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act removes from property divisible amongst a bankrupt s creditors  namely        Subsection   does not extend to the following property                 g  any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation       i  for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt  the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt  or  ii  in respect of the death of the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt      and any damages or compensation recovered by the bankrupt  whether before or after he or she became a bankrupt  in respect of such an injury or wrong or the death of such a person   In another of those earlier cases  Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     which again came before Greenwood J  his Honour commented  at   Moreover  if the services relied upon by Mr Rogers for the purposes of s   of the TPA are financial services as the pleading seems to suggest  s  AF  provides that Part V of the Act within which s   falls  does not apply to the supply  or possible supply  of services that are financial services   The relevant statutory instrument regulating financial services is the  ASIC Act    These comments seem to have inspired Mr Rogers to give his perceived grievances different attire in the form of the present proceedings in the hope that they will prove less threadbare in law than has hitherto proved to be the case  Regard to Mr Rogers  affidavit of   November   discloses that  in the main  those perceived grievances replicate those set out in statements of claim that he filed in earlier proceedings in this Court  An exception to this is a personal injuries damages claim based on alleged breaches of the ASIC Act    Insofar as those perceived grievances are now presented in a different guise   a  any cause of action under the ASIC Act that does not fall within s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act is vested in Mr Rogers  trustee in bankruptcy  and   b  having regard to Mr Rogers  affidavit of   November   and the other evidence upon which he relies  the following further observations made by Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   remain apposite  even though the claim is now formulated by reference to the ASIC Act rather than the Trade Practices Act      i   at    In truth  Mr Rogers seeks to recover the lost value of the rights and entitlements he says he ought to have enjoyed by reason of the fulfilment of the promises of the relevant respondents in respect of each of the various property transactions pleaded in the statement of claim  Any such claim is vested in the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers      ii   at    Damages for anxiety or stress may  however  be consequential but severable in the sense of being capable of estimation without regard in the estimation   to the bankrupt s rights of property  The claim by Major Wilson  in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd   AC   considered by Dixon J  in Cox v Journeaux  No      HCA       CLR   at   was emblematic of a consequential but severable claim which was capable of agitation by the bankrupt  If the damages are capable of estimation in such a way and are capable of being understood as severable from any claim on behalf of the trustee  it seems to me that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     FCR   applying Cox v Journeaux  No    contemplates that such a claim resides with the bankrupt even though it may be properly described as a consequential claim    Emphasis in original  explanatory case references or citations added    The reference to  the principle stated by Dixon J  is a reference to the reasons for judgment of his Honour in Cox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR   at   to which reference is made in the passage which I have quoted above from the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   FCA     Greenwood J did no more than acknowledge a theoretical possibility  recognised in the authorities to which his Honour referred  of a severable personal injuries claim  As it transpires  Mr Rogers  endeavour to engage that theoretical possibility in practice is  at least as presently revealed  futile  in my opinion   The Respondents have sought to have the substantive application dismissed pursuant to the powers conferred on the Court by s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth    Federal Court of

or citations added    For the Respondents it is submitted that none of the damages Mr Rogers claims in the present proceeding would fall for assessment by  immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind  body or character and without reference to his rights of property   The conjunctive in this proposition  derived from Cox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR   at   is emphasised on their behalf  It is submitted that the damages which Mr Rogers claims are entirely consequential on damage to Mr Rogers  financial interests as a result of alleged contraventions of the ASIC Act   Mr Rogers presses for an opposing conclusion   The reference to  the principle stated by Dixon J  is a reference to the reasons for judgment of his Honour in Cox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR   at   to which reference is made in the passage which I have quoted above from the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     For all that  what in substance Mr Rogers has done in the present proceeding is to seek to agitate a claim for damages for personal injury  loss and damage pursuant to causes of action said to arise under the ASIC Act   He has not done this before  No submission was made that this absence of seeking to litigate this very cause of action was irrelevant in light of Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   and the outcome of earlier proceedings in this Court brought by Mr Rogers against some of the Respondents  Further  it is  with respect  as set out above  possible to discern in the reasons for judgment given in certain of the earlier proceedings the inspiration for the present proceeding  Yet further  the application of the principle described by Sir Owen Dixon in Cox v Journeaux  No    in the circumstances of the present case is not without difficulty appliedBryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     FCR   Insofar as those perceived grievances are now presented in

references or citations added    The answer  in my opinion  is supplied by analogy with the following passage from the judgment of Handley JA  with whom Kirby P  as his Honour then was  and Meagher JA agreed  in the unreported New South Wales Court of Appeal decision Manningel v Hewlett   June   which was cited with approval by O Loughlin and Merkel JJ in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     FCR     at   The plaintiffs claimed damages in the proceedings in the manner particularised in paras  e   f  and  g  of their amended statement of claim but these claims were consequential upon alleged breaches of professional duty owed to them by the defendants in relation to the purchase of the land and the contract by the vendor to erect a dwelling house on it  The plaintiffs  claims for damages for loss of credit  for mental distress  inconvenience and for injury to their physical and mental health therefore were not claims  without reference to their rights of property  within the principle stated by Dixon J  On the contrary those claims were consequential on damages to the plaintiffs  financial and property interests as a result of alleged breaches of professional duty by the
