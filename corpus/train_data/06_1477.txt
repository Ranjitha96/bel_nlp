SZBII and Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Anor   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toApplicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Numerous authorities have held that  absent any default by the Tribunal in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations relating to the provision of an invitation to attend a hearing  no ground of procedural unfairness arises because of some default on the part of an agent retained by an applicant  In NBAJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA     Barnes FM at   adopting the observations of Lord Bridge in Regina v Home Secretary  Ex parte Al Mehdawi     AC   at   rejected the submission that fraud by an agent constituted jurisdictional error  In SZBSZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   Bennett J considered the circumstance in which an applicant claimed his migration agent had acted without consultation or instructions and in consequence an invitation to attend a Tribunal hearing was declined  Her Honour concluded that since the Tribunal s letter was forwarded in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements  there was no failure to give the applicant the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal  even though the applicant claimed that he had never received it  Accordingly the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision on the application for review in the absence of the applicant  The same conclusions were made in Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA    In SZBBL v Minister for Immigration   FMCA     Driver FM rejected the submission that there had been a denial of natural justice because of default on the part of the migration agent  His Honour s decision was upheld on appeal in this Court by Tamberlin J  see SZBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   referred toCameron v Cole   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In SZFDE the majority found that the legislative scheme contained in Div   of the Act required an invitation to be given to the appellant  Such invitation had been provided  and the decision not to attend resulted from the dishonest conduct of the agent  However  such conduct did not corrupt the decision or the statutory process  The majority considered that authorities which have upheld challenges to orders made against a party by a court in their absence through no fault of their own  such as Taylor v Taylor   HCA         CLR   and Cameron v Cole   HCA         CLR   are distinguishable because of the absence of the statutory scheme provided by the Act distinguishedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The sole basis for the assertion that there has been procedural error arises in consequence of the alleged fraudulent conduct by the appellant s nominated agent arising from his advice to the appellant that he would attend the hearing on his behalf and that it was not necessary for the appellant to attend  The appellant claims that there was a failure to comply with s   of the Act because he was not provided with a   real and meaningful invitation   as considered in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR   FCAFC         FCR   at     because of the conduct of the migration agent   In SCAR the Full Court recognised that under certain circumstances the invitation process prescribed by s   of the Act may not have been fulfilled  see also SZFML    However  in SCAR the Full Court found that the Tribunal innocently provided unfair treatment to the appellant in circumstances where the appellant was ill  In Tobasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   the Tribunal provided a translator who was unable to speak the appellant s language  In VBAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   the appellant was misled by statements of the Tribunal  In Applicant NAHF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCR   the Tribunal declined to grant an adjournment of the hearing  knowing that the appellant was incapacitated  Although the requirement of s   had been followed  the invitation was held to be  an empty gesture and a denial of procedural fairness see Hely J at     followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Even if the appellant established fraud  in the sense of reckless conduct or dishonesty by his migration agent which resulted in a non attendance at a hearing of the Tribunal  the decision of the Tribunal is not vitiated  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE   FCAFC   in which Allsop J said at      The parties did not attend a hearing to which they were invited  on the facts  because of the dishonest advice of their own agent  The decision itself was made  without the benefit of the participation of the respondents  but unaffected  and certainly not induced  by fraud    His Honour also said at      There has been no fraud of the Tribunal  There has been no fraud of the executive department  There was an invitation to attend a hearing  That invitation was declined  That decision to decline the invitation was influenced by the dishonesty and fraudulent purpose of the agent of the applicants  I do not see the basis for a conclusion that there was any denial of procedural fairness or that those circumstance  sic  denied the Tribunal the authority to decide the review given the terms of ss    A and s  B   In SZFDE the majority found that the legislative scheme contained in Div   of the Act required an invitation to be given to the appellant  Such invitation had been provided  and the decision not to attend resulted from the dishonest conduct of the agent  However  such conduct did not corrupt the decision or the statutory process  The majority considered that authorities which have upheld challenges to orders made against a party by a court in their absence through no fault of their own  such as Taylor v Taylor   HCA         CLR   and Cameron v Cole   HCA         CLR   are distinguishable because of the absence of the statutory scheme provided by the Act   In SZFDE French J dissented  finding that the fraud did affect the decision because it resulted in the non appearance of the appellant before the Tribunal  As a consequence the Tribunal was deprived of the opportunity of exploring certain issues with the appellant  French J concluded that the Tribunal s decision   was not one made under the Act  and therefore not a privative clause decision protected by s      French J s decision recognises the possibility that where  through no fault of their own  an appellant is deprived of a hearing  circumstances may exist to vitiate the decision despite compliance with the requirements of the statutory scheme  This possibility was also recognised by the Full Court in SZFML   It is apparent that the facts in each case will be critical in determining whether consent by the appellant to the agent in fact existed   This Court considers that it is bound to follow the majority in SZFDE   and to conclude that fraud  even if proved by the appellant  does not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal   In view of the above finding  it is not necessary to consider this ground of appeal  However  the Court will nevertheless state its observations   The appellant also challenges the finding of Nicholls FM that the MARA Notice would not establish fraudulent conduct by the agent and that the evidence before the Tribunal was not sufficient to establish fraud  The appellant sought to rely upon the MARA Notice as demonstrating a   propensity   for the migration agent to have misled the appellant by conduct amounting to fraud  or conduct akin to fraud   In written submissions provided after the hearing  the appellant relied upon the dissenting judgment of French J in SZFDE wherein his Honour stated that   the common law proposition that fraud may vitiate an administrative decision   extends to cover   reckless conduct   and sought to establish that the evidence of the migration agent s wrongful conduct in the MARA Notice is relevant to the question of whether the agent s conduct was reckless  The appellant submitted that the MARA Notice would show a  system  or  pattern  and a repetitiveness of conduct which would strengthen the inference to be drawn from such evidence within the meaning of s   of the Evidence Act    Nicholls FM held at      Even if the conduct of the agent could be said to be fraudulent  or akin to fraud  none of this material or what the witness was expected to say  went to show irregular conduct on the part of the Tribunal  Nor on the basis of what the Full Court said in NASB where fraud is given as one specific example which could be relevant  does this material go to show fraud or even any other irregular conduct on the part of a Minister or those associated with the Minister  Nor does this material go to show fraud  perjury or other misconduct of a witness before the Tribunal   I am unable to find that there is any jurisdictional error in His Honour s conclusions  Section   of the Evidence Act establishes the parameters of the evidence which is admissible  His Honour was also entitled  pursuant to s  b  of the Evidence Act to conclude that the evidence had no significant probative value  The evidence of the MARA Notice and of the proposed witness would do no more than establish a suggestion of misleading conduct between the migration agent and other parties  It does not establish any link between the conduct of the migration agent and the appellant in these proceedings  The Court is unable to find any jurisdictional error on the part of Nicholls FM  and the subsequent Full Court decision in SZFDE now conclusively determines that fraud by an agent does not result in jurisdictional error by a Tribunal  It follows that the appeal must be dismissed   An order that the appellant pay the costs of the first respondent in the sum of   has been sought  The Court finds such amount to be reasonable and will make the order sought       I certify that the

www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In contrast  in Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v SZFML and Anor   FCAFC   the agent had correctly indicated to the Tribunal that his client wished to attend the hearing  Shortly before the hearing date the Tribunal changed the date  A further invitation was provided to the agent  who responded stating that the appellant did not wish to attend  However evidence established that in fact the appellant  being unaware of the date change  had attended at the hearing on the day and had always wished to provide further evidence in support of her case  Further  cross examination of her agent satisfied the Court that the agent s evidence that he received instruction from the appellant was unreliable  The Full Court found that the appellant had not authorised her agent either generally or specifically to complete the second Response to Invitation form  It concluded that s  G of the Act had no operation if the agent for the appellant acted beyond the scope of his authority in returning the Response to Invitation contrary to the instructions provided by the appellant  The Full Court confirmed the finding of the Federal Magistrate that where there was no effective consent submitted to the Tribunal by an appellant concerning the hearing  the appellant was not bound by the conduct of the agent   The facts of the present case do not raise this issue  The appellant acknowledges that he signed the Response to Invitation form  He did not speak English but he knew that the form related to an invitation to attend the hearing  and he signed the form knowingly indicating that he would not be attending the hearing  His complaint is that he was given the wrong advice by his migration agent  namely that the migration agent would attend the hearing  Unlike the unique circumstances in SZFML  the appellant does not claim that he wanted to attend the hearing  Rather  he was content for the migration agent to attend   I consider that the circumstances now before the Court are indistinguishable from those considered in NASF   The appellant has not been denied an opportunity to attend the hearing and the Tribunal complied with the requirements of s   in the same way as was found by Bennett J in SZBZL   The Court therefore concludes that there was no jurisdictional error on the part of Nicholls FM   In SCAR the Full Court recognised that under certain circumstances the invitation process prescribed by s   of the Act may not have been fulfilled  see also SZFML    However  in SCAR the Full Court found that the Tribunal innocently provided unfair treatment to the appellant in circumstances where the appellant was ill  In Tobasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   the Tribunal provided a translator who was unable to speak the appellant s language  In VBAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   the appellant was

cth FCAFC  html  In NASB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   the Court referred to the   degree of irregularity   that an applicant would need to show in order to obtain relief  Nicholls FM concluded that the details in the MARA Notice and the prospective witness  proposed statement did not   bridge the gulf between the agent s conduct which led to his deregistration and the elements necessary to prove fraud  or for that matter  something akin to fraud  whatever that may be    consideredNBAJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
