Reid v McCallum   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCollingridge v Santor Pty Ltd     FLR   Reliance was also placed by the plaintiff upon the authority of Young J in Collingridge v Sontor Pty Ltd     FLR   particularly the passage at    I do not consider this case assists the plaintiff  Again  that case was dealing with a situation of an arrangement being entered into without a special resolution and it was held to be null and void  Reliance was placed  however  I think by way of analogy and by way of principle  upon a passage where Young J said    However  it is clear that the deed could not be consummated without the memorandum or articles of association being altered so as to include material which would exempt the scheme from being a reduction of capital because of s   of the Corporations Law    In my view this is not the situation confronting me  The Acquisition Deed could well be consummated without any change of name  for example  although the consequences of a failure to do so  that is failing to change the name  may impact adversely upon the Company  I do observe that there is the opportunity for the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria Ltd  RACV  to terminate the arrangements in circumstances where the change of name does not occur  at least as the arrangements are currently drafted  But  in any event  even if I am wrong as to this analysis  in my view the decision of Young J does not deal with the point I need to decide  namely whether there is a requirement for a special resolution in this case   The position remains that there is no requirement in the articles of association  or the Act  that necessitates the use of a special resolution procedure in this case  nor has any other reason been shown for such a procedure to be adopted   I mention some other matters raised by the plaintiff for completeness  The plaintiff referred to the proposed arrangements conferring unequal benefits upon members  and reference was made to arts   and   of the articles of association  The benefits proposed to be conferred by the arrangements are benefits to be conferred by membership of the new association operated by the RACV  they are not benefits conferred under the articles of association of the existing entity  namely the Company  In my view  arts   and   have no application to the circumstances of this case   Secondly  I observe that the objective of the proposal is to preserve and improve golfing facilities for members of the Company  To the extent that this is a matter which is relevant for determination  I do not accept that the proposal is inconsistent with the objects of the Company set out in para   of the memorandum of association  There is the promotion of the game of golf  and the provision of links and grounds at Torquay  which do not necessarily need to involve the ownership of the land   It was also suggested that the implementation of the proposal will involve a contravention of para   of the memorandum of association and art   of the articles of association  However  it is to be observed that each of those provisions is predicated upon there being a  winding up or dissolution  of the Company  The proposal is not one for the winding up of the Company or its dissolution  although this is contemplated to occur in due course  Paragraph   of the memorandum and art   of the articles will operate according to the terms upon a winding up or dissolution when that occurs   Finally  considerations of policy were adverted to by the plaintiff  which may impact upon other questions that could arise out of these circumstances  but not upon the sole issue which I have been asked to decide   In these circumstances I propose to order that the application be dismissed

James v Beuna Ventura Nitrate Grounds Syndicate Limited   Ch D   at   where Lord Herschell said    A good deal of argument was addressed to us on the question whether this resolution of April    sanctioned a different allotment of the shares from that provided for by art    and  if so  whether it was competent by a special resolution to sanction a departure from the provisions of art    without having first by a special resolution duly altered that article  I am not satisfied that it would be competent for the company thus to act  It is unnecessary  however  to decide the point     There is not here any sanctioning of a departure from the articles of association or the Act  as was hypothesised in the case of James   Ch D    There is nothing in the proposal that has been put before the Court that suggests that the requirement in respect of a name change will not occur  namely  that procedures in relation to a special resolution will not be followed consideredMcCawley v The King   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The plaintiff also relied upon the cases of Taylor v Pilsen Joel   General Electric Light Co     Ch D   and McCawley v The King   HCA         CLR    I do not consider these cases take the matter any further in the context of this case  as they do not deal with  or touch upon  the issue I need to determine  namely the one postulated by the plaintiff in identifying the issue  This is not a case where it is suggested the Company cannot enter into the arrangements at all  Nor is this a case where the entering into of the
