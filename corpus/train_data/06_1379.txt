premises were let on a yearly tenancy  until the tenancy be determined at the end of the first or any subsequent year by one of the parties giving to the other of them six calendar months previous notice in writing   On the face of the tenancy agreement the period of the tenancy was from   January   to   June   not a term of one year  The lessors served a notice to quit on   June    The notice required the tenant to quit  at the expiration of the year of your tenancy which will expire next after the end of one half year from the service of this notice   The Court of Appeal decided that the tenancy granted was for eighteen months and thereafter on a yearly tenancy  It also held that the notice to quit was valid  Evershed LJ dealt with the sufficiency of the notice in a lengthy passage between pages      He said  at   that that notice  puts plainly on the tenant the obligation of ascertaining the date meant by the form of words used  Prima facie  the problem is not very difficult  As  Lord Greene MR  observed during the argument  the tenant requires for its solution two things only  a modern calendar and the tenancy agreement  Armed with those two things he asks himself first  When was this notice served on me       H e is next required to find out when one half year ends after the service of the notice       T hen only remains the question  when does the year of his tenancy current on December     come to an end  It is true that involves the interpretation of the tenancy agreement  But  if I am right in the view which I have expressed  he should have no great difficulty in answering that question   Evershed LJ distinguished Phipps v Rogers   He said  at   of that case that there was  an accumulation of difficulties provided by the joint effect of the language of the tenancy agreement and the very unusual form of the notice to quit   Later  also at   he pointed out that the court had come  to the conclusion that the tenant was involved in so many difficulties that there was a failure on the landlord s part either to give a certain date or to supply the tenant with a formula from which certainty could be ascertained and that  therefore  the notice was not good   By way of contrast  as regards the case before the court the judge said that any ambiguity was capable of a clear answer  The last case is Allam   Co Ltd v Europa Poster Services

termination was effected  gives rise to several difficult issues  The first is whether a notice of termination will bring the charter to an end or whether the charter remains on foot until the vessel is repossessed  Unfortunately this is still a controversial topic  In The Turakina     ALR   Tamberlin J held that a demise charter  under which possession and control of the ship had been given to the charterer  could not be terminated by notice alone  He said termination would only occur when the owner retook possession of the ship  In The Rangiora     Lloyd s Rep   the New Zealand High Court followed that decision  stating that the principle was a rule of the common law  Nonetheless  there is a view that the rule established in The Turakina may be avoided by careful drafting  In CMC  Australia  Pty Ltd v Ship  Socofl Stream    FCA         FCR   it was held that the question whether a demise charter could be terminated without repossession depended upon the terms of the charterparty  The judge  Moore J  said  at        I t is necessary to ascertain from the terms of the charterparty whether the continuing physical possession of a vessel by the charterer  pending the taking of physical possession by the owner either by redelivery or some other means  is co extensive with continuing possession and absolute control of the vessel of the type characteristic of a demise charter      He went on to say  at   that it         is difficult to avoid a conclusion that if a charterparty expressly provided for its termination and the power to terminate was exercised  then the charterer ceased to be a demise charterer from the time of termination at least in the absence of provisions in the charterparty that suggested some other result  Comity requires me to apply The Socofl Stream and thus hold that in the case of this charterparty  in particular because of cll   and   the charter can be terminated on written notice  Clause   provides for termination by notice and cl   says that when the charter is at an end the charterer is the  gratuitous bailee  of the vessel  If I may say so  this is a troubling conclusion  It is troubling because until the owner actually withdraws the vessel not only does the charterer retain possession it still mans and supplies her  The problem becomes acute if the notice of termination is served while the vessel is at sea  Applying The Socofl Stream  she is not under demise while returning to port  If that be true it may surprise the owner to learn that the master now has ostensible authority to bind it  There is also the possibility that the owner may decide to retake possession at the next port of call or at a convenient port or place as contemplated by cl    The result of the application of The Socofl Stream is that the owner has control of the vessel during the voyage  The true position is probably different  I prefer the view that it is not until the vessel has been withdrawn that the demise comes to an end for it is only then that the charterer has lost exclusive possession of the vessel  That the charterparty describes the charterer s possession before delivery as that of  gratuitous bailment  is not to the point  The real relation between the charterer and the vessel cannot be disguised by the use of an inapposite label or description  I appreciate  however  that others take a different view citedMorris v Ship Kiama  Mubum      ACLC  The administrators seek the revocation because they have a potential buyer for the business and the sale may not go ahead unless the buyer is able to charter the vessel  They also say that if the action in rem remains on foot the owner will incur legal costs that will be passed on to the company in administration  I think there is little substance in the first point  If the vessel is arrested the owner will put up security and obtain its release  That will happen quickly  as it always does with a vessel that can easily be demised  There is some substance to the second point  I accept the owner will incur some costs in sorting out the quantum of ASP s claim and a portion of the costs will be payable by Pan Australia  leaving less for the other unsecured creditors  But the costs will not be excessive  in my opinion  Anyway  I am of opinion that the interests of the general body of unsecured creditors should be subordinated to those of ASP whose claim over the vessel is proprietary in nature  See also in relation to a similar application  Morris v Ship Kiama  Mubum      ACLC    For the foregoing reasons  I will make orders that Jaymont s motion be dismissed with costs and Pan Australia s application be dismissed but with no order as to costs  There will also be an order that ASP have leave to apply in proceeding no  VID   of

first case is P Phipps and Company  Northampton and Towcester Breweries  Ltd v Rogers     KB   which  if I may say so  is the high watermark of this line of authority  The case concerned a yearly tenancy of a public house  Either party could determine the tenancy  upon giving to the other of three months  previous notice in writing of his or her intention to do so expiring on any one of the days appointed as special transfer sessions by the justices for the district in which the premises are situate     The landlord gave the tenant a notice to quit which read   We do hereby give you notice to quit and deliver up to us  or such other person as we may appoint  on the earliest day your tenancy can legally be terminated by valid notice to quit given to you by us at the date of the service hereof       The notice was declared invalid  Bankes LJ said  at   that   It is not necessary that a notice should be clear and unambiguous in expressed terms provided it can be rendered clear and unambiguous by the application of the maxim  Id certum est quod certum reddi potest    That is sufficiently certain which can be made certain    There are many decided cases in the books where the Courts have imputed to the tenant knowledge which  when applied to the notice to quit served upon him  renders clear what would without that knowledge have been neither clear nor unambiguous   Bankes LJ  however  said that he was not prepared to impute or attribute to the tenant the knowledge of the facts or of the law that was required to enable the tenant to determine the day upon which the tenancy would come to an end  The situation was that several difficult construction questions and questions of fact had to be sorted out before the notice could be rendered certain  Among the points that needed to be resolved was whether the reference to  three months  meant three calendar months or three lunar months  whether an annual licensing meeting was or was not a special transfer session  and when the special transfer sessions were in fact going to be  held   Bankes LJ was unwilling to extend the maxim to embrace such a complex enquiry  Atkin LJ rejected the notice on similar grounds  He said  at    But it appears to me to defeat the whole object of notice to leave the date to be ascertained by the tenant as a problem not of fact but of law     A tenant receiving such a notice might have to consult his solicitor  who might have to consult counsel  who might have to advise an application to the Court for a declaration by action or summons   Scrutton LJ was in dissent  He was of opinion that a long settled line of authorities had treated landlords and tenants as both knowing the law and had assumed that the tenant must know the necessary facts  This  he said  bound him to conclude that the notice was valid  The second case is Addis v Burrows     KB    There premises were let on a yearly tenancy  until the tenancy be determined at the end of the first or any subsequent year by one of the parties giving to the other of them six calendar months previous notice in writing   On the face of the tenancy agreement the period of the tenancy was from   January   to   June

with a formula from which certainty could be ascertained and that  therefore  the notice was not good   By way of contrast  as regards the case before the court the judge said that any ambiguity was capable of a clear answer  Asquith LJ delivered a short judgment in which he pointed out  at   that in Phipps v Rogers it was observed that  each case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances  and that  the circumstances there were that the tenant was forced by the form of notice to answer questions both of law and fact interlocked with each other and calling for a much more complex calculus than anything involved in the  instant  case   The other judge  Lord Greene MR  also put Phipps v Rogers to one side as being a difficult case to understand  observing  at   that the difficulties presented to the tenant in that case were difficulties of construction and difficulties of fact  He rejected the suggestion that a termination notice giving rise to a difficult question of construction was necessarily invalid  The last case is Allam   Co Ltd v Europa Poster Services Ltd     WLR    I need not go into the facts  I cite the case for the observation by Buckley J who looked closely at Phipps v Rogers and Addis v Burrows and  at   said this   No doubt if those cases are both good law  as I must assume that they are  the question of the validity of the notice  the
