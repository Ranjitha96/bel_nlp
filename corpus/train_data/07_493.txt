to exclude the rules of natural justice  There is nothing in Pt XIB that amounts to unmistakable and unambiguous language clearly expressing an intention to exclude natural justice in connection with the issue of a Part A competition notice   Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  cf Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Lat   FCAFC         FCR   at   to   in considering s  A of the Migration Act    Cth   The fact that the Act provides for the provision of certain information in a s  AKA  notice does not of itself evince an intention otherwise to exclude procedural fairness   Miah at   per McHugh J  or  indeed  the possibility of the provision of further information or further consultation  The Act mandates the giving of certain information in a s  AKA  notice as a minimum  Such latitude in the information to be provided is encompassed by the requirement to describe in summary form the kind of anti competitive conduct proposed to be specified in the Part A competition notice  A  summary form  allows for a minimum but not a maximum of information to be provided  There is no inconsistency between the application of subss   and   which impose a minimum standard and a common law duty of procedural fairness   Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at       The Commission contends that the requirements of procedural fairness for the issue of a Part A competition notice are less onerous than those applicable to a quasi judicial Tribunal determining  for example  whether a person is entitled to refugee status  as in VEAL   The Commission points to the flexible nature of the duty and the need to adapt to the statutory requirements  For example  a judicial hearing with rights of appeal must precede the pecuniary consequences arising from the issue of a Part A competition notice  The Commission also challenges the impact of the reasoning in VEAL and Kioa   It emphasises the comment by Brennan J in Kioa at   that the person whose interests are likely to be affected by the exercise of a statutory power does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information  irrespective of its credibility  relevance or significance  As Brennan J recognised in Kioa    a  dministrative decision making is not to be clogged  by unnecessary inquiries  That observation is particularly relevant in a statutory context where the legislature has sought to respond to the fast moving pace of telecommunications markets and  in so doing  placed the Commission under an obligation to act expeditiously appliedAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A  decision  to which the ADJR Act applies is  subject to exceptions that are not presently relevant  a decision of an administrative character made  proposed to be made  or required to be made  under an enactment or by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth under an enactment  s   of the ADJR Act   A  decision  will generally  but not always    entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative  at least in a practical sense  of the issue of fact falling for consideration    Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  with whom Brennan and Deane JJ agreed   It will also involve a substantive determination    If  decision  were to embrace procedural determinations  then there would be little scope for review of  conduct    as expressly contemplated by s   of the ADJR Act   Bond at     As Mason CJ observed in Bond   a reviewable decision for the purposes of s   of the ADJR Act is   a decision which the statute requires or authorizes rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision    at    It is the case that s  AKA  of the Act requires a notice under that section to be given prior to the issue of a Part A competition notice pursuant to s  AKA   However  the satisfaction of that statutory prerequisite involves no  decision  of an administrative character  In order to comply with s  AKA  the Commission must  as I have noted  give a notice stating that the Commission proposes to issue a Part A competition notice  s  AKA a i  describing in summary form the kind of anti competitive conduct proposed there to be specified  s  AKA a ii  and inviting the carrier to make a submission within the specified time limit  s  AKA a iii   The Commission must then consider any submission received within time  s  AKA b   The discharge of those statutory obligations involves no determination of a substantive nature  The issue of a s  AKA  notice is an action taken prior to the ultimate decision to issue a Part A competition notice upon satisfaction of the  reason to believe  threshold  That action is procedural in character and involves no  decision  within the meaning of s   of the ADJR Act   It follows that  there being no relevant  decision  it is unnecessary to consider whether an extension of time should be granted under the ADJR Act to review the  decision  to issue the Consultation Notice   That leaves for consideration whether the Commission s conduct in issuing the Consultation Notice is reviewable  conduct  within s   of the ADJR Act  No specific time limit applies to the review of conduct   Conduct  engaged in for the purpose of making a decision includes   the doing of any act or thing preparatory to the making of the decision   including the taking of evidence or the holding of an inquiry or investigation  s   of the ADJR Act   It   points to action taken  rather than a decision made  for the purpose of making a reviewable decision    Conduct is   essentially procedural and not substantive in character     Bond at       The issue of the Consultation Notice was more than merely a preparatory step in the deliberative or reasoning process of the reviewable decision to issue the Competition Notice   Bond at    The issue of the Consultation Notice was  conduct  of the Commission within the meaning of s   of the ADJR Act and therefore reviewable pursuant to s   of the ADJR Act  It is also  in my view  amenable to review pursuant to s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act    The parties accept that s  B of the Judiciary Act applies to the decision to issue the Competition Notice  Section  AQA of the Act contemplates an application to the Court under s  B  in relation to that decision and prevents the Court from staying the process to issue the notice pending the finalisation of the application   The Commission submits that the statutory scheme does not contemplate there being a reviewable decision or conduct in connection with the issue of a s  AKA  notice  It relies on two matters in so doing  First  there is no specific provision for such review  Secondly  a review at that stage of the process would  the Commission submits  be contrary to the requirement for the Commission to proceed expeditiously once it has  reason to suspect  that there has been a contravention of the competition rule  The Commission points out that it would be unable to complete the process of forming a  reason to believe  under s  AKA  if persons were able to invoke s  B of the Judiciary Act before the Commission had received and considered the written submissions as contemplated by s  AKA    There are a number of reasons why the Commission s submissions should not be accepted  There is no clear language excluding the right to invoke s  B of the Judiciary Act   Importantly  s  B A c  confers jurisdiction on the Court in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament other than an exception which does not apply here  The decision to issue the Consultation Notice is a matter arising by reason of Pt XIB of the Act  It is within jurisdiction whether it be considered a  decision  or  conduct  for the purposes of the ADJR Act  Further  in any event  it is accepted that there is jurisdiction under s  B  of the Judiciary Act to review the Competition Notice  As Optus submits and the Commission accepts  a valid s  AKA  notice is a prerequisite to the issue of a valid Part A competition notice  An assessment of whether the Consultation Notice complies with s  AKA  is a necessary incident to the Court s review of the Commission s decision to issue the Competition Notice   The discretionary matters raised by the Commission as to the appropriateness  in certain circumstances  of review of a s  AKA  notice do not go to jurisdiction but to discretion in the granting of relief  If such relief is sought at an early stage  such as prior to the issue of a Part A competition notice and before any final or operative or determinative decision has been made  relief may be denied on substantive or discretionary grounds  Robertson A   The administrative law jurisdiction of the Federal Court Is the AD JR  Act still important      ABR   at   citedBurswood Management Ltd v Attorney General  Cth      FCR   It is accepted by the Commission that Telstra is a person   entitled to make an application to  the Court     under section     in relation to the decision to issue the Competition Notice  s    The Commission submits  however  that that decision is a decision in connection with the institution or conduct of proceedings in a civil court and  by the application of para  f  of Sch   to the ADJR Act  not a decision to which s   of the ADJR Act applies  The Commission relies on the following matters in support of that submission      The investigative nature of the Commission s role in deciding whether to issue a Part A competition notice  including the  reason to believe  threshold      The close connection between the institution of proceedings in a civil court and the issue of a Part A competition notice  including the institution of proceedings for the recovery of pecuniary penalties  as emphasised by Telstra in its submissions as to the effect of a Part A competition notice      The breadth of the expression  in connection with  as used in para  f  of Sch     Burswood Management Ltd v Attorney General  Cth      FCR   at   and    Authority to the effect that a decision to issue a s   notice is not a decision to which s   of the ADJR applies   Ricegrowers Co operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman     FLR   appliedCommissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   In circumstances where the s  AKA  notice and the Part A competition notice fulfil their statutory function  the carrier or carriage service provider is given sufficient information to enable it to alter its conduct and or make submissions to the Commission in response to the s  AKA  notice  In those circumstances  the statutory opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues has been given   Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   at     I have concluded that the Consultation Notice did not comply with s  AKA  of the Act and that the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice  The Commission was required to and did not describe in summary form in the Consultation Notice or otherwise give to Telstra by way of additional information  the kind of anti competitive conduct that was specified in the Competition Notice   Telstra was not given a reasonable opportunity to consult  or to comment and make submissions  or to change its conduct to avoid the issue of the Competition Notice  Telstra was denied the opportunity to be heard in respect of the new and different subject matter  The statutory scheme  which included the right to such opportunity in order to afford procedural fairness  was not complied with  It follows that Telstra was denied procedural fairness   Optus contends that it would only be if the Commission were to base its decision to issue the Competition Notice on some particular issue or material adverse to Telstra that was not apparent from the nature of the decision that procedural fairness would require that some step additional to the issue of the Consultation Notice be taken and says that this was not pleaded  This was sufficiently pleaded  Telstra relies in the statement of claim upon the alleged failure on the part of the Commission to give notice of the material and analysis on which the Commission based its allegations and statements in the Competition Notice as a basis of a failure to accord procedural fairness and natural justice  Telstra does not suggest that it was entitled to material reflecting the Commission s thought processes  Nor was it entitled to the Commission s own evaluation of Telstra s conduct or information supplied by it   Alphaone at     The Guidelines contemplate complainants and other interested parties providing submissions to the Commission  The giving of   careful consideration   to those submissions is said to be one means by which the Commission endeavours to achieve its objectives  p   of the Guidelines   The Commission did  by media release dated   December   invite such submissions  Telstra submits that it should be inferred that those submissions were provided by third parties and were taken into account  It points to the fact that Optus issued its detailed statement of claim against Telstra in the Optus proceeding only   days  including the   day Easter break  after the Competition Notice issued and that that makes it   tolerably plain   that Optus and the Commission have been working closely together   Where the Consultation Notice was insufficient as described  Telstra was entitled to be given additional information to be able to provide the meaningful submission contemplated by s  AKA   Where the differences between the notices were as described earlier in these reasons  it is reasonable to assume that  acting bona fide in the context of the Consultation Notice  the Commission relied upon additional material and material adverse to Telstra that went to the matters not described in the Consultation Notice  If the Commission based its decision to issue the Competition Notice on some particular issue or material adverse to Telstra that was not apparent from the Consultation Notice  procedural fairness would require that some step additional to the issue of the Consultation Notice be taken   Alphaone at      Telstra was entitled to be given notice of that material or the substance of it  The Commission accepts that  if it was obliged to provide that material to Telstra which it denies  Telstra was not accorded procedural fairness   Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     IPR   at    Failure to provide such information was a denial of procedural fairness or natural justice   The decision to issue a Part A competition notice pursuant to s  AKA  of the Act consequent upon a s  AKA  notice being given was likely to affect and be adverse to Telstra s interests  In those circumstances  the Commission was required to give Telstra the opportunity to ascertain the relevant issues  Where the exercise of the statutory power attracts the requirements of procedural fairness  Telstra was entitled to put information and submissions to the Commission   Alphaone at      The Commission was obliged to identify any issue critical to the decision to issue the Competition Notice which was not apparent from the Consultation Notice and any adverse conclusions  but not the reasoning process  which had been arrived at and which would not obviously be open on the material known to Telstra   Alphaone at   citedDepartment of Industrial Relations v Forrest     FCR   There is no general principle that uncertainty in an executive instrument spells invalidity   Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   per Kitto J   The question is whether what has been done in fact answers the description of what the statute permits to be done in law  A statutory notice such as a s  AKA  notice or a Part A competition notice  together   the Statutory Notices  must not be so vaguely expressed that its meaning of application is a matter of real uncertainty  The Statutory Notices must convey  with reasonable and sufficient clarity and certainty  the subject matter with which they deal and enable the recipient to know what is required if their issue is to be a valid exercise of statutory power   Television Corporation Ltd at   per Kitto J  SA Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt     FCR   at   per Fisher and French JJ  with whom Wilcox J agreed  Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FLR   at     per the Full Court   Where different kinds of subject matter are dealt with by different statutory provisions  the Statutory Notices should specify or make clear which particular aspects of the statutory regime are referred to and or relied upon   Department of Industrial Relations v Forrest     FCR   at   per Lockhart and Hill JJ    Telstra relies on observations by Lockhart and Hill JJ in Forrest at   to suggest  in effect  that the Consultation Notice must make explicit on its face every nuance or explanation without regard to the fact that Telstra  as the recipient  has knowledge of and understood certain of the terminology and subject matter  Their Honours in Forrest were referring to a different kind of notice  a conclusive certificate under s   of the Freedom of Information Act    Cth   the FOI Act   The Court there was concerned with whether that notice would be uncertain to a review Tribunal charged with the function of determining whether reasonable grounds existed for the documents the subject of the certificate to be exempt from the FOI Act  In the present case  the s  AKA  notice sought information from a recipient in the industry about its own processes   The purpose of a s  AKA  notice is to provide the affected carrier or carriage service provider with an opportunity to make a submission to the Commission on its proposal to issue a Part A competition notice  The Commission is obliged  by the Act  to consider any such submission  To achieve its purpose  a s  AKA  notice must provide sufficient detail to enable a real  practical and reasonably specific response as to whether or not the recipient is engaging in the kind of conduct alleged and whether that conduct is anti competitive  Further  a s  AKA  notice is not of a mere advisory character  It should provide sufficient information to enable consideration of a possible modification of conduct citedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Woodhams   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As I have noted earlier  where the subject matter of the Competition Notice is conduct  the recipient is entitled to know what is required of it   Television Corporation at   per Kitto J   Absence of information will involve a failure to provide necessary details if  without such information  the notice will not fulfil the purpose for which it is required to be given   Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Woodhams   HCA         CLR   at      However  a notice analogous to a notice before action is not intended to serve the purpose of a statement of claim if and when action is taken   Woodhams at   and    Despite the complexity and alleged ambiguity of the Statutory Notices on which Telstra relies  in context  the conduct described is sufficiently clear within each notice citedFieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   The severity of prospective penalties or consequences of failure to comply with a statutory notice that flow from the subject matter and the impact of the characterisation of the conduct are relevant factors in identifying the requisite degree of certainty  see Pyneboard at     Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   per Hill J   Account is to be taken of the statutory context in which the issue of a statutory notice arises and of the relevant interests of third parties  To take an example relevant to a Part A competition notice  a third party may contemplate bringing an action for damages in reliance on that notice and has an interest in knowing with clarity the ambit and scope of the notice   The question is whether a reasonable person in the position of the addressee of a statutory notice can fairly comply with its requirements or take advantage of the opportunity offered   Fieldhouse at   per Hill J with whom Burchett J relevantly agreed   The Statutory Notices are concerned with the conduct of carriers or carriage service providers and can only be given to a carrier or a carriage service provider  In this case  the Statutory Notices were given to Telstra  a sophisticated  well advised company with significant telecommunications experience  The notices followed a course of correspondence between Telstra and the Commission concerning the subject matter of the notices  Context may make something certain that  in the abstract  is uncertain citedGeorge v Rockett   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commission contends that the fact that it has  reason to believe  in relation to the conduct described in the Competition Notice is a relatively low threshold  The Commission draws in aid observations directed to the phrase  reason to believe  in cases concerning s   of the Act  In that context  the phrase is directed to a belief that a person is capable of furnishing information or producing  for example  documents relating to a matter that constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the Act  Telstra does not accept that this is analogous to the requisite reason to believe that a carrier or carriage service provider has engaged or is engaging in relevant anti competitive conduct for the purposes of s  AKA   It submits that the requisite state of mind requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person   George v Rockett   HCA         CLR   at     The basis for the belief is set out in the correspondence and in the Consultation Notice  Telstra has not demonstrated that there was an absence of such belief prior to the issue of the Competition Notice  I will turn to consider the terms of the Competition Notice   The Commission accepts that  if the Consultation Notice did not conform to the requirements of the Act such that no notice was given pursuant to s  AKA  it was not in the position to issue a valid Part A competition notice citedGribbles Pathology  Vic  Pty Ltd v Cassidy   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As Weinberg J noted in Gribbles Pathology  Vic  Pty Ltd v Cassidy   FCA         FCR   at     statutes commonly require the giving of notice or the invitation of submissions before a particular decision is made  The fact that a decision is preliminary  in the sense that it does not in itself affect rights without some further action being taken  does not obviate the duty to observe natural justice  Such decisions often affect   important interests  including reputation  or legitimate expectations    at    It is not necessary that the decision have direct or indirect legal effect   Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR    The rules of natural justice apply where a statute confers a power to prejudice a person s rights  interests or legitimate expectations unless they are excluded by plain words   Annetts v McCann   HCA         CLR   at   citedKindimindi Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Cove Council     LGERA   Optus accepts that there must be a relevant connection between the notices  It submits that the instance of anti competitive conduct in the Competition Notice must    in broad terms   be an instance of the same kind as that described in summary form in the Consultation Notice  The Commission cannot   significantly alter   the kind of conduct  Whether the relevant connection is maintained requires an evaluative judgment   Kindimindi Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Cove Council     LGERA   at    A narrowing or specification of the kind of conduct with greater precision is permitted but the description must  Optus submits  in substance be of the same kind of conduct   The parties provided detailed schedules of all of the differences between the Consultation Notice and the Competition Notice  The Competition Notice is not meant to mirror the Consultation Notice  It is expected to be responsive to the submissions consequent on the Consultation Notice  To the extent that further definitions are included and further particulars and explanations of terms used in the Consultation Notice are given  the subject matter of the notices cannot be said to be substantively different   I now turn to consider some of the differences in the Consultation Notice      Local Services is in terms of line rental   and   or   local call services supplied to Retail Customers  para  a   my emphasis      Retail Customers include the whole class of residential end user customers  para  d       The Relevant Conduct is described with reference to the Home Access increase in circumstances where there was no commensurate increase in the pricing of the range of Telstra s retail Local Services products when assessed as a weighted average  para       The Other Conduct refers to one of the retail Local Services products  the HomeLine Part  The reference is to the HomeLine Part increase  which was for local call services but not for fixed to mobile  long

long distance and international call services  para  b   my emphasis      The conduct said to have the effect or likely effect on competition is the Relevant Conduct alone or together with the Other Conduct  para       The  price squeeze  that is said to result from the taking advantage of market power in the Wholesale Local Services Market is the effect on  Telstra s rivals  who are Telstra s wholesale customers in the Retail Fixed Services Market and their ability to compete effectively with Telstra in that market  para   appliedKioa v West   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commission refused to provide Telstra with material on which it relied in coming to a decision to issue the Competition Notice and on which it based the allegations and statements in the Competition Notice which were not included in the Consultation Notice  Telstra submits that the failure on the part of the Commission to provide that information  which was necessarily significant to the decision   Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan J  constituted a denial of procedural fairness   Optus accepts that Telstra was entitled to be informed of the nature and subject of the matter under consideration and to be afforded the right to be heard in respect of the issues on which the decision was based  However  it submits that Telstra was not entitled  at the stage of examination and consideration by the Commission  to see any material that was adverse to its interest   There is no dispute that a common law duty of procedural fairness must accommodate to the statutory scheme  As stated by Mason J in Kioa at   the statutory power        must be exercised fairly  i e   in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements  the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes  whether public or private  which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations    The Commission contends that the requirements of procedural fairness for the issue of a Part A competition notice are less onerous than those applicable to a quasi judicial Tribunal determining  for example  whether a person is entitled to refugee status  as in VEAL   The Commission points to the flexible nature of the duty and the need to adapt to the statutory requirements  For example  a judicial hearing with rights of appeal must precede the pecuniary consequences arising from the issue of a Part A competition notice  The Commission also challenges the impact of the reasoning in VEAL and Kioa   It emphasises the comment by Brennan J in Kioa at   that the person whose interests are likely to be affected by the exercise of a statutory power does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information  irrespective of its credibility  relevance or significance  As Brennan J recognised in Kioa    a  dministrative decision making is not to be clogged  by unnecessary inquiries  That observation is particularly relevant in a statutory context where the legislature has sought to respond to

required to afford Telstra procedural fairness in relation to the issue of the Competition Notice at common law  Optus accepts that s  AKA  of the Act does not displace the Commission s obligations of procedural fairness  The Commission wishes to reserve the question whether a common law duty exists should the occasion to contend otherwise arise but submits that  in any event and in the specific statutory context  the scope and content of that obligation have been satisfied  Put another way  the Commission says that the common law duty extends no further than what is required by s  AKA   Optus submits that s  AKA  reflects the procedural fairness required and that that obligation has been complied with   I do not accept the Commission s submission that the requirement to afford procedural fairness takes its content only from s  AKA  of the Act  While the requirements of s  AKA  of the Act clearly inform the obligation to accord procedural fairness at common law they do not

must be construed in context  In its submission  the purpose of the exclusion in para  f  is to avoid the disruption of investigative procedures or court process with the requirement to furnish reasons  It relies on the observation of Fox J in Murphy v KRM Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at   to the effect that         t  he general idea behind par  f  seems to be that civil procedure will itself take care of what s   seeks to achieve when it requires reasons to be given  Conversely  civil procedure is not to be complicated by the s   procedure      The decision to issue a Part A competition notice is said by Telstra to be distinct both from an investigation and a decision to institute or conduct proceedings   There may be no correlative decision by the Commission to institute pecuniary penalty proceedings pursuant to ss  BX and  BY of the Act following the issue of a Part A competition notice  Further  third parties will not necessarily issue proceedings to recover damages pursuant to s  CC of the Act  Certainty of legal proceedings  however  is not necessary for a decision to fall within the broad terms of para  f  of Sch    Decisions which  relate to  or may result  in the bringing of proceedings in a civil court for the recovery of pecuniary penalties expressly are included in para  f  of Sch   to the ADJR Act  The issue of a Part A competition notice is a prerequisite to the bringing of proceedings in this Court for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for a contravention of the competition rule  s  BY g  of the Act   The scheme of the Act expressly contemplates that such proceedings may result from a decision by the Commission to issue a Part A competition notice  Were it not for the fact that such proceedings may result  the desired incentive for the carrier to cease the allegedly anti competitive conduct would diminish significantly  Indeed  Telstra relies upon that very consequence of the decision in its submissions as to the requirements of common law procedural fairness   The Commission s decision to issue the Competition Notice was a decision within the terms of para  f  of Sch   to the ADJR Act  It follows that the Commission was not

apply for a review of the alleged  decision  to issue the Consultation Notice within time  s  b iii  of the ADJR Act    Telstra submits that the decision to issue the Consultation Notice depended upon the exercise of a specific statutory power under s  AKA  of the Act  which decision gave rise to a legal right to put submissions to the Commission and legal obligation on the Commission to consider those submissions  It was a prerequisite to the issue of a Competition Notice and therefore had  according to Telstra  operative effect and impacted directly on Telstra s legal rights and obligations

International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commission does not accept Telstra s characterisation of the consequences of a Part A competition notice as  extraordinary  and  punitive   It points out that such a notice is an exercise of executive rather than judicial power and cannot be  breached   It contends that the Competition Notice   simply indicates that  the Commission  has reached the  relatively low threshold of  reason to believe  in relation to the conduct described in the notice    That imports a requirement to come to the view in good faith and on reasonable grounds that Telstra is breaching or has breached the competition rule  There is no  finding  that Telstra has engaged or is proposing to engage in anti competitive conduct  just a public announcement that the Commission has  reason to believe  that Telstra has engaged in at least one instance of anti competitive conduct of a kind described in the Competition Notice  This is described as a   relatively low threshold     The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission

proceedings to be commenced  The Commission points out that the consequences of the Competition Notice could have been avoided by Telstra if Telstra had accepted the Commission s invitation to give undertakings not to engage in the impugned conduct or successfully sought an exemption order pursuant to s  AS of the Act  If Telstra were able to satisfy the Commission that the conduct was not anti competitive or that the benefit to the public outweighs the detriment constituted by any lessening of competition  the Commission could make an exemption order  s  BC  of the Act    However  such an undertaking or the seeking of an exemption order would involve an acknowledgement by Telstra that its conduct or proposed conduct was anti competitive  a proposition that it does not accept  The issue

Council     FCR   As Finn J observed in Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health and Medical Research Council     FCR   at   the courts have indicated in a variety of contexts that  c  onsultation is no empty term   nor   a mere formality    The Commission has been given extensive powers which have been granted and affirmed in the context of certain conditions  The statutory process of consultation envisaged by s  AKA  and   is rendered ineffective if the recipient is not given adequate and appropriate information in order to make an informed response   Telstra was not afforded the opportunity to address issues relevant to the issue of the Competition Notice  Procedural fairness required that Telstra have that opportunity  whether such natural justice was in accordance with the statutory regime or common law principles   Optus relies upon the context of the statutory power being exercised under a scheme in which the Part A competition notice     a  does not prevent Telstra from engaging in the conduct referred to in the notice   b  is not evidence of the matters referred to in it   c  is akin to a notice before action  in the sense that a person  including the Commission  has no right to sue for a breach of the competition rule unless a Part A competition notice has been issued  and   d  may lead to the possibility of proceedings after its issue  in which proceedings the allegation of a breach of the competition rule will have to be proved to the civil standard of proof  citedVHAP of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   Optus also points to the decision of the Full Court in VHAP of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   at   where it was pointed out that the analysis of whether natural justice is afforded     is not a process of syllogistic reasoning  One does not approach it thus  the person is entitled to adverse material  this material was relied on in reaching an adverse result  that makes it adverse material  it was not provided in terms  therefore there has been a failure to afford natural justice
