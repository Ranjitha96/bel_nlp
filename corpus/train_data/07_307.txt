cases cth federal ct  html  There is no doubt that the Court has a discretion  in the interests of justice  to order that Mr Bulic s case should be reopened so that he can adduce further evidence and advance further argument  see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA   at     The availability of  fresh evidence  will  in some circumstances  warrant the reopening of a case   Mr Bulic submits that the documents would establish a number of negative propositions  They are that      There are no documents held by the respondent which contain any direct proof of Mr Bulic s indebtedness in the sum alleged     The files appear to have been  culled  and are incomplete   It is also suggested that the documents appear  in some instances  to be confusing and self contradictory  The balance inquiries which  it is said  should be examined by an expert accountant are numerous  They are printouts of computer records on various dates between   and    They relate to each of the four accounts held by Mr Bulic with the respondent and its predecessor  Each records debit and credit entries over a particular period  They appear to have been printed at the instigation of bank officers and used as the basis for the calculation of Mr Bulic s indebtedness from time to time   The respondent accepts that the Court has a discretion to reopen the case but submits that there is nothing in the newly produced material which would warrant such a step being taken  This is because there is nothing in that material which could reasonably be regarded as advancing the case already put by Mr Bulic  It contends that  on the contrary  there is certain documentary material which confirms Mr Bulic s indebtedness to it  in the amounts alleged  at relevant times citedRe Oates  Ex parte Deputy

Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at     referred toTrade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises     FLR   The Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion to award costs but that discretion must be exercised judicially  see Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd     FLR   at    Any departure from the ordinary rule that costs should be paid on a party party basis requires the presence of something special or unusual in the conduct of the case to be demonstrated  see Preston v Preston     WLR   at    The types of case in which it may be appropriate to award indemnity costs do not fall in any closed categories  see Tetijo Holdings Pty Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd  unreported  French J    May    One type of case in which it has been held that indemnity costs might be ordered is that in which an applicant pursues a hopeless case  In Fountain Selected Meats  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Woodward J said     I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding  solicitor and client  or  indemnity  costs  whenever it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant  properly advised  should have known that he no chance of success  In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive  or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law  Such cases are  fortunately  rare  But when they occur  the Court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion
