Starr v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedVincent v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR     ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In a test case relating to the ACM breeding project  Vincent v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR     ALR   the Full Court of the Federal Court held that management fees and interest claimed as deductions by another of the investors Ms Vincent  were on capital account  They had been outlaid essentially for the acquisition of calves under the scheme  Being on capital account they were not deductible  There was therefore no tax benefit obtained through the project  albeit it had been determined to be a Pt IVA scheme by the Commissioner  In the reasons for disallowing the objection to the amended assessments  the Commissioner referred to Vincent s case  The penalties imposed on Mr Starr and Mr Hopkins respectively were   per cent of the tax shortfall and   per cent of the tax shortfall   The Commissioner said in his reasons for disallowing Mr Starr s objection          Further Remission of the penalty and interest imposed is not warranted          a  In our view deductions claimed by you in relation to ACM Breeding Project are not allowable under subsection   and therefore section  L would apply as the purported deductions arose in relation to a tax avoidance scheme       b  The rates of penalty that apply under section  L are   of the amount of the primary tax applicable to the adjustment or  if it is reasonably arguable that the deduction claimed was correctly allowable    of the primary tax applicable to the adjustment       c  After having given consideration to any additional information or individual circumstances provided in your letter of objection we have decided it is still appropriate to maintain the flat rate of       d  There are no rights of objection under the Taxation Administration Act    TAA  against interest payable under the Income Tax Assessment Act    section  AA  and or the TAA  the General Interest Charge   However in the course of determining your objection we have reviewed the interest payable and concluded that no remission is warranted  If you are dissatisfied with our decision in relation to the interest you may apply to have the decision reviewed under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act           A similar statement was made by the Commissioner in relation to the penalty and interest applicable to Mr Hopkins  In his case the penalty was fixed at the flat rate of   per cent of the amount of the primary tax applicable to the adjustment  That level of penalty was fixed pursuant to s  L and  unlike Mr Starr s case  was not reduced by the discretionary remitter available under s   of the ITAA   Mr Starr and Mr Hopkins both sought review  in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal  of the decision of the Commissioner disallowing their objections  The issue on review was confined to the level of penalty  On   August   the Tribunal affirmed the decisions under review  Messrs  Starr and Hopkins then filed notices of appeal against the Tribunal s decision in the original jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   For the reasons that follow  I am of the view that their appeals are made out  that the Tribunal s decision should be set aside and the objections allowed   It was accepted by Messrs  Starr and Hopkins in their Outlines of Facts and Contentions submitted to the Tribunal that         By the making of the various Scheme Arrangements and the various steps and transactions carried out pursuant to the Scheme Arrangements  their participation in ACM constituted a scheme for the purposes of s  A of Pt IVA of the ITAA      Because they claimed as deductions project costs of   that Mr Starr incurred and   which Mr Hopkins incurred  and because those deductions were not allowable under s   of the ITAA  as the Full Court found in Vincent   FCAFC       FCR     the applicants each had a shortfall within the meaning of s  A of the ITAA      For the purposes of s  L b  of the ITAA the tax shortfall was caused by each of the two applicants  in a taxation statement  s  A of the ITAA  treating an income tax law as applying in relation to the scheme in a particular way       For the purposes of s  L d  of the ITAA  none of the scheme sections as defined by s  A applies in relation to the scheme   The penalties which were imposed on Messrs Starr and Hopkins were imposed pursuant to s  L of the ITAA   No oral evidence was given before the Tribunal  The decision was made upon the affidavits and upon papers lodged with the Tribunal by the Commissioner  There was no cross examination on the affidavits  Affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the applicants comprised the following         The affidavit of Kevin Phillip Sleight sworn   March      Mr Sleight described himself as Mr Starr s financial adviser  He introduced Mr Starr to the ACM project in June    He recalled Mr Starr was very interested in the commercial aspects of the ACM project and primarily concerned with making an investment that would increase his income in retirement  Mr Sleight s sole purpose in recommending that Mr Starr invest in the project was to increase his wealth from profits from sale of cattle under the project  The commission that Mr Sleight received as a result of Mr Starr entering into the project was not contingent on Mr Starr receiving a tax deduction      The affidavit of Rodolfo Del Carlo sworn   March      Mr Del Carlo is an accountant and as Mr Hopkins  financial adviser recommended the ACM project to him  He said that his sole purpose in introducing Mr Hopkins to the project was for Mr Hopkins to make a profit  He received a commission as a result of the investment but the commission was not contingent on Mr Hopkins claiming or receiving a tax deduction       The affidavit of Donald St Clair Starr sworn   March       Mr Starr said that before investing in the ACM project he had discussions with Mr Sleight about the cost of entry and the length of time it would take him to derive an income stream from the project  He said he was   years old at that time and wanted to retire early  He had no previous experience in cattle breeding but was encouraged by the fact that the Poll Hereford breed of stud cattle was being used as he knew them to be of a very high quality  Although he had given some consideration to the availability of tax deductions for the various expenses of the project  this was not the dominant reason or purpose behind his eventual decision to enter into it  His main concern related to the profit projections and whether it would be possible to make a sizeable profit from his investment  If he had thought the project would not have been profitable he would not have invested irrespective of the potential for tax deductions  He made cash payments of   to the project       The affidavit of Gary Kevin Hopkins sworn   March       Mr Hopkins said that before investing in the ACM project he had discussions with Mr Del Carlo about the investment  He read the relevant information booklet  The most important aspects of the project so far as he was concerned were the income projections contained on pages   and   of the information booklet  He was aware at the time that the prices being received at cattle sales were going through a prosperous period  He was also aware of the high quality of the Poll Hereford breed of stud cattle to be used in the project  He said he considered the projections of profit of approximately   per two cows to be profitable and worthwhile and realistic at the time that he invested  He said that his ability to claim tax deductions for various expenses related to the project was a factor he had considered before investing in it  but not the main reason or purpose behind his decision to invest  He said tax implications are always taken into account  but the obtaining of a substantial profit was his main objective and the profit projections were the most important part of his assessment  He said that if he had not believed that the project would be profitable he would not have entered into it  He made cash payments of   to the project      There was no other affidavit material before the Tribunal   The applicants accepted  before the Tribunal  that the relevant outgoings were on capital account reflecting the conclusion reached by the Full Court in Vincent   FCAFC       FCR     It was not in dispute that for the purposes of s  L d  of the ITAA none of the  scheme sections  applied in relation to the participants in ACM  The Tribunal said  at        However  schemes defeated under the primary provisions of the income tax legislation still have to satisfy the conditions of section  L before a penalty by way of additional tax applies  One of those conditions  and the one most relevant in this case  is that the particular scheme was a   tax avoidance scheme   for the purposes of section  L c  of the ITAA  Pursuant to section  L  the rates of penalty that apply are   of the amount of primary tax applicable to the adjustment  or if it is reasonably arguably that the deduction claimed was correctly allowable    of the primary tax applicable to the adjustment   The Tribunal then considered whether the ACM breeding project was a tax avoidance scheme within the meaning of the definition of that term in s    It was conceded on behalf of the applicants that the project was a scheme within the meaning of Pt IVA and accordingly within the terms of s  A of the ITAA  In the end the Tribunal s decision about the application of the penalty under s  L depended upon whether the  sole or dominant purpose  referred to in s   was to be assessed as a subjective purpose or an objective and  I interpolate  attributed  purpose   The Tribunal observed that Pt IVA requires the purpose of a scheme to be assessed objectively  So much flows from the language of s  D which applies when the taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit and  it would be concluded that the person or one of the persons who entered into or carried out the scheme     did so for the purpose of enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme   The Tribunal accepted the submission on behalf of the Commissioner that the language of s   indicated that an examination of the objective facts and circumstances surrounding the scheme was necessary and that this  tied in with the objective inquiry required in Pt IVA    The Tribunal found that the ACM scheme was a tax avoidance scheme in terms of s   of the ITAA entered into or carried out with the sole or dominant purpose of enabling the participants and  in this case  the applicants  to pay no tax or less tax  Section  L therefore applied  The applicants had not provided any evidence that their involvement in the ACM scheme was objectively different from the facts and circumstances ruled upon by the Federal Court in the case of Vincent   FCAFC       FCR    Accordingly  the Tribunal found the applicants had not  discharged their onus    The questions of law said to be raised on the appeal against the Tribunal s decision did not define with precision the issue thrown up by the grounds  The central issue emerging from the grounds of the appeal was whether the Tribunal erred in law in holding that s   does not involve an inquiry into the subjective purposes of the taxpayers concerned   It was contended in the grounds of appeal that the Tribunal ought to have found that         i  The test for determining whether a scheme is a  tax avoidance scheme entered into or carried out for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling a person to pay no tax or less tax  within the meaning of section   of the ITAA involves an inquiry into the subjective purpose of those who entered into or carried out the scheme  and in this case the Applicants  and the promoters of the Active Cattle Management Scheme       ii  The Applicants  unchallenged evidence supported a finding that they each had a dominant purpose of investing in the Active Cattle Management Scheme to make a profit and that paying no tax or less tax was not their dominant purpose       iii  The findings of the Full Court in Vincent v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR    at   supported a finding that the dominant purpose of the promoters of the Active Cattle Management Scheme was to make a profit and was not to enable the Applicants to pay no tax or less tax       iv  That the Active Cattle Management Scheme was not a tax avoidance scheme for the purposes of section   of the ITAA  and that the Applicants did not fall within section  L of the ITAA  and were not liable to pay penalties as imposed by the Respondent   In each case the applicants seek an order that the decision made by the Tribunal be set aside and that their objections be allowed in full   In this case the tax shortfall arose because the taxpayers treated money expended on their investment in the ACM project as deductible expenditure on revenue account  It was  in the light of the Full Court decision in Vincent   FCAFC       FCR     capital expenditure and therefore not deductible  That characterisation did not depend upon the status of the ACM project as a scheme to which Pt IVA applied within the meaning of s  D   The schemes in relation to which s   applied were tax avoidance schemes within the meaning of s    The definition of  tax avoidance scheme  in s   had two elements  The first was that it be  a scheme within the meaning of Part IVA   That picked up the definition of  scheme  in s  A  Importantly  a  scheme within the meaning of Part IVA  was not thereby  a scheme to which Pt IVA applies   The latter category is defined in s  D and is a subclass of schemes within the meaning of Pt IVA  It is limited  inter alia  by the requirement that  it would be concluded that the person  or one of the persons who entered into the scheme or any part of the scheme did so for the purpose of enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme       The section does not require an inquiry into the actual mental state of the taxpayer or anybody else concerned with the scheme but rather into what  would be concluded  about purpose after consideration of the eight factors listed in the section   In determining the nature of the inquiry into the purpose referred to in the definition of  tax avoidance scheme  in s   it is important not to be distracted by s  D  That section  unlike s   is concerned with what  would be concluded  about the purpose of those entering into a scheme having regard to the eight listed factors  That inquiry differs from the inquiry mandated by s    It defines the field of considerations from which an attribution of purpose can be made  It does not extend to actual states of mind   In my opinion  the Tribunal erred in law in excluding consideration of the stated purposes of Messrs Starr and Hopkins  Their statements were not contested  They were not inherently improbable  The Tribunal came to a contrary conclusion evidently based upon that reached by the Federal Court in Vincent   FCAFC       FCR   about the application of Pt IVA    It seems that in this case the Tribunal reached its conclusions about the relevant purpose upon the apparent assumption that the statements of the taxpayers  Messrs Starr and Hopkins  were irrelevant  In my opinion  however  there is no point in remitting these matters to the Tribunal as the evidence about the taxpayers  actual purposes in entering the schemes was not contested by the Commissioner  In the circumstances  the decisions of the Tribunal will be set aside and the objections allowed  The parties will be given liberty to apply for any necessary consequential orders    I certify that the preceding fifty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

cases cth HCA  html  The notion of objective intention in contract was discussed in Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc   HCA         CLR    at      Although the word  intention  is used in this context  it is used in the same sense as it is used in other contractual contexts  It describes what it is that would objectively be conveyed by what was said or done  having regard to the circumstances in which those statements and actions happened  It is not a search for the uncommunicated subjective motives or intentions of the parties   There are two ways of regarding the identification of intention in the contractual context  One is as a process of inference constrained because it excludes from consideration evidence of what the parties say their mental states were  The other is as a process of attribution  The latter is probably the more accurate characterisation   The fictional mental states of corporations are attributed rather than ascertained  A corporation is a fictitious legal person  It exists only in a kind of virtual reality created by the law  In order to allocate rights and liabilities the law treats a corporation as though it has a mind and as though that mind has mental states  So a corporation may have purpose  And although it is an attributed purpose because the corporation is a fictitious person  its purpose may be assessed subjectively or objectively citedNews Ltd v South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Despite the use of  purpose  in s  D of the Trade Practices Act as an attribute of the provisions defining exclusionary contracts  arrangements or understandings and despite its attribution to corporations  it has been treated as amenable to

purpose  for example the tribunal of fact must attribute a purpose to an artificial or notional mind that is deemed responsible for some act or omission  In such contexts  the tribunal of fact deduces

the basis of long standing authority McHugh J adopted the approach that the relevant purpose was the actual  ie  subjective purpose even though it was a subjective purpose attributable to a

effect of the person s conduct may be the best evidence  The statements of parties about their purposes will often be treated with reserve  Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd     FCR   ASX Operations Pty

cth FCAFC  html  Section  a  speaks of a circumstance in which the engaging by a corporation in conduct  has the purpose      This is more readily amenable to a subjective construction of purpose than s  D and has been so construed  Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR    What has to be shown in such a case is  the actual purpose of the relevant respondent   But as the Full Court said of direct evidence from parties as to their purposes  at            it will normally be critically scrutinised  it is often ex post facto and self serving   In my opinion these authorities are consistent with the proposition that the law should generally be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the words it uses having regard to their context and legislative purpose  Where a mental state is referred to it should be construed as an actual mental state unless the context indicates a constructive or attributed mental state   The conditions necessary to attract penalty tax under s  L established by that provision were as follows     The taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year        The shortfall was caused in whole or in part by the taxpayer treating an income tax law as applying in relation to a scheme in a particular way      The scheme was a scheme within the meaning of Pt IVA that was entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling a person to pay no tax or less tax       The scheme is not one in relation to which ss       or  AA apply citedKrampel Newman v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The purpose of s   was referred to by Ryan J in Krampel Newman v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at   where his Honour quoted with approval an observation by counsel based on the Explanatory Memorandum that           s  L is intended to apply the same level of penalty as s     and   for schemes entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding tax  but in respect of which the Commissioner has not applied any of the anti avoidance provisions because the schemes are ineffective under the ordinary provisions of the ITAA eg s    citedNewton v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The language of s   may be contrasted in this respect with that of the former s   the ill fated general anti avoidance section  That section applied to  e very contract  agreement or arrangement       so far as it has or purports to have the purpose or effect of in any way  directly or indirectly       inter alia   defeating  evading or avoiding any duty or liability imposed on any person by this Act   In Newton v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   the Privy Council took an objective approach to the assessment of purpose under that provision and quoted with approval what Williams J had said in the High Court  at      The purpose of a contract  agreement or arrangement must be what it is intended to effect and that intention must be ascertained from its terms  These terms may be oral or written or may have to be inferred from the circumstances but  when they have been ascertained  their purpose must be what they effect      The Privy Council said that the opening words of the section showed that it was not concerned with  the motives of individuals   However the language used in s   differed significantly from that of s   which refers to the  entry into or carrying out  of a scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of tax avoidance  See generally as to the relationship between s   and Pt IVA  Parsons  Income Taxation in Australia  Law Book Co    at     to       It is to be recalled that s  L was a penalty provision  The fact of entry into a tax avoidance scheme was a necessary condition of the imposition of the penalty for which it provided  If the purpose of penalties is to secure compliance with the tax laws  they may ordinarily be expected to be concerned with the conduct and purposes of defaulting taxpayers  That is to say their actual conduct and actual purposes  It is difficult to see why if two constructions of s   be available that construction should be adopted which would permit the imposition of a penalty by reference to a purpose which the taxpayer never had  Of course  purpose could be assessed even under s   by reference to objective factors  It may also be that the statements of individual taxpayers about their purposes relevant to the imposition of penalty would be given little weight  But the relative weight and extent of subjective and objective evidence relevant to that determination will be an accident of the particular proceedings in which the question arises  In this case the evidence of the taxpayers and the advisors was unchallenged
