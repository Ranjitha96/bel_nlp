which applies generally  s  C is clearly limited to native title determination applications under the Act     section  C applies where an application does not comply with ss      A or     whereas O   r   is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed  the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious  or the proceeding is an abuse of process    the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike out under s  C with those of summary dismissal under O   r   Williams v Grant   FCAFC   at         Accordingly the Courts approach such matters with caution  and on the basis that no court proceeding should be summarily dismissed except in a very clear case  Bodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR   at   followedBooth v State of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Mr Preston for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant  in supporting the notice of motion to dismiss Kabi Kabi   submitted in summary as follows        The Kabi Kabi   Application produces no evidence that the alleged decision making process resulting in that native title determination application was a mandatory traditional process involving traditional laws and customs which needed to be followed     In terms of s  B of the Act   an agreed process of decision making is applicable if there is no mandatory traditional process of decision making under traditional laws and customs  Where a native title determination application is based upon an agreed process  the applicant must identify how the process was agreed upon  and how it was put into practice     It is open to the Court to infer that the Kabi Kabi   Applicant cannot identify such a process in relation to that application  in that the Kabi Kabi   Applicant did not produce relevant evidence to the Court in response to the notice of motion to dismiss the application  and that it is also unlikely that any new material of relevance could be produced to the Tribunal     There has been no consultation process in the case of Kabi Kabi   involving invitations  notice or discussions with people relevant to any native title claim concerning the Kabi Kabi people  and no evidence has been produced to establish eldership in relation to those people in Kabi Kabi   who assert eldership  Accordingly  the decision making process is  on the Kabi Kabi   Applicant s own material  seriously defective to the point of being incurable      State of Queensland  Mr Prowse for the State of Queensland submitted        there cannot be valid authorisation of both claims in Kabi Kabi   and Kabi Kabi     the material filed by the Kabi Kabi   Applicant does not sufficiently address the authorisation issue    if the current situation continued  with competing claims  the view of the State was that more time and money would be wasted in fruitless interlocutory applications      Kabi Kabi   Applicant  Mr Poynton  for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant  opposed the dismissal application  In summary  his submissions were as follows        it was accepted that the Kabi Kabi   claim had failed the registration test of the Tribunal on the basis of failure of correct authorisation    the Act was amended at the beginning of     as sworn by Ms Bernice Anning  solicitor for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant  in an affidavit of   May   the Kabi Kabi   Applicant had been contacted by the Tribunal on the basis that  although Kabi Kabi   had failed the registration test on   August   the changes to the Act meant that the Tribunal was required to test the application again  and had assigned a case manager to help with any questions    accordingly  it would be premature for the Court to  close the administrative window of opportunity  opened by the legislature and the Tribunal by dismissing the Kabi Kabi   Application    an alternative way forward would be for the Court to order an adjournment until later in   to allow the Kabi Kabi   Applicant time to have their material prepared  submitted to the Tribunal  and be allowed to take advantage of the legislature s change of the law    it would be unfair to strike out the Kabi Kabi   Application  and not the Kabi Kabi   Application   Third  as I have already noted  Ms MacDonald also deposed that a majority decision arrived at during a meeting held in accordance with Australian meeting rules and conventions conforms to the traditional values associated with Kabi Kabi decision meeting in appropriate conditions  cf similar comments of Mr Alexander Davidson in his affidavit of   October    para    However in the absence of more precise evidence  I am not prepared to accept at this stage that majority vote is a method of decision making in accordance with traditional Aboriginal law and custom in relation to the Kabi Kabi people  Mr Niblett in his report makes no reference to majority voting as conforming to traditional decision making processes  Further  to paraphrase comments of Tamberlin J in similar circumstances in Booth v State of Queensland   FCA     there is no other evidence  oral or written  before me as to the constitution of the group or the basis on which it is claimed that a majority vote would be sufficient  or indeed as to who and how many persons are entitled to vote and precisely what is meant by the expression  majority vote    Booth   FCA   at       Fourth  if the authorisation process concerning the Kabi Kabi   claim was not in conformity with traditional law and customs  it is not clear to me on the evidence that the native title claim group agreed to and adopted any particular decision making process in relation to authorising the Kabi Kabi   Applicant to make the Kabi Kabi   Application  I note and accept the submissions of Mr Rangiah for QSNTS in this regard concerning the lack of evidence or detail as to the authorisation process in that case   Finally  I note that the submissions of Mr Poynton for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant in this matter are not that the application is authorised and in accordance with s     but are confined to a request for more time to allow it to  in the words of Mr Poynton  take advantage of  an administrative window of opportunity  offered by the Tribunal in relation to testing the application  In my view this submission does not address the key issues before the Court in relation to the current notice of motion  In particular        notwithstanding the formal offer by the Tribunal to test the application again  the applicant provides no explanation to this Court as to how or why  as a result of amendments to the Act   it is possible that the Tribunal may view the claim as authorised whereas previously it had not    no additional evidence was produced by the Kabi Kabi   Applicant to the Court in response to the notice of motion to have the Kabi Kabi   Application struck out demonstrating that the Kabi Kabi   Application was in fact authorised    the written submissions of QSNTS in relation to flaws in the alleged authorisation process in Kabi Kabi   have not been addressed by the Kabi Kabi   Applicant    I fail to understand how extra time allowed to the Kabi Kabi   Applicant in these circumstances will address a key issue raised by Mr Rangiah  namely that there are currently two applications allegedly authorised by Kabi Kabi people  covering a very similar area of land and involving eleven common apical ancestors  however both applications cannot be authorised  and either one or both of the applications must not be authorised in accordance with s   of the Act    Mr Poynton has also submitted that it would be unfair to strike out the Kabi Kabi   Application and not the Kabi Kabi   Application  However in my view this submission is of little weight  as I note from the undertaking of Mr Preston on behalf of his client that the effect of striking out the Kabi Kabi   Application is that the Kabi Kabi   Application will be discontinued   It is unnecessary in these circumstances that I deal with O   r   Federal Court Rules   The Kabi Kabi   Application does not comply with s   of the Act and accordingly should be struck out pursuant to s  C citedBrasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Mr Topp for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant submitted in summary        the notice of motion of   June   was an interlocutory step in the proceeding  Costs of interlocutory proceedings should be costs in the cause and not taxed until the end of the proceedings  O   r   Federal Court Rules   Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   FCA       as a consequence of s  A  in relation to native title applications there is no expectation that costs will follow the event    persons  entities or groups other than the respondents should not be entitled to any form of costs order in respect of the   June   notice of motion  whether a deemed costs in their cause order or at all  The directions made on   March   where the Kabi Kabi   Applicant was ordered to serve the Kabi Kabi   Applicant with the relevant documents  did not require or otherwise oblige the Kabi Kabi   Applicant to file affidavits  outlines of argument or any other material  nor to do anything else at all   I note the submission of Mr Preston that the   June   notice of motion had been on foot for almost a year at the time of the hearing of   May   and that the Kabi Kabi   Applicant had known since at least late April   that authorisation was an issue in the proceedings  In this respect advancement of the Kabi Kabi   Application appears to have been afflicted by some ennui   However  I also note that  while not determinative of the claim of the Kabi Kabi   Applicant  no orders have been sought by State of Queensland  Gurang Land Council or QSNTS

Court of the Federal Court in De Rose v State of South Australia  No     FCAFC   at   in the following terms        section  A  is intended to remove any ground for anticipation or expectation that unless cause is shown for another order  costs will follow the event    nonetheless  s  A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion    there is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order  It follows that the exercise of the discretion is not conditional upon a finding of fact or the formation of an opinion as to the occurrence of unreasonable conduct or the existence of special circumstances    section  A  of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court s discretion in cases where a party acts unreasonably  but s  A  does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s  A      the matters to be taken into account in making a costs order are left to the Court s discretion  which must be exercised judicially  However  the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs      Costs in favour of non parties  Mr Preston for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant submitted in summary        any consideration of an award of costs on the discontinuance of the   June   notice of motion must occur in light of s  A of the Act     as made clear in Ward   FCA       FCR   and De Rose   FCAFC             o the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs  o there is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order under s  A    o section  A  does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s  A               the conduct of the parties in the matter and the reasons for the discontinuance of a matter can bear heavily on the exercise of the discretion as to costs  so that if the discontinuance can be said to be an acknowledgement of likely defeat or no objective circumstance provides reasons for the discontinuance  a costs order in favour of the other party will ordinarily be made  Finn J in O Neill v Mann   FCA   at       a significant number of circumstances exist which would justify an award of costs against the Kabi Kabi   Applicant in this case    it is an underlying policy in the Federal Court Rules that the discontinuing party should be liable for the other party s costs unless the Court orders otherwise    the Kabi Kabi   Applicant did not comply with the directions of   March   and file material  and did not inform the Kabi Kabi   Applicant of the decision to discontinue the application to amend until after the due date had passed to file material    the Kabi Kabi   Applicant

in fact a representative body  however as pointed out by Wilcox J in Moran v Minister for Land   Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales   FCA   at       a person who wishes to rely on a

I note comments of Mr Niblett that the processes of decision making referred to in affidavits of persons comprising the Kabi Kabi   Applicant did not appear to have had the level of collective interaction and discussion to be expected in the  traditional  context  nor may all relevant parties have been adequately consulted  In this respect I note from Ms MacDonald s affidavit that she

  Applicant in this case may be distinguished however from such cases as Knight   HCA       CLR   and Gore   FCA       FCR   in that  in this case  costs are sought by a non party against a party to the litigation  While claims by non parties seeking costs in their favour against parties to litigation are rare  they are not unknown  for example Re Pan Pharmaceuticals  Selim v McGrath   NSWSC   and O Keefe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd   FCA    In O Keefe   FCA   Nicholson J said in the context of such claims in the Federal Court      The jurisdiction of the Court to award costs is found in s   of the Federal Court of Australia    Cth   the Act    It follows from the terms of that section that the jurisdiction is conditioned by there being  costs  and those costs being in  proceedings before the Court   Section   of the Act defines  proceeding  to mean  a proceeding in a court  whether between parties or not  and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of  or in connexion with  a proceeding      In Knight v FP Special Assets Limited   HCA         CLR   it was held by Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  McHugh J dissenting  that the discretion to award costs under O   r   of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland was not confined to the parties in the proceedings  That rule provided for the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the court to be in the discretion of the court or judge  Gaudron J at   stated that it was contrary to long established principle and wholly inappropriate that a grant of power to a court should be construed as subject to a limitation not appearing in the words of the grant  that is  the words used should be given their full meaning unless there is something to indicate to the contrary  Therefore  her Honour stated the

cth federal ct  html  This section was considered by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   whose comments were subsequently adopted and summarised by the Full Court of the Federal Court in De Rose v State of South Australia  No     FCAFC   at   in the following terms        section  A  is intended to remove any ground for anticipation or expectation that unless cause is shown for another order  costs will follow the event    nonetheless  s  A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion    there is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order  It follows that the exercise of the discretion is not conditional upon a finding of fact or the formation of an opinion as to the occurrence of unreasonable conduct or the existence of special circumstances    section  A  of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court s discretion in cases where a party acts unreasonably  but s  A  does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s  A      the matters to be taken into account in making a costs order are left to the Court s discretion  which must be exercised judicially  However  the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs      Costs in favour of non parties  Mr Preston for the Kabi Kabi   Applicant submitted in summary        any consideration of an award of

cases cth FCAFC  html  To the extent that there is overlap with respect to the operation of s  C and O   r   in the context of native title cases  I note that        unlike O   r   which applies generally  s  C is clearly limited to native title determination applications under the Act     section  C applies where an application does not comply with ss      A or     whereas O   r   is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed  the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious  or the proceeding is an abuse of process    the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike out under s  C with those of summary dismissal under O   r   Williams v Grant   FCAFC   at         Accordingly the Courts approach such matters with caution  and on the basis that no court proceeding should be summarily dismissed except in a very clear case  Bodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR   at
