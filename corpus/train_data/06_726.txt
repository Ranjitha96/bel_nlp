Australia  Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  By its statement of claim the applicant alleged that the respondents have contravened s   of the Act   Under this provision a trade mark will be infringed where a mark which is  substantially identical with  or deceptively similar to  a registered trade mark is used in relation to the same goods as the registered goods  The use complained of must be  use by the alleged infringer as a trade mark  and this requires consideration of the  purpose and nature of the impugned use  see Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Kitto J as cited in Johnson   Johnson Australia Pty Ltd v Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd     FCR   at   per Gummow J  It is clear that the respondents  use of the allegedly infringing marks is use for the purposes of trade   The third and fourth respondents have  in essence  admitted that they have infringed the Nokia Trade Marks  Nokia s evidence of the trap purchases from them and Mr Taylor s evidence that the goods were counterfeit made out Nokia s case of trade mark infringement against them  The third respondent has not attempted to file any defence in this proceeding and  in oral evidence  admitted that he had sold counterfeit Nokia products  In his  Defence  of   February   the fourth respondent effectively admitted trade mark infringement  Accordingly  Nokia is entitled to summary judgment against the third and fourth respondents  Mr Akyildiz and Mr Kim    In contrast to the third and fourth respondents  the first and second respondents have denied trade make infringement  As counsel for Nokia noted  the affidavit and statements filed on their behalf did not include any firm denials stating that the alleged trap purchases had not taken place  Further  this material admitted that the first respondent had sold  off market  products and did not specifically deny that such products included unauthorised Nokia branded products  On their own  these vague and seemingly ambiguous denials would have no prospects of success at a trial referred toTermi Mesh Australia Pty Ltd v Josu

or exceptional circumstances  The discretion conferred by the Rules of this Court is to be exercised by reference to all the relevant circumstances  However  as French J said at      Nevertheless the policy of the rule is clear that ordinarily a corporation will be required to be represented by a solicitor  Relevant factors for dispensing with that requirement include the financial capacity or lack of capacity of the corporation and those standing behind it  the effect of diverting company resources to paying legal expenses  the nature of the company s undertaking  its financial structure  its ability to retain and pay its staff and the identity and spread of its shareholders  The factual complexities of the case and the capacity of the proposed representative to conduct it effectively are also relevant         As his Honour observed those who carry on business through corporate structures have advantages that those who carry on business on their own account do not enjoy  but they also acquire disabilities and obligations  compare Clout  Trustee  v Anscor Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Drummond J and Melaleuca of Australia   New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck   FCA   at       per Bennett J
