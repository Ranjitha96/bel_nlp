Cahill v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  No     FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe no case submission had two limbs  The first limb concerned the proper construction of the definition of  building industrial action  in s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   The Union and Mr Mates argued that  in order to constitute  building industrial action  within paras  b  and  c  of the definition in s     the action in question must be that of employees in respect of their work  It followed  so they said  that there was an evidentiary hiatus in Mr Cahill s case because Mr Cahill had not adduced any evidence that any  ban  limitation or restriction  had been imposed by employees in respect of the work to which the ban  limitation or restriction related  see below at    For the reasons previously stated  however  the Union and Mr Mates failed to persuade me that their construction should be adopted  I accepted that  if there was a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of building work imposed by a union   then the definition of  building industrial action  might be satisfied  see Cahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union  No     FCA    referred to below as  the No case Ruling  at    Also for the reasons previously given  I was satisfied that it was just and convenient for this ruling to be made without putting the Union and Mr Mates to their election  In the second limb of their no case submission  the Union and Mr Mates contended that  taken at its highest from Mr Cahill s point of view  the evidence adduced by him did not make out the contraventions of ss   and   that he alleged in relation to the events of   and   February   and following  For the reasons previously given  I declined to rule on this part of the no case submission unless the Union and Mr Mates elected to call no further evidence  see the No case Ruling at   and    They were put to their election  and in respect of all causes of action  On   August   the Union and Mr Mates elected not to call any evidence  At a directions hearing on   August   I stated that I proposed to deliver my decision on the second part of the no case submission at the same time as final judgment

The term  building employee  is defined in s   to mean  a person whose employment consists of  or includes  building work  or     a person who accepts an offer of engagement as an employee for work

Union   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Union is and was a  building association  within the meaning of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   Pursuant to s  b     the following conduct in relation to a building association is taken to be conduct of the building association     conduct of an officer or agent of the association acting in that capacity   Mr Mates was an officer of the association  s   and acted in that capacity  At trial  counsel for the Union and Mr Mates made no argument to the contrary  see also Hanley v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing and Kindred Industries Union   FCA         FCR   at       per Ryan  Moore and Goldberg JJ and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   at   per Le Miere J  Mr Mates  conduct is therefore taken to be the conduct of the Union  Should Mr Mates  intent to coerce Hardcorp for a prohibited reason be imputed to the Union  In order to answer this question  it is necessary to turn to s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth  which relevantly provides that    Where it is necessary to establish  for the purposes of this Act or the  Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act  the state of mind of a body corporate in relation to particular conduct  it is sufficient to show   a  that the conduct was engaged in by an officer  director  employee or agent of the body corporate within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority  and    b  that the officer  director  employee or agent had the state of mind   I have already found that Mr Mates had the requisite state of mind  There is a question as to whether Mr Mates engaged in the conduct  within the scope of his     actual or apparent authority   There is no evidence of the scope of Mr Mates  actual authority  Having regard to the previous dealings between the Union and Mr Goss and his companies  however  and the admissions made by the Union  see   of the Defence  I am satisfied that Mr Mates acted within the scope of his apparent authority in respect of his conduct of   February   see Hanley   FCR at      In this regard  counsel for the Union and Mr Mates made no submission to the contrary  As already noted  the Union was an organisation for the purpose of s  a  and therefore a person to whom the prohibition in s   might apply  Further  Hardcorp was a constitutional corporation for the purpose of s  b  and  therefore  Mr Mates was a person to whom the prohibition in s   might apply  The latter would also be an alternative basis for supporting the application of the prohibition to the Union  Accordingly  I find that Mr Mates  in his own right  and the Union  through Mr Mates  conduct on   February   breached s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   The events of   February  There was ample evidence that the picket was directed to recovering payments for sub contractors and others to whom the Goss companies owed money  The picket followed immediately after the second creditors  meeting of Melbourne Transit  at which     cents in the dollar was offered to unsecured creditors   As noted above  on   February   Mr Palmer observed that the picketers had handwritten signs that referred to  Goss needing to pay his debts   The picket line included creditors of Melbourne Transit  For reasons already indicated  I would accord little weight to Mr McMahon s uncorroborated evidence that he recognized only a  small percentage  on the picket line as subcontractors  The video evidence of the picket on   February   showed that the then picketers were concerned with the repayment of debts  The evidence establishes that  on the balance of probabilities  the reason for the picket line was to pressure Mr Goss to make a better offer for the payment of debts than that made at the creditor s meeting on   February    Apart from the fact that Mr Mates had stopped the crane the day before  there would have been very little reason for supposing that the picket was being organised so as to coerce Hardcorp to re employ anyone or to allocate OH S responsibilities to any particular individual  I do not consider that the reason for stopping the crane can  without more  be treated as the reason for the picket  especially when the creditors  meeting had intervened and there was evidence to the contrary  Mr Cahill has therefore failed to establish that the reason proscribed in s   was a substantial or operative reason  or a substantial and operative reason  for the organising of the picket  see Hanley   FCR at       and National Tertiary Education Union   FCR at     and compare General Motors Holden Pty Ltd v Bowling     ALR   at   per Mason J citedLeighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR  The Union is and was a  building association  within the meaning of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act   Pursuant to s  b     the following conduct in relation to a building association is taken to be conduct of the building association     conduct of an officer or agent of the association acting in that capacity   Mr Mates was an officer of the association  s   and acted in that capacity  At trial  counsel for the Union and Mr Mates made no argument to the contrary  see also Hanley v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing and Kindred Industries Union   FCA         FCR   at       per Ryan  Moore and Goldberg JJ and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   at   per Le Miere J  Mr Mates  conduct is therefore taken to be the conduct of the Union referred toJames v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     ALR  As already noted  the contraventions alleged in respect of the events on site on   February   and the picket line on   February   and following were the subject of a no case submission  The question for the Court on a no case submission of the kind made is whether there is evidence upon which the Court could enter judgment for the applicant  Plainly enough  logically speaking  rejecting a no case submission does not necessarily entail the consequence that the claim succeeds  The difference between a ruling on a no case submission and final judgment is clear where a judge sits with a jury  Where a judge sits alone the distinction may be less easily seen  As Toohey J said in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     ALR   at     Where a judge is sitting with a jury  the distinction between the arbiter of law and the arbiter of fact is of course apparent  If the judge decides that there is a case to go to the jury  it is then for the jury to uphold or dismiss the claim  While there is no logical inconsistency in rejecting a no case submission and thereafter rejecting the claim  the distinction is a fine one when a judge sits without a jury  given that the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities and that inferences may be drawn by reason of the respondent s failure to adduce evidence         If a defendant elects not to call evidence  the judge has before him all the evidence upon which he is called to make a decision  Any distinction between the role of the judge in ruling on a no case submission and the role of the judge as an arbiter of fact becomes largely illusory     The inconvenience of not putting the defendant to an election is apparent  If the judge s decision on the no case submission is upset on appeal  there must inevitably be a retrial referred toResidues Treatment   Trading Co Ltd v Southern Resources Ltd     SASR  In Residues Treatment   Trading Co Ltd v Southern Resources Ltd     SASR   at     Perry J determined that the defendants should be put to their election and said    I realise that by putting the defendants to their election  I have effectively rendered it impracticable for the defendants to make any submission of no case to answer  even if they elect not to call any evidence  This is so  as if they do not call any evidence  it would not be appropriate for the court then to embark on the artificial exercise of determining whether there was a case to answer  The orderly disposal of the proceedings in those circumstances would require the defendants to proceed with their final submissions  see Toohey J  James v ANZ Bank at    But those considerations cannot deflect me from ruling in favour of the defendants being put to their election  if it is otherwise proper to do so  As noted above  this was also the view I came to and the course taken in this case  Accordingly  I turn to the evidence as it now stands  On   February   Transit Joint Venture booked and paid for a crane crew and a crane from IC Hire Pty Ltd  trading as Independent Cranes  to attend the site on Tuesday    February    Monday    February   was a rostered day off for workers at the site  On   February   Mr Mates attended Mount Street shortly after the crane and crane crew had come onto the site and begun to set up  The Union and Mr Mates did not dispute that Mr Mates told the crane crew to shut down the crane and leave  The crane crew spoke with Mr Mitchell at the office of Independent Cranes and left the site  Mr Cahill alleged that  by this conduct  the Union and Mr Mates contravened s   by taking action with the intent to coerce Hardcorp to employ Mr Deans  Ms Singleton and Mr O Donnell  and or   allocate and or designate to Ms Singleton the duties or responsibilities of an OH S officer  see   and   of the Statement of Claim  There was a further related allegation concerning s     which is discussed below citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOver the history of the proceeding  the Union and Mr Mates put forward various explanations for Mr Mates  conduct on   February   some of which were not pursued at trial and others were not pressed in final submissions  whether because of the Union s and Mr Mates  election not to call evidence or otherwise  Thus   A  of an amended defence dated   August   pleaded that the crane was removed because of a malfunction and or because of concerns about payment  Neither explanation was pursued at trial  I reject counsel for Mr Cahill s submission that I should treat this conduct on the Union s and Mr Mates  part as evidence of consciousness of guilt  I would not regard the relevant principle as applicable in the circumstances shown  compare Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at             It is undeniable  however  that there is no evidence that might explain Mr Mates  conduct other than that to which I have already referred  For the reasons that appear below  I would not regard the evidence concerning the events of   February   and thereafter as having much  if any  bearing on this incident  There was no evidence to support a suggestion that safety concerns motivated Mr Mates  conduct  compare   of amended defence and further amended defence dated   July    In cross examination  Mr Moresi  who had     years experience in the construction industry and with cranes  said that he had not heard Mr Mates or anyone else raise any safety issue when Mr Mates was on site on   February    Mr Moresi said that responsibility for any safety issue affecting the crane lay with the crane crew and the site safety officer  managers and engineer  Mr Palmer s evidence was to the same effect  including that no safety issues touching the crane were raised with him on   February    Mr McMahon s evidence was that  if there had been a safety issue with the crane  then  as a matter of practice  the crane crew would have immediately notified him as one of the site management personnel  Mr McMahon added that no one from Independent Cranes and none of the crane crew had raised any safety  location  or other problem concerning the crane on   February    The evidence established that Mr Mates told Mr Moresi  Mr Palmer and Mr McMahon that he had shut down the crane because there was no shop steward or OH S representative on site  When Mr Moresi informed him that Mr Van Senten was shop steward and OH S representative  Mr Mates persisted  saying he did not care  There is no reasonable explanation for Mr Mates  conduct once he was given this explanation  The only tenable explanation is that Mr Mates was carrying out his threats of   and   February   that the project at Mount Street would not recommence unless Mr Deans  Mr O Donnell and Ms Singleton were re employed and took on their former responsibilities  including that Ms Singleton assumed OH S responsibilities  It was telling that Mr Mates gave as his reason for his action that there was no shop steward or OH S representative  because this reflected the demands that he had made to Mr Goss at his earlier meetings with him on   and   February    The nature of Mr Mates  demands was reflected in that fact that  when he was told that Mr Van Senten was shop steward and OH S representative  he said he did not care  In effect  Mr Mates signalled that he was only interested in his people being appointed to these positions  This too was consistent with his demands of   and   February
