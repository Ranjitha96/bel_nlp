Housing  Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affair s   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe applicant seeks an extension of time within which to file an Application for Leave to Appeal from a judgment of Emmett J  delivered on   August     Budd v Secretary  Department of Housing  Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affair s   FCA    In that judgment  pursuant to s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth    the Federal Court of Australia Act   his Honour dismissed an appeal brought by the applicant pursuant to s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal   the Tribunal   given on   June    In the Tribunal  the applicant sought a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal given on   September    That decision had affirmed earlier decisions by Centrelink to reject a claim for a crisis payment made by the applicant on   July   pursuant to s  JH of the Social Security Act    Cth   His Honour was unable to discern any question of law that the applicant sought to have determined by him  His Honour looked at the contentions and arguments advanced by the applicant and held that the applicant s appeal before him had no prospect of succeeding  Emmett J carefully reviewed the decision of the Tribunal and the catalogue of complaints which the applicant sought to raise before him  His Honour referred to the terms of s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and noted that the appeal to this Court under that section must be on a question of law  His Honour said   Budd   FCA   at         The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground the appeal but is also the subject matter of the appeal itself  see TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR   at    In the absence of a question of law within the meaning of s   of the AA Tribunal Act  the jurisdiction of the Federal Court is not enlivened  His Honour then referred to s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act and moved on to consider the applicant s Notice of Appeal  At   and   his Honour said      The amended notice of appeal is clearly embarrassing  It is highly repetitious and quite incomprehensive  sic  in many respects  It repeats several times the contention that the AA Tribunal misconceived Ms Budd s complaint and misunderstood the medical report upon which she based her complaint   The documents of   August   and   August   are again repetitious of the complaint that the AA Tribunal failed to have regard to all of the evidence  The documents take issue with the matters considered by the AA Tribunal in concluding that Ms Budd failed in her contention that she had left or could not return to her home because of an extreme circumstance as is required by s  JH a  of the SS Act  The extensive further material that has been provided by Ms Budd serves only to confirm that she is seeking to invite the Court to canvass the factual conclusions reached by the AA Tribunal  His Honour then went on to hold that he could not discern a question of law raised by the applicant  and that  therefore  the appeal before him should be dismissed pursuant to s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act   The applicant must demonstrate that she has some prospects of succeeding in overturning his Honour s decision  In order to do that  the applicant must identify some error on the part of his Honour and demonstrate to a sufficient degree that she has a real prospect at a final hearing of establishing that the identified error was  in fact  made  The applicant has conspicuously failed to identify any error on the part of his Honour  All that she has done is to repeat her many complaints about the merits of the decision made by the Tribunal and the prior decision makers  This is not a sufficient basis to ground an appeal in this Court from his Honour s decision  For these reasons  although I am satisfied that the applicant has explained the delay in making her application for an extension of time for leave to appeal  I am far from satisfied that she has any prospects of succeeding in any appeal that might be lodged were leave to be granted  In those circumstances  I propose to dismiss the application with costs  After I delivered the above reasons for judgment  the applicant became disconnected from the telephone link to the Court which she had enjoyed throughout the hearing  Perhaps she hung up  At about the time we lost communication  Mr Markus  who appears for the respondent  sought a lump sum costs order against the applicant in the amount of    The applicant has not had an opportunity to address that application  However  it seems to me that the costs order which I have made  if taxed  would result in a sum of money far in excess of   being awarded to the respondent  In those circumstances  and in order to avoid unnecessary waste of time  money and effort  I propose to accede to Mr Markus  application  I will amend the order for costs which I have made to add the words   assessed at    The orders of the Court are    That the application made by the applicant in her Notice of Motion filed on   September   for an order extending the time within which she might have leave to appeal from the decision and judgment of Emmett J delivered on   August   be dismissed    I order that the applicant pay the respondent s costs of and incidental to that application  assessed at      I certify that the preceding

view  identified the basis of the claim and proceeded to deal with the merits of the claim  beginning at   of its Reasons for Decision  In particular  the Tribunal referred to and relied upon a decision of Heerey J in this Court in Arcibal v Secretary Department of Family   Community Services     AAR     where his Honour discussed the meaning of the expression   extreme circumstances    His Honour referred to and relied upon the Oxford English Dictionary s definition of the word   extreme   ie  as meaning   presenting in the utmost degree some particular characteristic    His Honour held that the Tribunal was entitled to look at the whole of the circumstances in which an applicant leaves his or her home  when considering an application under s  JH a   In the case before his Honour  those circumstances included the provision of alternative accommodation during the period of absence  At   of its Reasons  the Tribunal said      While it was necessary for the Applicant to leave her home while the bathroom renovations were carried out  unsatisfactorily in her view  I do not accept that that was an extreme circumstance because     a  NSW Housing arranged for and paid for the alternative temporary accommodation at a hotel     b  The Applicant was given cabcharges to transport herself from home to the hotel and from the hotel back to home     c  The Applicant was not rendered homeless  and    d  During the renovations  the Applicant continued to receive disability support pension  DSP  appliedCroker v Philips Electronics Australia Limited   FCA  http www austlii

Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe question of the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal is to be decided in accordance with the well known judgment of D cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR   at      The test to be applied in most cases is two pronged  The Court must be satisfied that the decision in respect of which leave is sought is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court and that substantial injustice would result if leave were to be refused  supposing the decision to be wrong  The applicant has filed an affidavit in support of her Application  In that affidavit  she has referred to the fact that she suffers a number of mental illnesses  She has also referred to her dealings with an officer of the Court who works in the Registry  She mentioned both of these matters in order to explain the delay between the date when she should have filed her Leave Application and the date when she filed the Application with which I am presently dealing  The delay was a period of some two and a half to three weeks  I am of the view that the applicant has sufficiently addressed the question of delay and that the reasons which she has given provide a reasonable explanation for her failure to lodge her Application for Leave to Appeal within time  In her affidavit  the applicant also seeks to come to grips with the second part of the test articulated in D cor   FCR   that is to say  the prospects of her Application for Leave to Appeal  She asserts that the primary judge denied her procedural fairness  It seems that the basis of this assertion is that his Honour only allowed a very short time to the applicant to secure the services of a lawyer in order to assist her in arguing the application which she had brought before his Honour  The applicant did not provide further evidence in support of her assertion that she was denied procedural fairness  His Honour commenced the hearing of the application before him on   August   and adjourned that hearing to   August   in order to enable the applicant to secure the services of a lawyer  were she able to do so  In the events which happened  she was unable to do so  although she took advantage of the week s adjournment to furnish further materials to his Honour  There is nothing in the allegation that his Honour failed to accord procedural fairness to the applicant  The other group of matters relied upon by the applicant is to be found in the draft Notice of Appeal which she has annexed to her affidavit in support of the current application  It is extremely difficult to discern any particular point sought to be raised by the applicant by way of appeal  She asserts  both in the draft Notice of Appeal and in her oral submissions made today  that she has been dealt with unfairly  The gravamen of that complaint seems to be that the Tribunal made the wrong decision when it confirmed the Social Security Appeals Tribunal decision to reject the applicant s claim for a crisis payment  Doing the best I can with the text of the draft Notice of Appeal  I can see no other ground raised  The Tribunal had before it a claim for a crisis payment pursuant to s  JH of the Social Security Act   The ground for that claim was that the applicant had left  or could not return to  her home because of an extreme circumstance  The essential facts said to underpin that claim were not in dispute before the Tribunal  The Tribunal held that the applicant suffered from psychiatric conditions  including agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder  It noted that she receives a disability support pension and lives in accommodation provided by the New South Wales Department of Housing  On   June   the applicant had to leave her home and stay in temporary hotel accommodation that was provided and paid for by New South Wales Housing  whilst it had renovations carried out to the bathroom of her home  She returned to her home on   June    She made her claim for a crisis payment in respect of the period from   June   to   June   on account of the temporary move to which I have referred  During that period  she continued to receive her pension appliedDeighton v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhen dealing with such an
