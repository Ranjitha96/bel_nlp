Advanced Switching Services Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales t as Colonial State Bank   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAgar v Hyde   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Because of the transitional provisions introducing s  A into the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  the test in that section for summary dismissal of causes of action cannot be applied on the present application  For the purposes of determining fair arguability  rather  I must have regard to the line of authority exemplified in Sir Garfield Barwick CJ s judgment in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   particularly at      Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Agar v Hyde   HCA         CLR   at          The test to be applied has been expressed in various ways  but all of the verbal formulae which have been used are intended to describe a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome of the proceeding if it were to be allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way   I am satisfied on the material before me that there is a high degree of certainty this amendment would not be able to succeed as pleaded and ought not to be allowed to go to trial  Other factors which have induced me to come to this conclusion are as follow  The discussions that Mr Sukkar said occurred with the bank officers did not take place in circumstances where it might be expected  ordinarily  that reasonable persons in the position of the parties or Mr Sukkar himself would regard the bank as giving him financial advice  as opposed to simply putting forward the bank s position  even if that position were being put perhaps forcefully or determinedly   It is important to plead material facts in order to identify what is alleged will be the essential matters to be proved to establish a party s legal right to relief or resist the grant of relief to the opponent  Under the judicature system of pleading  such as is maintained in this Court  there is no necessity to assert or identify a legal category of action or suit which the facts asserted may illustrate  involve or demonstrate and on which the particular relief claimed is based or to which it is relevant  Agar v Hyde   CLR at        The essentiality of pleading the material facts  as opposed to even pleading a statute pursuant to which relief might be claimed  was emphasised recently in Agtrack  NT  Pty Ltd v Hatfield   HCA         CLR   at           per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ  and see also Air Link Pty Ltd v Paterson     CLR   at         discussedBrickfield Properties Ltd v Newton     WLR   As ASS pointed out  there are departures in that rule from similar  but differently worded  rules in other courts  But it has relied on a construction of O   r   based on what Sachs LJ said in Brickfield Properties Ltd v Newton     WLR   esp at         All ER   at      The approach which ASS urged in accordance with the approach of Sachs LJ in Brickfield     WLR       All ER   is that r   creates a plenary power to amend  However  Edmund Davies and Cross LJJ expressed considerable doubts about Sachs LJ s approach to the English rule  which was cast in somewhat similar terms to O   r    ASS said that the power ought not be read down by reference to the commencing words of the rule   Subject to the following provisions of this rule  discussedCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Finding     Qd R   On a number of occasions the courts have considered claims in which bankers have been sought to be made into fiduciaries of their customers  Recently  in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finding     Qd R   the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered a case in which a bank was in the position of being a mortgagee exercising power of sale as well as being financier of the purchaser  The Court held that no fiduciary duty to the incoming purchaser arose in the bank on the facts in that case  In coming to that conclusion they referred to a number of authorities in this Court  the High Court and elsewhere  They pointed out that in other cases where a relationship of a fiduciary nature between banker and customer arose  the bank had assumed the role of financial adviser  or perhaps had brought parties together  and the customer had placed complete faith and confidence in the adviser  as one would expect in a fiduciary relationship  In a passage quoted with approval by the Court of Appeal in Finding     Qd R at   Hill J had said in Golby v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     FCR   at      It is not a critical feature of a banker customer relationship that the banker undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of its customer in the exercise of some power or discretion affecting the interests of the customer in a legal or practical sense  Absent therefore some special feature  such as the giving of advice in Smith   FCR   there is no reason to erect a fiduciary relationship between bank and customer when that relationship is essentially one founded in contract   And as Davies and Pincus JJA with Derrington J pointed out in Finding     Qd R at       there was no evidence in that case of reliance upon the advice of the bank in relation to the transaction  nor was there evidence of the customers holding any expectation that the bank would disclose the relevant information or that it had assumed the role of adviser to the customers  Here the proposed amendment does not make any allegation of reliance by ASS upon the advice given by either Messrs Burrowes or Bingham in relation to interest rates  timing of finance or the quality of the terms proposed by the bank  In those circumstances  the proposed pleading does not reveal a cause of action that I regard as fairly arguable   I would also observe in passing that  unlike what had happened in the cases to which I have referred  much of what was pleaded as material which the bank ought to have disclosed suggested that  had disclosure been made  the proposition of dealing with Akyman would have appeared even better from ASS s point of view than it had on what ASS already knew  Although the bank had made its own internal estimates as to how profitable the business was likely to be  based on the sales projections which it had been given by Akyman  it is likely that much of that material had been already provided to ASS by the same source  Akyman  in one form or another  albeit it is possible that it may not have provided all of it  In any event  these observations do not affect the matter because  if there were a duty to disclose  the bank would have had to discharge its obligation to give a proper disclosure followedCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith     FCR   In Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith     FCR   at   Davies  Sheppard and Gummow JJ looked at a situation in which a bank was held to have entered into a fiduciary relationship with its customer  Their Honours noted that it was not a novel proposition  where a bank gave a customer advice upon financial affairs  that in addition to any contractual rights the customer may have  the relationship between the parties may be such as to found either a breach of a common law duty of care or a breach of a fiduciary duty  And they said that in many cases the bank as financier would have a manifest personal interest of its own in the matter   They said that the question then became one of ascertaining whether  given the apparent commercial self interest of the bank  it also could be taken to have assumed a fiduciary responsibility towards the customer in question  and emphasised that the context and factual settings were critical in that regard  Their Honours said that a bank could be expected to act in its own interests in ensuring the security of its position as a lender to its customer   Smith   FCR at            but it may have created in the customer the expectation that nevertheless it will advise in the customer s interests as to the wisdom of a proposed investment  This may be the case where the customer may fairly take it that to a significant extent his interest is consistent with that of the bank in financing the customer for a prudent business venture  In such a way the bank may become fiduciary and occupy the position of what Brennan J has called  an investment adviser  Daly v Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Their Honours went on to emphasise that the case before them was not one where one would properly describe the parties as acting in a commercial transaction at arm s length and each with the assistance of fully independent professional advice   Smith   FCR at     I am of opinion that the evidence before me on this application has every characteristic of a transaction of the latter description  This involved a business proposition that was being considered by ASS and its principals over a period  They had the assistance of fully independent professional advice from their solicitors  Bruce   Stewart  In his affidavits  Mr Sukkar noted disclosures that the bank and also Akyman had made  to some degree  at the times when Bruce   Stewart were advising first him and Mr Barrow and  later  ASS  There was also some further disclosure to ASS because its consent had to be given to the relationship agreement between the bank and Akyman citedGolby v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     FCR   On a number of occasions the courts have considered claims in which bankers have been sought to be made into fiduciaries of their customers  Recently  in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finding     Qd R   the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered a case in which a bank was in the position of being a mortgagee exercising power of sale as well as being financier of the purchaser  The Court held that no fiduciary duty to the incoming

of advice in Smith   FCR   there is no reason to erect a fiduciary relationship between bank and customer when that relationship is essentially one founded in contract  citedGray v New Augarita Porcupine Mines Ltd     DLR   The matters alleged to have been relevant for the bank to disclose  again  have features which suggest that much of this material could be taken to have been known to ASS or its principals during the course of the relationship  Of course  the mere fact that ASS had some knowledge is not an answer to a claim of breach of fiduciary duty  In order to discharge his or her duty the fiduciary must disclose fully and frankly the nature and extent of any conflict between his or her duty and or interest and the interest of the person to whom the fiduciary owes the duty  As Lord Radcliffe said in giving the advice of the Judicial Committee in Gray v New Augarita Porcupine Mines Ltd     DLR   at   of a director s duty to disclose to the company s board     The amount of detail required must depend in each case upon the nature of the contract or arrangement proposed and the context in which it arises  It can rarely be enough for a director to say  I must remind you that I am interested  and to leave it at that  unless there is some special provision in a company s articles that makes such a general warning sufficient  His declaration must make his colleagues  fully informed of the real state of things   see Imperial Mercantile Credit Ass n v Coleman   LR   HL   at p   per Lord Chelmsford   If it is material to their judgment that they should know not merely that he has an interest  but what it is and how far it goes  then he must see to it that they are informed  see Lord Cairns in the same case at p    citedMaguire v Makaronis   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  And  Brennan CJ  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Maguire v Makaronis   HCA         CLR   at    footnote omitted   which was approved by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say Dee Pty Ltd   HCA   at        What is required for a fully informed consent is a question of fact in all the circumstances of each case and there is no precise formula which will determine in all cases if fully informed consent has been given   The sufficiency of disclosure by a fiduciary can depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the person to whom it is made  so that it can truly be said that his or her consent is fully informed  That is a question of fact in all cases   Farah Constructions   HCA   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ   Because I am of opinion that no fiduciary obligation arose  it is irrelevant for me to consider the question of sufficiency of disclosure in the context of whether the proposed amendment is fairly arguable  cf  Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd  In Liq    HCA         CLR   at           per McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ  distinguishedMcGee v Yeomans     NSWLR   I am of opinion that the commencing words of r   which I have just quoted demonstrate that the power of the Court in r   in the ordinary and natural meaning of the rule  must be read as being constrained by matters referred to in the rest of O   r    These words make O   r   operate differently to rules such as those considered in cases like McGee v Yeomans     NSWLR   at  G where Glass JA observed that the general power of amendment under the New South Wales rules   Supreme Court Rules    NSW  Pt   r   was not made subject to the other parts of the same rule  and that another part of that rule  SCR Pt   r   expressly provided that those parts did not limit the general power to allow amendments under SCR Pt   r    cf  Charles Church Developments Ltd v Stent Foundations Ltd     WLR     That might not be the end of the argument because ASS also pointed to O   r    There is certainly also a plenary character to the grant of power in that rule  But it falls to be considered here  having regard to the question whether the interests of justice operate to allow the filling of a gap which would have the consequence of overcoming an expired limitation period  In that respect  the qualification in the commencing words of O   r   and other parts of the rule in O   r   are relevant  Order   r   subrr   to   deal expressly with applications to the Court for leave to make amendments        to correct mistakes in the name or identity of the party    to substitute one party for another where such a mistake needs correction    to alter the capacity in which a party is said to be suing  or    to add a new claim for relief or foundation in law for a claim for relief provided that it arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as those already pleaded to support an existing claim for relief by the party applying for the amendment   Each of those subrules and the framing of subr   in itself evince an intention to allow the correction of mistakes or the addition of a legal formulation of a claim for relief  but not to add previously omitted material facts necessary to complete the pleading of an existing cause of action  And subr   expressly provides that an amendment would not be permitted which would have an effect inconsistent with a statute of limitation in matters arising under subrr  b  and   followedQueensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The first question which needs to be determined  in the application to amend  is whether the proposed pleading raises a cause of action which is fairly arguable  I have taken this formulation from the reasons of Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      They said that if a matter were fairly arguable then  ordinarily  the party seeking to amend ought to be permitted to argue it  provided that any prejudice to the other side might be compensated by costs  Kirby J  in concurring  also pointed to other prejudices and considerations which may inform a proper exercise of the discretion to permit amendment   JL Holdings   CLR at       The first representation said to give rise to the expectation pleaded in paragraph  D came out of the conversation between Mr Burrowes of the bank and Mr Sukkar  Mr Burrowes said that it would be the quickest and best way to proceed  they would be the best rates that he would be able to give and that the application then being discussed would be the quickest way to procure finance   The second representation on which the expectation in paragraph  D was said to have been raised arose out of a conversation with Mr Bingham  The evidence before me is that he is no longer an officer of the bank  his whereabouts are not known and he was not previously considered to be a person who would be a witness in the proceedings  Mr Sukkar says that Mr Bingham told him over the telephone that the issue of interest rates was raised and Mr Bingham said that the rates then discussed would be the best that Mr Sukkar would be able to achieve  And  at a later time  he said that he wanted ASS  in effect  to proceed quickly in order for Mr Nicolau or Akyman to be satisfied that ASS could raise the funds and proceed with a letter of credit  Mr Bingham was also claimed to have said that they were the best interest rates he would be able to give to the applicants   In JL Holdings   CLR at     Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to considerations of case management as having a relevance  albeit that they should not in the ordinary course outweigh the ultimate need for the Court to do justice between the parties  Likewise  I am of opinion that part of the balance in which justice between the parties in the present application is to be viewed  is the fact that these proceedings have been on foot for six years and involve events that took place over   years ago  among other events  The allegations involve quite new claims and matters in the context of the existing pleadings and extensive affidavits  These related to conversations of which Mr Sukkar has been well aware at all times  since he was a party to them when they occurred  see too Jeans v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd     ALR   at     per Hill  Madgwick and Conti JJ    ASS submitted that some of the material in the documents newly discovered by the bank alerted those advising ASS to the possibility of this claim  But that is not a statement that anyone has made on oath nor has it been tested  I have been asked to infer that that is the case  An amendment of this significance  if granted  would require the bank to review the whole of its case and the way in which its relationship with ASS developed and proceeded in the first half of    I am not satisfied that this task could fairly be undertaken by the bank in a short time  This would mean that the bank would have to find and interview witnesses as well as to subpoena documents from others  It includes the possibility that it would have to find Mr Bingham  its former officer  if he is still able to give evidence and if he has any recollection of the events so long afterwards  It is not suggested by ASS that there are any bank manager s diary notes evidencing any of the three conversations relied on so that  at the moment  there is no contemporaneous record of the conversations upon which anyone can rely  It may be that the bank is able to do a search within its own records and discover those  but the evidence before me indicates that it is likely that in the ordinary course those documents that have not been the subject of discovery could have been destroyed by now  although no search  at the moment  has been undertaken  I have had regard to the possibility that new documents could be located   But even then it may be necessary to subpoena others  such as  for example  Bruce   Stewart  Again  I must have regard to the likelihood that documents which that firm had at the time may now have been destroyed  since some of the applicable limitation periods applying to its dealings with ASS and its principals have since expired  albeit that there is a potential for some causes of action to have remained  such as those depending on damage occurring quite some time after the transactions   All these matters suggest to me that there could be substantial delays in the further hearing of the matter with possibilities of real prejudice to the bank  Moreover  the evidence before me indicates the value of the bank s security is in the order of about     million less than its claimed debt  There is no evidence from ASS as to its current financial position or its ability to meet any such difference  In JL Holdings   CLR at   Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to the fact that if the case was fairly arguable then the party seeking the amendment should be permitted to pursue it      provided that any prejudice to  the other side  might be compensated by costs    On the evidence  before me  I am not satisfied that there is any real prospect of the bank being compensated by costs in this case were it ultimately to be successful  Indeed  I am satisfied that the bank is likely to suffer a substantial shortfall in the realisation of any security should it succeed in these and the related proceedings in enforcing those securities and recovering judgment against ASS and the guarantors of ASS  In those circumstances it would be an empty mantra for the Court to say simply that an order for costs would be sufficient  ASS s senior counsel indicated during argument that  if its application were granted  attempts would be made to provide evidence of its ability to pay or provide security for   in a manner satisfactory to the Court to secure the bank s costs thrown away  together with the value of the   days  interest on the outstanding moneys claimed by the bank  about     I am not satisfied that this security would compensate the bank against the prejudice an amendment would occasion  This is not merely because of the bank s loss of the opportunity to have a hearing that has now been fixed to commence this week for over six months  The prospect is that that hearing will be delayed further  In the meantime the shortfall in value of the bank s securities would be likely to increase  In the circumstances I am of opinion that the cause of action sought to be raised by the amendment is not sufficiently strong as to warrant the exercise of my discretion  balancing all the interests of the parties as best I can on the material before me  so as to conclude that it is in the interests of justice to allow the amendment   The second basis on which the application to amend has been contested is that ASS wishes to plead its reliance upon the six representations to which I have referred  The proposed pleading refers to a number of activities which ASS is said to have undertaken in reliance upon the six representations   There is a dispute between the parties as to whether or not the evidence currently filed supports or answers those aspects of reliance  But  it is accepted by ASS that other than two paragraphs in the amended statement of claim  no material facts are pleaded at present which would be sufficient as instances on which ASS could be found to have relied on any of the six representations  ASS pointed to pars   and   of the amended statement of claim  They alleged that  first  on   March   the bank proposed to ASS and Akyman that sales of the EFTPOS product cease until such time as particular identified problems with it were rectified  and  secondly  on   March   Akyman responded by telling the bank that its proposal would be addressed by an upgrade to the third release of the product  But those allegations appear to be ones involving activity by Akyman  not by ASS   Here  as ASS accepted at the outset of its argument  the facts pleaded in the amended statement of claim in respect of the six representations required an allegation of reliance in order to complete the essential elements of a cause of action under s    But  the pleading omitted any allegation that any of the six misrepresentations caused ASS to do or refrain from doing anything  cf  Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ  Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ   Accordingly  the facts pleaded in the current amended statement of claim do not disclose a basis upon which relief might be granted  Hence ASS seeks an amendment to assert the material facts in respect of its reliance   It follows that as the amended statement of claim currently stands  it does not plead  as ASS accepted  a cause of action under s   of the Act in respect of the six representations to which the new amendments are directed   If ASS were to attempt today to plead for the first time any such cause of action  it would be outside any applicable limitation period under s   of the Act  That provides that a cause of action under s   may be commenced at any time within six years after the day on which the cause of action that related to the conduct accrued  No suggestion was made in argument that the causes of action on each of the six representations had not accrued at least by some time in    This has had the consequence that if I do not grant this amendment  the causes of action cannot be retrieved   Of course there will be cases in which material facts have already been pleaded that demonstrate that a remedy not already sought should be allowed to be sought or that some expansion of the circumstances relied on as material facts may be permitted because they are  in substance  fairly pleaded already  But there are also considerations of policy behind the enactment of statutes of limitations  as the judgment of McHugh J in Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor   HCA         CLR   at     demonstrates with clarity  In a case like the present the effect of delay on the quality of justice may be seen to be an important factor in the legislative choice of the six year limitation period in s   of the Act   Here I think it is fairly safe to infer an oversight has occurred in the pleading of the amended statement of claim which the proposed amendment now seeks to rectify  In JL Holdings   CLR at         the Court was mindful that amendments to rectify such oversights ought ordinarily to be granted if they can be done without injustice to the other party  The question here is whether an injustice will be done by taking away from the bank the protection that the limitation period in s   may have given it against a cause of action incompletely alleged against it  The pleading of the causes of action based on each of the six representations in issue here  as currently on the record of the Court  will result in the action failing because of the absence of any allegation of the material fact of ASS s reliance   I am of opinion that permitting an amendment which would take away from a party a substantive defence granted by legislation  in circumstances where there is no direct procedural rule supporting the grant of an amendment  is capable of causing injustice within the concepts discussed in JL Holdings   HCA       CLR   and the cases to which that decision refers   However  ASS has relied on the provisions of O   r    That provides      General             Subject to the following provisions of this rule  the Court may  at any stage of any proceeding  order that any document in the proceeding be amended  or that any party have leave to amend any document in the proceeding  in either case in such manner as the Court thinks fit                    All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding  or of correcting any defect or error in any proceeding  or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings        Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in subrules     or   or paragraph    a  is made after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of commencement of the proceeding has expired  the Court may  nevertheless  grant such leave in the circumstances mentioned in that subrule if it thinks it is just to do so                    Where there has been a mistake in the name or identity of a party  an amendment to correct the name of the party may be made notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment is to substitute another person as a party        Where an order to correct a mistake in the name of a party has the effect of substituting another person as a party  the proceeding shall be taken to have commenced with respect to that person on the day the proceeding commenced        An amendment to alter the capacity in which a party sues may be made if the new capacity is one which that party had at the date of the commencement of the proceeding or has since acquired        An amendment may be made even if the effect of the amendment is to add a new claim for relief or foundation in law for a claim for relief  whether by way of substitution for an existing claim for relief or foundation in law or not  if the new claim for relief or foundation in law             a  arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as those already pleaded to support an existing claim for relief by the party applying for leave to make the amendment  or      b  subject to subrule   arises  in whole or in part  out of facts or matters that have occurred or arisen since the commencement of the proceeding              Subject to subrule   an amendment of a pleading may be made even if the amendment pleads a fact or matter that has occurred or arisen since the commencement of the proceeding        Paragraph    b  and subrule   do not permit an amendment that would have an effect inconsistent with any statute that limits the time within which an action or a proceeding of a particular kind may be brought or instituted  citedTruebit Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA    unreported   November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Queensland Court of Appeal also quoted with approval what Branson J had said in Truebit Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA   at p    Her Honour set out the following passage from Meagher RP  Gummow WMC and Lehane JRF  Equity  Doctrines and Remedies   rd ed  Butterworths    at pp     which read     The distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciary relationship is that its essence  or purpose  is to serve exclusively the interests of a person or group of persons  or  to put it negatively  it is a relationship in which the parties are not each free to pursue their separate interests    Her Honour then continued       There is thus an inconsistency between the notion of Westpac assuming a fiduciary duty to the applicants in respect of its treatment of their application for finance and the maintenance of Westpac s  own commercial self interest as lender   Moreover  there is a commercial  and possibly conceptual  unreality surrounding the contention that Westpac was entitled to consider the applicants  application for finance both in the applicants  interest and in Westpac s own interest as the proposed lender to the applicants  but not in Westpac s interest as the mortgagee lender exercising through a receiver the power of sale in respect of  the property
