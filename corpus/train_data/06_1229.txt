Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Heydon JJ held that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error where the tribunal had reached a decision to refuse a visa to an applicant and had said that it had given no weight to a confidential letter  The visa applicant was ignorant of the existence of the letter which contained credible  relevant and significant material which was adverse to the visa applicant  Their Honours said       It follows that asking whether  despite what was said in its reasons  the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry  The relevant inquiry is  what procedures should have been followed  The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decision maker have made

cases cth HCA  htmlIn Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Mason J noted that the Court should proceed with caution in cases where it was suggested that a decision maker had erred by giving too much or too little weight to particular considerations      lest it exceed its supervisory role by reviewing the decision on its merits   He said that a close analogy existed between the judicial review of administrative action and appellate review of a judicial discretion  He pointed to the fact that in cases of the latter kind appellate courts could review discretionary judgments that had failed to give proper weight to a particular matter  but were slow to do so because the mere preference for a different result was not sufficient to disturb the exercise of the discretion by the judge at first instance   CLR at   appliedAustralian Communist Party v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhen a court

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlAlthough the particular document containing the policy was not part of the appeal papers or before the trial judge  during the course of argument before me  two documents were produced  One was headed  About Visa   and I was informed by counsel for the Minister that its provisions applied as the policy at the time at which the appellant made his original application for a visa  Unhelpfully  it did not set out criteria for the purposes of assessing whether cl     should be interpreted in any particular way  but  simply referred to another policy for those criteria  The policy in effect for the period   May   to   June   being the period in which the Tribunal s decision was given  was also produced  It set out  in par     criteria  for the purposes of cl     materially identical to those the subject of consideration by a Full Court of this Court in Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at         The terms of par     of the policy were            The policy intention of this criterion overall is to establish whether the applicant has the ability to manage and operate a main business successfully      Under policy  it requires  sic  the applicant to demonstrate that               they have exercised responsibility within the main business es  in terms of decision making authority  responsibility for employees and or responsibility for expenditure        such responsibility has been exercised on a continuous  as opposed to on an occasional basis  and       their skills have been fundamental to  or have exerted direct influence on  the operation of the main business es               The success  or otherwise  of the business es  is not a relevant factor in assessing this criterion  Rather  if an applicant satisfies this criterion in respect of a failed or declining business  this should be considered in assessing whether the applicant  has overall had a successful business career   The Full Court held  following a concession by the Minister  that the requirements of the identically worded policy did not correspond to the requirements of the Regulations  The court said   FCR at     that           the departmental policy     was narrower than the criterion for a subclass   visa set out in cl          The criterion requires satisfaction on the part of the Minister that the applicant for the visa as owner of and interested in a main business  maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business or in those businesses from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business or those businesses   This did not import a requirement that could only be satisfied by demonstrating the exercise of responsibility within the business in terms of decision making authority  responsibility for employees  and or responsibility for expenditure  There is a variety of ways in which a person might maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of a business and in making decisions affecting its overall direction and performance    emphasis added The trial judge adopted the submission of the Minister that the Tribunal s approach to this issue was not a misconstruction of the requirements of a statutory criterion for the granting of a visa by applying a policy which was narrower than the criterion in cl     in contrast to Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    Rather  his Honour  in adopting the Minister s submission  found that it was clear from the Tribunal s decision that it had applied the very words of the enactment  in the passages at     to which I have referred  and that the case was no more than a merits review  as opposed to an error going to jurisdiction  I do not agree  The Tribunal s obligation was to conduct a review of the decision of the delegate  s    In performing that review it had power to exercise all of the powers and discretions that were conferred by the Act on the person who made the decision  s    And  having made a decision  the Tribunal was obliged to prepare a written statement under s   which set out          the decision of the Tribunal on review    its reasons for that decision    the findings on any material questions of fact  and    references to the evidence or any other material on which those findings of fact were based  I am of opinion that the Tribunal did not  in its reasons for decision  set out the evidence or any other material on which the ultimate findings of fact to which it came in relation to cl     were based  There was nothing in the findings or other material set out in its reasons that enabled it to come to the conclusion that it could not be satisfied on the issue of the appellant s involvement in the business  The Tribunal expressly said that it had considered policy in arriving at its lack of satisfaction that the appellant had met the criteria of cl      Here  the Tribunal appears to have been misled by its reliance on the unlawful constriction which par     of the policy sought to put on the proper interpretation of cl     as held in Lobo v Minister   FCAFC         FCR    As their Honours held  a want of satisfaction of the criteria set out in the policy would not equate to a want of satisfaction of the criterion in cl      And an assessment by the Tribunal in which  as it said  it was required to have regard to that policy and apply it unless there were cogent reasons for departing from it  involves jurisdictional error because the Tribunal applied the policy rather than the criteria in cl       FCR at        The Tribunal made an error of law in that it did not correctly understand and apply the criteria in cl      Nor did it give any reasons for its conclusion in that regard  Each was a failure to conduct that part of the review in accordance with law  being a requirement to decide whether or not the appellant met the criteria for cl      And  this was also a jurisdictional error   Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     FCR at        The second argument related to whether or not the appellant met the requirements of Pt   of Schedule   of the Regulations for the purposes of cl      Under that clause a notice in the Gazette can establish the number of points required for the  business skills points test  to be satisfied  The notice  for present purposes  required   points  It is not in issue that the appellant was entitled to   points by reason if his age  being between   and   years  and was entitled to   points because the business with which he was involved  in the   months immediately preceding the making of his application  met the criteria specified  in Div     of Schedule   in cl    Accordingly  he had   points from those two criteria  He needed another   points to satisfy the test in the notice in the Gazette  The Tribunal assessed appellant as being of limited ability in English and gave him   points for that item  It then found that it was not satisfied with the estimates of value which the appellant had given for his assets and was not satisfied he had net assets of more than     million at the hearing  but was satisfied of him having at least   worth  Accordingly it gave him   points for that item  He was thus   points short of what he needed to meet the points test appliedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

per Gummow J        per Callinan J  the distinction between a decision which the court finds no reasonable decision maker could have come to and one which the court considers simply to be unreasonable

for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThis raises a tension between a consideration of the way in which a court must assess the impact of a jurisdictional error that is found and its bearing on the overall decision  In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang   HCA         CLR   at       Gummow and Hayne JJ said that           to attempt to divorce the Tribunal s statement of its findings on what it considered to be a material question of fact  from the decision it made and  in particular  from its reasons  may be dangerous in cases like the present where it is accepted that the Tribunal made an error of law  There are several reasons why it may be a dangerous process  First  there is the notorious difficulty of disentangling findings of fact from conclusions about applicable legal principle  Secondly  assuming that those difficulties can be surmounted  the findings of fact which the Tribunal makes after hearing and assessing the body of material and submissions will necessarily reflect the Tribunal s conclusions about applicable legal principle and will be directed to the questions that those principles present      Their Honours went on to say     If  in that review  the Tribunal makes an error of law and a subsequent review is ordered  what is the Tribunal then to do if the further findings are to be made about subjects with which the first Tribunal dealt  For it to take  as its starting point  findings that were made on that earlier review under a misapprehension of applicable legal principles  may  indeed often would  skew the second factual inquiry by the Tribunal  Their Honours then noted that by contrast  if no more findings needed to be made on the second review because only one conclusion was lawfully open to the Tribunal on the findings that it made at the first  the difficulties to which they had referred would be much reduced  if not eliminated  The Tribunal s function here  as the Minister pointed out  involved consideration of the situation at two points of time for certain matters  Under cll     and     some criteria  such as those under cl     had to be satisfied at the times of both the application and the decision  Additionally  under cl     further criteria had to be satisfied at the time of the decision  Under cl    b ii  the appellant s score on the business skills points test is calculated as the sum of his scores  for present purposes  at the time when the application for the visa was made  Under cl    c  certain assets only are to be valued or assessed for value in determining whether an applicant meets the points criteria under Pt   of Schedule   of the Regulations  see items      I am of opinion that when a matter is remitted  under Div   Pt   of the Act  to the Tribunal for further hearing and determination according to law  similar reasoning applies  The way in which that review is undertaken is similar to the task of the Refugee Review Tribunal in like circumstances see  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang   HCA         CLR   and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC    see esp at      The fact that the appellant had not satisfied the points test in each criterion in a decision which is set aside would be a matter that the Tribunal could take into account  if it had to complete its review  although it would be able to review the question afresh  as Gummow and Hayne JJ pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang

decision making  of its nature  involves the formation of value judgments as to such matters as credibility  the strength or compellingness of the particular case  the importance of consistency in decision making and the simple formation of the relevant opinion which the statute prescribes as the occasion for the exercise of the power  Thus  s   of the Act requires the Minister  as the decision maker  to be satisfied of particular matters if she is to grant a visa  Value judgments are ones in respect of which there is room for reasonable differences of opinion  no particular opinion being

repository of the power might exercise it  that exercise of power is supported by the statute which conferred it  whether the discretion be judicial or administrative in nature  Brennan J went on to point out that appellate courts were more familiar with the usual confines within which judicial discretions might be exercised and were therefore more sensitive to an unreasonable exercise of such a discretion and more confident of their ability to detect error in its exercise  He said       It is harder to be satisfied that an administrative body has acted unreasonably  particularly when the

au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Minister relied on remarks of McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA         ALJR    and in particular I apprehend at         and         that in effect the Tribunal in stating its reasons for decision was entitled to make findings of fact and was not required to go through line by line each item of evidence  or each relevant matter and deal with it in turn  accepting or dismissing it  So much may be accepted  The Minister also argued that the decision required under s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act  was whether or not the Tribunal  standing in the shoes of the Minister as the decision maker  was satisfied of the matters set out in the Regulations for the purposes of granting the visa for which the appellant applied  She contended that findings along the way were not ones which went to jurisdiction  I am of opinion that it was not open to the Tribunal  on the basis only of the findings it set out  to find that a person in a single business that consists of running one retail trading shop who makes decisions daily about placing orders and pricing of goods offered for sale  and had done so for over one year prior to his application without any suggestion of supervision or control  did not have direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business from day to day or in making decisions that affect the overall direction and performance of that business  The Tribunal did not express any finding or reason for that ultimate conclusion  except that it did not find the evidence compelling  As McHugh J pointed out  in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Durairajasingham   HCA         ALJR   at     the requirements of s   are that the Tribunal give a written but not lengthy explanation of the decision already made  I am of opinion that there was an absence of any reason  factual finding or reference to facts expressed in the Tribunal s reasons that could show that a person who had the duties and performed the functions of the appellant in the business during the period which the Tribunal was considering  namely the year prior to his visa application being lodged  did not satisfy the criteria of cl      Having regard to the Tribunal s expressed findings and reasons  its decision on this issue was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could have come to it on the basis expressed in those findings and reasons  That is not to say that another tribunal could not come to the same decision  but if it did so it would have to apply the law correctly  make findings and give reasons which were capable of supporting the decision  I can see no error of approach in the way that the Tribunal dealt with this matter  It was entitled to form a view as to whether or not what had been put to it by the appellant satisfied it as to the value of his assets  This was  as McHugh J said in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Durairajasingham     ALJR at     a finding on  inter alia  credibility or establishment of facts which was the function of a primary decision maker par excellence  I do not consider that the Tribunal has been shown to have erred or not performed its function of review of the application in this respect  The question arises of how the matter ought then be resolved  The Minister has raised an issue of some difficulty  She says that the Tribunal may have erred in the way in which I have found  but that nonetheless even if one accepts that result  the application would be rejected on reconsideration by the Tribunal  That is because  even if the Tribunal formed a more favourable view on  first  the issue under cl     and then  secondly  on the language issue and awarded the appellant   more points  he would still be   points short of the   required to satisfy the points appliedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Ex parte

Ex parte Palme   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Heydon JJ  appliedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at                 McHugh and Hayne JJ respectively considered whether and to what extent the court could withhold relief in cases where the jurisdictional error had been established  The decision to issue to constitutional writs or a writ of certiorari is  of course  discretionary  McHugh J pointed out  as the Minister put in her submissions  that discretionary relief may be refused if an applicant has in fact suffered no injustice because  for example  the statutory regime compelled a particular outcome   ALR at      I am of opinion that there was some relationship between the Tribunal s findings about the appellant s degree of involvement in the business and his language skills  In particular the Tribunal referred to the difficulties he had in the interview with the Department  which was conducted without an interpreter  in considering both the issues under cl     and the language component of the points test  The Tribunal found that the appellant did not demonstrate to it that he understood and spoke English at a level which would have allowed him to understand questions in English  and therefore accepted that he had difficulties in understanding questions asked of him at the Departmental interview   As the trial judge observed      the issue was not dealt with as clearly as one might like  in the reasons of the Tribunal even though there was no jurisdictional error established on this point  In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at     Hayne J  with whom Kirby J agreed  referred with approval to what Gaudron J had said in Enfield City Corporation v Development Assessment Commission   HCA         CLR   at     that           the courts should provide whatever remedies are available and appropriate to ensure that those possessed of executive and administrative powers exercise them only in accordance with the laws which govern their exercise  The rule of law requires no less  The Minister does not rely on any delay  waiver or acquiescence or other conduct disentitling the appellant to relief  The sole question is whether the finding by the Tribunal that the appellant had not satisfied it as to the points test is such as mandates that any reconsideration by the Tribunal must result in the same ultimate decision to affirm the decision not to grant the visa  I am of opinion that the Tribunal s findings on the points test issues are part of the merits which it can revisit or not as it sees appropriate  if it is ordered to conduct the review according to law  It would be for the Tribunal to make its own decision as to whether or not it was satisfied as to any such matters on a review  albeit that it may well feel that it does not wish to revisit the matter  Alternatively  it may feel that  having regard to the jurisdictional error that has been found  it ought to do so  The Court cannot compel the Tribunal to adhere in the future to any particular state of satisfaction which it expressed previously in its reasons  I am not satisfied that the appellant has suffered no injustice   SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR at             having regard to the jurisdictional error I have found and to the fact that on reconsideration he may be able to satisfy the Tribunal conducting the review in accordance with law of the matters which it had previously not been satisfied about under the points test  I am not confident that the jurisdictional error I have found could have had no bearing on the outcome and thus I should not refuse relief  Stead v State Government Insurance

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at         Allsop J   with whom Weinberg J agreed on this point at   FCR     considered the consequences of failure to comply with the operation of s  A of the Act  He held that if it could be shown that there was a basis for the Tribunal s decision which could be seen to be entirely independent of a failure to follow the requirements of procedural fairness mandated by s  A   then by analogy with the reasons of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal Ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   at           and  in particular at     the court could withhold constitutional or prerogative writ relief in the exercise of its discretion appliedSZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe question of how the review  if one is ordered  is to be further conducted  would be a matter for a member constituting the Tribunal for the purposes of that review  In a similar context  a Full Court of this court recently considered  when a matter was remitted by the court  what the Refugee Review Tribunal was required to do when further conducting the review  and whether it was obliged to start afresh or was entitled to take account of what had already been looked at by the Tribunal  differently constituted on the earlier occasion  whose decision had been set aside by a consent order made by the court  SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC    I am of opinion that when a matter is remitted  under Div   Pt   of the Act  to the Tribunal for further hearing and determination according to law  similar reasoning applies  The way in which that review is undertaken is similar to the task of the Refugee Review Tribunal in like circumstances see  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang   HCA         CLR   and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC    see esp at
