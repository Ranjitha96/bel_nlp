EMAS Offshore Pte Ltd v The Ship  APC Aussie     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedPort of Geelong Authority v The  Bass Reefer    FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhere a demise charter had been terminated before the plaintiff applied to amend to an existing writ  Foster J said in Port of Geelong Authority v The  Bass Reefer    FCA         FCR   at   that  as a matter of discretion  he would not allow an amendment where some items covered by the requested amendment might arguably be maritime claims but others not  He adverted to difficulties that obviously might arise if the writ were to be amended at that time after the charterer had ceased to be a relevant person  Like his Honour  I have difficulty in seeing that the grant of the requested amendment would be just or appropriate in all the circumstances  see too r   of the Admiralty Rules   I am of opinion that  as a matter of my discretion  I should not allow this amendment  so as to permit this claim to be made in this way at this time  The claim is  in effect  against the property of the owner of the vessel  APC Marine  when the owner will not be able to have recourse  in the circumstances  to its current demise charterer because T D has ceased to have any connection with the vessel  In addition  although I do not express these views for the purposes of my decision  it is desirable to say that in my view s   of the Act does not appear to me  at the moment  to support the present claim  That section contemplates that when an action in rem is commenced the  or a  maritime claim will be connected temporally by the coincidence of possession of a demise charterer who is liable and the cause of action asserted as a  or part of a  maritime claim  I will assume for the moment that EMAS  claim for indemnity  is a maritime claim under s  j  or  m  in respect of towage of the barge or a claim in respect of goods  materials or services supplied to it for its operation or maintenance  i e  necessaries   However  each of those categories is a matter about which there is a considerable amount of learning and which may or may not be correct in respect of the present proceedings discussedTisand Pty Limited v The Owners of the Ship MV  Cape Moreton   Ex Freya    FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Tisand Pty Limited v The Owners of the Ship MV  Cape Moreton   Ex Freya    FCAFC         FCR   Ryan and Allsop JJ  particularly at         engaged in a substantial and learned discussion of the importance of identifying persons with a proprietary interest as owner or demise charterer in arrest proceedings  albeit that they concentrated on the question of ownership  They said that in ss       and   of the Act  the phrase  the owner  was used in a proprietary sense  reflecting the clear purpose of the Act to require that the property proposed to be arrested belong to the relevant person  The  Cape Moreton    FCR at      Here  that approach must be adapted to the special provisions of s   in relation to a demise charterer being the relevant person  At the time of the arrest of the  APC Aussie     T D was the relevant person  as the existing demise charterer  T D was the contracting party with EMAS under the charter for her towage  But  at the present time T D is not capable of being a relevant person in respect of the barge because the demise charter has been terminated and APC Marine  as owner  has retaken possession  T D now has no proprietary interest in the barge  yet EMAS is seeking to extend the ambit of the security for which the arrest was obtained to a cause of action not previously contemplated in either the writ or the amended writ  If granted  the amendment would have the effect of greatly expanding the amount of security that EMAS could require for release of the   APC Aussie     before its owner would be able to exercise its proprietary rights  even though the new claim involves no direct relationship between EMAS and APC Marine  There may be occasions  that were not suggested during the hearing  in which it is possible to argue that such an amendment could be appropriate  It is for that reason that I do not wish to express a final view on this question and instead have exercised my discretion to refuse the application to amend  The reality is that EMAS seeks to utilise the earlier arrest of the barge  to bring pressure on APC Marine well after EMAS became aware of the existence of APC Marine s Singaporean writ and in circumstances in which EMAS has delayed making the application to amend until after the intervening event of APC Marine s termination of its charterparty with T D followedShell Oil Company v The Ship  Lastrigoni    HCA         CLR
