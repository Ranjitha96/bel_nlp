SZLJM v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRaikua v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Magistrate has referred to what his Honour described as   a long line of authority   addressing the jurisdiction to undertake the review then being urged upon that Court and correctly concluded that   the applicant has no arguable case for establishing jurisdiction in relation to the relief sought in this matter    Included among those authorities was the review of the authorities undertaken by Lindgren J in Raikua v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA       FCR     In Raikua   review was sought of both the failure of the Minister to exercise the power conferred by s   of the Migration Act    Cth  and the decision of the Manager of the Ministerial Interventions Unit  Ms Connolly  not to bring Ms Raikua s subsequent s   application to the attention of the Minister  Ms Connolly had made that decision because she had formed the view that the subsequent application fell within Guidelines which had been issued in respect to the exercise of the power  Lindgren J analysed the position as follows      The Minister could have decided not to consider any requests for the exercise of his power under s   for a specified period of time  and that decision would not have been subject to review  In the present case  his decision not to consider exercising that power was of a more limited kind  It is plain that the Minister s intention  as expressed in his note of   August   relating specifically to this case  and in paras       and       of Guidelines MSI   was to decide not to consider exercising the power in the case of any request where the criteria of  unique or exceptional circumstances  were not met  in the opinion of the assessing officer   his note of   August   or where it  appears  or is  found   to or by the relevant officer   respectively Guidelines MSI   paras       and       that they are not met     The Minister s decision not to consider exercising his power under s   in the particular case of the applicants comprises his decision just referred to operating upon the subjective judgment formed by Ms Connolly  There is no suggestion in the evidence that the Minister intended anything other than that provided the officer in good faith formed the view that the  unique or  exceptional circumstances  criterion was not met  the Minister did not wish to consider exercising his s   power  The applicants do not suggest that Ms Connolly did not act in good faith     Ms Connolly s decision is not something provided for by the Act  and does not itself affect legal rights  cf Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond     CLR   at      The decision of Ms Connolly is not susceptible to judicial review  The only decision that might conceivably be susceptible to judicial review is that of the Minister  However  it was permissible for the Minister take the decision not to consider exercising his power under s   by laying down guidelines as to the classes of case that were not to be referred to him   Bedlington v Chong     FCR         and because of s   the jurisdiction denying provisions  whether found in the former s   or in the present ss     and     and  A a  cannot be avoided in relation to the Minister s decision by resort to the notion of jurisdictional error   There is considered to be no relevant distinction between the facts of the present case and the facts before Lindgren J  No reason has been shown to reach any different conclusion to that reached by His Honour  His Honour s conclusion  with respect  is considered to be manifestly correct   Nothing is gained by a further review of either the provisions of ss       or   of the Migration Act    Cth  or the authorities followedSZFDZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Lacking in substance is an attempt to draw a distinction founded upon a factual contention that in the circumstances of the present case a Departmental officer intervened to   prohibit the possible exercise of the power by the Minister    In SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   Moore J concluded that a like application for leave should be refused and reached that conclusion   regardless of whether the request was forwarded to the Minister    His Honour observed      The Minister submitted that the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed with costs because there were no reasonable prospects of success  First  the Federal Magistrate was clearly correct in concluding that there was no jurisdiction to review the Minister s decision for the reasons accepted by the Federal Magistrate  This was so regardless of whether the request was referred to the Minister for her personal consideration  and regardless of whether the delegate s decision was affected by jurisdictional error  notwithstanding there was no evidence at all to support such an assertion  Secondly  as was clear from s   of the Act  the Minister had no duty to consider the power under s   and therefore relief could not have been granted in the Court below even if there had been jurisdiction to consider the application   An application for special leave to appeal from His Honour s decision has been dismissed  SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   HCA Trans   citedSZFDZ v
