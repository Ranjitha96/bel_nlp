McIver v Healey   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedGibbs v Mayor  Councillors and Citizens of City of Altona   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Under s   of the Act   and s   of the Act as it stood prior to   March   where multiple breaches of an award provision arose out of a course of conduct by one person  those breaches  for the purposes of the section  constitute one breach  In Gibbs v Mayor  Councillors and Citizens of City of Altona   FCA         FCR   at   Gray J held that each separate obligation found in an award should be regarded as a term for the purposes of s    The same would now apply to s    Gray J went on to say at     The ascertainment of what is a term should not depend on matters of form  such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award  but on matters of substance  namely the different obligations which can be spelt out   His Honour then said that he considered each separate obligation imposed by an award to be a  term  for the purposes of s    Importantly  he then said at     If the different terms impose cumulative obligations or obligations that substantially overlap  it is possible to take into account the substance of the matter by imposing no penalty  or a nominal penalty  in respect of breaches of some terms  but a substantial penalty in respect of others   I agree  with respect  with the approach of Gray J to the question of  course of conduct  under s   and the former s    Tracey J applied the same approach in Kelly v Fitzpatrick     IR   at    I therefore reject the submission of counsel for Mrs Healey  Mr Green  that there was one single course of conduct which was constituted by Mrs Healey paying a flat rate of pay to her employees instead of the award rate plus loadings and allowances   In accordance with the approach of Gray J in Gibbs   I consider it appropriate to examine the circumstances of each relevant employee and assess an appropriate penalty for each breach  This may mean that in many instances no penalty will be imposed for breaches   Apart from Mr Whitton and Ms Jodi Buck  Mrs Healey employed the affected employees on a flat casual rate in breach of the award  In each of those   cases the critical offending conduct was the setting of a rate below the award rate  The failure to pay appropriate loadings and allowances flowed from the setting of the incorrect rates of pay for the relevant classifications  The   figure referred to above should apply to the maximum penalty available for all breaches of cl   of the award which is applicable  as at their commencement date  to all but seven employees  Those seven commenced as juniors  Clause       was breached in respect of them  In other words  depending on the time of commencement of the employee a fine of   of the maximum should be imposed   times  In seven of those cases the relevant breach will be that of cl       because seven of the   employees commenced as junior employees   The total penalties for breaches of cls        in respect of juniors  and    in respect of adults  amount to    Putting to one side the non payment of Ms Jodi Buck  the major transgression was the setting of a flat rate for all purposes for every employee  except Mr Whitton  Even Mr Whitton was not paid the amount due under the award  Accordingly  seven penalties will be imposed for breach of cl       and   for breach of cl    The failure to pay the correct casual loadings and allowances in breach of cl       involved Mrs Healey in a failure to comply with obligations which  substantially overlap   in the words of Gray J in Gibbs at   with the obligation to set the appropriate adult or junior rate for the relevant classification as required by cls       and    Consequently  I impose no penalty for breaches of cl       of the award  I also impose no penalties for additional breaches of cls       and   in respect of payments made to employees in the weeks subsequent to the commencement referred toKelly v Fitzpatrick     IR   I agree  with respect  with the approach of Gray J to the question of  course of conduct  under s   and the former s    Tracey J applied the same approach in Kelly v Fitzpatrick     IR   at    I therefore reject the submission of counsel for Mrs Healey  Mr Green  that there was one single course of conduct which was constituted by Mrs Healey paying a flat rate of pay to her employees instead of the award rate plus loadings and allowances   As set out by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick at     prior to   August   the maximum penalty for breach of s   was   for an individual  Since that time it has been   for breach of s   and  on and after   March   s     The following   former employees of Mrs Healey commenced employment with her prior to   August     Hannah Bereznicki  junior on commencement    Luke Buck    Sandra Buck    John de Little    Rebecca Denton    George

  Stephanie Semmens    Luke Sorrentino    James Stoessiger    Drew Underwood  and     Sian Williams  junior on commencement    The balance commenced after   August    Three of them commenced as

Having determined an appropriate level of penalty for each of the contraventions of the award  I must now look at the aggregate of those penalties   to form a view whether that figure is out of proportion to the overall conduct of Mrs Healey  see Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary Smith   FCAFC   at   per Gray J  This exercise may also be described as did Graham J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at   as ensuring that the figure provides an appropriate response to the conduct which led to their breaches      The application of the totality principle does not mean that the figure arrived at before its consideration must be reduced  However  the Court must engage in what Gray J described in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at   as an  instinctive synthesis  and arrive at a figure which Graham J said at   should be  just and appropriate    The conduct which led to the breaches occurred over seven years  The only evidence before the Court to explain it is found in the agreed statement of facts at paragraphs   and   where reference is made to OWS receiving a complaint from Ms Tracey Pearce  At paragraph   the following is said    In her claim to OWS  Ms Pearce stated that during the course of her employment at the Theatre Royal Hotel  she was paid pursuant to wage rates contained in a purported AWA  and as a consequence believed that she had not been paid her correct rate of pay    It is open to be inferred that  at least in the case of Ms Pearce  Mrs Healey attempted to apply an AWA which was inoperative for some reason relating to lack of compliance with legislative provisions concerning AWAs  There is no other evidence with respect to AWAs in which Mrs Healey is the employer  Even if the rates set were struck in accordance with incomplete AWAs  there is no evidence that any employee agreed to their terms  In any event  this does not explain other strange features of this matter such as the non payment of Ms Jodi Buck  the downward adjustments in the rate applicable to Ms Hodgson and the attempt to give some loading to the rate of Mr Whitton but to no one else
