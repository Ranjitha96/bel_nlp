www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSection   of the Veterans  Entitlements Act    Cth   the Act  renders the Commonwealth liable to pay pension to a veteran who is incapacitated by a war caused injury or a war caused disease  The circumstances in which an injury or disease is taken to be war caused are set out in s   of the Act  So far as relevant to the present case those circumstances are where the injury or disease resulted from an occurrence that happened while the veteran was rendering operational service  s  a  or where the injury or disease arose out of or was attributable to any eligible war service  which includes operational service  rendered by the veteran  s  b   Whether a veteran is suffering from an injury or disease  and the diagnosis of that injury or disease  is to be determined to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision maker  s    Where  as in the present case  a claim relates to operational service  the standard of proof on whether an injury or disease is war caused is prescribed by s   and    The question posed by s   is whether  the whole of the material  before the decision maker raises a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury or disease with the circumstances of the veteran s service  Section   is affected by s  A   which provides that a hypothesis connecting a person s injury or disease with the circumstances of any particular service is reasonable only if there is in force a Statement of Principles  SoP  that upholds the hypothesis  A hypothesis raised by the material will be reasonable only if it is consistent with  or fits the template of  the SoP  Repatriation Commission v Deledio   FCA         FCR   at    At the time of the respondent s decision there was in force SoP Instrument No   of   concerning depressive disorder  Clause   of the SoP states that there is sound medical scientific evidence that depressive disorder can be related to relevant service rendered by veterans  Clause   states that at least one of the factors set out in clause   must be related to any relevant service rendered by the veteran  Clause   lists the factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting depressive disorder with the circumstances of a veteran s service  The only factor of present relevance is factor  b      experiencing a severe psychosocial stressor or stressors within the two years immediately before the clinical onset of depressive disorder       The expression  severe psychosocial stressor  is defined as      an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual  for example  being shot at  death or serious injury of a close friend or relative  assault  including sexual assault  severe illness or injury  experiencing a loss such as divorce or separation  loss of employment  major financial problems or legal problems  The Tribunal found that the appellant served in the Royal Australian Navy from   July   to   June   and that his two trips to Vietnam on HMAS Sydney from   November   to   December   and from   February   to   March   were operational service  It was common ground that the appellant had a depressive disorder  The Tribunal described the hypothesis relied on by the appellant as follows      the condition was war caused by the chronic sea sickness experienced during his operational service  with a resulting social isolation and depression at the possibility of being unable to serve at sea       The Tribunal identified the factor relied on as that in clause  b  of the SoP citedRepatriation Commission v Yates   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlHis Honour also held that the recurrence of the symptoms was      not an aggravation of the condition  A temporary presence of symptoms is not sufficient to show an aggravation within the meaning of the Act       In this connection his Honour relied on the observations of Lindgren J in Repatriation Commission v Yates   FCA         ALD   at    The appellant s third complaint that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider the hypothesis that the appellant s seasickness caused his depression was also dismissed  The Magistrate referred to the Tribunal s finding  recorded at   above  that the hypothesis of depression arising from severe seasickness was reasonable under the terms of clause  b  of the SoP  and to the first two sentences of the passage quoted at   and continued      Thus while it is true  as Mr Cunningham asserts  that paragraph   of the Tribunal s reasons for decision rolls three independent hypotheses into one  the extract I have detailed shows that the Tribunal in fact did expressly consider the hypothesis that the seasickness caused the depression simpliciter  His Honour then observed that it was  scarcely surprising  that the Tribunal had to an extent rolled three hypotheses into one  having regard to the way in which the case had been conducted  both in evidence and in submissions  He gave some examples at   to   and concluded      the issue of the seasickness in the evidence before the Tribunal was intimately interrelated with the concerns of Mr Cunningham right from the inception of his more severe seasickness both that it caused social isolation and or that it  led  him to be concerned about his future in the Navy          Given that this is so it does not seem to me that the Tribunal can be overly criticised for approaching the matter in the way that it did  The fact that it did so in large part followed the Appellant s evidence and to an extent the submissions made by counsel on his behalf          Thus the finding by the Tribunal that  constitutional predisposition was the cause of the seasickness and the subsequent depression on the realisation that his long held ambition to be a sea going sailor was not to be achieved  was in my view open to the Tribunal on the materials and does not constitute an error of law  His Honour noted that in view of his dismissal of all three complaints  he did not need to deal with the respondent s submission that the appeal was incompetent  This issue is dealt with in the ensuing paragraphs  The appellant commenced his proceeding in this Court  Section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   the AAT Act  provides      A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia  on a question of law  from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding       Order   of the Federal Court Rules regulates the practice and procedure to be followed in respect of appeals from the Tribunal  Rule   requires that the notice of appeal state  among other things       b  the question or questions of law to be raised on the appeal   c  the order sought  and   d  briefly  but specifically  the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought  The proceeding was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to s  AA of the AAT Act  Section  AA  confers jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to hear and determine transferred appeals  Subsection   provides that s     and   apply in relation to the hearing and determination of a transferred appeal in a corresponding way to that in which they apply to the hearing and determination of an appeal to this Court  Section   requires this Court to hear and determine the appeal and make such orders as it thinks appropriate  Subsection   empowers the Court to make orders affirming or setting aside the Tribunal s decision and an order remitting the case to be heard and decided again by the Tribunal citedRoncevich v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI am not satisfied that the Tribunal s use of the expressions  not attributable to operational service  and  the cause of the seasickness  shows that it properly considered s  B   The subsection is broader than  attributable  in par  b  and  cause  in par  f   Paragraph  a  was potentially applicable  It could be that the appellant s seasickness resulted from an occurrence  rough seas  on the way to Vietnam  The Tribunal did not consider whether the appellant s pre existing disposition to seasickness was aggravated by his service  par  d   Nor did it consider whether the seasickness  arose out of  his operational service  par  b   In Roncevich v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at     in considering a provision in the same terms as s  B b  the Court said the use disjunctively of the expressions  arose out of  and  attributable  manifests an intention to give  defence caused  a broad meaning  What was there said in relation to the expression  defence caused injury  is applicable to  injury     related to service  in s  B   After noting that the Tribunal did not refer to s  B  the Federal Magistrate observed that the  phraseology  in   of the Tribunal s reasons was  in some respects unfortunate   Nevertheless his Honour regarded that paragraph as containing  an unintended paraphrase of the requirements of  s  B   I am unable to agree  According to the Macquarie Dictionary a paraphrase is a  restatement of the sense of a text or passage  as for clearness   The Tribunal s use of the words  attributable to  and  the cause  does not capture the sense of the relevant parts of subsection   and is not aptly described as a paraphrase  It may well be that the explanation for the Tribunal s failure to refer expressly to s  B  lies in the fact that the appellant s counsel  who did not appear on the present appeal  informed the Tribunal that the respondent s references to s  B  were misplaced  and that the appropriate provision was s    That section deals with the circumstances in which an injury is to be taken to be a war caused injury or disease  It is in some respects similar to s  B   However  the Tribunal did not refer to s   either  As I have said  it was common ground on the appeal to this Court that it was necessary for the Tribunal to go through the  related to service  exercise in s  B   It did not do so  and the ground of appeal related to the first amended question of law  namely par   of the notice  is made out  The second amended question of law is whether the Tribunal was correct in holding that a pre existing condition can never give rise to a stressor that is related to service within s  B  The Tribunal s reasoning on this issue is set out at   above  It involved the following steps followedRoper v Repatriation Commission     ALD  Order   r  a  as interpreted by the

JJ agreed consideredWhite v Repatriation Commission   FCA         AAR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn White v Repatriation Commission   FCA         AAR   Spender J considered the definition of  severe psychosocial stressor  in a SoP which was in similar terms to the definition in the instant SoP  At   his Honour said      the definition of severe psychosocial stressor concerns an occurrence that  objectively  is an occurrence the nature of which is such as to evoke feelings of a particular kind in a person exposed to that occurrence and which  subjectively  evokes feelings of substantial distress in the particular person concerned  Both aspects are relevant and necessary       After observing that the Tribunal there had determined that the events relied on did not meet the objective requirement  his Honour continued at       In my opinion  the submission on behalf of Mr White that an event which in fact evokes feelings of substantial distress in a person satisfies the definition of  severe psychosocial stressor  has to be rejected  Such a submission  that any occurrence no matter how trivial or innocuous it objectively is  can be a  serious psychosocial stressor  means that the examples given in the definition     would be not only irrelevant and devoid of utility  but positively misleading  As appears above  the Tribunal did not expressly address whether the appellant s seasickness was an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual  It had before it evidence from Dr Strauss that Before the Magistrate the respondent submitted that there was no evidence before the Tribunal that seasickness is a severe illness and therefore an occurrence which of its nature is objectively capable of evoking feelings of substantial distress  It said that Dr Strauss  evidence related only to the subjective effect of seasickness on the appellant  His Honour was referred to the observations of Spender J in White   FCA       AAR    The Magistrate did not accept the respondent s submissions on this issue  He considered Dr Strauss  evidence  taken in the round and fairly was to the effect that seasickness is capable of being a severe illness   He noted that Dr Strauss found that the appellant s experiences and their ramifications were a severe psychosocial stress for him  and caused him significant or substantial distress  He referred to the dictionary definition of  severe  disagreeably intense  unpleasantly extreme   especially of bad weather  illness  injury etc  causing hardship pain or suffering by its degree of extremity  The Magistrate found that Dr Strauss  report evinced or was at least open to the interpretation that  he regarded these matters both objectively and as they affected Mr Cunningham individually   I agree with that reading of Dr Strauss  report  It is true that in his report he spoke of there having been a severe psychosocial stressor  for this man   But in cross examination he gave evidence about seasickness in the abstract  and said      seasickness begins with nausea and travels through to very severe symptoms  But seasickness involves nausea  I think  that      can be quite severe and debilitating
