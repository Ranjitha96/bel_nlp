SZDJH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedApplicant S  of   v Refugee Review Tribunal     ALD   It would appear that s  B of the Migration Act    Cth  applies to the appellant s application  Prior to the introduction of s  B there was generally no obligation on the Tribunal to conduct its own investigation or to make some particular inquiry  see generally  WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     Applicant S  of   v Refugee Review Tribunal     ALD   at   and S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     With the introduction of s  B this position is made clear  see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at    citedAustralian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is not sufficient to say  as the appellant does  that upon the Federal Magistrates Court making its decision  he tried harder to find further material  The appellant was well aware that his credit was in issue before the Tribunal  and he should have made all efforts to produce all the material he wished to rely upon before the Tribunal  Even if the new evidence would now be admissible  to which I refer to  for example  Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia   FCA         FCR   remembering that this is a review procedure  in my view  I should not allow the additional information to be adduced by the appellant before me   There is a public interest in disposing of public law cases in a timely manner and this is not a case where the issue to be agitated here was not appropriately and clearly put to the appellant before the Tribunal  Fairness does not dictate in this case that I should allow the appellant to tender into evidence any new material for the purposes of this appeal  My function is to review the decision of the federal magistrate and the Tribunal and not to consider the appellant s visa application on the merits and de novo  This is particularly so where the Tribunal did not accept the appellant as a witness of truth   I further observe that the additional material seems to me to be relevant to the appellant s credibility  The Tribunal  in considering the material of Mr Kalin  was treating it as confirmatory of its view that the appellant was not telling the truth about his involvement with Jehovah s Witnesses  Even if the Tribunal had the additional information before it  any response  in my view  would not have affected the Tribunal s finding about the credit worthiness of the appellant  I am not satisfied that there is any significant possibility that the decision of the Tribunal or the Federal Magistrates Court would have been different if the additional information now sought to be relied upon was in fact before either the Tribunal or the federal magistrate   In my view  the approach of the Tribunal and the federal magistrate  and their conclusions  were correct  Accordingly  the appeal will be dismissed    I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton    Associate Dated    May   Counsel for the Appellant  The Appellant appeared in person     Counsel for the

to the question of the additional information  In my view the appellant has had ample opportunity to put material to the Tribunal and to place any evidence to rebut the statements of Mr Kalin  In fact  the appellant did address the Federal Magistrates Court as to Mr Kalin possibly being wrong  Even before the federal magistrate no additional information was sought to be tendered into evidence  No sufficient explanation is now offered in relation to the additional information sought to be relied upon and why it was not sought to be relied upon earlier  see generally  Chopra v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   and following citedNAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In any event  it is apparent from this case that the Tribunal did make inquiries as to whether conscientious objectors were sent to prison  It relied upon information from Mr Kalin in forming its view on whether conscientious objectors were sent to prison  I see nothing wrong with the approach of the Tribunal in making this choice in its assessment of the information  and this is clearly a factual matter for it  see NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   to   citedS  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www
