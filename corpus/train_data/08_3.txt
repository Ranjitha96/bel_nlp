referred toCitron v Z ndel  No       CHRR D  Further  one cannot ignore the public interest nature of the claim and the complete recognition by the Parliament of that type of claim and of the lack of wide international recognition of Australia s claim to the relevant part of Antarctica  see the majority of the Full Court reasons at   FCAFC       FCR   and     and see also Citron v Z ndel  No       CHRR D  at       In the light of the reasons of the majority of the Full Court  I cannot conclude that the practical difficulty  if not impossibility  of enforcement is a reason to withhold relief   On the material placed before the Court  I am satisfied that the respondent has contravened ss    A   B   C   D and   of the EPBC Act in relation to Antarctic minke whales and fin whales by killing  injuring  taking and interfering with them and the treating and possessing of them and by injuring  interfering with and treating and possessing humpback whales and that  unless restrained  it will continue to kill  injure  take and interfere with them  and treat and possess them citedMabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Australia s claim to sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is recognised only by four nations  New Zealand  France  Norway and the United Kingdom  themselves with asserted  and otherwise disputed  claims over various parts of the Antarctic land mass  Japan rejects Australia s purported exercise of jurisdiction over waters that are considered by Japan to be the high seas  This is not a ground for invalidity of the EPBC Act  the sovereign claim by Australia to the Australian Antarctic Territory is not a matter capable of being questioned in this Court in this proceeding  cf Mabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR    These matters of sovereignty and international recognition  and lack of extensiveness thereof  can be taken to have been before  and well recognised by  Parliament when it enacted the EPBC Act citedSimonton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The applicant submitted that a broad range of

perspective of disobedience  To do so requires the setting to one side of the refusal by Japan to recognise Australia s claim to Antarctica  It is not for this Court to question Australia s claim or Parliament s mandate in the EPBC Act  which is based on Australia s claim  Thus  this perspective can be seen to be relevant for this Court to take into account  even if from another perspective  for instance that of Japan  the perspective is flawed   So viewed  it  futility arising from disobedience and an inability to bring about obedience  may bring to mind what was said by Hardie  Hutley and Bowen JJA in Vincent v Peacock     NSWLR   at     In our opinion  it is not a ground for refusing an injunction that it would not have a practical effect  where its failure to have a practical effect is because the defendant disobeys it
