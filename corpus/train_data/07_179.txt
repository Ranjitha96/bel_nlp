Property Pty Ltd  formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd  formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited    FCA   I have ordered that the application be summarily dismissed against all respondents  Put shortly  I found that the Statement of Claim was  first  offensive  embarrassing and disclosed no reasonable cause of action and  second  the causes of action relied upon were in any event doomed to failure because they sought to impeach a consent order of a superior court of record without first having that order set aside   The respondents have sought to be heard on the question of costs  They now seek an order that costs be awarded in their favour on a solicitor and client basis citedRe Wilcox  Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd     ALR   The jurisdiction of the Court to order costs is conferred by s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The section provides a broad and ample power which ought not be read down otherwise than in accordance with accepted principle  The discretion so conferred is informed by the ordinary practice of this Court that an unsuccessful party usually will be required to pay the costs of the successful party on a party and party basis  That practice  as was indicated in Re Wilcox  Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd     ALR   at   and     is not departed from unless the justice of the particular case so requires or some special or unusual feature arises citedColgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   The courts in quite some number of cases have indicated types or categories of case in which the award of costs on a basis other than party and party may appropriately be ordered  see e g  Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at      However  they have emphasised that the categories are not closed and that  even though circumstances may exist which are capable of warranting a more generous costs order than on a party and party basis  this does not compel that such an order be made  Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd v Boland  No       ALR   at      For present purposes it is unnecessary to consider the case law in any detail  I am content in this matter to adopt the observations of Gray J  with whom the other members of the court agreed  in Hamod v New South Wales     ALR   at      Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail  They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty  Rather  they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred  as a normal costs order could not be expected to do  when the court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs  citedYates Property Corporation Pty Ltd v Boland  No
