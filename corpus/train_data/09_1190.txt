FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe plaintiff Councils seek their costs of the proceedings against each of the corporate defendants  Lehman Australia  Lehman Asia and Lehman Bros  Lehman Australia accepted that any costs it should be ordered to pay be payable as costs of its winding up  ordered by me on   October   City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd  No     FCA    Lehman Australia argued that the order should apportion the liability for costs severally so that each corporate defendant would be ordered to pay one third of the Councils  costs  Lehman Asia also asserted that since the Councils had not joined it as a defendant initially and it had applied to be joined  it was an intervenor  and that it should not be ordered to pay any costs at all or any significant costs  Lehman Bros argued that under r     of the Federal Court  Corporations  Rules     its liability was limited to any additional costs that were incurred by the Councils  until it was joined as a defendant at its own request on   July    In addition  Lehman Bros seeks an order for its reasonable expenses in respect of a subpoena served on it by the Councils on   June    The Councils argued that the subpoena sought documents that would have been discoverable had Lehman Bros been a party at the time of service  They argued that the expenses in respect of the subpoena should be characterised as an incident of Lehman Bros  later involvement as a defendant  The Councils commenced these proceedings urgently and ex parte on   June   when Stone J gave them leave to serve the originating process returnable before me on   June    That process was directed to challenging the validity and implementation of the resolution of Lehman Australia s creditors  made on   May   that it execute a deed of company arrangement citedCity of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThus  in any action to set aside the deed Lehman Asia  as a party to it  had to be a defendant  It was a proper and necessary party  as its offer to be joined on   June   recognised  Lehman Asia was also the principal proponent of the deed during the earlier administration  City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd   FCA   at     It filed a defence and cross claim  It sought relief by having the Court remove or vary the terms of the impugned clauses or order amendments so as to give effect to the intention of those creditors who had voted in favour of the resolution  In addition  it sought an order for rectification of the deed  City of Swan   FCA   at         Lehman Asia had not sought to be added as an intervenor on   June    Nor was it content to rely on merely being heard under r     without being made a party  Neither position would have been appropriate  Lehman Asia was a party to the deed  And  Lehman Asia was an active  proper and necessary party to the proceedings that sought that the deed be terminated or declared void  It exercised its rights of participation in the proceedings as a party  including bringing a cross claim  It had a significant interest in seeking to uphold the validity of the deed of company arrangement  or obtaining relief to similar effect  or to enforce the balance of the deed excluding any clauses found to be invalid  It should be liable for costs as a party citedCity of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThat argument is without substance  On   June  when the proceedings began  they were properly constituted as a vehicle to challenge the creditors  resolution that Lehman Australia execute a deed of company arrangement containing provisions to the effect of those held by the Full Court to be beyond the statutory powers of the creditors to include in such a deed  City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd   FCAFC    Importantly  on   June   the Councils obtained new causes of action in respect of the deed that had been executed on that day  Lehman Asia was an actual party to that deed as were  conformably with s  B  and   Lehman Australia and its administrators followedProbiotec Ltd v University of Melbourne   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlOrdinarily  where defendants or respondents in the same interest all participate in the proceedings and

 FCR at     and Cachia v Hanes   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson and McHugh JJ  The consequence of ordering each of the corporate defendants to pay one third or some other proportion of the Councils  costs severally  would be to put at risk the efficacy of the partial indemnity  were one or more of the defendants either incapable of paying its portion or recalcitrant  Despite their insolvencies  it is not suggested that the corporate defendants will not be able to meet any costs order  I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate or just to reduce their liabilities from being joint and several merely because they were the three unsuccessful active parties  They can seek contribution among themselves after one or more has paid the Councils  In principle  the Councils should be free to seek recovery of the full amount of any costs order against all of the corporate defendants  each of which took an active part in the proceedings  Each of them contributed to the costs being incurred  at least while a party  see below  in a way which  as between them and the plaintiffs was not readily distinguishable  Each of the corporate defendants was essentially in the same interest  adopting and reinforcing arguments the others put  even though there were some individual substantive  but as the matter proceeded  in the result  not substantial  differences between them  e g  the different results sought in Lehman Asia s and Lehman Bros  cross claims  see too Probiotec   FCR at     per myself  at     per Besanko J  and at     per Finn J  Lehman Bros  position was different to that of Lehman Asia  Lehman Bros was not a necessary party to the proceedings  However  it obtained significant and express benefits from the impugned provisions in the deed of company arrangement  And  as its cross claim showed  if it lost those benefits because the impugned provisions were found to be invalid  unlike Lehman Asia  Lehman Bros wanted the deed then to terminate and Lehman Australia to be wound up  Lehman Bros argued that its liability for costs before   July was governed by r     and that s   prevented any wider order for costs being made against it before that date  Rule    a  provides that the Court may direct that a person granted leave under r     to be heard  without becoming a party in a proceeding  if it considers that the attendance of that person has resulted in additional costs for any party that those costs should be borne by the person  Lehman Bros argued that the Councils had not incurred any additional costs because of its attendances prior to   July  I reject that argument  It is inconsistent with the substantive position put by Lehman Bros at the hearing on   July  Lehman Bros also argued that because it was not a party before   July  r     was the sole source of its liability for costs  I am of opinion that s   gives the Court power to award costs against a party  including costs incurred by the successful party before the new party had been joined  The power to order costs in s   is not confined  once the Court considers that a party to the proceedings should be ordered to bear them  Of course  the time and circumstances of a party s joinder will be relevant to the exercise of the discretion to order costs  particularly in respect of any period before that joinder  see Probiotec   FCR at      Here  Lehman Bros contemplated from its first appearance that it may wish to become a party  By   July   that position had become substantially clearer  During the hearing on that day its counsel recognised the likelihood that Lehman Bros would become a party and argued in anticipation that it would put its own substantial case forward in the litigation  Of course  once it became one  Lehman Bros would assume the obligations of a party under the Federal Court  Corporations  Rules and the Federal Court Rules   including discovery  By this time  it was apparent that unless an order for an early trial of separate issues was made  a course resisted by Lehman Bros  these proceedings would be complex  lengthy and involve considerable discovery  The classes of documents sought in the subpoena broadly included documents that would have been discoverable by Lehman Bros  I have not considered whether the terms of the subpoena were appropriate in every respect  However  they reflected  whether or not  if challenged  they would be found too broad or imprecise  classes of documents that would be likely to be relevant for collection or consideration by Lehman Bros  lawyers for the purpose of discovery  Thus  much of what Mr Hoser s affidavit referred to was work that would have been required to be done in any event  even if no subpoena had been issued citedRe Wridgemont Display
