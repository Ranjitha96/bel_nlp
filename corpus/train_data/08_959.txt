cases cth FMCA  html  This is an appeal from orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on   July   dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  Tribunal  SZJRW   Anor v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA    On   October   the Tribunal published its decision to affirm a decision of the delegate of the first respondent  the Minister  to refuse to grant each appellant a protection visa under the provisions of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act    Appellant SZJRW  the primary appellant  is a citizen of the People s Republic of China  China  who sought a protection visa based upon a contended well founded fear of persecution on the ground of his participation in protests against the government of China  that is  by reason of his political opinion  Appellant SZKEM is his wife and sought a protection visa as a family member of the primary appellant   In these reasons  I will use the term  the appellant  as a reference to the circumstances  findings and contentions concerning the primary appellant unless otherwise apparent citedNAHI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant says a proper inference can not be drawn from the country information relied upon by the Tribunal that an applicant for a passport is of no interest to PRC authorities on grounds of prior protest conduct for reasons of political opinion  simply because the applicant obtains a passport and achieves an objective of lawfully leaving China  However  five things should be noted  First  the Tribunal was entitled to prefer the country information it obtained and rely upon it in discharging its fact finding role   NAHI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     and   relying upon VTAG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   and VAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at      Secondly  the finding is primarily supported by the Tribunal s assessment of the appellant s evidence  Thirdly  the appellant accepted that he had not engaged in protest activity and explained the conjunction of circumstances causing that to be so  Fourthly  even if no proper inference arises out of the older country information  the Tribunal did not act on  no evidence  in reaching its finding as evidence  that is  the appellant s own evidence  supported the finding  Fifthly  the question of whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law just as whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law  Accordingly  in the context of judicial review  the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law  On the other hand  clearly enough  there is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact  In addition  even if the reasoning upon which the decision maker reached its conclusion of fact is demonstrated to be unsound  that would not amount to error of law   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi   FCA

HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Tribunal s reference to the country information upon which it relied is said to reflect a less rigorous standard for assessing

written evidence and the evidence of the witnesses at the hearing  Thus  the Tribunal did not simply rely upon  old decision templates   Rather  the Tribunal asked itself whether it could be satisfied
