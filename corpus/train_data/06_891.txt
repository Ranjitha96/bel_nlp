McKenzie v South Australia   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMcKenzie v State Government of South Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The native title claim group represented by the applicants has already had an application under the Native Title Act    Cth  struck out  see McKenzie v State Government of South Australia   FCA    Before that matter was struck out  for reasons relating both to the identification of the claim group and to the alleged authority of the claimants  the applicants had amended their application on a number of occasions  Following the strike out decision  a fresh application was filed on   February   resulting in the present proceedings   Shortly thereafter the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement  the ALRM  notified the applicants of perceived deficiencies in its Form    Once again these related both to authorisation and to the composition of the claim group  Initially  the applicants sought simply to amend their application  the amendment seemingly being to change the composition of the claim group somewhat  It was then made plain to the applicants that leave was required   The ALRM opposed the grant of leave on the ground that there was a reasonable basis for concluding that the Form   would still be defective for reasons similar to those given in the earlier McKenzie litigation  On   May   the application for leave to amend was adjourned to allow the applicants to address the ALRM s concerns  Instead of proceeding further with that application  the respondents purported to discontinue this proceeding  They have now conceded correctly that that is not within their power to do so as of right and that the leave of the Court is required   The basis of the discontinuance is set out in an affidavit of the solicitor for the applicants  Mr McDonald           After the hearing before His Honour Justice Finn on   May   which considered the ALRM s objections to the Form   in this matter  I took further instructions from the Applicants in Pt Augusta on the following weekend         The purpose of those further instructions was to prepare supplementary affidavits of the Applicants to respond to the ALRM s objections         While taking those instructions I became aware for the first time that Willy Austin should have been named as an apical ancestor as part of the claim group description  Willy Austin had been raised as a possible apical ancestor by Dr Daniel Vachon  the anthropologist for the Kuyani Wilyaru people and his name was raised at the authorization meeting on   July    It was decided at this meeting not to include Willy Austin as an apical ancestor but no detailed discussion as to his exclusion took place    As mentioned above I only became aware on the weekend of   May   that descendants of Willy Austin do identify themselves as Kuyani citedAnkamuthi People v State Government of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html   Although I advised the applicants and they have considered the possibility of amending the present proceedings  I have been instructed to discontinue and lodge fresh proceedings to avoid any argument in relation to a perceived lack of authorization in relation to these proceedings  The reference to my advice should not be taken as any waiver of legal professional privilege

wants to  provided no injustice will be caused to the defendant  Covell Matthews   Partners v French Wools Ltd     WLR   at   which has been adopted in a number of cases in this Court  I have determined that discontinuance in this matter will occasion no injustice  subject to the question of costs     The Court has a general discretion under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  to make cost orders  The principles informing the Court s discretion in such cases are well known  see eg  Ruddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR   at par    However  when costs are sought in discontinuance proceedings  somewhat different considerations obtain to those that obtain under s    It has been recognised that the underlying policy of the Rules is that the discontinuing party should be liable to pay the other party s costs unless the Court orders otherwise  see e g  Grundy v Lewis   FCA    That policy  though  has not itself solidified into a principle which parallels the usual rule under s   of costs following the event  The Courts have indicated that  on a motion for discontinuance  the conduct of the parties in the matter and the reasons for the discontinuance can bear heavily on the exercise of the discretion as to costs  see O Neill v Mann   FCA   at par         The consideration of an award of costs in this particular proceeding must  of course  be seen under the shadow of s  A  and   of the Native Title Act  Section  A provides        Unless the Federal Court orders otherwise  each party to a proceeding must bear his or her own costs
