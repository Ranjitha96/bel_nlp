respondents have expressed contrition and have put in place mechanisms which are designed to ensure that there will be no repetition of the breaches which have led to the present proceeding  Specific deterrence does not  therefore  loom large as a consideration in determining penalty  It does not follow that the need for general deterrence may be disregarded  As Finkelstein J said in CPSU v Telstra Corporation Limited     IR   at    even if there be no need for specific deterrence  there will be occasions when general deterrence must take priority  and in that case a penalty should be imposed to mark the law s disapproval of the conduct in question  and to act as a warning to others not to engage in similar conduct      No less than large corporate employers  small businesses have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees  rightly  have an expectation that this will occur  When it does not it will  normally  be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction  Such a sanction  must be imposed at a meaningful level  see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd   ATPR     at     In fixing appropriate penalties for breach of each of the relevant Award terms it is necessary to bear in mind that  with the exception of the breach of Clause      casual loadings  there were repeated breaches of each of the terms over a period in excess of five years  For a little more than half of this period the maximum penalty  calculated  having regard to s   and     as single breaches of each relevant term  was    It was   for the rest of the period  The breaches of Clause     occurred wholly within the period during which the maximum penalty was    It is also necessary to bear in mind that the various breaches had a differential financial impact on Mr Paynting  The failure to pay him for overtime hours worked on weekdays accounted for well over half the shortfall  The bulk of this sum is attributable to a failure to comply with Clause      The next most serious shortfall was in the payment of ordinary hours  Again  it was the failure to take into account Mr Paynting s entitlement to the casual loading which was the main contributor to this underpayment  The underpayments for Saturday  Sunday and public holiday work were relatively minor   Another factor

Callinan   Heydon JJ referred toGibbs v The Mayor  Councillors and the Citizens of the City of Altona     FCR   The parties  agreement about the identification of the terms which had been breached was founded on the construction of s   which was adopted by Gray J in Gibbs v The Mayor  Councillors and the Citizens of the City of Altona     FCR   at    His Honour there held that  each separate obligation found in an award is to be regarded as a  term  for the purposes of s       His Honour further held that  in ascertaining what constitutes a  term  regard should be had  not  to  matters of form  such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award  but on matters of substance  namely the different obligations which can be spelt out   In the present case the parties have fixed on the particular provisions of the Award to which it was necessary to have resort for the purpose of calculating Mr Paynting s minimum legal entitlements to wages  In my view the parties were correct to approach the matter in this manner  The six  terms  which have been identified applied throughout the relevant period and  depending on the days of which Mr Paynting worked  imposed obligations on the respondents as to the level of remuneration payable to him  Whilst the Award was varied from time to time to increase the amounts prescribed by the various terms  the substantial obligation did not vary  it was that the prescribed amount should be paid to Mr Paynting   When calculating Mr Paynting s entitlements under the Award for any given day  it was necessary  in many instances  to have regard to more than one of the aforementioned terms  For example  in the period between   February   and   June   when he was working on a casual basis  his ordinary hourly rate was supplemented by the casual loading and  if the work was undertaken on a Saturday  a further loading was payable   The parties have agreed that the breaches of particular terms led to the following underpayments     a  Underpayment of wages for ordinary hours   i  Clause            ii  Clause          b  Underpayment of wages for overtime hours Monday to Friday   i  Clauses       and          ii  Clause          c  Underpayment of wages for Saturday hours   i  Clauses             and          ii  Clauses       and            d  Underpayment of wages for Sunday hours   i  Clauses       and        ii  Clause        e  Underpayment of wages for public holiday hours   i  Clauses       and            ii  Clause          referred toJohnson v R   HCA         ALR

Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd   FMCA   Mowbray FM identified  a non exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty  and if it does the amount of the penalty   Those considerations were derived from a number of decisions of this Court  I gratefully adopt  as potentially relevant and applicable  the various considerations identified by him  They were      The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches     The circumstances in which that conduct took place     The nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches     Whether there had been similar previous conduct by the respondent     Whether the breaches were properly distinct or arose out of the one course of conduct     The size of the business enterprise involved     Whether or not the breaches were deliberate     Whether senior management was involved in the breaches     Whether the party committing the breach had exhibited contrition     Whether the party committing the breach had taken corrective action     Whether the party committing the breach had cooperated with the enforcement authorities     The need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements and    The need for specific and general deterrence   The parties accepted that these considerations should guide the exercise of my discretion in the present proceeding   The various breaches of Award terms which occurred in this case can all be traced to a single source  That source was the decision  made by the first respondent  to offer Mr Paynting employment at an hourly rate  Mr Paynting accepted that offer  Throughout the relevant period Mr Paynting was paid  either at the originally agreed rate  or  subsequently  at higher agreed rates  The wages paid to Mr Paynting were calculated on the basis of the agreed hourly rates  Over a period of a little more than five years this led to the underpayment of     in wages which would have been paid to him had the Award requirements been observed  This underpayment represented about a third of Mr Paynting s wages entitlement under the Award  The amount is significant  Although the shortfall was paid in full to Mr Paynting in April   he was deprived of the financial benefits which timely payment of the correct wages would have provided   The respondents operate their business  in what was described in argument as   an informal partnership   The first respondent ceased formal eduction at the end of Year   the second respondent at the end of Year    The business operates from a base in rural Victoria  The first respondent is one of six drivers employed in the business  The second respondent works one day a week in the business attending to the payment of wages and accounts rendered  Day to day administration is in the hands of an employed manager  The turnover of the business has fluctuated over time  Between   and   the turnover in each year has fallen within the range of     million to     million  The average operating profit over this period  prior to any drawings by the respondents  has been   per year  In order to make good the underpayment to Mr Paynting it was necessary for the business to extend its overdraft  Apart from an accountant  the business had no external professional advisers  In particular  it did not retain anyone with expertise in industrial law  The respondents were not members of any employer or industry association   The respondents gave uncontradicted evidence that  at all relevant times  prior to June   they were unaware of the existence of the Award or of its application to their business  This was despite the fact that a series of certified letters which related to the making of the Award and its predecessors and the respondency of the business to it was sent to their business address  There was no evidence as to why this correspondence did not come to the respondents  attention or  if it did  why they had overlooked it  Counsel for the respondents accepted that there were avenues available to them which would have enabled them to ascertain their obligations had they been aware of those avenues and minded to utilise them  In these circumstances I infer that the respondent s ignorance of their obligations under the Award  on the view most favourable to them  was the result of carelessness and inadvertence   As already noted the underpayments totalled      They occurred over a period of a little over five years and represented approximately one third of the amount to which Mr Paynting was entitled referred toPonzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http
