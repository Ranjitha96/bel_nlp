Vijayakumar v Qantas Airways Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredBrannigan v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFurther  Qantas sought an order that the application  as filed  be dismissed summarily pursuant to s  A of the FMC Act and r     of the FMC Rules on the basis that the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding  Qantas submitted that the applicant s complaint concerned conduct in India and the DDA had no extra territorial operation  Qantas relied on Brannigan v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA         FCR   which held that federal discrimination laws have no extra territorial operation  The Federal Magistrate found that the  entirety of the applicant s claim relates to his treatment at Mumbai Airport in India  and  t he discriminatory act upon which the applicant relies is the refusal of the Qantas Manager and other staff at Mumbai Airport to allow him to take all his baggage onto the aircraft without paying the excess baggage charge of some      This act occurred in India  not in Australia  at   and   of his reasons  The Federal Magistrate accepted that Brannigan was a correct statement of the law  His Honour accepted that the Court had no jurisdiction to hear a claim about alleged discrimination that arose in Mumbai and was confined to matters that occurred there  The application was dismissed on the ground that the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding  at   and   of his reasons  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in respect of two matters In relation to the first matter  the applicant raises a number of issues going to the construction and application of s  PO  of the then HREOC Act and claims that by reason of errors made by his Honour in dealing with these issues  his Honour s exercise of the discretion in r     of the FMC Rules miscarried  In relation to the second matter  the applicant claims that his Honour failed to consider and give effect to various principles or provisions of the DDA and that he erred in concluding that the DDA had no extra territorial effect  After reciting the terms of the claim in the original application  which are extracted in   above  his Honour said  at   and         In my view  the entirety of the Applicant s claim relates to his treatment at Mumbai Airport in India  In order for his claim to succeed  the Applicant must establish that the Disability Discrimination Act applies outside Australia  The Delegate of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission dismissed the Applicant s claims on the basis that the Act did not apply extra territorially  relying on the decision in Brannigan v Commonwealth of Australia                        The discriminatory act upon which the Applicant relies is the refusal of the Qantas Manager and other staff at Mumbai Airport to allow him to take all his baggage onto the aircraft without paying the excess baggage charge of some      This act occurred in India  not in Australia  In my view  his Honour s conclusion on this issue is not infected with any error  On the hearing of the leave application  the applicant submitted that it was not the case that his unamended application was confined to matters in Mumbai because it refers to the purchase of a ticket in early   and a refusal by Qantas to reasonably accommodate his disability aids  These claims  it was submitted  raise issues broader than the conduct of Qantas in Mumbai  That may be so but it does not lead to the conclusion that any part of the discriminatory act originally complained of took place anywhere other than in India  The applicant further submitted on the hearing of the leave application that the Federal Magistrate I reject all of these submissions  The first is not supported on the facts  the second was not particularised in any way  and the third is devoid of any reasoning process  Following upon what his Honour said at   of his reasons  see   above  at   his Honour said        Unless he can show that the Disability Discrimination Act has an extra territorial operation  the Applicant s claim cannot succeed  His Honour then considered various arguments by the applicant as to why Brannigan applies only to Commonwealth employees or matters relating to discrimination in employment and rejected these arguments  At   his Honour said        I am satisfied that the decision in Brannigan clearly shows that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear a claim about discrimination that arose in Mumbai in India and is entirely confined to matters that occurred there  The Disability Discrimination Act has no extra territorial effect  Had that been the intention of the legislature  then it would have been clearly stated in the legislation  I cannot identify any error in his Honour s process of reasoning  On the hearing of the leave application  the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in his approach to the extra territorial issue  It was submitted that a distinction was to be drawn between discrimination in employment by the Commonwealth occurring outside Australia with which Brannigan was concerned  and the application of the DDA to foreign corporations  trading or financial corporations or trade or commerce between Australia and a place outside Australia  According to the applicant  his Honour took Brannigan too far by treating it as having conclusively determined that the DDA can never be concerned with conduct occurring outside Australia  I do not agree  nor do I agree with the applicant s submission that his Honour ought to have left the complex legal issues raised by the extra territorial issue to be argued in full at a hearing on the merits  In conclusion  I am of the view that his Honour s conclusions on the two matters sought to be raised on appeal are not infected with any error and that even though a refusal of leave may effectively put an end to the applicant s substantive rights  no useful purpose would be served by a grant of leave  nor would the applicant suffer substantial injustice  The applicant s complaints have already been considered on a comprehensive basis by HREOC and terminated  The application must be refused

toD cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe discretion the Court has in respect of an application for leave to appeal is a wide one  but is ordinarily informed by two considerations    Whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court  and   whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision is wrong   See Decor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR    The same considerations apply where the application for leave is heard by a single judge referred toMastronardi v State of New South Wales   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlIn relation to both matters  it is claimed by the applicant that his Honour s reasoning and conclusions were vitiated by the excessive delay of   months between the conclusion of the hearing and the giving of judgment  This was not pressed on the hearing of the application for leave  correctly in my view  because it is well established that delay will not constitute a ground of appeal in its own right in civil proceedings  but the manner

referred to in   above are not exhaustive  Whilst leave to appeal an interlocutory decision on a point of practice or procedure  rather than substantive rights  might less readily be granted  even a decision affecting the latter may be refused where the appeal would achieve no useful purpose  Refusal to Allow Amendment of Application The Federal Magistrate dealt with this matter at     of his reasons  The applicant sought to amend his application in the manner indicated below  Describe the discrimination you are complaining of       In early   I purchased a return air ticket from Qantas to travel from Sydney to Mumbai  India and return  I commenced my journey on   March   when I left Sydney and returned to Australia on a Qantas flight leaving Mumbai  India on   June            The Respondent has discriminated against me in that it refused to its Conditions of Carriage failed to reasonably accommodate carriage of my mobility aids and other essential equipment  including medications and sleep machine without the payment of excess baggage charges          In doing so the Respondent has unlawfully discriminated against me in the provision of goods and services and access to premises on the grounds of my disability and has contravened the Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport        State all sections of the Act that are relevant to this claim       Sections                             and       and   of the Disability Discrimination Act   consideredQueensland v Forest   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe applicant submitted that his Honour s conclusion  that ss   and   of the DDA are mutually exclusive and that the applicant could not rely on essentially the same conduct in a claim under two mutually exclusive sections  was an error of law  It was submitted that the provisions can and do operate mutually without excluding each other and reference was made to the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Queensland v Forest   FCAFC         FCR    Having closely read the reasons of the Full Court  both those of the majority  Spender and Emmett JJ  and the minority  Black CJ  I am not persuaded that this case is authority for that proposition  But even if these two provisions are not mutually exclusive and his Honour was in error in concluding that they were  in my view this would not vitiate his Honour s ultimate conclusion that the proposed amendments to the application are outside the limits of s  PO  of the then HREOC Act  In my view  his Honour s refusal to allow amendment of the application in the terms proposed by the applicant  is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being re considered by this Court  Summary Dismissal The Federal Magistrate dealt with this matter at   to   of his reasons  His Honour paraphrased the issue  correctly in my view  as being whether the applicant had a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting his application  On the basis of the dismissal of the application to amend  his Honour observed  again correctly in my view  that the application to be considered was the original application filed on   June   at   of his reasons
