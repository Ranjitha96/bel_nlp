IGT v Commissioner of Patents   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedA Goninan   Co Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The joint submissions first addressed the question of the Court s jurisdiction to review the decision under the ADJR Act  The parties contended that the decision was one of an administrative character made under an enactment  being reg     of the Patents Regulations   Reference was made to A Goninan   Co Ltd v Commissioner of Patents   FCA         FCR   which involved review under the ADJR Act of a decision made pursuant to reg     of the Patents Regulations to allow further time for the filing of evidence  I am satisfied that the Court has jurisdiction and power to make the order sought   IGT submits to the Court as part of the joint submissions  that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by reg     in that         i  it constituted the exercise of a discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case  in contravention of sections  e  and  f  of the AD JR  Act       ii  in exercising the power  the Delegate failed to take account of relevant considerations  in contravention of sections  e  and  b  of the AD JR  Act       The joint submission then went on        Aristocrat accepts  solely for the purpose of the Court making the consent orders sought by IGT and Aristocrat that it is open to the Court to so find     It may be observed immediately that there can be no question of any contravention of s   of the ADJR Act  That section identifies grounds of review  It does not mandate or prohibit conduct by decision makers citedEmory University v Biochem Pharma Inc   APO  http www austlii edu au au cases cth APO  html  The  rule  or  policy  relied upon by IGT as fettering the delegate s discretion was      a particular requirement as a pre condition to the exercise of his power under regulation     namely that the Further Evidence be  crucial  or  vital  to the determination of the opposition or alternatively  that it must  add substantially  to IGT s case       In posing that requirement the delegate is said to have foreclosed the balancing exercise which he was required to undertake in exercising his discretion  Aristocrat accepted  for the purpose of the consent orders  that it was open to the Court so to find  The delegate did refer to another delegate decision in Emory University v Biochem Pharma Inc   APO     if the further evidence       did not add substantially to the case compared with previous evidence already served then the further evidence could be refused   So framed  consideration of the significance and substantiality of the evidence would be perfectly legitimate as a relevant consideration  However  in the reasons the delegate did say  at       It would seem IGT s present application to serve further evidence  with the consequential further delay  could only be justified in this case if the further evidence was significantly different from the initial evidence served in support and crucial to advancing the proper determination of the opposition on its merits   Without determining the point finally  I accept that it is arguable that the delegate  in so expressing himself  could be taken to have elevated the significance of the evidence to a determinative factor effectively excluding consideration of other matters  I emphasise that I do not find that this was the legal effect of the delegate s remark  However  the possibility of error which both parties have accepted  is sufficient to support the consent order which is now sought as being within power and appropriate  I will therefore make the order proposed      I certify that the preceding twenty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French     Associate Dated    January   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr P Mallon     Solicitor for the Applicant  Mallon   Co Lawyers Pty Ltd     Counsel for the Second Respondent  Ms Taliadoros     Solicitor for the Second Respondent  Gilbert   Tobin     Date of Joint Submissions    January       Date of Judgment    January           AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
