Meadow Springs Fairway Resort Ltd  In liquidation  v Colliers International Consultancy and Valuation Pty Ltd   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCouncil of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Order   r   is most commonly used to allow the Court to resolve preliminary issues or questions  which  once resolved  mean it is unnecessary for the Court to resolve other issues or questions in the proceeding  In such circumstances  splitting the trial can save the Court and the parties the time and expense of dealing with ultimately redundant issues  Here  the respondent s liability for all applicants  claims and quantum of the first applicant s claim could not be described as preliminary issues or questions  However  that does not mean they cannot be determined separately from the quantum of the second applicants  claims  Indeed  it is even possible for an order under O   r   to be made  after the event  of the trial  where the Court has only  at that stage  dealt with issues of liability  see Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd   FCA   at   to   per Gyles J

the trial will result in  savings in time and expense   see Tepko Pty Limited v Water Board   HCA         CLR   at   per Kirby and Callinan JJ and Dovuro Pty Limited v Wilkins   HCA         CLR     Dovuro   at   per Hayne and Callinan JJ  such that it is  just and convenient  for the order to be made  see also Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society     ALR   at   per Branson J   This is not an appropriate case to split the trial in the manner proposed by the first applicant and the second applicants  other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd   There is no evidence that any significant time and expense will be saved by the Court granting the application  The first applicant and the second applicants  other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd  have not discharged the onus of proving that the course proposed is just or convenient so as to displace the usual position that all issues and questions in a trial should be dealt with at the same time  Further  as counsel for Colliers submitted  in cases such as this  where claims in the accrued jurisdiction include negligence  it is not desirable to split the question of liability from the question of quantum  see Dovuro   HCA       CLR   at      The first applicant and the second applicants  other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd  and Colliers have each raised competing claims about the utility of determining separately the quantum of the second applicants  claims  if they succeed on liability  It is not necessary to resolve that debate now because I do not consider that there would be any significant saving of time and expense in the course proposed by Mr Solomon s clients   The application for an order under O   r   is dismissed  The respondent should have its costs of  and incidental to  that application    I

cases cth federal ct  html  The premise which underlies the general course of not splitting trials is that  it is ordinarily appropriate that all issues in a proceeding be disposed of at the one time  see Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott   FCA     Liberty Financial   at     It is incumbent upon the applicant  for the O   r   order  to show why there should be a departure from that course  see

Society     ALR   at   per Branson J citedSave the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The course proposed by the first applicant and the second applicants  other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd  is unusual  It is not uncommon for a trial to be split so that liability is determined before quantum  damages or compensation  But it is unusual for a trial to be split so that one applicant does not have the trial split with respect to its claim  while splitting the trial with respect to the other applicants  claims  These circumstances alone do not dictate that the trial should not be split  However  the Court must tread warily in this area  As Black CJ and Moore J said in Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth   FCAFC         FCR   at      The formulation of separate or preliminary questions is authorised by O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    Cth   But it is a procedure that should be adopted with caution and can be fraught with

  at   per Branson J citedUnity Insurance Brokers Pty Limited v Rocco Pezzano Pty Limited     CLR   The primary reason for this application concerns an agreement between the liquidator of Meadow Springs and a receiver and manager  Mr G Carrello  purportedly appointed by a creditor about the representation of Meadow Springs at the trial  That agreement is conditional on this application being granted  Dismissal of this application  in the absence of successful mediation of that issue  would require the Court to determine the competing claims of the liquidator and the receiver to represent Meadow Springs  Mr Solomon points to authorities  such as Unity Insurance Brokers Pty Limited v Rocco Pezzano Pty Limited     CLR   at     and   which refer to the public interest in disputes being settled  However  the public interest does not require a Court to give effect to a settlement where it would not be appropriate to do so  A Court should not act otherwise than judicially and in good conscience simply to rubber stamp an agreement between those with an interest in litigation
