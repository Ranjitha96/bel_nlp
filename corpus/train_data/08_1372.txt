SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBunnag v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The position advanced by the Respondent Minister  that review is available where there has been a failure to make inquiries  is consistent with the proposition that jurisdictional error may be exposed by a failure to inquire and that such a failure may render a decision manifestly unreasonable  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at      Her Honour Justice Kenny there observed    This takes me to the sixth of the Minister s grounds on the hearing of the appeal  On the one hand  the authorities establish that the Tribunal has no general obligation to initiate enquiries or to make out an applicant s case for him or her  These authorities stretch back over the life of the Tribunal    On the other hand  there is authority for the limited proposition that  in certain rare or exceptional circumstances  the Tribunal s failure to enquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure may render the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation     KB    Wednesbury Corporation     In Wednesbury Corporation     KB at   Lord Greene MR summarised what he saw as a fundamental common law principle when he said  i t is true to say that  if a decision on a competent matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it  then the courts can interfere   He added that  to prove a case of that kind would require something overwhelming   A finding of jurisdictional error on the ground of unreasonableness is rare compared with other grounds  see Applicant M  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per North J  It is sometimes said that there must be something exceptional about the case to attract the ground    Although the position in Australia may differ from that in England  the decision in Wednesbury Corporation     KB   would support the proposition that an exercise of power that is unreasonable in this sense may ground a finding of jurisdictional error        The concept of vitiating unreasonableness has been extended to the manner in which a decision was made  Thus  a failure by a decision maker to obtain important information on a critical issue  which the decision maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available  may be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would proceeded to make the decision without making the enquiry    In this circumstance what vitiates the decision is the manner in which it was made  Since this is a limited proposition  it does not conflict with the larger statement that the Tribunal is under no general duty with respect to making enquiries     Appl d  Bunnag v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per McKerracher J  In circumstances where a migration agent forwards by way of facsimile a cover sheet together with a five page submission and where only the cover sheet is received  it has been held to be unreasonable for the Tribunal not to inquire about the missing pages  SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

argument may be permitted to be raised even though it has been   unequivocally disclaimed   before the trial judge  eg  C A Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd   FCA   at       FCA       IPR   at      The argument there sought to be raised on appeal was an argument important to trade mark law and one where it was conceded that no further evidence would have been relied upon had the argument been pursued at trial   In the present appeal  if the s  R  argument is to be pursued  no further evidence is required to be adduced on appeal  But  and whatever other difficulties would otherwise have been confronted  a fundamental difficulty is that the argument is one without substance followedCoulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A party is

duty to inquire further  The response of the Association was disclosed to the now Appellant and he provided his response consideredMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh     FCR   The Tribunal  it may be noted  had no hesitation in suggesting that an inquiry should have been made of the Association and no hesitation in suggesting that an adverse inference could be drawn against the Appellant in the event that he did not consent to such a course  In the absence of any submission now being advanced that a reasonable apprehension of bias may have arisen on the part of the Tribunal by confronting the Appellant with such a choice  it is unnecessary to make any comment upon the course in fact pursued by the Tribunal  But  having embarked upon its preferred course of making an inquiry of the Association  the Tribunal was thereafter committed to making a further inquiry to resolve the diametrically opposed evidence exposed before it  There may be no general obligation to make inquiries to test the authenticity of documents produced to the Tribunal  eg  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh     FCR    But where an inquiry initiated by the Tribunal itself places the authenticity of documents otherwise before it in issue  further inquiries should be made to attempt to resolve the conflict that emerges  Having confronted the Appellant with the choice of consenting to an inquiry being made of the Association  or an adverse inference possibly being drawn  it was incumbent upon the Tribunal to at least make a further inquiry of the nature now advanced by the Appellant   In the present appeal  it is considered that  as a matter of discretion  leave to raise the argument previously abandoned should be refused  No reason has been advanced to explain why the argument now sought to be advanced was previously abandoned by the now Appellant  In any event  the fifth Ground of Appeal is considered to be without sufficient merit to now warrant the granting of leave   The Application as filed in the Federal Magistrates Court stated the following as one of the grounds there relied upon  The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in its application of s  R  of the Migration Act    Before that Court the now Appellant was represented by Counsel  For whatever reason  that ground was there abandoned followedNBKT v Minister for

constituted a denial of procedural fairness  That submission was resisted by Counsel for the Respondent Minister  It was his contention that by reason of s  B of the   Act   there is no scope for the operation of general requirements of procedural fairness outside the specific provisions of Div   of Pt   of the Act   NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at

Ground on appeal but to raise it by way of an application to amend the Notice of Appeal as filed  that application being filed only shortly before the hearing of the appeal  The purpose of an appeal is to permit the correction of error  not to permit a fresh application to be brought on different grounds occasioned by a change of counsel  Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

consideredSingh v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N  Whether or not it is unreasonable not to make further inquiries may well depend upon the availability of further information and its importance to the factual issues to be resolved  It may also depend upon the subject matter of inquiry and an assessment of the comparative ability of individuals to provide or to obtain relevant information  There may thus be little  if any  scope for a duty upon a decision maker to inquire into facts well known to an applicant and facts within his power to adduce  eg  Singh v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALN N   In refugee cases  reference may also be made to the comparative difficulty in some circumstances confronted by an applicant seeking refugee status and the comparative ability of decision makers to elicit further information  cf Taylor S  Informational Deficiencies Affecting Refugee Status Determination  Sources and Solutions     U Tas LR    And an assessment as to whether further inquiries should be undertaken may also take into account the importance of a decision upon an individual    an administrative decision making process which impacts upon an individual s freedom or a claimed ability to live in freedom may warrant more extensive inquiries being undertaken than one  for example  where the imposition of a modest pecuniary penalty is under consideration   Notwithstanding considerable reservation  it is considered that the Tribunal should have proceeded to make an inquiry of either Mr Nuruzzaman or Mr Hossain or the Association  The issue to which the Certificates were directed was properly accepted by Counsel for the Minister as being centrally relevant to the decision reached  The second Ground of Appeal   construed as it was argued as a contention that the Federal Magistrates Court erred in not concluding that the Tribunal s decision was vitiated by reason of a failure to make inquiries  thus prevails   Any decision which requires a further inquiry to be made  it must be accepted  poses   the risk that an inquiry could never be satisfactorily concluded in the knowledge that another unturned stone may be hiding additional relevant information   McMillan J  Recent Themes in Judicial Review of Federal Executive Action     FL Rev   at    But  in the present appeal  a simple phone call may well

take into account delays and or the number of occasions on which the now Appellant was required to give evidence  caused by the number of occasions upon which the claim was remitted to the Tribunal  in making credibility findings based on alleged inconsistencies at different hearings   ii  further erred in finding that the Tribunal had provided a fair proceeding for the now Appellant when relying on evidence from a third party questioning the authenticity of documents relied on by the Appellant to corroborate his claim to be a member of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat   iii  further erred in finding that the Tribunal s decision was   not unreasonable   in circumstances where the decision was affected by apprehended bias   iv  further erred in finding that the decision of the Tribunal was a privative clause decision  in circumstances where the Tribunal failed to comply with the requirements of ss  A and  AA of the Migration Act    Cth     In addition to these Grounds   the Appellant now seeks leave to amend the existing Notice of Appeal to raise an additional ground  namely   v  a contravention of s  R  of the Migration Act    Cth    When the appeal was called on for hearing  Counsel for the Appellant only sought to press the second and fifth Grounds  The remaining Grounds were abandoned followedSZITU v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In entertaining the current appeal  it is relevant to recall that this Court is exercising appellate jurisdiction  being the jurisdiction conferred by s  d  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  to hear an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  This Court is not exercising the original jurisdiction conferred by the Commonwealth legislature upon the Federal Magistrates Court by s   of the   Act  The original jurisdiction of this Court conferred by s  A of the   Act is    and is expressed to be    a   limited jurisdiction    See  SZITU v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   at   per Greenwood J   No argument was advanced  however  on behalf of the Respondent Minister denying the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the fifth Ground sought to be advanced  The Respondent Minister s position was that this Court should decline to entertain the fresh ground    not as a matter of jurisdiction    but rather as a matter of discretion  No Notice of Objection to the competency of the appeal had been filed  Counsel for the Respondent Minister submitted that leave to raise an argument as to non compliance with s  R  should be refused in circumstances where that was an argument raised for resolution before the Federal Magistrates Court  where the now Appellant was there represented by Counsel  and where  for whatever reason  Counsel then appearing for the now Appellant expressly abandoned reliance upon any alleged non compliance   In the absence of submissions being advanced which properly addressed the concerns as to jurisdiction  and where ultimately it is unnecessary to do so  the present appeal has not been resolved on the basis that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the proposed further Ground of Appeal   If the issue had been pursued  it is considered that it should have been resolved not by a single Judge of this Court but by the Full Court constituted by three Judges followedSZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There was  however  no opposition to advancing the submission as to a failure to make inquiries in terms of the decision being unreasonable  So structured  the dispute centred upon whether or not it was unreasonable not to have made further inquiries  No submission was advanced on behalf of the Appellant  nor could it have been advanced  that the power of the Tribunal to make further inquiries imposed upon it   any duty or obligation to do so   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA   at       HCA       ALR   at     per Gummow and Hayne JJ  See also  SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   per Allsop J  WAGJ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     Nor was any submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister that there was not a line of inquiry which was readily available to the Tribunal and centrally relevant to the task being undertaken  eg  Li v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at       FCA       ALD   at   per Kenny J  The simple submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister was that there was material upon which the Tribunal could justifiably have based its decision and there was  in those circumstances  no duty to inquire further  The response of the Association was disclosed to the now Appellant and he provided his response   The position advanced by the Respondent Minister  that review is available where there has been a failure to make inquiries  is consistent with the proposition that jurisdictional error may be exposed by a failure to inquire and that such a failure may render a decision manifestly unreasonable  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at      Her Honour Justice Kenny there observed    This takes me to the sixth of the Minister s grounds on the hearing of the appeal  On the one hand  the authorities establish that the Tribunal has no general obligation to initiate enquiries or to make out an applicant s case for him or her  These authorities stretch back over the life of the Tribunal    On the other hand  there is authority for the limited proposition that  in certain rare or exceptional circumstances  the Tribunal s failure to enquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure may render the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation     KB    Wednesbury Corporation     In Wednesbury Corporation     KB at   Lord Greene MR summarised what he saw as a fundamental common law principle when he said  i t is true to say that  if a decision on a competent matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it  then the courts can interfere   He added that  to prove a case of that kind would require something overwhelming   A finding of jurisdictional error on the ground of unreasonableness is rare compared with other grounds  see Applicant M  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per North J  It is sometimes said that there must be something exceptional about the case to attract the ground    Although the position in Australia may differ from that in England  the decision in Wednesbury Corporation     KB   would support the proposition that an exercise of power that is unreasonable in this sense may ground a finding of jurisdictional error        The concept of vitiating unreasonableness has been extended to the manner in which a decision was made  Thus  a failure by a decision maker to obtain important information on a critical issue  which the decision maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available  may be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would proceeded to make the decision without making the enquiry    In this circumstance what vitiates the decision is the manner in which it was made  Since this is a limited proposition  it does not conflict with the larger statement that the Tribunal is under no general duty with respect to making enquiries     Appl d  Bunnag v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per McKerracher J  In circumstances where a migration agent forwards by way of facsimile a cover sheet together with a five page submission and where only the cover sheet is received  it has been held to be unreasonable for the Tribunal not to inquire about the missing pages  SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA       FCR   per Allsop J followedSZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Section  R  provides as follows    For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person   a  in determining whether the person has a well founded fear of being persecuted for one or more of the reasons mentioned in Article  A  of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  disregard any conduct engaged in by the person in Australia unless   b  the person satisfies the Minister that the person engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person s claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol   This provision  it has been said    suffers from a lack of clarity   SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       ALD   at   per Spender  Edmonds and Tracey JJ   The contention sought to be raised concerns the fact that the Tribunal correctly concluded that the Appellant s conduct in attending the Ahmadi mosque in Australia was to be disregarded  The Tribunal thus relevantly concluded  Since I do not accept that the applicant is a genuine Ahmadi I am not satisfied that he has engaged in his conduct in attending the Ahmadi mosque here otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee  I consider  therefore  that his conduct in attending the Ahmadi mosque here is to be disregarded in accordance with subsection  R  of the Act   Notwithstanding the assurance provided by the Tribunal that the attendance at the mosque was to be   disregarded   Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Tribunal nevertheless went on to have regard to that attendance when it thereafter concluded    I note for the sake of completeness that  since I do not accept that the applicant has told the truth about his claimed conversion to the Ahmadi faith in Bangladesh  I do not accept that there is a real chance that he will be perceived as a convert to the Ahmadi faith if he returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future   Such a   perception   it was contended  could only have been founded upon the Appellant s attendance at the mosque followedSZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A party is normally bound by the manner in which it has previously conducted its case  Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALJR    Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ there observed  It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case  Except in the most exceptional circumstances  it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party  after a case had been decided against him  to raise a new argument which  whether deliberately or by inadvertence  he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so   Appl d  Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       ALR   at     per Hill  O Loughlin and Tamberlin JJ  Similarly  in Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR   at   Gibbs CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Dawson JJ observed  It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial  If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court  tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish   The importance of litigants  especially in the present statutory context  raising all arguments in need of resolution in the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be underestimated  In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   Lander J referred to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court being exercised by a single judge pursuant to s  AA  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and continued    The appellate process is to correct error  If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal  the appeal court will become de facto the primary court  That is undesirable  It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court  If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court  the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed  That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court s point of view    Moreover  to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court  If new grounds are advanced on appeal  it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court followedTickner v Bropho   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The circumstances in which a decision of the Tribunal should

observed at         The circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to inquire are  I think  strictly limited  It is no part of the duty of the decision maker to make the applicant s case for him  It is not enough that the court find that the sounder course would have been to make inquiries  But  in a case where it is obvious that material is readily available which is centrally relevant to the decision to be made  it seems to me that to proceed to a decision without making any attempt to obtain that information may properly be described as an exercise of the decision making power in a manner so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised it       This decision was subsequently endorsed by the Full Court  Luu v Renevier     ALR    See also  Tickner v Bropho   FCA         FCR   at     per Black CJ  Subsequently in Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA       ALR   at   Wilcox J returned to his earlier decision in Prasad and further observed        It will be a relatively rare case in which a statutory decision is vitiated because of the decision maker s failure to make inquiries  It
