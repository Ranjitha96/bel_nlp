austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs Gleeson CJ and Crennan J observed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at     in all applications for an interlocutory injunction the Court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that As their Honours observed further  these are the organising principles  to be applied having regard to the nature and circumstances of the case  under which issues of justice and convenience are addressed  at    It follows that it is for Ms Jones to satisfy me positively in respect of these issues  Before turning to these issues however it is appropriate to identify the precise relief sought by Ms Jones  and  in more detail  the background to this application  Relief Sought Pursuant to her application Ms Jones seeks relief for adverse action taken against her  and or proposed to be taken against her  by QTAC because of her role in negotiations for an Enterprise Agreement  and for breach of her contract of employment  The permanent relief sought by Ms Jones is as follows      A  DETAILS OF CLAIM         On the grounds stated in the accompanying affidavit or statement of claim  or such other accompanying document as may be prescribed by the Rules  the Applicant claims      Pursuant to section  a  of the FW Act  an injunction restraining the Respondent from taking any action against the Applicant in reliance upon  any allegations against the Applicant made by the Australian Services Union in its letter to the Respondent dated   August   and or  the complaint made against the Applicant by Nicola Bowes dated   August   and or  the anonymous complaint made against the Applicant dated   August   and or  the anonymous complaint made against the Applicant dated   August   and or  the complaint made against the Applicant by Danelle Bayley dated   August   and or  any allegations against the Applicant made by the Australian Services Union in its letter to the Respondent dated   August   and or  the Carol Watson report on Grievances against CEO  QTAC dated   September   and or  Walter Williams  hand written diary notes forwarded to the Applicant by Professor Deborah Terry on about   October     Pursuant to section  b  of the FW Act  the Respondent pay the Applicant compensation for loss suffered by the Applicant because of the Respondent s contravention of the FW Act  Pursuant to section   of the FW Act  the Respondent pay the Applicant a pecuniary penalty for the Respondent s contravention of the FW Act  A declaration that it is a term of the employment contract between the Applicant and the Respondent dated   November   that the Applicant is entitled to be accorded natural justice in any investigation into any complaint or allegation of serious misconduct as set out in clause     of the employment contract and or unsatisfactory performance or misconduct as set out in clause     of the employment contract   A declaration that the Respondent is in breach of the contract of employment between the Applicant and the Respondent by failing to         a  accord the Applicant natural justice in the purported investigation into the allegations and complaints against her  as referred to in paragraph   above               Damages for breach of contract  It is clear that the question whether there is a serious question to be tried imports the obligation of the applicant to establish a prima facie case for permanent relief as explained by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at     There  their Honours said the establishment of a prima facie case in this context meant it was sufficient for the plaintiff to show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial  How strong the likelihood needs to be depends upon the nature of the rights the plaintiff asserts  and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order sought

Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at     Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   followedBP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings     CLR    Fourth  although Mr Spry for Ms Jones urged that the contract of employment should be interpreted as implying a term requiring QTAC to accord natural justice to Ms Jones in connection with any determination of serious misconduct or misconduct by Ms Jones  such an implied term is difficult to reconcile with cl     which specifically provides that QTAC is not required to follow grievance or other procedures in view of the seniority of Ms Jones  position  The Court does not lightly imply terms into a contract which the parties have not thought fit to express  As observed by the Privy Council in BP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings     CLR     in order for a term to be implied the following conditions must be satisfied  It must be reasonable and equitable  It must necessary to give business efficacy to the contract so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it  It must be so obvious  it goes without saying  It must be capable of clear expression  and It must not contradict any express terms of the contract  In light of the detailed terms of cl   which provides for different grounds of termination and associated periods of notice  and a specific provision in cl     excluding review procedures in respect of Ms Jones  employment  it is difficult to see how the implication of term importing the rules of natural justice into the terms and conditions of employment can be justified on any of the conditions described in BP Refinery     CLR    Certainly there is clear authority to the contrary the House of Lords held in Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation     WLR   that  absent statutory intervention  there is no rule at common law that the requirements of natural justice are incorporated into the employment relationship  per Lord

employment citedKimpton v Minister for Education     IR    Fourth  I am persuaded that the commencement of an investigation into the allegations against Ms Jones and the commissioning of the Carol Watson report arguably constituted  adverse action  for the purposes of the FW Act  In particular  I note  Observations of North J in Kimpton v Minister for Education     IR   at   where his Honour said        I do not regard it as hopeless or untenable to contend that the requirement to participate in the investigatory process may amount to a relevant injury or prejudicial alteration  This is not to say that there is not force in the arguments put by Dr Jessup  Those arguments should  however  be resolved at the trial of the proceeding when the matter can be determined after comprehensive argument and in the light of all the evidence available at the trial        Observations of Goldberg J in United Firefighters Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board     ALR   at   where his Honour said in the course of delivering judgment in respect of an application for an interlocutory injunction        I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried on this integer of a contravention of s  K  The laying of the charges imposes a burden on the persons charged to respond to allegations relating to their conduct as employees of the board  I do not consider that one can separate out the effect and consequence of the charges from the fact that they occurred because of the employee s employment by the board  I do not accept that a person charged is not affected in his or her employment until the charge has been proven    The laying of the charges exposes an employee of the board to a potential disadvantage in his or her employment if the charges are ultimately proven  In highlighting these comments of Ryan J in Nixon   FCA         FCR     Mr Spry submitted that his Honour contemplated adverse action taken by an employer in circumstances where a disciplinary charge was brought other than in good faith  and contended that such was the case in relation to the commencement of the investigation against Ms Jones  In my view  placing to one side for the moment whether the commencement of the investigation constituted adverse action against Ms Jones  there is little evidence at this stage to support any claim by Ms Jones that the Carol Watson report was commissioned by QTAC other than in good faith  Indeed  as Mr Murdoch SC submitted  under the Workplace Health and Safety Act    Qld  QTAC is obliged to ensure the safety of its employees at work  which includes protection from workplace harassment  However it is also the case that the possible conflict of authority between Kimpton     IR   and United Firefighters     ALR   on the one hand  and Nixon   FCA         FCR   on the other  suggests another issue which warrants determination at a final hearing rather than at an interlocutory stage

Infrastructure   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn the basis that Ms Jones would suffer an injury from this course of action  I consider that damages would not provide an adequate remedy  Discipline of a chief executive officer for allegedly creating a culture of fear or terror in the workplace  be such discipline in the form of termination of employment or otherwise  is a very serious matter  In my view it is likely that such a course of conduct would have a detrimental effect on Ms Jones  reputation and impose a stigma which could adversely affect her future career prospects  cf comments of Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure   FCA   at      Issue   Does the balance of convenience favour the granting of an interlocutory injunction In relation to this issue  Ms Jones submitted in summary that In response QTAC submitted that the balance of convenience is strongly in favour of denying the interlocutory

Police Federation of Australia v Nixon   FCA         FCR   where his Honour observed that the resumption of an investigation into certain allegations against a senior police officer did not amount to an alteration of the officer s position because  alteration  in this context requires a substantive change in  or reduction of  the advantages enjoyed by the employee in that capacity  Specifically  his Honour found that      Merely to be subject to a disciplinary inquiry or investigation does not  without more  constitute such a substantive change   at  Mr Spry drew my attention to further comments of his Honour in Nixon   FCA         FCR   at     namely      I consider  with respect  that amenability to a disciplinary charge brought in good faith and on a proper prima facie evidentiary basis is a normal incident of employment and does not of itself  before the laying of the charge  constitute  an adverse affection of  or deterioration in  the advantages enjoyed by the employee  in the sense used by the High Court in the passage from Patrick Stevedores     In highlighting these comments of Ryan J in Nixon   FCA         FCR     Mr Spry submitted that his Honour contemplated adverse action taken by an employer in circumstances where a disciplinary charge was brought other than in good faith  and contended that such was the case in relation to the commencement of the investigation against Ms Jones  In my view  placing to one side for the moment whether the commencement of the investigation constituted adverse action against Ms Jones  there is little evidence at

between Kimpton     IR   and United Firefighters     ALR   on the one hand  and Nixon   FCA         FCR   on the other  suggests another issue which warrants determination at a final hearing rather than at an interlocutory stage  In this case Ms Jones has established at least a sufficient likelihood of success in claiming that the commencement of the investigation by QTAC and the subsequent conduct of the investigation were prejudicial or disadvantageous to her position as an employee  Not only had QTAC commissioned an investigation by a third party into complaints and allegations against Ms Jones in circumstances where such complaints and allegations included anonymous complaints or  in the case of allegations by Mr Williams  were allegedly driven by motives relevant to his own position  but QTAC on   November   informed all staff of the existence of the Carol Watson report and that it intended to respond to it  While QTAC did not specifically identify Ms Jones as the subject of the report  in my view the focus of the report would have been well known to QTAC staff  Such publicity is invariably capable of damaging the reputation of an employee or adversely affecting her standing in the organisation  cf comments of Ryan J in Nixon   FCA         FCR   at            Fifth  in her letter to Ms Jones dated   October   Professor Terry responded in detail to issues raised in correspondence from Cooper Grace Ward on behalf of Ms Jones and concluded      Allegations         Having considered the investigator s report and your response to that report  QTAC believes there is evidence that you have acted in a way which amounts to bullying or harassment of employees  If established  QTAC believes the conduct may amount to serious misconduct or misconduct for the purposes of your employment contract  such that QTAC is in a position to terminate your employment either summarily or on notice          The allegations are set out conveniently in the findings in the investigator s report as clarified in this correspondence and supplemented by the matters recorded in Mr William s diary entries  The diary entries  maintained by Mr Williams  contain a number of specific examples of conduct  If the events occurred in the manner recorded by Mr Williams  QTAC would consider many of them to be unacceptable  As is clear from the affidavit of Professor Terry sworn   November    paras     a meeting of the members of QTAC was proposed to make a decision concerning Ms Jones  employment based on the Carol Watson report and Ms Jones  responses to that
