Wang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedLiu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The legislation which relevantly governs the issues raised in this appeal is tolerably clear in its effect  Section  b  provides that the Minister may cancel a visa if satisfied that its holder  has not complied with a condition of the visa   Section   provides that in such circumstances the Minister must cancel the visa if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled  Clause    b  of the Regulations relevantly provided  prior to   October   that for the proposes of s   the Minister must cancel a Student  Temporary  Class TU visa if satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with condition    Condition   requires the visa holder to comply with sub clause    In order to meet the requirements of sub clause   the visa holder must be enrolled in a registered course  see condition  a   That requirement  as with the other requirements in condition   concerns a continuing state of affairs  In effect  the visa holder is not permitted to cease to be enrolled in such a course  Liu v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at       There is an inexorable and somewhat remorseless logic to this sequence of statutory requirements  The Minister has no discretion in the matter  The Regulations as they stood prior to   October   plainly had the potential to operate unfairly  That was subsequently recognised  and clause     was amended appliedLiyanage v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  However  there is clear authority for the proposition that the appellant s case must be considered in the light of the law as it stood at the time of the visa cancellation  Both the delegate s decision and the MRT s decision to affirm that decision took place before the amendments came into effect  The appellant cannot call in aid the ameliorated version of the clause because it has no retrospective effect

appellant s grounds of appeal  as set out in the recent notice of appeal  In the end  however  it seems to me to be unnecessary to determine that question  If this matter were remitted  the MRT would  on the authority of Zhou   still be required to consider his case on the basis of the Regulations as they stood prior to   October     Ms Welshman submitted that new material might be placed before the MRT which might lead it to conclude that the appellant had not ceased to be enrolled at St Augustine s College as from   March    She submitted that it might be possible to attack the process by which the school arrived at its decision to terminate his enrolment   That submission seems to me to have an air of unreality  This case has always proceeded upon the assumption that the appellant s enrolment at St Augustine s College came to an end as at   March    I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which the MRT would  or could  arrive at any different conclusion  It follows that if this matter were remitted  the ultimate result of any reconsideration would inevitably be that the delegate s decision would be affirmed referred toNAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant requires leave to raise new grounds that were not argued before his Honour  The Minister opposes such leave on the basis that it is not expedient in the interests of justice that leave be granted  He submits that the new grounds have no reasonable prospects of success  NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   per Madgwick J  with whom Conti J agreed  at     citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Futility is a well recognised basis upon which a Court will decline to grant judicial review  see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA   at     In such circumstances relief is refused because the applicant has in fact suffered no injustice since the statutory law compels a particular outcome   Had any of the grounds of appeal that are now sought to be agitated before me been raised before the Federal Magistrate his Honour would undoubtedly have rejected the application for judicial review  That is because it would have been futile to grant the relief sought   There is no basis upon which to grant leave to permit the new grounds to be argued  It would be futile to grant such leave  It also follows that no appealable error can be demonstrated in relation to his Honour s decision to dismiss the application for judicial review   The appeal must be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding twenty nine   numbered

html  It is unnecessary to refer to the many cases which say that where there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take a point before the primary judge  and the point seems to be of doubtful merit  leave should ordinarily be refused  See  however  VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     The real question  so far as leave is concerned  is whether any of the grounds sought to be raised has a reasonable prospect of success  That question cannot be determined without also considering the related issue of whether it would be futile to remit this matter to the MRT for reconsideration
