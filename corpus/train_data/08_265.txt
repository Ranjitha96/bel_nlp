toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Limited   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  This approach is consistent with that which was adopted by Mansfield J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Limited   FCA         FCR   at      His Honour accepted that the effect of the decision by the judges in Kotan is that the

 FCAFC         FCR     a Full Court  after referring to Mann v Carnell and other authorities said at       These authorities show that  where issue or implied waiver is made out  the privilege holder has expressly or impliedly made an assertion about the contents of an otherwise privileged communication for the purpose of mounting a case or substantiating a defence  Where the privilege holder has put the contents of the otherwise privileged communication in issue  such an act can be regarded as inconsistent with the confidentiality that would otherwise pertain to the communication appliedDSE  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Their Honours referred with approval to the statement of Allsop J in DSE  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc   FCA         FCR   at     His Honour there referred to waiver coming about when a party entitled to the privilege makes an assertion which is either about the contents of the confidential communication or which necessarily lays it open to scrutiny  Privilege is lost because an inconsistency arises between the act and the maintenance of the confidence  informed partly by forensic unfairness   It is true that Mr Pearson has deployed the existence of the separate settlement team and the fact that the team developed a proposed settlement regime for consideration by the Enforcement Committee  However  I do not consider that the assertions in Mr Pearson s affidavit at   and     fall within the principles referred to above   In particular  I do not consider that the assertions in the affidavit are about the contents of the redacted portions of attachment   referred toHudson v Branir Pty Limited     NTR   The parties agreed that I should follow the course adopted in Hudson v Branir Pty Limited     NTR   by having regard to the context of evidence proposed to be adduced at the final hearing so as to be able to determine the context in which the dispute over the Notice to Produce arises  Some of that material  though not yet formally in evidence  was read out and referred to in open Court and I will refer to the salient parts in my reasons for judgment   Mr Mark Pearson is the Executive General Manager of the Enforcement and Compliance Division of the ACCC  At all times since about July   Mr Pearson has been the most senior staff member of the ACCC with overall responsibility for the investigation of air cargo price fixing   Mr Paul Taylor  Director  Coordination Branch  has been responsible for conducting the investigation on a day to day basis since about July   discussedKotan Holdings Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   The ACCC contends that there is no legitimate forensic purpose to support the production of these documents  The essential reason for this is that the ACCC submits that the only relevant decision in relation to the attack upon the s   notice is the decision of the ACCC itself  decisions of officers or staff cannot be decisions of the ACCC to issue the notice  The ACCC relies upon a decision of a Full Court in Kotan Holdings Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission     FCR     The ACCC also contends that even if there is a legitimate forensic purpose in the production of the documents  certain redacted portions of them are subject to a claim for legal professional privilege  One portion is also said  in the alternative  to be the subject of a claim for public interest immunity   Kotan   on which counsel for the ACCC relied  was an appeal from an order of a single judge striking out a statement of claim seeking relief against s   notices issued by the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission   Crucial to the decision of the Court  and to the ACCC s argument in the present case  were the terms of   of the statement of claim  It pleaded that on a date unknown to the applicants   i  the Commission   ii  the officers of the Commission having the conduct of the matter   iii  the solicitor acting for the Commission  had decided that proceedings should be instituted   Davies and Foster JJ said at   that they accepted that it may be arguable that the power to issue a s   Notice ceases when the Commission has formally resolved that legal proceedings be instituted  However  they said that this was not pleaded in   of the statement of claim  Lockhart J observed at   that the only relevant decision could be that of the Commission itself  so that the allegations that officers of the Commission and the solicitor had decided to institute proceedings could not stand   These were statements of a Full Court and  of course  I accept them as binding  authoritative and correct  But they were made in relation to the pleading that was in issue before their Honours  In my view  their Honours  remarks on this topic  though no doubt central to the question at the final hearing  do not assist the ACCC on the question of the Notice to Produce   What   of KAL s statement of issues leaves open for determination on the final hearing  is who  in the present case  comprised the Commission  In this respect    of the statement is in different terms from   of the statement of claim in Kotan where the pleading specifically referred to persons who could not have constituted the Commission for the purpose of the decision to issue the s   notice   This approach is consistent with that which was adopted by Mansfield J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Limited   FCA         FCR   at      His Honour accepted that the effect of the decision by the judges in Kotan is that the question of whether the exercise of the power is for an improper purpose is to be determined by a consideration of all the circumstances   The precise limits of the power to issue a s   notice were left open in Kotan  Davies and Foster JJ accepted that it was arguable that the power ceases when the Commission has formally resolved that legal proceedings be instituted  at    Lockhart J at   was of the view that the Commission s power to issue a s   notice does not cease and is not abused merely because the Commission has made a decision to commence proceedings   The documents required by   of the Notice to Produce are documents created by senior officers of the ACCC  They go to the questions raised in   of the Statement of Issues and to the questions of purpose raised by the other paragraphs set out above   I reject the submission that they lack a legitimate forensic purpose referred toMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  KAL contends that even if the relevant portions of the document are properly the subject of the claim for legal professional privilege  that privilege has been waived in accordance with the principle stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR     The evidence before me on the hearing was an affidavit of Mr Scott Gregson  the General Manager of the Enforcement Branch of the ACCC  His affidavit deals with the claims of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity   The principle of implied waiver  under which a party who would otherwise be entitled to the benefit of legal professional privilege was stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at     In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd   FCAFC         FCR     a Full Court  after referring to Mann v Carnell and other authorities said at       These authorities show that  where issue or implied waiver is made out  the privilege holder has expressly or impliedly made an assertion about the contents of an otherwise privileged communication for the purpose of mounting a case or substantiating a defence  Where the privilege holder has put the contents of the otherwise privileged communication in issue  such an act can be regarded as inconsistent with the confidentiality that would otherwise pertain to the communication referred toO Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Gageler SC referred me to the line of authorities commencing with Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works     All ER     referred to by Gibbs CJ in O Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR   at    Gibbs CJ there said that the authorities establish that when a Minister

cth HCA  html  The principles of public interest immunity to be gleaned from the decisions of the High Court in Sankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   and Alister v The Queen   HCA         CLR     were set out by Lockhart J in Zarro at     appliedWorkcover Authority  NSW  v Law Society of New South Wales     NSWLR   The principles applicable to legal professional privilege as a rule of substantive law were comprehensively reviewed by McColl JA in Workcover Authority  NSW  v Law Society of New South Wales     NSWLR   at  ff   The following relevant propositions emerge from her Honour s review of English and Australian authority    Once it is established that a legal practitioner was acting in the requisite capacity  a confidential communication will attract privilege even if it contains extraneous matter  as long as it was prepared for the dominant purpose of giving legal advice     Legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law  it may include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context     What matters is whether the lawyers are being asked qua lawyers to provide legal advice     The presence of other matter may raise a question of the purpose for which the document was brought into existence but this will be a question of fact     The privilege should not be undermined by an overly narrow or technical approach to the identification of the relevant advice appliedZarro v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   It is well established that the Court may inspect the documents in question to ascertain whether any doubts about the validity of the claim are made good by an inspection of the documents  see eg Zarro v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   at     The parties agreed that I may inspect the documents  I have done so and am satisfied that the claim for the redacted portion of attachment   is supported   In my view  the claim for legal professional privilege for attachment   is not supported  either by the principles to which I have referred or by an inspection of the document   The principles of public interest immunity to be gleaned from the decisions of the High Court in Sankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   and Alister v The Queen   HCA         CLR     were set out by Lockhart J in Zarro at
