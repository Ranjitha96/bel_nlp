indicates  a person dissatisfied with an assessment has a full right of challenge under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  and the grounds upon which an assessment may be challenged are broad  In Deputy Commissioner v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Richard Walter   Brennan J said  at      The challenge may be made before either an administrative or a judicial tribunal  at the taxpayer s election  on any ground which affects the taxpayer s liability to tax or the quantum thereof including the Commissioner s power to make the assessment to which the taxpayer has objected   In the absence of detailed submissions I will refrain from expressing a concluded view on this point  and I turn to consider the second question  namely  whether a breach of the hearing rule under the Act could arguably give rise to a successful claim for relief under s  B of the Judiciary Act    The High Court considered the effect s   and s   of the Act in Richard Walter   At least a majority of the Court considered that an assessment cannot be challenged on an application under s  B of the Judiciary Act unless one of the three matters identified by Dixon J  as he then was  in R v Hickman  Ex parte Fox and Clinton   HCA         CLR     Hickman   is established  In a well known passage dealing with the effect of a privative clause  Dixon J said  at      Such a clause is interpreted as meaning that no decision which is in fact given by the body concerned shall be invalidated on the ground that it has not conformed to the requirements governing its proceedings or the exercise of its authority or has not confined its acts within the limits laid down by the instrument giving it authority  provided always that its decision is a bona fide attempt to exercise its power  that it relates to the subject matter of the legislation  and that it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body   In Richard Walter   Mason CJ referred to this as a principle which had gained acceptance  at   and Brennan J  as he then was  referred to it as a principle of construction which should be applied to s   of the Act  at    Deane and Gaudron JJ took a similar view to that expressed by Brennan J  Their Honours said  at      That approach should  in our view  be applied to the construction of s   of the Act  The result of its application is that s  s protection from invalidity is applicable only if the purported  assessment   i  is  a bona fide attempt  by the Commissioner or other authorised officer to exercise powers conferred by the Act   ii   relates to the subject matter  of the Act and  iii   is reasonably capable of reference to  those powers  If a purported  assessment  does not satisfy those three requirements  the protection of s   will be unavailable and the purported  assessment  will be invalid  That being so  s   of the Act is inconsistent with s  v  of the Constitution to the extent that it purports to make a certificate of the Commissioner or a Second or Deputy Commissioner conclusive evidence of the due making of an assessment in proceedings in the original jurisdiction of this Court under s  v  in which it is alleged that the assessment does not satisfy one or more of those requirements  In what follows  references to an assessment  or a determination  not being  bona fide  should be understood as encompassing not only failure to satisfy the first requirement but also a failure to satisfy either the second or third   It seems to me that unless Richard Walter has been overruled by the High Court  it is binding on me and the applicant s claim for relief under s  B of the Judiciary Act insofar as it is based on an alleged breach of the hearing rule arising at common law cannot succeed   The applicant submitted that the High Court adopted a line of reasoning in Plaintiff S  v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR     S    which suggests a different approach will now be taken to privative clauses or the like than that taken in Richard Walter   In particular  the applicant submitted that the decision in S  meant a breach of the rules of procedural fairness may not be protected by a privative clause or the like  In S    the Court held that the privative clause in the Migration Act did not prevent judicial review of decisions which involved jurisdictional error   Gleeson CJ said that in the particular statutory context of the Migration Act the privative clause did not operate to exclude judicial review for breach of the requirements of natural justice  at          His Honour did not disapprove of Hickman   he said that as a matter of statutory construction it did not contain the relevant principles for the case before him  He referred to the decision in Richard Walter on two occasions without disapproval  at          Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ said that Hickman was not a principle but  simply a rule of construction allowing for the reconciliation of apparently conflicting statutory provisions   at      There is no general rule as to the meaning or effect of a privative clause  Their Honours said  at      footnotes omitted     Rather  the meaning of a privative clause must be ascertained from its terms  and if that meaning appears to conflict with the provision pursuant to which some action has been taken or some decision made  its effect will depend entirely on the outcome of its reconciliation with that other provision   Their Honours cited Richard Walter without disapproval  Callinan J adopted a similar approach  at         I do not think that the decision in S  throws any doubt on the particular principles to be applied to the provisions of the Act as enunciated by the High Court in Richard Walter   That is  to successfully challenge an assessment  one of the Hickman provisos must be established  That is the view taken in other decisions of this Court  Engler v Commissioner of Taxation  No       ATR   at   per French J  Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Warrick  No       ATR   at     per French J  In any event  even if there was reason to think the High Court might not follow Richard Walter   until that Court overrules the decision I am bound to follow it  I might add that the principles stated in Richard Walter have been applied by this Court on a number of occasions  see Briglia v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   where Kenny J refers to the relevant authorities  I summarise my conclusions with respect to the applicant s fourth claim as follows  There is no arguable case of bad faith  There is no arguable case of a breach of s   and  even if there was  there is no arguable case that such a breach affects the validity of the assessment  Even if at common law there was an obligation to observe the hearing rule in connection with the making of an assessment the decision in Richard Walter means that there is no arguable case that a breach of such an obligation can form the basis of a successful challenge under s  B of the Judiciary Act    In my opinion  none of the applicant s claims are arguable  In those circumstances  an order should be made dismissing the proceeding  I will hear the parties as to costs and other orders   I certify that the preceding forty nine   numbered

if any  to which this section relaxes the well established test enunciated in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   because I have reached the conclusion  by a reference to that test  that this proceeding must be dismissed  In my opinion  no reasonable cause of action is disclosed in the proceeding   To date  the action has proceeded on affidavits  O   r    On the hearing of the respondent s application I received affidavits filed and served on behalf of the applicant and affidavits filed and served on behalf of the respondent  I have treated the statements made by the applicant in his affidavits in a similar way to allegations in a statement of claim  In other words  on this application I have taken them to be correct  I have not attempted to resolve any disputed issues of fact  and the respondent did not suggest that it was appropriate that I do that   I start by summarising the key allegations made by the applicant as set out in two
