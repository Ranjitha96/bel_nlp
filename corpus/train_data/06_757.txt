austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The standard to be applied before a pleading is struck out is that the claim must be  so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed  General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   at    I am conscious that this is an early stage of the proceeding  Bearing in mind what the Amended Statement of Claim states concerning the relationship between the brothers and their companies  I am not prepared to conclude at this stage that the claim of wrongful interference with contractual rights is so untenable that it cannot possibly succeed   As to the question whether or not the claim is properly pleaded  in my view there is no deficiency in the pleading  the material facts are pleaded and particulars are provided in support of the claim  It is simply a question of whether the facts alleged and the particulars provided make out a tenable claim  I am satisfied that the claim is sufficiently arguable that it should not be struck out   I turn to deal with the causes of action concerning the allegation that the third applicant s plant breeder s rights have been infringed  The attack on this part of the pleading was based on submissions which  at least to some extent  involved a misapprehension of what is required by the rules of pleading and the authorities  In the first place  the respondents submitted  by reference to the paragraph concerning the Rich Lady plant breeder s rights allegations  that allegations in paragraphs   to   were in the nature of conclusions of law  In my opinion  that characterisation is not apposite  Paragraphs   to   make allegations of material fact  and are expressed in language which reflects the facts required to be established under ss     and  a  of the PBR Act  in order to establish an infringement of plant breeder s rights  That does not mean that what is alleged is a conclusion of law citedDare v Pulham   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Order   r  a  of the Federal Court Rules  the Rules  requires that a pleading shall contain only  a statement in summary form of the material facts on which the party relies  but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved   The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues and to inform the other parties of the case that they must meet  Dare v Pulham   HCA

Dart v Grace Bros      In Dart v David Jones   King J considered the sufficiency of a pleading and particulars of patent infringement which alleged that the plaintiff retailer had possessed for sale  offered for sale  offered for supply  sold or supplied certain press type sealed containers  His Honour referred to the equivalent provision of the Industrial Property Rules  Vic  and concluded that the particulars were adequate  having regard to the pre discovery stage of the proceedings  at      His Honour concluded that the particulars were sufficient to apprise the other side of the nature of the case they had to meet  King J added that  on the face of it  a marketing company such as David Jones should know what it has sold  or should have access to records from which such information may be ascertained  at   consideredDart Industries Inc v Grace Bros Pty Ltd     IPR   Mr Caine  senior counsel for the applicants  referred me to several authorities dealing with a like provision to O   r   concerning patent pleadings  see s   of the Patents Act    Cth  and Dart Industries Inc v David Jones Ltd   AIPC       Dart v David Jones    and Dart Industries Inc v Grace Bros Pty Ltd     IPR     Dart v Grace Bros      In Dart v Grace Bros  another case involving a retailer  the defendants argued that the particulars alleging the instances of sales of goods were inadequate  Marks J held that it was appropriate  given the early stage of the pleading  to accept the adequacy of the particulars that had been given  In reaching this conclusion  his Honour referred to the fact that more detailed information was not in the possession of the plaintiff  but it was clearly within the possession of the manufacturers and retailers of the products  In addition  Marks J observed that defendants failed to put on affidavit that they did not deal in the subject goods at the relevant time  His Honour noted that defendants were well aware that  they and they alone hold the key to the solution of the problem whether they deal in these goods or not  at     In my view  there are distinctions between the above authorities and the present case  The principal allegation against the respondents is that they have grown trees of the relevant varieties in the course of their orchard and wholesale fruit business and that they have sold fruit of the relevant variety  The facts particularised go no further than raising a case of that kind  While the relevant particulars can support  at least to the necessary threshold stage in a pleading  the allegations in  for instance paragraphs  a   b  and  e  they do not lend any support to the allegations in paragraphs  c  and  d   Accordingly  I propose to strike out the unsupported subparagraphs  c  and  d  in paragraphs   to   of the Amended Statement of Claim   Mr Hess  senior counsel for the respondents  argued that the other allegations of infringement of plant breeder s rights were not supported by material facts  It was argued that the particulars merely identify that trees have been found in existence at the properties and  in the case of Arctic Star and Earliqueen  provide some factual material indicating sales  In my view  a sufficient case is raised by the allegations that have been pleaded and the facts that have been particularised  The respondents  attack on the other aspects of the pleadings concerning contravention of plant breeder s rights therefore fails   The respondents criticised other minor aspects of the pleading in argument  The respondents argued that some illogicality or inconsistency arose because paragraphs     and   of the Amended Statement of Claim allege that each of Fred  Bruno and Tony are and were at all relevant times in effective control of fourth and fifth respondents  Mr Caine submitted that there was no logical inconsistency in alleging that each of the brothers was in effective control of the two companies  Be that as it may  Mr Caine indicated that if pleading requires some attention  it would be appropriate to address this matter by adding some words to paragraphs  f   e  and  e  of the Amended Statement of Claim  to the effect that the relevant individual was in effective control  either alone or in conjunction with his brothers   I consider that the additional words suggested by Mr Caine may assist the clarity of the pleading  however I decline to make a specific finding that the pleading as it stands is illogical or inconsistent in this regard   It was also submitted that there were deficiencies or pleading inadequacies in relation to the allegations of breach of contract in the Amended Statement of Claim  I do not accept these submissions  The breach of contract claims are pleaded at an appropriate level of generality  and the particulars are capable of supporting the allegations
