Tervonen v Finland   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Education Union v Lawler   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In England it has been suggested that Anshun estoppel does not apply to judicial review proceedings  R v Secretary of State for the Environment  Ex parte Hackney London Borough Council     All ER       All ER

Law Litigation     Mon Univ L Rev   consideredBrock v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  But the weakness of the position of Mr Tervonen is the fact that any such challenge which sought to impugn the validity of the request was properly the subject matter of proceedings  in this case  seeking to impugn the decision made by the Minister under s   when giving effect to that request  The present proceeding was not commenced at the outset and before any decision authorised by the   Act was made  the present proceeding was commenced only after all other attempts to challenge the decisions to give effect to the request proved unsuccessful  Compare  Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA   at       FCA       ALR   at    Even if such an application is not itself foreclosed by Kainhofer   it is now too late to allow such an application to be pursued   To now permit such a proceeding to continue would be an abuse of process   The Amended Application should be dismissed pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules  followedCoffey v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA       FCR   An abuse of process  it may be noted  may arise where the same point has been resolved in earlier litigation in another court  even though there may be no res judicata or issue estoppel  Coffey v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA       FCR    It was there concluded that it would be an abuse of process to permit the appellant to pursue proceedings in the Federal Court in respect to the recovery of social security benefits in circumstances where the issue had been canvassed by means of a   comprehensive and multi level process for the review of decisions   under the Social Security Act    Cth   Von Doussa  Branson and Sundberg JJ there observed    An attempt to litigate in the Court a dispute or issue which has been resolved in earlier litigation in another court or tribunal may constitute an abuse of process even though the earlier proceeding did not give rise to a res judicata or issue estoppel     Whether it does depends on the facts of the particular case       Their Honours went on to conclude      In the present case the circumstances are these  First  the Parliament has made available a comprehensive and multi level process for the review of decisions under the Act  Secondly  the appellant has had three reviews under the procedures thus made available  Thirdly  the respondent and his officers have been vexed already by these reviews  especially those before the two Tribunals  In our view  for the Court to allow the appellant to relitigate his claim that the respondent was not entitled to withhold from his benefits the amount of the alleged overpayment  would be to permit its process to be employed in a manner unfair to the respondent  The maintenance of the debt claim is an abuse of process  and should be dismissed followedDutton v Republic of South Africa   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There is a public interest in all litigation  including extradition cases  for all issues to be resolved at the one time  In extradition cases it is thus recognised that a person against whom extradition is sought is   obliged  when challenging extradition proceedings     to bring forward his whole case   Dutton v Republic of South Africa   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   per Wilcox  Whitlam and Moore JJ   The decision of Gyles J correctly  with respect  concluded that the argument sought to be pursued was foreclosed by the decision in Kainhofer  To now permit the same argument to be advanced  albeit against a different respondent  would be an abuse of process as it would be the pursuit of litigation already resolved against a party and litigation having no prospects of success consideredLing v Cth   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The decision thus involves an evaluative judgment as to whether it was   unreasonable   not to have raised an argument in earlier proceedings  See also  Ling v Cth   FCA         FCR   at   per Sundberg J  Wilcox and Whitlam JJ agreeing  citedMinister for Home Affairs v Tervonen   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first two notices have been the subject of a proceeding before a judge of this Court at first instance  Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs  No     FCA       ALD    And there was then an appeal from that decision  Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen   FCAFC       FCR    An application for special leave to appeal was filed with the Sydney Registry of the High Court of Australia on   March     The appeal to the Full Court was allowed in part  Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen   FCAFC       FCR    No argument as to the meaning of the words   accused   or   offence   occurred in the Full Court  No notice of contention was filed on behalf of Mr Tervonen seeking to raise any such argument before the Full Court   The contention of the Minister is simply that the very argument now sought to be raised was either in fact raised and resolved against Mr Tervonen at first instance  notwithstanding the appeal being successful in part  or  if not raised  ought reasonably to have been raised  Moreover  and in the absence of a notice of contention having been filed with the Full Court  the Minister now submits that it is too late for the argument to be raised in this proceeding   Mr Tervonen s contention is equally simple    he contends that for the purposes of s    and s   of the   Act  any conclusion that the warrants  as issued and relied upon by Finland  are in respect to an   offence   is not the task to be undertaken by those provisions  Section   entrusts to the Attorney General the task of reaching an   opinion   and the task entrusted to the Magistrate under s   is that of reaching a state of   satisfaction    It was only the lawfulness of the   opinion   reached by the Minister which was in issue  or so it is contended  Whether the   extradition request   was a request which could lawfully be made  so the argument was understood  was not resolved followedPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   it was concluded that reliance could not be placed upon an indemnity agreement as it should have been earlier relied upon as a defence  Gibbs CJ  Mason and Aickin JJ there observed that   this is not a case of issue estoppel in the strict sense    Their Honours continued at   The critical issue  then  is whether the case falls within the extended principle expressed by Sir James Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson     Hare       ER    The Vice Chancellor expressed the principle in these terms   where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in  and of adjudication by  a Court of competent jurisdiction  the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case  and will not  except under special circumstances  permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest  but which was not brought forward  only because they have  from negligence  inadvertence  or even accident  omitted part of their case  The plea of res judicata applies  except in special cases  not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment  but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation  and which the parties  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time    And at   their Honours concluded      In this situation we would prefer to say that there will be no estoppel unless it appears that the matter relied upon as a defence in the second action was so relevant to the subject matter of the first action that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it       In England it has been suggested that Anshun estoppel does not apply to judicial review proceedings  R v Secretary of State for the Environment  Ex parte Hackney London Borough Council     All ER       All ER    But that is not the position in Australia and an Anshun estoppel may be invoked in a

estoppel  and whether it was   reasonable   for Mr Tervonen to have raised the argument earlier  consideration has been given to the fact that the Applicant is a person detained in custody  But that status assumes little if any importance when it is further borne in mind that he was represented by Counsel in the proceeding at first instance  No explanation has been forthcoming as to why the present argument was not previously advanced   In Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       FCA       FCR   at     Emmett  Conti and Selway JJ noted that Anshun estoppel has been applied to proceedings in the nature of review of administrative action   insofar as Anshun estoppel is aimed at avoiding abuse of process    Their Honours further observed  however  that   there will be instances where  even though there is every reason why the matter should have been raised earlier but was not  there are special circumstances that prevail to permit a party to raise the issue in a subsequent proceeding   at    Where the beneficiary of an Anshun estoppel  their Honours observed    is a Minister of State  who has no personal interest in the

subject of challenge is the response of the Respondent Minister upon receipt of that request  The then Minister issued a notice pursuant to s   of the Extradition Act    Cth  on   August   the Minister also issued an   amended notice   on   April    A further notice pursuant to s   was issued on   November   in respect to the same request   The manner in which Mr Tervonen contends that the request does not comply with the Treaty is understood to be a contention that the request made by Finland was not in respect to   an offence or offences against the law   of Finland within the meaning of  and for the purposes of  s  a i  of the Extradition Act    Cth    Section   of the Extradition Act    Cth  provides as follows  Meaning of extraditable person Where   a  either   i  a warrant is or warrants are in force for the arrest of a person in relation to an offence or offences against the law of a country that the person is accused of having committed either before or after the commencement of this Act  or  ii  a person has been convicted of an offence or offences against the law of a country either before or after the commencement of this Act and   A  there is an intention to impose a sentence on the person as a consequence of the conviction  or  B  the whole or a part of a sentence imposed on the person as a consequence of the conviction remains to be served   b  the offence or any of the offences is an extradition offence in relation to the country  and  c  the person is believed to be outside the country  the person is  for the purposes of this Act  an extraditable person in relation to the country   The argument now being advanced by Mr Tervonen focuses upon the meaning to be given to the words   accused   or   offence    He contends that the extradition request as made  and the supporting material provided  expose the fact that some of the warrants relied upon by Finland were warrants for his arrest for pre trial investigation purposes rather than for trial for   offences     An abuse of process arises where arguments or contentions should have been raised in earlier proceedings  eg  Rivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act    Cth    FCAFC       FCR     particularly at     per Rares J  As His Honour Justice Handley put it  writing extra judicially   i  n the language of the stud book  one might say that Anshun was by abuse of process out of Henderson v Henderson  Anshun Today       ALJ     However that argument may be resolved in relation to that form of relief  the Respondent Minister does not dispute  at least for present purposes  the jurisdiction of this Court to review    for example    whether a person is an   extraditable person   within the meaning of s   of the Extradition Act    Cth  and a person who may be the subject of a notice issued under s   of that Act  It would not be necessary to trespass into the question as to the validity of an   extradition request   where such a request did not seek the extradition of a person for an   extradition offence   or where there was manifestly no warrant   for the arrest of a person in relation to an offence   judicial review could be sought in respect to any subsequent decision or threatened decision which sought to give effect to such a request   The force of the present submission advanced by the Minister  and the comparative weakness of the position of Mr Tervonen  is that such judicial review as is now sought attempts to isolate out and review  as a discrete step in the extradition process  the making of the request    a step which precedes any decision or conduct which is authorised by the   Act  No provision of the Extradition Act authorises the making of a request by a foreign country  the Act simply contemplates what is to happen when such a request is made by an   extradition country     It is presumably for this reason that the present Amended Application seeks not only declaratory relief in respect to the request  but also a   writ of prohibition   prohibiting any effect being given to the request as made by Finland  And it is presumably for the same reason that no reliance has been placed by Mr Tervonen upon the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   At a point of time when all that has occurred is the making of a request  there is certainly no decision   under an enactment   as required by the   Act  In some circumstances  relief in the nature of prohibition against an   officer of the Commonwealth   may  however  be appropriate pursuant to s  B  of the Judiciary Act    Cth

Tervonen had been charged by a competent authority with the relevant offences against the law of Finland  bearing in mind that an extradition treaty must be a treaty relating to the surrender of

further contends  in the alternative  that the present argument has in any event been advanced by Mr Tervonen and also resolved against him by the decision at first instance in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs  No     FCA       ALD    In issue in that proceeding were the first two of the notices issued pursuant to s   of the   Act  In the course of his reasoning His Honour there observed  Did the Finnish warrants satisfy the criteria in s  a i    Each of the Finnish warrants recited that Mr Tervonen was  suspected on probable cause  of one or more offences  Mr Tervonen argued that the language of the warrants did not meet the threshold set in s  a i  of being warrants which were in force for his arrest  in relation to an offence     against the law of  Finland  that the person is accused of having committed   He argued that being suspected on probable cause was something less than being accused of having committed an offence   The argument so expressed is considered to be a different argument to that now sought to be advanced  His Honour thereafter continued    Mr Tervonen argued that  on their face  none of the eight warrants amounted to an accusation that Mr Tervonen had actually committed an offence  or that he was  accused  of having done so within the meaning of s  a i   He said that a mere statement in the warrants that his arrest was claimed and that he was  suspected with probable cause of the following criminal acts  which were then set out was insufficient to satisfy s  a i     In Director of Public Prosecutions  Cth  v Kainhofer   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at     HCA   Brennan CJ  Dawson and McHugh JJ left open the meaning to be attributed to the word  accused  in s  a i  of the Act  noting  It is sufficient to say that  in considering whether a person is an extraditable person under s  a i  of the Act  it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory object of enabling Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties with countries that adopt a variety of criminal procedures different from our own    The Attorney General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law  Williams  v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC       FCR   at     Minds may differ as to the proper construction of s  a i  and whether a particular warrant relied on by an extradition country falls within it  as the decision of the Full Court  which the High Court reversed in Kainhofer   For this reason s  a i  is framed so that the Attorney General must form the opinion that the person is an extraditable person    Having regard to the terms of the warrants and other material before him  I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the opinion that they met the criterion in s  a i   Each warrant asserted that there was probable cause for suspecting that Mr Tervonen had committed an offence and that the court which issued the warrant considered he ought be arrested    In the context of Australian law  a statement that a person has been arrested by the police and charged with an offence is capable of bearing a meaning that the police suspected him or her of having committed the offence and that the arresting officers had reasonable cause for doing so  Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison   HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at   per Mason J  That case dealt with defamatory meanings that might be conveyed to ordinary  reasonable Australians by a statement of a police arrest and charge    Each warrant  on its face  was termed a  warrant   It was issued by a Finnish court for the arrest of Mr Tervonen who was stated to have been suspected on probable cause of having committed an offence  The minister could reasonably form the opinion that each document was a warrant  issued by a Finnish Court  in force  for the arrest of Mr Tervonen in relation to an offence against the law of Finland that he was accused of having committed within the meaning of s  a i   While other persons may not have formed the same view  having regard to the significant differences between the laws of other countries and Australia  to which Mason CJ  Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to in Kainhofer at CLR   ALR   I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the view that each of the warrants was one which met the description in s  a i    To now permit Mr Tervonen to pursue his present arguments would certainly not promote finality in litigation and would now permit him to raise an argument which either has been raised and resolved or an argument which should have been raised before the trial judge in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs  No     FCA       ALD   and on appeal  if necessary  by way of a notice of contention   It is considered that the argument now sought to be advanced by Mr Tervonen was  at the very least    so relevant to the subject matter   of the proceeding being pursued before the trial judge in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs  No     FCA       ALD   that it was   unreasonable   for him not to have relied upon it in that proceeding  Not only were the terms of s  a i  the very subject matter of consideration by His Honour  the terms of the Treaty were also the subject matter of consideration  His Honour thus summarised one of the arguments being advanced before him for resolution as follows    Mr Tervonen has challenged the validity of each s   notice  He argued that Senator Ellison s s   notice was invalid because        Article   of the Treaty Between Australia and Finland Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on   June   as amended by Art   of the Protocol Between Australia and Finland Amending the Treaty Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on   September   contained in Sch   to the Extradition  Finland  Regulations    Cth  required Finland to accompany its request for his extradition with a statement of each offence for which extradition was sought together with a statement of the acts or omissions which were alleged against Mr Tervonen in respect of each offence  Mr Tervonen argued that because in August   Senator Ellison personally did not have before him all of this material  as required by the treaty  he could not issue the notice   Whether or not the warrants were for   offences   the meaning of s  a i  was an issue under consideration  as were the terms of the Treaty  A matter centrally relevant to the   opinion   of the Minister when giving a notice under s   is the   opinion   as to whether a person is an   extraditable person   within the meaning of s    Any argument that a person is not an   extraditable person   because there is no warrant for his arrest for an   offence   is an argument which should have been raised    if it was to be raised at all    when the Minister s decisions under s   were under scrutiny by this Court either at first instance or on appeal  It is an argument which should have been advanced as a reason why the Minister could not have lawfully reached the   opinion   required followedWalton v Gardiner   HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A superior Court will not allow its processes to be used as an   instrument of injustice or unfairness   Walton v Gardiner   HCA       CLR    Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ there summarised the position as follows  at     The inherent jurisdiction of a superior Court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court  which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality  may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness  Thus  it has long been established that  regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance  proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail  Again  proceedings within the jurisdiction of a court will be unjustifiably oppressive and vexatious of an objecting defendant  and will constitute an abuse of process  if that court is  in all the circumstances of the particular case  a clearly inappropriate forum to entertain them  Yet again  proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if  notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel  their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings
