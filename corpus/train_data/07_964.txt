Murdaca v Accounts Control Management Services Pty Ltd   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It does not appear that either party drew her Honour s attention to the judgment of the High Court in CDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR    In that case McHugh  Gummow and Callinan JJ at   indicated that the circumstances in which the discretionary power of the Family Court  and by inference the analogous power of the Federal Court  to receive further evidence on appeal should be exercised are to be determined as a matter of statutory construction and        t  hat matter should not be approached as if the common law procedures which gave rise to the principles laid down in such authorities as Wollongong Corporation conclusively indicate the proper construction of the statutory provision   The only reason for referring here to Mr Murdaca s desire to adduce further evidence on his appeal is that the affidavit which he sought to have received in evidence makes reference to his obtaining a stay of execution of the judgment debt and includes as an annexure a copy of the stay order obtained by him  Although the fact and date of the stay order had been established before the Federal Magistrates Court  the content of the affidavit which Mr Murdaca sought to have received in evidence on his appeal could have been seen as throwing light on at least one of the bases on which he sought to have the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court set aside citedDe Robillard v Carver   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Stone J had earlier made an order that the sequestration order against Mr Murdaca s estate be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal to this Court  or further order of the Court  on certain conditions  Those conditions were designed to ensure that the value of Mr Murdaca s interest in a property  which I understand to be his home  was maintained and that he delivered up vacant possession of that property to his trustee in bankruptcy should his appeal be dismissed  I note  incidentally  that her Honour ought not to have been invited to stay the sequestration order  s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   The appropriate order was a stay of proceedings under the sequestration order   De Robillard v Carver   FCAFC   at       Mr Murdaca has not given vacant possession of the property to his trustee in bankruptcy and has been served with a writ of possession  He now seeks orders allowing him to remain in possession of the property pending the determination of an application made by him to the High Court for special leave to appeal from the judgment of this Court  Presumably  if he obtains special leave to appeal  he will make a further application for an order to maintain the status quo   The appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court was heard by a single judge pursuant to a direction made by the Chief Justice under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Chief Justice has now directed that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the appeal be exercised by a single judge  It seems to me that the order now sought by Mr Murdaca invokes the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to his appeal and thus that I may determine the present application and need not refer it to a Full Court appliedJennings Construction Limited v Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Murdaca s application is  or at least is akin to  an application for a stay to preserve the subject matter of litigation pending an application for special leave to appeal  In Jennings Construction Limited v Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd  No     HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J made clear that such an application should in the first instance be made to the court below which is familiar with the matter rather than to the High Court   In Burgundy Royale Brennan J at   said     In exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction to stay  the following factors are material to the exercise of this Court s discretion  In each case when the Court is satisfied a stay is required to preserve the subject matter of the litigation  it is relevant to consider  first  whether there is a substantial prospect that special leave to appeal will be granted  secondly  whether the applicant has failed to take whatever steps are necessary to seek a stay from the court in which the matter is pending  thirdly  whether the grant of a stay will cause loss to the respondent  and fourthly  where the balance of convenience lies   Subject to the second of the above considerations having no relevance  the above passage provides valuable guidance as to the proper approach to be taken on the present application  I understand Brennan J s reference to the prospect of a grant of special leave being  substantial  to be intended to convey no more than that there should be a real  as opposed to a remote or insubstantial  possibility of special leave being granted   For the following reasons it seems to me that Mr Murdaca s application for special leave could be understood to involve a question of law that is of public importance because of its general application  It also seems to me that the interest of the administration of justice could be understood to require consideration by the High Court of the judgment because authoritative guidance from the High Court  or indeed the Full Court of this Court  is not presently available on that question of law  s  A of the Judiciary Act    Cth    The act of bankruptcy on which the creditor s petition was founded was Mr Murdaca s alleged failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice  The bankruptcy notice required payment of a judgment debt within   days after the service of the notice  At the time of issue and service of the bankruptcy notice  execution of the relevant judgment had not been stayed  see s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act    However  an ex parte stay of proceedings in respect of the judgment was granted within the period of   days after the service of the notice  that is  before the commission by Mr Murdaca of the purported act of bankruptcy on which the creditor s petition was founded   I conclude that Mr Murdaca s prospects of success on his application for special leave are sufficiently real to be characterised as substantial in the sense discussed in Burgundy Royale   HCA       CLR    see   above    Neither the trustee nor the petitioning creditor pointed to any loss or other prejudice that would be suffered if the stay were granted  provided that the value of Mr Murdaca s interest in his home was maintained  After taking the opportunity to review Mr Murdaca s records of payments made by or on his behalf  including payments of rates  utility charges  strata levies and mortgage instalments  the trustee did not oppose the grant of a stay of proceedings under the sequestration order so as to allow Mr Murdaca to retain possession of his home   In considering the balance of convenience I note that the reasons of the Federal Magistrate suggest that Mr Murdaca s only source of income is a disability pension and that his assets are limited to a car valued at   and his interest in his home  His home secures repayment of a mortgage debt  The judgment debt is modest when compared with the equity apparently held by Mr Murdaca in his home  If the property is sold  costs  including agent s fees and commission and trustee s remuneration  will be incurred  Should Mr Murdaca ultimately succeed on an appeal to the High Court it may prove impossible for the status quo to be restored distinguishedLindholt v Merritt

in Schekeloff is open to reasonable question  It is at least arguable  in my view  that a debtor does not commit an act of bankruptcy by not complying with a demand to pay a judgment debt which becomes unenforceable during the period allowed for compliance with the demand albeit that the debt had been due and payable at the dates of issue and service of the bankruptcy notice   Mr Murdaca acted for himself before the Federal Magistrates Court although he had legal representation at the hearing of his appeal  The grounds of appeal set out in his notice of appeal were unhelpfully drawn and not properly particularised  I assume that they were drafted by Mr Murdaca  Stone J understood Mr Murdaca to claim that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to go behind the judgment of the lower court and further erred in exercising his discretion in favour of making a sequestration order distinguishedWiltshire Smith v Mellor Olsson     FCR   The judgments of the Full Court of the
