behalf of the now Appellant as making out his claims  Thus  for example  the Tribunal in its reasons addressed the claims advanced by reason of the Appellant being a Muslim married to a Christian woman  The Tribunal continued       However  the Applicant has presented no information to indicate that members of such a particular social group experience harm in Bangladesh  let alone that any such harm is experienced for reason of their membership of that group  In the absence of any information on which to base a consideration of this claim I am not satisfied that there is a real chance that the Applicant would suffer serious harm amounting to persecution for this reason if he were to return to Bangladesh   There is no procedural unfairness or contravention of any provision within Part   Div   of the   Act in the Tribunal so proceeding  The Tribunal conducts an inquisitorial review of the claim made and has a power   to get any information that it considers relevant   s    But

and Hayne JJ   The Tribunal  moreover  simply did not accept in identified respects the account given  The Tribunal thus finds  for example        I do not accept that the Applicant did  in fact live in hiding in the nine months before he left Bangladesh   I am strengthened in this view by the inconsistency between the Applicant s claimed fear of arrest and the fact that he stayed on in Bangladesh
