http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng   HCA         CLR   Gleeson CJ and Gummow J accepted as  orthodox  the test for actual bias that requires demonstration of a pre existing state of mind which disables the decision maker from undertaking or renders him or her unwilling to undertake any or any proper evaluation of the materials which are relevant to the decision to be made  at   read with    Their Honours observed  at       Decision makers  including judicial decision makers  sometimes approach their task with a tendency of mind  or predisposition  sometimes one that has been publicly expressed  without being accused or suspected of bias  The question is not whether a decision maker s mind is blank  it is whether it is open to persuasion   Neither the conduct of the review nor the sending of the s  A letter  nor the second Tribunal s reasons for decision  nor all of those things taken together  allow the conclusion to be drawn that the second Tribunal approached its task with a closed mind  It was entitled to have regard  as it did  to the claims made by the appellant before the first Tribunal as well as the materials put before it  The appellant was given every opportunity to put her case to the second Tribunal  Her advisor was invited to speak and gave a substantial oral submission  It might rightly be said that the s  A letter raised matters which could properly have been put at the review  It might have been preferable if that had been done  For some applicants however  a challenging approach by the Tribunal at review has itself been seen as an indicator of bias rather than a proper disposition of the inquisitorial function  To the extent that the s  A letter gave the appellant an opportunity to comment upon the Tribunal s provisional views rather than new information relevant to the appellant  it may not have been necessary  In any event there was no basis in the materials before her Honour for the erection of the structure of impropriety propounded by counsel for the appellant  Ground  a  fails   Counsel for the appellant in written submissions contended that the second Tribunal had failed to afford the appellant the opportunity to give evidence and present arguments  relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   The thrust of this argument was that the second Tribunal  by putting its questions relevant to credibility in the s  A letter  did not afford the appellant the opportunity in oral responses to demonstrate her credibility  Counsel put it thus in the written submissions  at       Credibility is very critical issue in refugee matters  The main thing that affected the credibility was the Tribunal s disbelief in the events allged to have happened  That is an issue that arose in the matter but no opportunity was given to deal with this matter during the hearing  It would been appropriate to question the Appellant if the Tribunal did not belive her or question the witness  This was avoided  we submit deliberately   sic  Section   requires  in the circumstances in which it applies  that an applicant for review be invited to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review  That does not impose a duty upon the Tribunal to cross examine the applicant on claims which it may have difficulty in accepting  There was no failure to comply with s   of the Act in this case   This ground rested upon the assertion that the second Tribunal had formed an opinion that the appellant s claims were fraudulent based on the first Tribunal s decision  It had applied its opinion to the appellant s case and not given fresh consideration to the application for review  The short duration of the hearing    minutes  compared with what was said to be a usual average time of between   and     hours  allegedly indicated that the Tribunal  did not want to spend much time during the hearing as it has prejudged the critical issues   sic    An apprehension of bias was said to arise from the fact that a fair minded lay observer would wonder why the second Tribunal would invite the appellant and her sister to a hearing but not ask them about the main incidents alleged to have happened to the appellant before holding that all were fabricated  The way in which it dealt with her advisor s request in relation to the credibility of the appellant would also  it was said  have caused apprehension of bias when taken in combination with the decision record   In my opinion  however  a reading of the transcript of the proceedings and of the express opportunities given to the appellant and to her advisor to put to the second Tribunal anything they wanted to say would have prevented any apprehension of bias arising  Nor does the sending of the s  A letter or the terms of the reasons for decision give rise to such an apprehension
