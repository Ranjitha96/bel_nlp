rather than by a proxy  relying upon the decision of Ipp J in Atkins v St Barbara Mines Ltd     FLR   at    Again  that is a reasonable basis upon which to proceed   I have been taken through the manner in which executive options  employee share acquisition plan shares and executive equity plan shares are to be dealt with and I see no difficulty in what is proposed   There were two aspects of the Explanatory Statement which called for some consideration  The first related to the explanation of the cash and share consideration option  It is not easy to summarise that option in a manner understandable by a lay person  The final result is acceptable  The second arose from the form of the independent expert s report  the Expert Report  which is incorporated by reference in the

   On   May   I made orders convening a meeting of members of SFE Corporation Limited  SFE  pursuant to s   of the Corporations Act    Cth   the Act  and ancillary orders  I said I would deliver short reasons for those orders  These are those reasons   The obligations of ASX  in particular in relation to the Scheme consideration  are backed up by an executed deed poll as is the case in many such schemes  I have remarked in other cases  eg Re KAZ Group Ltd   FCA   that this procedure is not entirely satisfactory as  in the event of default or delay  the shareholder whose shares have been actually acquired is left with the remedy of suing upon a deed poll  It may be that in this case the practical risk is slight  Indeed  the provision of undertakings plus appropriate evidence  if and when the matter comes back for approval  may eliminate the risk for all practical purposes  It seems to me  however  that schemes of this kind would be more acceptable if a procedure be devised whereby a mechanism were built in by which a third party such as a trustee company would have the role of suing on behalf of former shareholders in the target company  An alternative safeguard in relation to the cash portion of the payment would be to set aside a trust fund immediately before the vesting of the shares in the acquiring company  I do not see why shareholders whose shares are divested should run any performance risk so far as the quid pro quo is concerned   My attention was drawn to the provisions relating to ineligible foreign shareholders and to breach of the law or the ASX Constitution   I saw no problem with them   The Implementation Agreement includes exclusivity provisions including  no shop  and  no talk  restrictions  It also provides for a break fee to be paid by one side or the other in certain circumstances which could amount to over   million
