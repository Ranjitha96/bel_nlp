Weti v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toHouse v The King   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the present case  the application for adjournment was not refused but was limited to one day to   November   rather than ten days to   December   which was the preferred term of adjournment of the Deputy President  Whether or not an adjournment is granted and the terms of that adjournment are matters entirely within the discretion of the Tribunal  As was said in House v The King   HCA         CLR   at        The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles  It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that  if they had been in the position of the primary judge  they would have taken a different course  It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion  If the judge acts upon a wrong principle  if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him  if he mistakes the facts  if he does not take into account some material consideration  then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so   The considerations which led or compelled the Deputy President to so limit the term of adjournment have already been canvassed at some length  and it was not submitted on behalf of the applicant that the exercise of the discretion miscarried because such considerations  or any one or more of them  were not relevant  But the applicant submitted that the Deputy President failed to take into account two relevant considerations  namely      The possibility of having the matter heard by another member of the Tribunal  and    the possibility of the matter being heard in the period     December     I have already indicated at   above why I do not think these were real possibilities and that may well explain why the Deputy President made no specific reference to them  In the scheme of things  I do not think the lack of any specific reference to them indicates that they were not taken into account  rather they were overtaken by the fact that the Deputy President only had one possible free day between   November   and   December    apart from   November   and that was   December   and the fact that there were no hearing rooms available up until   December   even if another member of the Tribunal was available to hear the matter at a date later than   November     While there was no express challenge to the Tribunal s exercise of its discretion in limiting the terms of the adjournment to one day in the form of a ground of review  a considerable amount of time was spent in argument on the Tribunal s alleged failure to take these two matters into account  If there was such a ground of review  I would not be prepared to conclude that the Tribunal s exercise of discretion miscarried by reason of such matters referred toKuswardana v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     ALR   The fact that this alleged failure had not been raised in the Tribunal was no bar to its qualification as an error of law on the part of the Tribunal according to counsel for the applicant  In this regard I was referred to what was said by Bowen CJ in Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at   see too Fox J at   although Deane J at   was troubled as to whether the appellant s failure in that case to raise the issue in the Tribunal precludes the intervention of the court on appeal referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for the Minister accepted that failure to consider a relevant consideration is  as Mason J explained in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    one instance of an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of ultra vires administrative action  but noted that failure by a decision maker to take into account relevant considerations is only an error where the statute makes the considerations ones which the decision maker is   bound to take into account in making that decision  consideredSales v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant s case on this ground relied almost if not entirely on the decision of Allsop J in Sales v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   where his Honour held that in the facts and circumstances of that case  the   day response period specified in a letter to Mr Sales  informing him that he was liable to the possibility of visa cancellation and deportation  was  plainly inadequate for him to address the task before him   at   and  was not procedural fairness   at     Counsel for the applicant submitted that although Sales involved a decision made by the Minister personally  the circumstances of this case include all of the above criteria  Furthermore  like the applicant in Sales   neither the applicant nor her mother could be described as  people of wide or deep resources  or otherwise of significant education   at    In Sales   Allsop J described Direction   as  a comprehensive and careful document  and that the  task to prepare material for a consideration of such matters  objectively understood  is wide reaching and significant   at    I was referred to the remarks of Allsop J at   to   with the submission that they are all applicable to the applicant with the exception that she has not spent  most  of her adult life in prison  however  she has certainly spent a significant part of her adult life in prison   Counsel for the applicant further submitted that the ground of review should be rejected for the following reasons      As neither the Act   nor Direction No    either expressly  or by implication  mandate the consideration of this factor  the failure to take it into account cannot be an error     Any procedural failings by the delegate of the Minister in reaching the original decision could not be relevant in any sense as the Tribunal was making the decision afresh and so any such unfairness was able to be remedied     It is not apparent that there was any relevant unfairness by the delegate  Unlike the case in Sales   this was the second time the applicant had to explain why her visa should not be cancelled  the applicant did not complain that she was unable to respond effectively and she took the opportunity to make submissions  similar in substance  to those later made by her solicitor   In the facts and circumstances of this case  I do not think the   day response period in the NOICC denied the applicant procedural fairness  While there are some factual similarities between this case and Sales   they are more apparent than real  Importantly  this was the second time within approximately   months that the applicant was called upon to respond to such a notice and her responses in that case resulted in a warning  It was made clear in the NOICC that in making a decision whether to cancel the applicant s visa under s   of the Act   the Minister or delegate would take into account  amongst other things  the information the applicant supplied on the earlier occasion   This ground of review cannot be sustained   This is undoubtedly a factor to which the Tribunal should have had regard in terms of Direction No    see    a  thereof  The applicant submitted that the Tribunal failed to give proper consideration to the length of time the applicant  a New Zealand citizen  had lived in Australia continuously  there is little discussion in the Tribunal s decision concerning the length of time the applicant has resided in Australia and the extent of her ties to her family and the disruptive effects of her visa cancellation   It was further submitted that the Tribunal failed to consider the effects of the visa cancellation on the applicant s ties to her siblings her half brother and her half sisters  I was referred to Sales in which Allsop J suggested that the  bests interests of children  dealt with at     of the Direction  could also include children who are not direct issue of the person concerned such as the  extended family of the applicant  including nephews and nieces   at    Finally  the applicant submitted that although the Tribunal asserted that there was no evidence  about the Applicant s relationship with other members of her family or members of the community   at   there was little inquiry made by the Tribunal into the nature of those relationships when the applicant gave evidence notwithstanding that the applicant was unrepresented   However  it is apparent that the Tribunal did give this factor consideration  At   it said     Disruption would result to the Applicant s family  Her parents reside in Sydney  She maintains that she has a good bonding now with each of them although it is noted neither attended the Hearing  The mother affirmed her   statement  The father did not provide any information to the Tribunal  There was not any evidence about the Applicant s relationship with other members of her family or members of the community   I also reject the inference  implicit in the submissions that there was little inquiry made by the Tribunal into the nature of those relationships when the applicant gave evidence  that the Tribunal was in some way under a duty to make inquiry because the applicant was unrepresented consideredSullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   I was referred to what was said by Deane J in Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   at   namely      Section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act provides  for present purposes  that  the Tribunal shall ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his case   In dealing with an application for review  the Tribunal is plainly under a duty to act judicially  that is to say  with judicial fairness and detachment  In these circumstances  the requirement contained in s   that the Tribunal shall ensure that a party to the proceedings before it be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case constitutes statutory recognition of an obligation which the law would  in any event  imply  Where a Tribunal is under a duty to act judicially  the principle that a party must be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case is at the heart of the requirements of natural justice which it is obliged to observe  see R v Moodie     ALR   at     A little later  at   his Honour said     A refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting his case      The absence of any application for an adjournment does not  however  necessarily conclude the issue adversely to the appellant  The failure of a tribunal which is under a duty to act judicially to adjourn a matter may  conceivably  constitute a failure to allow a party the opportunity of properly presenting his case even though the party in question has not expressly sought an adjournment   When pressed as to what the Deputy President should have done in the circumstances but did not do  counsel for the applicant submitted       First and foremost he should have canvassed the possibility of having the matter heard by another member of the Tribunal    As I have indicated at   above  presumably the Deputy President did not undertake any such canvassing because he was aware that no hearing rooms were available on any day up until   December          H e should have canvassed the dates  between   December of that year      and   December as to whether the matter could be heard by himself or another member of the Tribunal    As I have indicated in   above  my reading of the relevant excerpt from the transcript indicates that the Deputy President did not have any days available from that moment until   December   other than the next day   November   and possibly   December    That last mentioned date was not a choice because of lack of availability of a hearing room  and the possibility of the matter being heard by another member of the Tribunal in the   to   December   period was out for the same reasons   Finally  the applicant submitted that the subsequent conduct of the hearing  together with the Deputy President s initial instinct to accede to the request to adjourn the matter  only serves to emphasize the merits of the adjournment application the reason the Deputy President chose not to do so being apparently based entirely on pragmatic considerations regarding room availability   While it is clear that a refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting his case see Deane J in Sullivan at   whether it does or not depends on what underlies the request for an adjournment  For example  and this is close to the example cited by Deane J in Sullivan   if a party makes application for an adjournment to enable him to procure a particular person as a witness  refusal of that application may well constitute such a failure  The refusal of an application for an adjournment predicated on a lack of legal representation and a need for time to secure such representation  as in the present case  may also constitute such a failure  but then again it may not  It will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case  in particular how the lack of legal representation impacted  adversely  on the ability of the applicant to present his her case
