Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedMZWMQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  McInnis FM noted that the Tribunal had made a series of adverse findings in relation to the appellant s credibility  His Honour observed that those findings  free of jurisdictional error  were largely incapable of supporting a decision that there had been an error of law  In relation to the husband s inconsistent evidence  McInnis FM relied on the decision of Marshall J in MZWMQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     MZWMQ   to determine that the appellant s husband was an applicant before the Tribunal and that accordingly  s  A b  of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act  operates to excuse the Tribunal from having to give written notice to the appellant of the evidence given by her husband  In any event  two significant findings in relation to the appellant s credibility were made on matters where the evidence of the appellant s husband was not relevant  first  the implausibility that someone in the appellant s position would be regarded as a political threat  and secondly  the fact that the appellant did not claim to be a refugee earlier   Section  A a  of the Act requires that the Tribunal provide to the appellant particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming the decision that is under review  However  the issue before McInnis FM was whether the husband s evidence  as a dependant applicant  fell within the exception in s  A b  of the Act in that it was information that  the applicant gave for the purposes of the application   McInnis FM relied on MZWMQ to reach the conclusion that the husband s evidence fell within the exception in s  A b   The first respondent contended that the facts in this case are similar to those considered by Marshall J in MZWMQ   As a result  the Tribunal was not required to given written notice to the appellant of her husband s inconsistent evidence   Counsel also referred to two additional cases that address the status of dependant applicants  In Peniche v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Weinberg J treated dependant family members as applicants in their own right for the purposes of s   of the Act  the section which gives the applicants an opportunity to give evidence to the Tribunal  However  in VBAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Gray J interpreted s  A b  widely so as to include evidence given by witnesses called on behalf of the applicant to the Tribunal  As counsel for the respondents noted  the proposition that the exception in s  A b  extends to all evidence given on behalf of the appellant  including that given by other unrelated witnesses  goes further than MZWMQ   and beyond the issue raised by this case   I am not satisfied that I am only entitled to depart from the decision of Marshall J if I consider that his Honour was plainly wrong  There is no doubt that this proposition applies when a Full Court of this Court is asked to depart from a previous decision of the Full Court  But there seems to be no authority extending the principle to the decision of a single judge who was exercising appellate jurisdiction  So much was conceded by counsel for the respondents  The view I have reached is that I should accord MZWMQ the same authority and respect that I would accord other single judge decisions in this Court  and that I should not depart from it unless I am satisfied that it was wrongly decided   The appellant and her husband are joint applicants in the proceedings before me  the appellant s application and the husband s dependant application having been combined pursuant to reg  c   I infer from the Tribunal s reasons that the appellant was present when her husband gave evidence to the Tribunal  The Tribunal specifically notes that the appellant was asked about discrepancies between her evidence and her husband s evidence  It also notes her responses that her husband was a very forgetful person and not very good with dates  and that her husband had confused the political parties that they were supporting   In my opinion  it is consistent with the object and statutory purposes of s  A b  to construe its reference to an application as including joint applications which are combined pursuant to the Regulations   In all the circumstances  including the reasons put forward by counsel for the respondents  I am not satisfied that MZWMQ was wrongly decided by Marshall J  I propose to follow MZWMQ and apply it in this case  Accordingly  I reject the appellant s claim that the Tribunal erred in not giving particulars of the husband s evidence to the appellant in the manner contemplated by s  A a   As a joint applicant  the evidence given by the husband fell within the exception in s  A b    It also follows that  in my view  the Federal Magistrate did not err in rejecting the claim based on s  A citedAbebe v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The first respondent contended in written submissions that it is well

whether the appellant s claims were true and is not required to ask the appellant to clarify any issues that the Tribunal finds to be vague  confused and contradictory  The Tribunal assessed the appellant s claims and set out its reasons why it did not accept them in the first respondent s submission  there can be no suggestion that the Tribunal is required to act otherwise  Additionally  the first respondent submitted that a finding on a credibility issue that was open to the Tribunal on the material before it does not give rise to an error of law  see Mashyekhi v Minister for Immigration

Court to indicate that the decision of Marshall J was plainly wrong  see VJAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     Additionally  counsel submitted that the statutory context of s  A b  supports Marshall J s interpretation  Counsel referred me to Pt IV of Sch   of the Migration Regulations    Cth   the Regulations     Regulation  c  provides that  a pplication by a person claiming to be a member of the family unit of a person who is an applicant   may be made at the same time and place as  and combined with  the application by that person   Counsel also sought to rely on s  A ab  of the Act which defines  application for a protection visa  for the purposes of the section as including  an application for a visa  a criterion for which is that the applicant is a non citizen in Australia who is the spouse or a dependant of a non citizen in Australia  i  to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as

issue raised by this case referred toVBAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appellant filed a notice of appeal on   October   setting out the following grounds of appeal     a  The evidence of the appellant before the Tribunal was  vague  confused and contradictory in relation to many aspects of her claim  and the learned Magistrate found that the Tribunal s adverse finding regarding the appellant s credibility was open to it  and hence there was no error in law          However  the decision of the learned Magistrate indicates that he adopts and applies the decision in VAT v  MIMIA   FCAFC   which decision also encompasses the denial of procedural fairness as a jurisdictional error  The point is made that if the Tribunal found the appellant s evidence to be vague  confused and contradictory in relation to many aspects of her claim  then the Tribunal ought to have clarified the issues that were vague  confused and contradictory rather than making an adverse finding as to credibility without clarification  This assumes importance in relation to the Tribunal findings about the KKB           b  The appellant s credibility was a deciding factor and the Tribunal relied on the appellant s husband s evidence to decide that issue and the appellant s husband was an applicant before the Tribunal  the learned Magistrate gave the incorrect interpretation to section  A  and   in that the Tribunal had no legal obligation to put the appellant s husband s evidence to the appellant in accordance with section  A of the Act  In saying that section  A b  of the Act operates to excuse the Tribunal from giving notice  the learned Magistrate has not clarified what the word  application  refers to in the said sub section  A b            c  In seeking to rely on the decision in VBAP of   v  MIMIA   FCA   to substantiate that the Tribunal has not erred in its approach to section  A in that in any way it would not have altered the findings of the Tribunal  see paragraph   of the learned Magistrate s judgment  what the learned Magistrate failed to see was that the finding on these two issues were crucial to the appellant s case   In contentions of fact and law filed on   December   the appellant again asserted that she was persecuted and threatened due to her membership of the Cyprus Women s Group  She submitted that there was a lack of state protection available to her and the police had failed to investigate the threats made  The appellant contended that her husband was unable to retain employment as a result of her political involvement in the Cyprus Women s Group and the fact that he voted against the incumbent government  Additionally  the appellant asserted that she underwent major surgery on   December    None of these contentions  however  were subsequently pressed as independent grounds of appeal   The appellant appeared before me on   February   with the aid of an interpreter  I invited the appellant to identify any reasons why  or any facts or circumstances that supported her contention that  the decisions of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate were wrong  At the hearing  the appellant did not add anything of substance to the matters referred to in the notice of appeal and the contentions of fact and law   The respondents advanced an alternative argument to address the contingency that the husband s evidence might fall outside the exception in s  A b   The respondents submitted that McInnis FM was correct in applying the decision in VBAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA      VBAP     In VBAP   the Tribunal had rejected the applicant s claim on four separate bases  North J accepted at   that  in relation to one of these bases  s  A may not have been complied with  However  his Honour held that  despite this non compliance  he could not accept a submission that the Tribunal s decision must be set aside  His Honour distinguished SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR     SAAP   pointing out that SAAP was a case in which the only ground relied upon was a ground on which jurisdictional error was established  In his Honour s view  SAAP does not stand for the proposition that  if there is a breach of s  A in relation to one ground upon which a decision is made  and there exist one or more grounds upon which the decision is not or cannot be impeached  the decision nevertheless fails referred toSAAP v Minister for

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It is unnecessary for me to deal with this argument because I have reached the conclusion that s  A does not apply to the husband s evidence  In these circumstances  and having regard to the recent decision of the Full Court  Moore  Weinberg and Allsop JJ  in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC     I wish to reserve my opinion on the argument  both generally and in relation to its application in a case where the allegedly independent findings underpin a conclusion that the applicant s claims are not credible citedAbeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As Kenny J observed in Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     on an appeal conducted by way of re hearing  such as an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court   the powers of an appellate court are exercisable only if the appellant can demonstrate that  having regard to the evidence before the appellate court  the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal  factual or discretionary error   The appellant has failed to point to any error in the decisions of the Tribunal and McInnis FM   In my opinion  for the above reasons  the notice of appeal and the appellant s submissions  both written and oral  do not disclose any error in the decision of McInnis FM  or for that matter in the decision of the Tribunal   I dismiss the appeal and order that the appellant pay
