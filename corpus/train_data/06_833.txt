theirs underwent repair even though they were not out of pocket for that hire  That Court applied The Greta Holme   AC   on the basis that injury to non income producing property which deprives a

Portugal v Waterlow   Sons Ltd   UKHL       AC   In Banco de Portugal v Waterlow   Sons Ltd   UKHL       AC   at   Lord Macmillan held that where the sufferer from a breach of contract finds itself in consequence of that breach placed in a position of embarrassment  the measures it may be driven to adopt in order to extricate itself ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the party whose breach of contract had occasioned the difficulty  His Lordship continued     It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it  but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency  The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures  and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken  appliedCarslogie Steamship Co Ltd v Royal Norwegian Government   UKHL       AC   The principle applicable to the right of a shipowner to recover from a

by resorting to other expedients at a measurable outlay   I am satisfied that it was necessary for Consort to charter the Noumea Express as a substitute vessel in July and August   while the Gazelle Coast underwent the extensive repairs and restoration work then undertaken  I am of opinion that the claim for the hire of the Noumea Express is reasonable  Mr McInnes noted that some repairs carried out at this time were not referable to any purchase defect  I have considered those items and they appear to me  based on their description  to be of a relatively minor or routine nature and to be of a kind that could be undertaken concurrently with the major work  A shipowner can have other work performed while its vessel is undergoing repairs caused by a wrongdoer without being obliged to account  as it were  for extra costs incurred  see Carslogie Steamship Co Ltd v Royal Norwegian Government   UKHL       AC   at     where Viscount Jowitt accurately summarizes the authorities referred

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Because Consort did not become the legal or beneficial owner of the ship at the time at which the purchase money of USD    m was paid to the vendor  the usual measure of damages in tort  being a comparison between the price paid and the value received  cannot be applied  Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ  see too at   per Murphy J      per Wilson J      per Brennan J   I am of opinion that  for the same reasons  damages for any claim in contract in the circumstances of a case like the present cannot be assessed on that comparative basis  This is because J Mac s contract obliged it to provide a prepurchase survey report which was prepared with reasonable care  It could be expected  as I have held  that Consort would either itself  or through a subsidiary  enter into a contract to purchase the ship  The damage which was in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the prepuchase survey contract was entered into must have been the loss that would flow to whomever was the purchaser  If that were not Consort  then Consort could only have been contemplated to be able to recover a different loss that it suffered itself   In Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   Mr and Mrs Gould were the guarantors of their company  Gould Holdings Pty Limited  The Goulds had entered into a contract to buy property induced by fraudulent misrepresentations made by the vendor  The contract provided for the purchaser to be a company to be incorporated  which  in the event  became Gould Holdings  By the time of the trial  Gould Holdings was in liquidation  The liquidator gave evidence that he had no funds and there was no substantive prospect of the company bringing an action to recover damages for the deceit caused by the vendor  The High Court made it clear that it was not open to the Goulds  as shareholders  to sue for the loss which their company had suffered by purchasing the property at a price much greater than its true value  However  the Court held that the Goulds could recover damages for the loss which they personally had suffered and which was separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the company   CLR at     per Gibbs CJ      per Murphy J      per Wilson J      per Brennan J    Even though the basis for recovery under s   of the Act is not governed by common law rules of causation or remoteness or by the measures of damages in contract or tort  I am of opinion that in the present case it is still necessary to identify whether Consort has suffered some loss distinct and separate from that of its wholly owned subsidiary  Rho Beta   by entering into and completing the contract of the purchase of the vessel   Consort itself paid for all of the repairs both before January   and after that time when it had assumed the legal and beneficial ownership of the ship  Accordingly  Consort claimed that it suffered the damage in respect of the cost of repairs and restoration as well as the charter hire of the substitute vessels   Having regard to the evidence of the nature and extent of the corrosion and other damaged condition of the ship at the time of purchase  it is clear that if the vessel were to be operated satisfactorily and to be maintained in class  it would have been necessary for extensive repairs and restoration work to be undertaken immediately or in the foreseeable future following completion of the purchase  And  likewise  it would have been necessary for the vessel to be taken out of service while the majority of that work was undertaken so that a substitute vessel or vessels would need to be hired to take the Gazelle Coast s place in Consort s business operations   While it may have been true that just as in Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   the subsidiary  Rho Beta   may have had a right of action against the wrongdoer  J Mac  the fact is that without the financial support of the parent  Consort  the right of action could not be realized  In the meantime  Consort had a business to run and needed the ship back in service to do so  Consort s ability to recover its loan  being the purchase price of the vessel  from Rho Beta   was substantively diminished by at least the loss in the value of the ship that had to be recognized in Rho Beta  s books  That loss  may have been offset by the contingent asset of Rho Beta  s cause of action against J Mac but  as I have said  the exercise of that right depended upon Consort causing it to occur  Perhaps  that would have been a legally correct and advisable course  but  for the reasons given by Lord Macmillan  the course embarked on by Consort was also reasonably open to it   The purpose for which Consort had engaged J Mac s services was to receive advice as to the condition of the vessel so that it could be employed in Consort s business  Whether it was employed directly or through one of Consort s subsidiaries mattered not  Once the vessel required  in order to maintain class and efficacy as a trading vessel  the repairs and restoration work  they had to be effected if it were to be available in Consort s business  And  Consort had to spend directly or indirectly the money for those repairs or else it would have lost the whole of the investment made   The position here is similar to that which Gibbs CJ pointed out in Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at      However it would be quite unreal to determine the extent of the Goulds  loss on the basis that Gould Holdings would recover damages for deceit immediately after the date of settlement of the contract of sale  There was not the least likelihood that such an event would occur  Moreover  there was not the slightest intention that the amount owing by Gould Holdings should be repaid to the Goulds until the company had been trading profitably for some time   Gibbs CJ went on to say that the fact that the company might have had rights against the wrongdoer  did not mean that the Goulds were precluded from enforcing their own personal rights   CLR at    His Honour had held that the direct consequence of buying the resort was that Gould Holdings had to procure  in that case  the necessary funds to enable the business to carry on and for that purpose to obtain the necessary guarantees from the Goulds  It was foreseeable that that would occur and therefore it was not unreasonable for the Goulds to have given the guarantees   The situation here is stronger in Consort s favour since it itself was the principal debtor to ANZ  and Rho Beta   was  in effect  a surety for the repayment by Consort of the loan   Mr McInnes said that in January   ownership of the vessel was transferred back to Consort and the loan and security documentation was amended  He did not elaborate on precisely how that amendment occurred but I infer that the amendments were to reflect the fact that Rho Beta   no longer had any part in the arrangements between Consort and ANZ for the provision of funds with which to first  acquire and  secondly  repair and restore the vessel  He said     Effectively no money changed hands between Consort and Rho Beta    Rho Beta   now has no assets   There is  of course  in a situation such as the present  a danger that by awarding Consort the damages claimed  J Mac could be put in the position of having to pay Rho Beta   the same damages at a later time if other proceedings had been taken by Rho Beta    But  Mr McInnes swore that Rho Beta   had no assets  I must therefore infer that the asset comprised in its right of action against J Mac was no longer available to Rho Beta   at   July   when he swore his affidavit  Again  the evidence is not in the most satisfactory state  but I am of opinion that even if Rho Beta   retained at that time the causes of action it may have had against J Mac for its prepurchase survey reports  in Rho Beta  s hands that right of action was as valueless as Gould Holdings  right of action was in Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at        The likelihood of Consort recovering anything from Rho Beta   in respect of the losses Consort has sustained is  on the evidence before me  negligible   It follows  that Consort has established that it has suffered loss and damage in the sum claimed because any cause of action it may have against Rho Beta   is valueless and it  Consort  suffered the loss and damage of the cost of repairs  restoration and the hire of substitute vessels itself  Accordingly  judgment should be entered for the full amount claimed together with interest on the basis which I have indicated   The amount for which judgment will be entered is based on the following calculations as to interest and currency conversion in a calculation prepared by the solicitors for Consort     a  expenditure in the schedule in Australian dollars        b  expenditure in the schedule of USD     converted at the respective dates of payment to  the Australian dollar equivalent              c  interest item

been committed or the contract had been performed  Haines v Bendall   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ  As their Honours noted  compensation is the cardinal principle and the  universal  rule is that a plaintiff cannot recover more than it has lost   CLR at     I find that when the prepurchase survey contract was made it was in the contemplation of the parties  and of a reasonable person in the position of J Mac  that Consort would be likely to suffer loss if the survey results were reported negligently  Consort s loss would be that it had purchased the vessel at a price that was far greater than its true value or alternatively would have to pay for the cost of repair and restoration so that it would be brought to a condition conformable with that in the advice given by J Mac  And  I find that a reasonable person in the position of J Mac would have realized that Consort would be likely to be exposed to such losses either directly  were it to acquire

expectation loss   Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   courts take a similar approach to determining the loss or damage as I have just taken on the contractual measure which is appropriate in this case  namely the difference between the price and the true value  see Potts v Miller   HCA         CLR    However  that measure of damages is treated by the courts as a flexible rule of practice  which may not be appropriate to the quantification of damage in each case   HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at               The ultimate award  including interest  could  of course  be discounted back to reflect it as at   July   when loss was incurred on completion of the purchase  I am of opinion that such a method would

is sufficient to make the award as I propose   HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astoland   HCA         CLR   at                Doing the best I can  I find that such an award provides a just

au au cases cth HCA  html  I find that had J Mac properly reported in a prepurchase survey to Consort that the vessel had the deficiencies or a number of them which have been admitted as existing in the defence  Consort would not have purchased the vessel  In arriving at these findings I have also had regard to the evidence in the affidavits of Messrs Pasma  Woodall and Barrie as well as to so much of the affidavits of Messrs Perrott  Bleasdale  Dowell and McInnes and Capt Adhikari as was read  Accordingly  Consort s claim for damages is to be approached upon the basis that the cases have described as a  no transaction  case   Kenny   Good Pty Limited v MGICA   Ltd   HCA         CLR     Thus  in Kenny   Good Pty Limited v MGICA   Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           Kirby and Callinan JJ held that if a correct valuation had been given  there would have been no loss suffered by the mortgage insurer because it would not have provided mortgage insurance at all  They said that this approach gave content to  or defined  the contractual obligation to exercise reasonable care and the tortuous duty of care  It did this by having regard to the kind of loss or damage in respect of which the contract breaker or tortfeasor was required to exercise reasonable care   In that case the valuation included a representation that the property was a suitable investment for trust funds  on the basis of the valuation  for a term of     years  Kirby and Callinan JJ said that the valuer had an obligation and a duty in giving the valuation to exercise reasonable care to enable the mortgage insurer to decide whether to enter into an insurance transaction at all  The obligation or duty was breached if an accurate representation would have suggested that the mortgage insurer should not have entered the transaction  the other justices took a similar approach    CLR at         per Gaudron J      and     per Gummow J  but see per McHugh J at      The valuer was held liable for the whole of the loss which the mortgage insurer suffered  some of which resulted from a later fall in the property market   Here  the advice sought from the professional surveyor related to the condition of the ship and its appropriateness for purchase by Consort  It was clearly within the contemplation of Consort and J Mac at the time their contract was entered into that Consort would expose itself to financial loss if it acted on J Mac s advice and J Mac s prepurchase survey were inaccuracte  Such loss could occur if Consort purchased the ship itself or caused  as is usual in such commercial transactions  a subsidiary to be incorporated for the purposes of acquiring and holding the asset and the ship turned out not to be sound in respects the subject of the opinion provided by J Mac   The loss could be suffered by reason that  first  the price paid for the ship might be greater than its true worth or secondly  the cost to repair the ship  so as to bring it to the condition where it might operate and possess the characteristics the subject of the negligent opinion  was substantial  Who suffered that loss is a fundamental issue in this matter distinguishedappliedMurphy v Overton

impossibility of otherwise effecting such indemnification without exposing him to some loss or burden  which the law will not place upon him   The principle identified by these authorities establishes that a tortfeasor must bear the cost of replacement or repair of the plaintiff s property where that has been damaged or destroyed by the tortfeasor s negligence  And the quantum of that cost is not diminished by any betterment of the plaintiff s property as a result of the repairs which the plaintiff achieves provided that the plaintiff does not act extravagantly  Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc   FCA         FCR   at         per Hely J   The third basis upon which damages fall to be assessed in the present case is that provided pursuant to s   of the Act  That measure is one which is flexible so as to be appropriately adapted to the circumstances of compensating a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of s   of the Act   Here  Consort argues that it suffered loss by reason of J Mac s contravention of s   because it was exposed to being in default under its financing arrangements with ANZ  It had caused its subsidiary to acquire the ship at a price far greater than its true worth  Rho Beta   had no assets other than the ship itself with which to repay the loan provided by Consort  Accordingly  Rho Beta   had a loan of USD    m and its only asset was worth only half of that amount  Consort was obliged to maintain the asset value of its subsidiary so as to remain within its own covenants to ANZ  Thus  Consort argued that since it wished to run the ship in connection with its business  and not be in default under its loan facility it was necessary for Consort to pay for the repairs and restoration work and hire of substitute vessels  The ship had to be in a condition where it could keep its class certificates and registrations  And  it needed to be repaired and restored so as to be able to operate with appropriate efficiency in the conduct of Consort s business for which it had been purchased  Thus  Consort was exposed to the necessity of either itself paying those costs or alternatively of financing them   I am satisfied that the repairs performed to the hydraulics of the vessel s cranes by Perrott Engineering Pty Limited in November   were necessary and the sum claimed for them is reasonable   In the period between July   and September   major repairs and restoration work were undertaken when the ship was at the Tropical Reef Shipyard  Further repairs were carried out in    I accept Mr McInnes  evidence as to the circumstances in which the various repairs of the vessel were undertaken between   and   in respect of which damages are claimed in the schedule  I am of opinion that his evidence establishes that Consort acted reasonably in the way in which it went about arranging for and paying for the repairs and the hire of substitute vessels  Consort paid hire for a replacement vessels during that period appliedPotts v Miller   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In tort  the measure of damages is that sum which would be sufficient to place the innocent party in the position it would have had had the tort not been committed  Frequently  in a case like the present where there is no contractual expectation loss   Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   courts take a similar approach to determining the loss or damage as I have just taken on the contractual measure which is appropriate in this case  namely the difference between the price and the true value  see Potts v Miller   HCA         CLR    However  that measure of damages is treated by the courts as a flexible rule of practice  which may not be appropriate to the quantification of damage in each case   HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at               Consort claims damages on two alternate bases  First  it says that the total amount claimed is the equivalent of the damage suffered at the time of purchase  being the difference between the price and the true value of the Gazelle Coast   Potts v Miller   HCA         CLR    Thus  it seeks interest on that sum from   July    Secondly  Consort says that the amounts are claimed as damages being the expense to which it has been put in restoring the Gazelle Coast to the condition she ought to have been in had she been as J Mac s survey report had represented   The problem with the first basis is that it uses the actual costs of repair and restoration work  together with charter hire incurred at various times over the five years succeeding the purchase  No evidence has been given that repair costs remained constant in that period  And the evidence shows that charter rates were different  in mid   they were USD   per day while in late   when the CEC Light was fixed  they were USD    There is no evidence of the rates at July    Nor has Consort given evidence of the net present value at July   of the damages claimed   If Consort were to receive an award calculated on the first basis  it would be likely to achieve more than the true measure of its loss if interest were then awarded from July    Charter rates were different and the market for those rates varies over time  Mr Dowell identified an average fixing rate in the June quarter of   at USD   albeit that he deemed USD   as a realistic rate for a replacement ship appliedSS Strathfillan v SS Ikala   AC   The principle applicable to the right of a

damaged vessel is less by the cost of repairs than the value it would have if undamaged  though it is true that evidence may establish that the value of the vessel undamaged is exactly the same as her

York   P   Because  the cost of repair is adopted as being equivalent to the diminution in the ship s value  it is immaterial that the repairs themselves are never executed  The York   P   at     per Scrutton LJ with whom Greer LJ agreed at     For the purchaser of the Gazelle Coast   that loss was the difference between the price paid and the actual value of the ship  Mr Dowell  an expert shipbroker  has assessed that difference at around USD    m  i e  that the vessel was really worth  at the time of its purchase  half of the purchase price   He arrived at that valuation on the basis that the cost of repairs  restoration work and substitute vessel hire actually incurred by Consort were necessary to bring the vessel to the standard at which it would have been worth the purchase price of USD    m accounted for the difference in value  He considered that the purchase price was a proper reflection of market value for the vessel had it been in the sound condition which J Mac s reports erroneously said it was   There is  however  in this scenario the complication to which I referred earlier  namely that although Consort entered into the contract of purchase  and was liable for the price  it exercised its right to nominate Rho Beta   as the purchaser  Thus  when title to the vessel passed to Rho Beta   as I will discuss below  it  rather than Consort  suffered the loss

case of negligent advice in contract or tort   Here  Consort would not have undertaken the borrowing from ANZ or engaged in the whole exercise of procuring the acquisition of the Gazelle Coast if J Mac had given accurate prepurchase survey reports to it  By the time the inaccuracy of J Mac s reports became known  Consort was in the invidious position of being obligated to ANZ to maintain the value of the ship and Rho Beta    Not only that  Consort needed the ship for the purposes of its own business  after all that was the very purpose of the acquisition in the first place  Rho Beta   had no money or resources other than as may have been able to be provided by Consort   As a matter of commonsense  without Consort s financial support  Rho Beta   could not have raised any money on the security of the ship with which to effect the repairs and restoration work which were needed  That is because the ship was worth about half of what Rho Beta   owed to Consort on the loan of the purchase price  The ship was mortgaged to ANZ and Rho Beta   had given a fixed and floating charge to ANZ  Its borrowing capacity against its only substantive asset was non existent  That is because Rho Beta  s net asset position was one in which its liabilities exceeded its assets by about   once the value of the ship was written down to half the purchase price  As a consequence  if repairs and restoration work were to be effected  they could only be by Consort using its financial resources to borrow the money and thereafter seeking to recoup itself from the wrongdoer who had place it into that position  namely J Mac referred toWenham v Ella   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In assessing damages for breach of contract the Court seeks to place the party who sustains a loss by reason of the breach in a position  so far as money can do it  which is the same as if the contract had been performed  Robinson v Harman     Ex   at     ER   at   Burns v M A N  Automotive  Aust  Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at          Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ explained that this general principle is limited by a rule laid down by the Court of Exchequor in Hadley v Baxendale     Ex   at     ER   at     CLR at    That rule held that the damages recoverable from a breach of contract were such as might fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally  that is  according to the usual course of things  from such a breach of contract itself  as may be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract  as the probable result of the breach of it  Their Honours went on to say that these principles had been discussed by Gibbs J in Wenham v Ella   HCA         CLR   at     where he approved the following exposition of Lord Reid   Czarnikow Ltd v Koufos   UKHL         AC   at      The crucial question is whether  on the information available to the defendant when the contract was made  he should  or the reasonable man in his position would  have realized that such loss was sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract to make it proper to hold that the loss flowed naturally from the breach or that loss of that kind should have been within his contemplation
