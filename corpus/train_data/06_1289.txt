Sayegh v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toInterlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd     FCR  I agree with both parties that  as the two limbs of rule  b  are separated by the disjunctive   or  the applicant only needed to show that the proposed premises satisfied one of the two limbs of rule  b   The Tribunal was in error on this point however as  for reasons given below  I have concluded that the Tribunal s ultimate conclusion was not affected by this error  nothing turns on it  The real issue in the appeal is the meaning of the phrase  nearest other premises  which occurs in both rule  b i  and    b ii   In particular  the issue was whether the phrase had the same or different meaning in each subrule  Despite a cogent argument put by Mr Zipser  counsel for the applicant  I have concluded that the meaning of the phrase is determined by the context of the subrule in which it occurs and for that reason  nearest other premises  has a different meaning in each subrule  It would seem that the Minister s new determination yields a result consistent with the result that would flow from the applicant s interpretation but this does not seem to me to assist in the interpretation of the rules that apply to the current application  As indicated above  the rules under consideration here were implemented pursuant to the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement  The   determination is made pursuant to the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement  The preamble to Part   of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement notes that  in addition to correcting difficulties associated with the previous location rules  the amendments to the location rules contained in the agreement  are intended to provide greater flexibility to respond to community need for pharmacy services and to improve access to pharmacy services   In addition  the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement indicates several objectives of the Location Rules that are not evident in the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement for instance to ensure that  all Australians have access to PBS medicines   It seems clear that the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement has different objectives from the Third Agreement even if those objectives have evolved from those in the earlier Agreement  There is no basis on which to suggest that the later rules can be relied on to clarify the meaning of the earlier rules  In the circumstances the caution advocated by Gummow J in Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd     FCR   at   is well advised  The orders in this matter must be that the respondent s notice of contention is upheld  the application is dismissed and the applicant must bear the respondent s costs    I certify that the preceding

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe respondent also referred to Murphy v Farmer   HCA         CLR   in connection with the weight that should be given to the principle referred to in    In Murphy the appellant had submitted that there was a presumption that the word  false  should mean the same thing in s   of the Customs Act    Cth  as it did in s   of that Act  The majority held  at        Plainly  there is some force in that argument  On the other hand  as Gibbs J  commented in Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  the presumption that a word is used with a uniform meaning in a statute is not one  of very much weight    it all depends on the context   In the same case  Mason J  pointed out that the  presumption readily yields to the context       footnotes omitted In the circumstances it is appropriate to consider the history of the rules and the policy that they were intended to promote approvedPharmacy Guild of Australia v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority     FCR  In support of its construction of rule   the respondent referred to Pharmacy Guild of Australia v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority     FCR   and a decision of Deputy President McMahon of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal in Re Levis and Australian Community Pharmacy Authority     ALD    Both of these cases were concerned with earlier versions of the rules than those presently under consideration  The rules considered by Branson J in the Pharmacy Guild case were made by a determination under s  L of the Act on   May   and were set out in her Honour s reasons at     as follows           For the purposes of paragraph  K b  of the Act  the rules with which the Authority must comply in making a recommendation on an application by a pharmacist for approval under s   of the Act in respect of particular premises are set out in paragraphs   to         Approval of a pharmacist under section   of the Act in respect of particular premises must not be recommended except as provided for in paragraphs   to                            approval of a pharmacist under section   of the Act in respect of particular premises must be recommended if the pharmacist is already approved under section   of the Act in respect of other premises from which the pharmacist proposes to cease supplying pharmaceutical benefits immediately before granting the approval if                   c  the premises in respect of which approval is sought are not less than two kilometres  measured door to door by the shortest lawful access route  from the nearest other premises in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under s   of the Act      Branson J rejected the submission that these provisions required the decision maker to determine which were the  nearest other premises  by a straight line measurement before establishing the measurement of the shortest lawful access route from those premises to the premises in respect of which approval was sought  Her Honour found no warrant for such an approach in the words of the provision and held that in relying on evidence as to which pharmacy in the vicinity of the proposed premises was the  closest  the decision maker took into account an irrelevant consideration  Her Honour commented  at        The issue before it was not whether the Oyster Bay pharmacy was the closest relevant pharmacy to the  proposed premises  but whether the distance from the nearest other relevant premises measured door to door by the shortest lawful access route to the  proposed premises  was less than   kilometres  The provisions considered in Re Levis were not relevantly different and Deputy President McMahon relied upon the decision in the Pharmacy Guild case in reaching a similar conclusion  I respectfully accept that the context of the phrase  nearest other premises  justified Branson J s conclusion in the Pharmacy Guild   and that this meaning might coherently be adopted in respect of the present provisions  However  the present provisions are different from those considered by Branson J and the significance of that difference must be examined  Whereas previously the relevant rules used only one criterion to test distance from the nearest other premises  rule   in  b i  and  b ii  respectively  uses both the straight line measurement and the lawful access measurement  Accordingly  there is a competing principle to the principle of contextual analysis applied by Branson J namely the  sound rule of construction  referred to in   above  The issue is which of the two competing principles should prevail referred toRe Levis and Australian Community Pharmacy Authority     ALD  In support of its construction of rule   the respondent referred to Pharmacy Guild of Australia v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority     FCR   and a decision of Deputy President McMahon of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal in Re Levis and Australian Community Pharmacy Authority     ALD    Both of these cases were concerned with earlier versions of the rules than those presently under consideration  The provisions considered in Re Levis were not relevantly different and Deputy President McMahon relied upon the decision in the Pharmacy Guild case in reaching a similar conclusion referred toRegistrar of Titles  WA  v Franzon   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAlthough I have reached the conclusion stated above  the starting point of my analysis  and the applicant s submissions  is the generally accepted principle that  unless there is a reason to conclude otherwise  such as an indication in the statute itself   it is a sound rule of construction to give the same meaning to the same words appearing in different parts of a statute  Registrar of Titles  WA  v Franzon   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J  If that principle were to be applied  the first step in the application of either subrule would be to identify the   nearest other premises  in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under s   of the Act  On that basis the premises so identified would be the same whether one was applying subrule  b i  or  b ii   The Act does not say how one is to determine which other premises is the  nearest  and therefore  subject to other indications to the contrary  one would give the word its ordinary English meaning  In the subrules under consideration  nearest  is used in respect of proximity or distance  it is the superlative form of the adjective   near  which  according to the Oxford English Dictionary  means  to  within or at a short distance  or  close to a place  thing or person in respect of space or time   The  nearest  other premises are the  closest  other premises or those which are the shortest distance away  The shortest distance between two places is colloquially referred to as being a  beeline  or  as the crow flies  meaning a direct route that has no obstacles and is roughly a straight line measurement  On this analysis  the nearest other premises to the proposed premises are not necessarily those that are the quickest to reach from the proposed premises  The statement that  X pharmacy is the closest   or nearest  but that it would be  quicker to get to Y pharmacy  is immediately understandable as making that distinction referred toSmoker v Pharmacy Restructuring Authority     FCR  The background to these rules was explained by Hill J in Smoker v Pharmacy Restructuring Authority     FCR    His Honour referred to an agreement made in   between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia which was intended to reduce the number of pharmacies approved to supply pharmaceutical benefits  His Honour continued at            the Government ultimately accepted recommendations made to it that pharmacy numbers should be reduced by encouraging pharmacists to either amalgamate or close to reduce the number of inefficient pharmacies and to strengthen the more viable pharmacies that remained  Provision was to be made for closure payments and  where an amalgamation or closure payment was made  no new approval in respect of the premises was to be granted unless certain approval criteria were met  The subsequent development of this policy through two subsequent agreements and the change in emphasis from  a preoccupation with concentration of pharmacies in a particular locality     to a desire to introduce more competition between pharmacies  was referred to in the AAT decision under review  The Third Community Pharmacy Agreement  made in   refers in clause  d  to a purpose in amending the rules governing pharmacy relocations as being  to enhance competition consistent with the maintenance of a viable and well distributed community pharmacy network   I do not accept that the applicant s interpretation interpolates into rule   an unarticulated criterion for determining which premises are the nearest  In my view the reasons for interpreting  nearest other premises  as set out in     are coherent and acceptable subject to there being indications in the statute or otherwise that a different meaning was intended  In addition  I do not accept that the applicant s interpretation defeats the purpose of having the two subrules with their different modes of measurement  On the applicant s interpretation once the  nearest  premises have been identified  if the straight line measurement is at least     kilometres then the application must be approved  If  however  that measurement is less than     kilometres then the distance from the proposed premises by lawful access measurement must be determined  If that distance is   kilometres or more then a positive recommendation must be made under rule  b ii   For instance  using a common example  assume pharmacy A is only   metres by straight line measurement from the proposed premises but is directly across a river so that the shortest means of lawful access is across a bridge some   kilometres downstream  In that example the criterion in subrule  b ii  would be met and a positive recommendation made even though subrule  b i  has not been met
