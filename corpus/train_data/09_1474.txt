The first four questions arose from matters dealt with in the Tribunal s reasons  Each was resolved adversely to Mr Culley  The fifth and sixth questions asked        Whether the statutory power of disqualification contained in s  F of the Corporations Act is subject to an implied requirement that it be exercised within a reasonable time  and           Whether the respondent failed to exercise

See also Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     citedKuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FLR  A distinction has been drawn  in the authorities  between findings which the Tribunal is bound to make for the purposes of a particular case and those which it is not required to make  In the former case a question of law may be found to arise notwithstanding the failure of the parties to raise the issue before the Tribunal and the failure of the Tribunal to deal with it  Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FLR   was such a case  There Bowen CJ said  at   that       In my opinion a party is not necessarily precluded by the conduct of his case before the Tribunal from arguing on  appeal  matters conceded below  If he is successful then the decision of the Tribunal may be overturned found in some way to be wrong in law  even though that error may have been substantially contributed to by the conduct of the case by the party in question  In other words  the conduct of the party s case before the Tribunal goes to this Court s discretion to what course it will take given that there has been an error rather than to the question as to whether the Tribunal really made an error          The case before this Court is not merely one of parties agreeing upon what facts should be decided by the trier of fact  nor a case of facts  peculiarly within the knowledge of the party  being conceded  Rather  there was a clear statutory precondition upon which the Tribunal had to be satisfied and enough material and evidence before it to raise the issue independently of the parties  submissions  In these circumstances it was an error of law not to consider and decide the issue of immigrant status  Whether or not that error should lead to the decision of the Tribunal being set aside and the matter remitted to it depends in my view upon principles similar to those expressed by Dixon J in Burston s case and by the same judge in Orr v Holmes   HCA         CLR     at p    to fulfil an imperative demand of justice      In Kuswardana the Tribunal had to make a determination as to whether or not the applicant before it was an  immigrant  because the application of the statutory provisions which the Tribunal was applying depended on an answer to that question citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gungor   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThese powers must be read in context  They are not as expansive as might at first appear  In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gungor   FCA         FLR   at   Sheppard J said that       It is in my opinion not correct to say that this court is by these provisions given wide powers to make such order as it thinks fit  Implicit in its power are a number of restrictions  The appeal is expressly limited to error of law  which alleged error is the sole matter before the court and is the only subject matter of any order made consequent on the appeal  The order which this court can make after hearing the appeal is also similarly restricted to an order which is appropriate by reason of its decision  It follows that the only order which can be properly made is one the propriety of which is circumscribed by and necessary to reflect this court s view on the alleged or found error of law  To go further I would see as amounting to exceeding the jurisdiction of this court under this section  A power to make  such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision  is much more restrictive than a power  to make such order as it sees fit  or a power  to make a decision in substitution for the decision  the subject of the appeal  Section   confirms  though it states that it does not purport to limit  this as an appropriate reading of the power in s    when it limits its statement of the express power of the court when setting aside a decision to the making of an order remitting the case to be heard again  Having set aside a decision  it has no express power to substitute what it sees as the correct decision unless such is the appropriate order by reason of its decision on the point of law in the context of the particular proceedings      It is not disputed that the  reasonable time  point could have been taken before the Tribunal  Had it been  the Tribunal would have been in a position to find the facts which are set out in my earlier judgment at     and determined whether  as a matter of law  ASIC had failed to comply with the implied obligation contained in s  F of the Act and what  if any  consequences should follow  The Tribunal did not consider the point and make any findings because Mr Culley did not raise it referred toSecretary  Department of Social Security v
