proceedings  is entitled to the benefit of a properly pleaded case  so that a proper defence can be filed   In my view a person reading the pleaded definition could not reasonably be expected to determine whether he or she had purchased items which were  rubber products  as defined in paragraph   of the statement of claim  The statement of claim fails sufficiently to describe or otherwise identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates  For this reason alone the statement of claim should be struck out  see Philip Morris  Australia  Ltd v Nixon   FCA         ALR   at     There are  however  additional and related difficulties occasioned by the failure of the applicant adequately to define  rubber products  which affect the efficacy of other parts of the statement of claim  The applicant pleads  in paragraph   that Bayer Australia and Chemtura Australia were able to and did influence the price of rubber products in Australia  In paragraph   it is claimed that the respondents overcharged for rubber products  As a result it is alleged  in paragraph   that the applicant and group members suffered loss and damage as a result of having to pay more for rubber products that they would have been required to do had the respondents contravening conduct not occurred  In the absence of a clear definition of group members and a clear understanding of what is comprehended by the term  rubber products  these paragraphs are embarrassing  The respondents cannot fairly be expected to plead to them  The same problem arises in respect to paragraph   in which it is said that there is a national market in Australia for the supply of rubber products   Before passing to other objections to the statement of claim it should be noted that the applicant has not

Bulldogs Rugby League Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The need for precision in the framing of group definitions in representative proceedings was explained by Sackville J in Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Ltd   FCA    His Honour said    In determining what s  H a  of the Federal Court Act requires  it is important to consider why it is necessary to describe or identify the group members in a representative proceeding  One reason  as the High Court observed in Wong v Silkfield  is to enable the Court to determine whether the requirements of s  C have been satisfied  Unless the group member is adequately described or identified  although not necessarily named or counted  s  H  it may be difficult to ascertain  for example  whether the claims of all the group members give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact    Another reason for describing or identifying group members is to enable group members to decide whether or not to opt out of the representative proceeding pursuant to s  J  of the Federal Court Act  If a person who is a group member does not opt out of the proceedings he or she will be bound by the judgment   Section  ZB requires the judgment in a representative proceeding to  describe or otherwise identify the group members who will be affected by it  and provides that the judgment binds any such persons other than any person who has opted out   The failure by a group member to opt out of representative proceedings may therefore be attended by serious consequences  although of course the litigation might also produce advantages for that group member    These factors suggest that it must be possible for persons who may be within the represented group to ascertain from the pleadings whether they are in fact group members  The point was made by Hedigan J in Cook v Pasminco Ltd   VSC     at   in relation to similar State legislation         It is beyond doubt that in a group proceeding the description of a group membership must be such so that it is at least possible to determine who falls within the group as described  Persons contemplated as being within the group would themselves not understand whether they were within it  unless the definition of the group is intelligible  although not necessarily exact  Members of the group are entitled to know what constitutes the essentials of the group  A decision concerning opt out cannot be sensibly made unless it is known what it is that is being opted out from          It follows from his Honour s observations that a person must be able to ascertain from the description of the represented group whether he or she is a member of that group          Clearly enough  not every description or identification of the represented group will satisfy the requirements of s  H a  of the Federal Court Act  A useful  although not necessarily exhaustive test  is whether the description is such as to enable a person  with the assistance of a legal adviser if necessary  to ascertain whether he or she is a group member  If the description incorporates a reference to conduct alleged in the pleadings  a person or his or her adviser ought to be able  by reading the description and the relevant portion of the pleadings  to determine whether he or she is a member of the represented group  If a person cannot reasonably be expected to do this  the definition is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of s  H a    Emphasis added     In that case the group was defined  in part  by reference to the pleaded conduct of the respondent  Hence his Honour s allusion  in the final paragraph quoted  to a definition incorporating a reference to conduct  The test which he propounded would have equal application to a definition which had  as one of its elements  the purchase by group members of a particular product  a person who wishes to ascertain whether or not he or she is a group member must be able  by reading the definition  to determine whether he or she has purchased such a product   As presently framed the group definition includes any person who has paid at least   for  rubber chemicals  or  rubber products  in a six and a half year period  There could be multiple purchases so long as the aggregate price of those purchases exceeds    The purchases could have been made anywhere  A person seeking to determine  perhaps with the assistance of his or her lawyer  whether he or she fell within the group would have considerable  but probably not insurmountable  difficulty in deciding whether or not these criteria had been satisfied  Resort to invoices  catalogues  product statements and other documents would be needed  The real problem would lie in determining whether the items purchased were  rubber products   Some decisions would be easy  a rubber ball could readily be identified as a  rubber product   But how are potential group members to know whether an item which does not have the external appearance or texture of rubber contains  rubber chemicals  They would  presumably  require the assistance of an expert chemist  What if the rubber item forms but a small part of a larger product  The respondents cite as examples the mud flaps on a large truck or the rubber  feet  at the bottom of table legs  Despite being asked  the applicant has not told the respondents whether  in such cases  the larger item with a small rubber part is itself to be regarded as a  rubber product  because it  contains rubber chemicals  citedState Bank of Victoria v Parry     ACSR   The material facts needed to
