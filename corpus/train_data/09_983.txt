Hneidi v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship  includes corrigendum dated   December     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAston and Secretary  Department of Primary Industry  Re     ALD   In Re Aston and Secretary  Department of Primary Industry     ALD     Re Aston   the Tribunal  of which Davies J was the President  considered the correct and preferable decision on the material before it in relation to an allocation of a quota of Southern bluefin tuna under a scheme limiting the taking of tuna adopted pursuant to the Fisheries Act    Cth   The Tribunal quoted extensively from the reasons for judgment of Brennan J in Drake  No   and noted the reasons why  in the circumstances of Re Aston   it was appropriate to place great weight on the policy  at        There being no special circumstances which affected the Astons  this is pre eminently the type of matter in which the policy adopted by the primary decision maker ought to be applied by this Tribunal  The policy affected an industry  It was a policy decided upon at the highest level  being resolved upon by the Australian Fisheries Council comprised of the six relevant Ministers of the States and the Federal Minister for Primary Industry and the Federal Minister for Science and Technology  It was a policy which could only be developed in the political arena after consultation with industry  The Tribunal  which is not accountable politically and which cannot proceed by obtaining industry consensus  must give such a policy great weight  discussedBecker and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  Re     ALD   In an earlier decision  Brennan J  again sitting as the President of the Tribunal and on a review of a Minister s decision to order deportation under s  a  of the Migration Act    Cth    Migration Act   as it then was  drew a distinction between policies made or settled at the political level and policies made or settled at the departmental level  Re Becker and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALD   at    Different considerations may apply to the review of each kind of policy and more substantial reasons might need to be shown why policies forged at the political level should be reviewed discussedDainty and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  Re     AAR   The Tribunal member referred to clause       and noted that the primary policy objective underpinning the residency requirement was the development and maintenance of close and continuing ties with Australia  The Tribunal member noted the argument that the first applicant did not receive the same protection from Australian Embassy representatives as his Australian wife  The Tribunal member said that she did not accept that  this argument holds sufficient weight that the usual policy should be ignored   She said that she did not accept that the difficulty faced by the spouse of an Australian citizen in this case was  so significant or exceptional that policy should be ignored   She said       In the matters of Re Dainty v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     AAR   and Re Vukaj v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   AATA     citizenship applications were granted even though the guidelines set out in the Instructions were not satisfied  However  those cases are distinguishable from this case  In both those cases  the applicant was living in Australia at the time of the application and had much more substantial contact and association with Australia than Dr Hneidi  In each case  they were married to resident Australian citizens and had significant ongoing connections with Australia   The Tribunal member noted that policy statements were not binding on the Tribunal  but must be brought to account and given appropriate weight   The Tribunal member said that she could not see a sufficient basis to depart from the Instructions   The Tribunal member then turned to consider the application by the second  third and fourth applicants  She noted the relevant provisions of the Instructions and said that  based on the Instructions  the children would not usually be considered for citizenship  The Tribunal member considered whether she needed to address the issue of the best interests of the children by reason of the fact that Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article   refers to the  best interests of the child   She referred to various authorities and concluded that she must give consideration to the children s best interests in this case as a primary consideration  She considered the submission that the best interests of the children lie in coming to Australia with their family and in being able to travel as a single unit and in the safest way when travelling internationally  The Tribunal member said that she had considered that argument carefully  She said it was really a value judgment to suggest that the children would be better off coming to live in Australia  She noted that the children could come to Australia at any time and reside here as they had visas which entitled them to do so  and the fact that they have not yet done so indicated that their parents were satisfied that their current best interests were served by continuing to reside with them in Beirut  The Tribunal member concluded by saying       Having considered the best interests of the children and having considered the policy directions and the underlying policy behind the grant of citizenship to children under the age of sixteen years  the Tribunal considers that there is no compelling reason to go behind the policy set out in the Instructions       Questions of law and grounds of appeal  The amended notice of appeal identifies two questions of law and three grounds of appeal  The first question of law and the ground of appeal related to it are as follows   Question of law         Whether the Tribunal  upon a review of the decision by the Minister to not grant a certificate of Australian citizenship under subs    of the Act  impermissibly fetters the exercise of its discretion by applying the policy known as the  Australian citizenship instructions  unless there are cogent reasons not to do so        Ground of appeal       The Tribunal failed to exercise its own independent judgment in respect of its decision  and give proper  genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the applicants  cases  in that it   a  held that it was required to apply the policy known as the  Australian citizenship instructions  unless there were cogent reasons not to do so   b  applied the policy in making the decision  and   c  failed to hold that as the policy had not been adopted or approved by the Minister and had not been exposed to parliamentary scrutiny  the existence of the policy was merely a relevant consideration to take into account in the exercise of the discretion under subs    of the Act   The second question of law and the grounds of appeal related to it are as follows   Question of law       Whether  on the proper construction of subs    of the Act  the Minister  in determining whether to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship  is bound to take into account whether members of the person s immediate family are Australian citizens        Grounds of appeal       The Tribunal erred in law in failing to take into account a relevant consideration in the exercise of its power under para  c  of the Act in respect of the first applicant  in that it failed to take into account that the first applicant s daughter with his Australian citizen wife was also an Australian citizen          The Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration in the exercise of its power under para  a  of the Act in respect of the second to fourth applicants  in that it failed to take into account that their sibling was an Australian citizen       The first question of law and the first ground of appeal  In Re Dainty and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     AAR     Re Dainty   Davies J  as President of the Tribunal  reversed the decision of the delegate under s  c  of the Act and decided that the Minister s guidelines were not appropriate to the applicant s circumstances discussedDrake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   AATA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  The starting point is the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   AATA         ALR     Drake    In Drake   the relevant power was the power of deportation in s   of the Migration Act    Cth  as it then was  The Minister had issued a policy statement on the question of considerations relating to the deterrence of others  A question which arose was whether the Tribunal had attached such importance to the policy statement as to result in a failure by the Tribunal to exercise its own independent judgment  Bowen CJ and Deane J discussed the general principles relating to the role of policy in administrative decision making   Their Honours started by stating some general principles as to the role of the Tribunal  Those principles are now well known  They include the fact that the role of the Tribunal is an administrative one and its task is to make the correct or preferable decision on the material before it  There may be cases in which the Tribunal is precluded from having regard to general government policy by the terms of the statutory power and other cases in which  again by the terms of the statutory power  the Tribunal is bound to apply principles laid down in advance  Absent statutory prescriptions of this nature  the Tribunal may take into account a policy and that is particularly so where the statute itself does not specify the criteria which are relevant to the exercise of the statutory power  In the ordinary case  a policy is a relevant factor for the Tribunal to take into account  It is desirable in terms of consistency in decision making that a policy be taken into account by the Tribunal and that follows from the fact that the original decision maker has applied or taken into account the particular policy  However  the Tribunal cannot apply a policy in a way which indicates that  in truth  it has abdicated its function to reach the correct or preferable decision on the material before it  The weight to be placed on a policy is a matter for the Tribunal to determine and it will ordinarily do so  balancing the need for consistency in decision making and the need for justice in the individual case   Bowen CJ and Deane J said the borderline between cases in which a Tribunal has  after an independent assessment  applied a government policy and cases in which a Tribunal has abdicated its function may well be blurred  Their Honours said  at        It is  however  desirable that  in any case where the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the particular circumstances are such as to make the correct or preferable decision that which results from an application of some government or ministerial policy to the particular facts  the Tribunal makes it clear that it has considered the propriety of the particular policy and expressly indicates the considerations which have led it to that conclusion  This is particularly so in matters such as the review of a deportation order where no two cases will be identical and where personal liberty will commonly be involved  discussedDrake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  No   Re     ALD   The appeal was allowed in Drake and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing  The President of the Tribunal  Brennan J  as his Honour then was  conducted the rehearing  Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  No       ALD     Drake No      Brennan J referred to the advantages which flowed from the original decision maker being able to be guided by policy statements  guidelines or standards  The policy must be consistent with the statute and it must not be framed so as to preclude consideration of the merits of the individual case  The Tribunal may apply the policy on a review  Brennan J said  at        If the Tribunal applies ministerial policy  it is because of the assistance which the policy can furnish in arriving at the preferable decision in the circumstances of the case as they appear to the Tribunal  One of the factors to be considered in arriving at the preferable decision in a particular case is its consistency with other decisions in comparable cases  and one of the most useful aids in achieving consistency is a guiding policy   Brennan J went on to explain why it was not convenient for the Tribunal to formulate policy  His Honour said that administrative policies are best formed and amended in a political context  In the course of his discussion  his Honour referred to the chain of responsibility from Minister to government to Parliament and to the fact that the bureaucracy is best placed to advise on broad policy  His Honour reached the following conclusions  at        When the Tribunal is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary power reposed in a Minister  and the Minister has adopted a general policy to guide him in the exercise of the power  the Tribunal will ordinarily apply that policy in reviewing the decision  unless the policy is unlawful or unless its application tends to produce an unjust decision in the circumstances of the particular case  Where the policy would ordinarily be applied  an argument against the policy itself or against its application in the particular case will be considered  but cogent reasons will have to be shown against its application  especially if the policy is shown to have been exposed to parliamentary scrutiny  discussedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Others     ALD   In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Others     ALD     this Court was required to consider a decision of the Tribunal granting the applicant relief under s   of the Taxation  Unpaid Company Tax  Assessment Act    Cth   There was a ruling of the Commissioner which specified the circumstances in which relief should be granted  After referring to the particular policy which was in issue in Re Aston   French J  as his Honour then was  said  at        And  as in that case  which involved the exercise of a discretion to limit the terms of fishing licences under a national quota scheme  a policy which is developed in the political arena after consultation with the relevant industry ought generally to be given great weight  Taxation ruling IT   does not appear to be in that category  Nevertheless  the magnitude of the task involved in carrying out original decision making and supervising and regulating the exercise of delegated authority under the taxation laws  is a powerful indicator that appropriate guidelines are essential for the avoidance of administrative chaos and for the achievement of reasonable consistency  The need to maintain the perception and reality of equal treatment is an important factor in the administration of all laws and not least in those relating to taxation  But such considerations go to the weight to be attributed to policy and that is ultimately a matter for the Tribunal  Nevistic v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  supra   at    Deane J  Re Aston  supra   at AAR    Davies J   citedHneidi v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALD   This is an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  Hneidi v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALD    The appeal to this Court is limited to an appeal on a question of law   Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   the AAT Act  s     The first applicant holds both Syrian and Lebanese citizenship  and he currently resides in Beirut  He is married to Ms Karina Hneidi  who holds both Australian and Lebanese citizenship  and there are four children of the marriage  One of the applicant s children holds Australian citizenship   On   October   the first applicant made an application for Australian citizenship for himself and for the three children who did not hold Australian citizenship  On   June   a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship refused the application  In his reasons  the delegate did not specifically provide reasons for refusing the applications with respect to the three children  On the application for review to the Tribunal  the Tribunal member said that as the three children had been joined to the first applicant s application then  by implication  the applications by the children had also been refused referred toLofthouse and Australian Securities and Investments Commission  Re   AATA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  Finally  I mention that I was referred to the Tribunal s decision in Re Lofthouse and Australian Securities and Investments Commission   AATA         ALD     a case involving consideration of the weight to be given to a Policy Statement formulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission   I turn now to examine the Tribunal s reasons in light of these principles   The Tribunal member did not discuss the source of the Instructions  She did not discuss whether the Instructions had been made by the Minister or by senior officers in the Minister s Department  She appears to have proceeded on the basis that the Instructions were Ministerial Guidelines rather than Departmental Guidelines  She formulated one of the issues before the Tribunal as           to what extent can the Tribunal go outside the Ministerial Guidelines  the Guidelines  in exercising its discretion followedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The reasons of the Tribunal are not to be read with an eye keenly attuned to error  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR    It was not suggested that the Instructions are unlawful  In any event  I would reject such a contention  Key elements of the Instructions simply reflect important criteria in s   of the Act which deals with a grant of a certificate of citizenship  The fundamental question is whether the Tribunal member made an independent assessment on the material before her  I think that she did   I reject the first ground of appeal   The second question of law and the second and third grounds of appeal  The respondent accepted that when a decision maker is determining whether to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship under s   of the Act  he or she is bound to take into account whether members of the person s immediate family are Australian citizens  The applicants submitted that the matter was not taken into account and that that was an error of law  The respondent submitted that this matter was taken into account by the Tribunal both in relation to the first applicant s application and the application of the children discussedNevistic v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   In Nevistic v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR     the Full Court of this Court considered an appeal from the Tribunal on a question of law  The Tribunal had reviewed a decision of the Minister to deport the applicant under s   of the Migration Act as it then was  The Tribunal had taken into account government policy on the deportation of persons involved in growing  importation or distribution of illicit drugs and had decided that the correct and preferable decision in all the circumstances of the case was that the applicant be deported from Australia  The Tribunal said that  absent the policy  its decision may have been different  The Full Court dismissed the appeal and held that the Tribunal was entitled to take the policy into account as a relevant factor and that the weight to be accorded to the policy was a matter for that Tribunal  The Court also said that the Tribunal could not abdicate its function of determining the correct and preferable decision on the material before it by simply applying the policy without conducting an independent assessment   In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Others     ALD     this Court was required to consider a decision of the Tribunal granting the applicant relief under s   of the Taxation  Unpaid Company Tax  Assessment Act    Cth   There was a ruling of the Commissioner which specified the circumstances in which relief should be granted  After referring to the particular policy which was in issue in Re Aston   French J  as his Honour then was  said  at        And  as in that case  which involved the exercise of a discretion to limit the terms of fishing licences under a national quota scheme  a policy which is developed in the political arena after consultation with the relevant industry ought generally to be given great weight  Taxation ruling IT   does not appear to be in that category  Nevertheless  the magnitude of the task involved in carrying out original decision making and supervising and regulating the exercise of delegated authority under the taxation laws  is a powerful indicator that appropriate guidelines are essential for the avoidance of administrative chaos and for the achievement of reasonable consistency  The need to maintain the perception and reality of equal treatment is an important factor in the administration of all laws and not least in those relating to taxation  But such considerations go to the weight to be attributed to policy and that is ultimately a matter for the Tribunal  Nevistic v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  supra   at    Deane J  Re Aston  supra   at AAR    Davies J   referred toSadiq and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Re   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  Secondly  the applicants submitted that the Tribunal member had not considered the propriety of the Instructions  There are two answers to this submission  First  where a policy is lawful  the Tribunal would not normally consider the propriety of the policy as a policy  It would consider the propriety of applying the policy to the facts of the particular case  I am satisfied that the Tribunal member did that  The second answer is that  by reference to some observations in Re Sadiq and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   AATA     the Tribunal member did give consideration to the propriety of the policy as a policy   Thirdly  the applicants submitted that the Tribunal member misdirected herself in law because she referred to two cases  namely  Drake No   and Re Dainty   which discussed the relevant principles in the context of ministerial policy  not departmental policy  The answers to this submission are as follows  A fair reading of the Tribunal member s reasons reveals that she did not adopt an incorrect approach to the Instructions as departmental policy  In so far as it might be said that she placed greater weight on the Instructions than was called for  that was a question of weight which was a matter for the Tribunal referred toTurner v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   It may appear from the Tribunal s reasons that a consideration was taken into account even though it is not expressly mentioned   Turner v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at   per Toohey J   It seems to me that the inference that the matter was taken into account will be more easily drawn if the consideration is one of less significance than other considerations in the case  It seems to me that the fact that Maya is an Australian citizen is of less significance than other considerations in the case   Plainly  the Tribunal was aware and made reference to the fact that Maya was an Australian citizen  I am satisfied that the matter was taken into account because the Tribunal member contrasted the position of Ms Hneidi and Maya with the first applicant and the three children in terms of assistance from the Australian Embassy and ease of international travel   I reject the second and third grounds of appeal
