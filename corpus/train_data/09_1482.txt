the Family Court of Australia  The only outstanding matter for decision at this stage relates to costs incurred in the following proceedings  An application by Mrs Jensen for a stay of the proceedings for abuse of process  Mrs Jensen was unsuccessful in respect of this application citedJT Stratford   Son Ltd v Lindley  No       All ER    Third  I am not persuaded by the trustee s submission that costs of the notice of motion for transfer should be costs in the cause of the trustee s application in this court to be transferred to the Family Court  While the trustee had  appropriately  commenced these proceedings in this Court and had a prima facie right to have his claim heard in this Court  Mrs Jensen was well within her rights to apply for an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court  I do not agree that Mrs Jensen sought  unsuccessfully  to have the proceedings transferred to the Family Court at the hearing of   March   in fact although counsel for Mrs Jensen invited the Court to make the order of its own initiative  no formal application for transfer was made  I do not think that  at this stage  an order should be made that such costs should be costs in the cause and awarded according to the final award of costs in the action  cf comments of Lord Denning in JT Stratford   Son Ltd v Lindley  No       All ER   at   citedLife Airbag Co of

am not persuaded that the demands of justice require a departure from the general rule that an order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed
