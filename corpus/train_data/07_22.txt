AAR   In Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglon     AAR   at   Ryan J indicated that because O   was not qualified in any way by reference to the other Rules  it should in the first instance determine the practice and procedure applicable to appeals from the AAT  The parties made no submission to the contrary   Indeed  the second respondent stressed that the Court should apply O   in its terms  rather than direct that the venue of the hearing of the appeal be changed to the Victoria District Registry under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  or under O   r   or that the proceeding be transferred to that Registry under O   r  f  having regard to the definition of the  proper place  in O   r   of the Rules consideredHadid v Lenfest Communications Inc     FCR

Australia v Victoria   HCA         CLR   at   Philip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     citedNational Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corporation     FCR   The parties did not seek to rely on the jurisprudence concerning the transfer of proceedings or the determination of the  proper place  of proceedings under s   of the FCA Act  or O   r  f  of the Rules  However  their submissions focussed upon the connection of the subject of the AAT proceedings and this appeal to Victoria and the respective convenience of the parties  Their submissions therefore in fact centred upon the sort of considerations discussed in National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corporation     FCR   and subsequent decisions concerning s   of the FCA Act and O   r  f    In this matter  there is no circumstance relevant to the efficient administration of the Court to be weighed  The appeal will be heard following the next Full Court callover with equal facility in Adelaide or Melbourne   Clearly  the subject matter of the appeal is in Victoria  Nothing more need to be said on that point  The application to the AAT in its South Australia District Registry appears to have been made because the applicants were South Australian based  and had relevant interests in or in the vicinity of the King Valley area   In my view  generally speaking  little weight should be given to the fact that counsel or the solicitors for a party are in a particular location  Principally  that is because the selection of counsel and solicitors is a matter for the parties  Their choice should not be of significance to the identification of the proper place of a matter  The Court is a national Court  with Registries in each State and Territory and can sit anywhere in Australia  However  to an extent  there is a tendency for parties to institute proceedings in a Registry of the Court convenient to counsel or the solicitors for the parties rather than in a Registry which has a real connection with the subject matter of the dispute  or indeed with the parties themselves or the witnesses  I do not think that the Registry where proceedings are instituted should be dictated by that consideration  Further  where that is the case  it may well be appropriate to transfer the proceeding to a proper place  having regard to the considerations discussed in Sentry and other cases   For those reasons  I order that the Victoria District Registry is the appropriate Registry for this appeal and that the proceeding be transferred to the Victoria District Registry of the Court   In my view  as the second respondent has succeeded on its motion  but only on one of the two matters it argued  the appropriate order is that the costs of the second respondent on the motion should be its costs on the appeal  The intention of that order is that  if the appeal is successful  there will in effect be no costs of the motion  but if the appeal is dismissed and the second respondent gets its costs of the appeal  those costs will include its costs of and incidental to the motion   I certify that the preceding thirty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment
