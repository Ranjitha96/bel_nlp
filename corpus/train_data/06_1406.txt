        ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   On or about   April   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal requesting written reasons for the decision of Senior Member McCabe given   October    Written reasons for decision were made available on   April     REASONS OF THE TRIBUNAL     Senior Member McCabe indicated in par   of his Reasons for Decision that the principles which should be applied in respect of an application for reinstatement pursuant to s  A  and   are those suggested by Manoli v Secretary to the Department of Social Security     ALD    In summary  the Tribunal must consider    the conduct of the appellant    any prejudice  most obviously prejudice to the respondent    the merits of the substantive case and    in considering these matters  the overriding obligation to do what is fair in the circumstances     Applying that approach  the Tribunal     Did not accept that the appellant and Thiel Partners had not received notice of the hearing listed for   September        Did not accept that the appellant had a good excuse for failing to attend the original hearing on   September   at which the case was dismissed      Found that the interests of the respondent were not prejudiced by the delay attending the review  however some prejudice to the interests of the respondent could accrue if the appellant s claim was not prosecuted expeditiously      Found that the appellant s interests would be prejudiced if the Tribunal did not allow reinstatement because it would be unable to continue its challenge to the decision under review      Was of the view that the merits of the case had not been substantiated beyond an assertion by the appellant that it had good prospects of success      Found that the failure of counsel appearing for the appellant at the hearing to explain the discrepancy between the contentions in the outline and the facts as they emerged at the hearing  must count against the appellant  and that the appellant was treating the Tribunal with  indifference       Found that  the excuse  the appellant  offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue       Was not minded to grant an adjournment to allow the appellant to provide material given the delays that had already occurred     In conclusion  the Tribunal held at par      The original application was dismissed after the appellant or its representative failed to attend a directions hearing  Its reinstatement application did not address one of the important issues before the Tribunal at the hearing  the merits of the case  and the excuse it offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue  It is fair to all the parties in all the circumstances that the application for reinstatement be refused     APPEAL     A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal only on questions of law  s   AAT Act     The grounds of appeal in this case are     Whether the Tribunal erred in law in refusing an application by the appellant for an adjournment to place further affidavit material before the Tribunal and therefore denying the appellant opportunity to properly prosecute the application for reinstatement      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed pursuant to s  A  of the AAT Act  b  by failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant in the circumstances and that any prejudice to the respondent could be remedied by the operation of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect of the order made   October   and the dismissal of the appellant s application to reinstate the application for review      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed pursuant to s  A  of the AAT Act  b  by failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant in the circumstances and that any prejudice to the respondent could be remedied by the operation of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect to the orders made   October   in that the Tribunal has made a decision that is unreasonable   SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT     The appellant submits that the crucial error of the Tribunal appears at pars             of the Written Reasons for Oral Decision of the Tribunal  In summary the appellant submits that    The Tribunal failed to give the appellant a reasonable opportunity to be heard in relation to the email from Mr Summerville  The appellant relied on s   AAT Act which provides that a Tribunal shall ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case     The Tribunal has the power to grant an adjournment at any time and that the efficient running of the court should not prevail over the injustice of preventing the appellant from responding to an adverse inference     The email that was presented to the appellant at the application for reinstatement was information that was adverse to the interests of the appellant  and was used by the Tribunal to make very serious findings against the appellant going to its credit and integrity     There may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant can offer in respect of the email     Although the Tribunal has a duty to discharge its obligations in an expeditious manner  s   AAT Act  the needs of case management do not derogate from the requirements of procedural fairness  State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR       Refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting its case  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       The Tribunal wrongly denied the appellant the opportunity to fully present its case  and denied the appellant procedural fairness     The decision of   October   and the reasons given on   April   in relation to reinstatement were unreasonable in that the reference to the adjournment was in relation to material supporting the merits of the case  and not in response to the email evidence that related to the conduct of the appellant  While the Tribunal must be minded to delays and prejudice caused by delay  it must not subordinate that interest to the need for procedural fairness     The Tribunal acted in error by reaching conclusions which were not open to it  and without any reasonable or logical basis  and committed manifest Wednesbury unreasonableness   RESPONDENT S SUBMISSIONS     In summary  the respondent submits that    Procedural fairness only requires that a party be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case  not that a Tribunal ensure that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which it is entitled  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       It is relevant to enquire whether the party or its legal representative should have reasonably apprehended that the issue was or might become a live issue   Re Building Workers  Industrial Union  Aust  Ex parte Gallagher   HCA         ALR   at   and in this matter the appellant did not file any material with the Tribunal in support of its application for reinstatement     It was clear that the appellant was aware of the issue of its non appearance at the directions hearing on   September   that this was a live issue  and that a reasonable explanation and evidence of the reasonable explanation for this non attendance would be required to be put before the Tribunal     The only evidence before the Tribunal at the reinstatement hearing was the email from Mr Summerville to Ms Dimitrijevski  Although  as the appellant submits  there may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant could offer in respect of the document  the appropriate time to provide any explanation was at the reinstatement hearing     There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal     In this case it was open on the material before it for the Tribunal to make the findings of fact that it made  and the decision of the Tribunal was not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense and therefore no error of law was made out   ISSUES BEFORE THIS COURT     There are essentially two issues of law which arise in respect of the appellant s notice of appeal  namely whether the appellant has been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal and whether the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense     The application by the Tribunal of the principles articulated in Manoli was not in dispute     I propose to deal with each issue in turn   WAS THE APPELLANT DENIED PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS BY THE TRIBUNAL      The appellant has strongly urged the Court  both in written and oral submissions  to allow the appeal on the basis that it was denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal  both in relation to the Tribunal refusing an adjournment to allow Counsel for the appellant to take instructions in relation to the email produced at the Tribunal hearing  and in relation to the decision of the Tribunal to refuse to reinstate the matter under s  A AAT Act     The appellant in this case is subject to a significant administrative penalty  It is entitled to dispute that penalty  and to receive a fair hearing in so doing     There is no question that  as explained by Mason J in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   there is a common law duty to act fairly  in the sense of according procedural fairness  in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights  interests and legitimate expectations  In the context of decisions for which provision is made by statute  his Honour went on at      In this respect the expression  procedural fairness  more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case  The statutory power must be exercised fairly  ie in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements  the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes  whether public or private  which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations       Brennan J in Kioa discussed the principles concerning a party having an opportunity to deal with matters relevant to its case as follows     at    A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an interest of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise      The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information  irrespective of its credibility  relevance or significance       Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible  relevant and significant to the decision to be made       These principles were affirmed recently in different contexts by the High Court in Applicant VEAL of   v MIMIA   HCA         ALR   and by the Full Court of the Federal Court in NARV v MIMIA   FCAFC         FCR       In this case the reason that the appellant s substantive application before the Tribunal was dismissed under s  A  AAT Act on   September   was that the appellant did not appear at the hearing on that day  Section  A  provides      If a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in respect of an application for the review of a decision  not being the person who made the decision  fails either to appear in person or to appear by a representative at a directions hearing  or an alternative dispute resolution process under Division   held in relation to the application  or at the hearing of the proceeding  the Tribunal may         a  if the person who failed to appear is the applicant  dismiss the application without proceeding to review the decision  or    b  in any other case  direct that the person who failed to appear shall cease to be a party to the proceeding       There does not appear to be any dispute that the Tribunal was empowered to dismiss the appellant s application on   September   in view of the appellant s non appearance at that hearing     It therefore follows that it was obvious that issues and evidence relevant to the non appearance of the appellant on that day would have been critical at the reinstatement hearing of   October   and that ensuring that all appropriate inquiries had been made by the appellant  and that their Counsel was properly briefed as to this issue  would be important in the conduct of that hearing     As stated by Mason J in Kioa   it is important to consider the issues of procedural fairness as appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case     Here  the Tribunal on   October   had before it a case where  notwithstanding that the case was being prosecuted by the appellant     Over the course of eight months  the appellant had a history of failing to attend hearings  Indeed out of four hearings listed  the appellant attended only one  and another was vacated at its request      The appellant failed to comply with deadlines  including those which it had requested      The notice of the hearing of the substantive matter was sent by the Tribunal to Mr Summerville  the nominated representative of the appellant  in accordance with the AAT Act  Section  AA  provides  so far as relevant     For the purposes of this Act         a  a document  statement  notice or other notification is taken to be given to a person if it is sent by post to whichever of the following addresses is applicable         i  if the document  statement  notice or other notification relates to a proceeding and the person has provided an address to which documents in relation the proceeding may be sent that address                    b  a document  statement  notice or other notification so sent by post is taken to have been given  unless the contrary is proved  at the time when the document  statement  notice or other notification would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post            There does not appear to be any dispute that  at the time  Mr Summerville was properly served with the relevant notice of listing by the Tribunal  or that  as a result for the purposes of s  AA  the appellant was properly served with that notice      It is very clear that critical issues for the appellant in the reinstatement proceedings on   October   were the merits of the substantive application which had been dismissed on   September   and why the appellant had not appeared at the hearing of   September        In relation to the merits of the substantive case the appellant submitted before the Senior Member at the hearing on   October   that        its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success    it intended to show that  on a proper consideration of all the facts  it was not liable for the GST in respect of which it had been assessed    it would show that it was not liable for the GST and penalties imposed by the respondent by means of substantial documentary evidence    it would show that the monies received by it in respect of which GST and penalties had been levied had been refunded in total       Other than those assertions  no material was provided to substantiate the claim of the appellant that its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success       In relation to its failure to appear at the hearing of   September   the appellant submitted in writing before the Senior Member at the hearing of   October   that        the appellant  and  to the best of the appellant s knowledge  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing held by the Tribunal on   September     in the event that Mr Summerville did receive the listing for   September   the appellant was not informed of the listing by Mr Summerville    the appellant believed that the reason that neither it nor  to the best of its belief  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing arose from the change of representation in the matter    as the appellant had not received a listing for the hearing  the appellant was unable to arrange for itself or a representative of itself to attend the hearing    if the appellant had received a listing of the   September   hearing  the appellant would have attended or arranged for a representative to attend the hearing  or otherwise have informed the Tribunal       However  notwithstanding these submissions  the respondent was able  seemingly without difficulty  having inquired of Mr Summerville  to produce evidence that Mr Summerville had forwarded the notice of listing of   September   to the appellant  and had indicated that he intended send on the original notice     In view of the history of this matter  that Counsel for the appellant was taken by surprise by the email was extraordinary  It was particularly astonishing in light of the facts that    presumably  in advance of the hearing of   October   the appellant could have asked Mr Summerville whether he had received the notice of listing  as the respondent did    although the issue of the appellant s non attendance on   September   was decisive in the dismissal of their application on that date  it appeared that the appellant had not taken that elementary step as its Counsel was unprepared for that evidence to be produced    the appellant for unknown reasons was prepared to make submissions that to the best of its knowledge neither it nor Mr Summerville had received the notice of listing  without apparently ascertaining from Mr Summerville whether that was the case appliedAssociated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         All ER    On or about   April   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal

ever have come to it  then the courts can interfere  That  I think  is right  but that would require overwhelming proof  and in this case the facts do not come anywhere near such a thing     at   While sending correspondence or documents by email does not of itself necessarily equate to receipt of that correspondence or those documents by the addressee  this issue was not the subject of submissions before me  however I note an interesting discussion of the issue in S Hill   Flogging a Dead Horse The Postal Acceptance Rule and Email      Journal of Contract Law   the Tribunal had evidence before it that the notice of listing of   September   was not only emailed to the appellant by Mr Summerville  but that  the original  was also sent by another means  I have already noted that it appears that Thiel Partners was the nominated representative of the appellant  There is also no dispute that the address of Thiel Partners was the address nominated by the appellant for service of documents within the meaning of the AAT Act  or that it was appropriate for Mr Summerville  in his communications with the appellant  to forward correspondence to Ms Dimitrijevski  There was evidence before the Tribunal that the notice of listing for the hearing of   September   had been communicated in multiple ways to the appellant and that the appellant was not only claiming lack of awareness of the notice of listing  but apparently as indicated by the fact that its counsel was taken by surprise by this fact was unaware that its representative had forwarded the notice  I note once again that the failure of the appellant to attend the hearing of   September   and reasons for its failure to attend that hearing were clearly likely to be key issues at the hearing of its reinstatement application  On this basis  it was in my view open to Senior Member McCabe to draw adverse inferences concerning the conduct of the appellant  it preparedness for the hearing  and its approach to the litigation as a whole  and to take those findings into account in exercising his discretion to dismiss the reinstatement application   Further  on the case before me it appears that the only evidence before the Tribunal as to the merits of the substantive application were submissions by the appellant that its application had strong merits and a good chance of success  and would be supported by documentary evidence  The lack of more substantial evidence before the Tribunal is surprising  as the appellant had clearly anticipated that the merits of the substantive application would be a key issue  but had chosen not to substantiate its case with supporting evidence  In my view the Tribunal was entitled to make its findings concerning the merits of the substantive case and the scanty nature of the evidence in support of those claimed merits  and to cite this as a ground for exercising the discretion to dismiss the reinstatement application   I note again that the Tribunal is vested with a discretion in s  A  to reinstate applications  if it considers it appropriate to do so   That discretion is not unfettered  but must be exercised reasonably  Brennan CJ in

Tribunal made findings which were open on the case before it  Certainly  the decision of the Tribunal to dismiss the application for reinstatement could not be described as so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it   Accordingly  the decision of the Tribunal is not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense  In my view  the Tribunal in this case has not acted in a manner which gives rise to an error of law  either in refusing to allow an adjournment in relation to the production of Mr Summerville s email  or in dismissing the application for reinstatement   ORDER

   CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   On or about   April   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal requesting written reasons for the decision of Senior Member McCabe given   October    Written reasons for decision were made available on   April     REASONS OF THE TRIBUNAL     Senior Member McCabe indicated in par   of his Reasons for Decision that the principles which should be applied in respect of an application for reinstatement pursuant to s  A  and   are those suggested by Manoli v Secretary to the Department of Social Security     ALD    In summary  the Tribunal must consider    the conduct of the appellant    any prejudice  most obviously prejudice to the respondent    the merits of the substantive case and    in considering these matters  the overriding obligation to do what is fair in the circumstances     Applying that approach  the Tribunal     Did not accept that the appellant and Thiel Partners had not received notice of the hearing listed for   September        Did not accept that the appellant had a good excuse for failing to attend the original hearing on   September   at which the case was dismissed      Found that the interests of the respondent were not prejudiced by the delay attending the review  however some prejudice to the interests of the respondent could accrue if the appellant s claim was not prosecuted expeditiously      Found that the appellant s interests would be prejudiced if the Tribunal did not allow reinstatement because it would be unable to continue its challenge to the decision under review      Was of the view that the merits of the case had not been substantiated beyond an assertion by the appellant that it had good prospects of success      Found that the failure of counsel appearing for the appellant at the hearing to explain the discrepancy between the contentions in the outline and the facts as they emerged at the hearing  must count against the appellant  and that the appellant was treating the Tribunal with  indifference       Found that  the excuse  the appellant  offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue       Was not minded to grant an adjournment to allow the appellant to provide material given the delays that had already occurred     In conclusion  the Tribunal held at par      The original application was dismissed after the appellant or its representative failed to attend a directions hearing  Its reinstatement application did not address one of the important issues before the Tribunal at the hearing  the merits of the case  and the excuse it offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue  It is fair to all the parties in all the circumstances that the application for reinstatement be refused     APPEAL     A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal only on questions of law  s   AAT Act     The grounds of appeal in this case are     Whether the Tribunal erred in law in refusing an application by the appellant for an adjournment to place further affidavit material before the Tribunal and therefore denying the appellant opportunity to properly prosecute the application for reinstatement      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed pursuant to s  A  of the AAT Act  b  by failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant in the circumstances and that any prejudice to the respondent could be remedied by the operation of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect of the order made   October   and the dismissal of the appellant s application to reinstate the application for review      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed pursuant to s  A  of the AAT Act  b  by failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant in the circumstances and that any prejudice to the respondent could be remedied by the operation of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect to the orders made   October   in that the Tribunal has made a decision that is unreasonable   SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT     The appellant submits that the crucial error of the Tribunal appears at pars             of the Written Reasons for Oral Decision of the Tribunal  In summary the appellant submits that    The Tribunal failed to give the appellant a reasonable opportunity to be heard in relation to the email from Mr Summerville  The appellant relied on s   AAT Act which provides that a Tribunal shall ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case     The Tribunal has the power to grant an adjournment at any time and that the efficient running of the court should not prevail over the injustice of preventing the appellant from responding to an adverse inference     The email that was presented to the appellant at the application for reinstatement was information that was adverse to the interests of the appellant  and was used by the Tribunal to make very serious findings against the appellant going to its credit and integrity     There may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant can offer in respect of the email     Although the Tribunal has a duty to discharge its obligations in an expeditious manner  s   AAT Act  the needs of case management do not derogate from the requirements of procedural fairness  State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR       Refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting its case  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       The Tribunal wrongly denied the appellant the opportunity to fully present its case  and denied the appellant procedural fairness     The decision of   October   and the reasons given on   April   in relation to reinstatement were unreasonable in that the reference to the adjournment was in relation to material supporting the merits of the case  and not in response to the email evidence that related to the conduct of the appellant  While the Tribunal must be minded to delays and prejudice caused by delay  it must not subordinate that interest to the need for procedural fairness     The Tribunal acted in error by reaching conclusions which were not open to it  and without any reasonable or logical basis  and committed manifest Wednesbury unreasonableness   RESPONDENT S SUBMISSIONS     In summary  the respondent submits that    Procedural fairness only requires that a party be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case  not that a Tribunal ensure that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which it is entitled  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       It is relevant to enquire whether the party or its legal representative should have reasonably apprehended that the issue was or might become a live issue   Re Building Workers  Industrial Union  Aust  Ex parte Gallagher   HCA         ALR   at   and in this matter the appellant did not file any material with the Tribunal in support of its application for reinstatement     It was clear that the appellant was aware of the issue of its non appearance at the directions hearing on   September   that this was a live issue  and that a reasonable explanation and evidence of the reasonable explanation for this non attendance would be required to be put before the Tribunal     The only evidence before the Tribunal at the reinstatement hearing was the email from Mr Summerville to Ms Dimitrijevski  Although  as the appellant submits  there may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant could offer in respect of the document  the appropriate time to provide any explanation was at the reinstatement hearing     There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal     In this case it was open on the material before it for the Tribunal to make the findings of fact that it made  and the decision of the Tribunal was not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense and therefore no error of law was made out   ISSUES BEFORE THIS COURT     There are essentially two issues of law which arise in respect of the appellant s notice of appeal  namely whether the appellant has been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal and whether the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense     The application by the Tribunal of the principles articulated in Manoli was not in dispute     I propose to deal with each issue in turn   WAS THE APPELLANT DENIED PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS BY THE TRIBUNAL      The appellant has strongly urged the Court  both in written and oral submissions  to allow the appeal on the basis that it was denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal  both in relation to the Tribunal refusing an adjournment to allow Counsel for the appellant to take instructions in relation to the email produced at the Tribunal hearing  and in relation to the decision of the Tribunal to refuse to reinstate the matter under s  A AAT Act     The appellant in this case is subject to a significant administrative penalty  It is entitled to dispute that penalty  and to receive a fair hearing in so doing     There is no question that  as explained by Mason J in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   there is a common law duty to act fairly  in the sense of according procedural fairness  in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights  interests and legitimate expectations  In the context of decisions for which provision is made by statute  his Honour went on at      In this respect the expression  procedural fairness  more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case  The statutory power must be exercised fairly  ie in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements  the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes  whether public or private  which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations       Brennan J in Kioa discussed the principles concerning a party having an opportunity to deal with matters relevant to its case as follows     at    A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an interest of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise      The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information  irrespective of its credibility  relevance or significance       Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible  relevant and significant to the decision to be made       These principles were affirmed recently in different contexts by the High Court in Applicant VEAL of   v MIMIA   HCA         ALR   and by the Full Court of the Federal Court in NARV v MIMIA   FCAFC         FCR       In this case the reason that the appellant s substantive application before the Tribunal was dismissed under s  A  AAT Act on   September   was that the appellant did not appear at the hearing on that day  Section  A  provides      If a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in respect of an application for the review of a decision  not being the person who made the decision  fails either to appear in person or to appear by a representative at a directions hearing  or an alternative dispute resolution process under Division   held in relation to the application  or at the hearing of the proceeding  the Tribunal may         a  if the person who failed to appear is the applicant  dismiss the application without proceeding to review the decision  or    b  in any other case  direct that the person who failed to appear shall cease to be a party to the proceeding       There does not appear to be any dispute that the Tribunal was empowered to dismiss the appellant s application on   September   in view of the appellant s non appearance at that hearing     It therefore follows that it was obvious that issues and evidence relevant to the non appearance of the appellant on that day would have been critical at the reinstatement hearing of   October   and that ensuring that all appropriate inquiries had been made by the appellant  and that their Counsel was properly briefed as to this issue  would be important in the conduct of that hearing     As stated by Mason J in Kioa   it is important to consider the issues of procedural fairness as appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case     Here  the Tribunal on   October   had before it a case where  notwithstanding that the case was being prosecuted by the appellant     Over the course of eight months  the appellant had a history of failing to attend hearings  Indeed out of four hearings listed  the appellant attended only one  and another was vacated at its request      The appellant failed to comply with deadlines  including those which it had requested      The notice of the hearing of the substantive matter was sent by the Tribunal to Mr Summerville  the nominated representative of the appellant  in accordance with the AAT Act  Section  AA  provides  so far as relevant     For the purposes of this Act         a  a document  statement  notice or other notification is taken to be given to a person if it is sent by post to whichever of the following addresses is applicable         i  if the document  statement  notice or other notification relates to a proceeding and the person has provided an address to which documents in relation the proceeding may be sent that address                    b  a document  statement  notice or other notification so sent by post is taken to have been given  unless the contrary is proved  at the time when the document  statement  notice or other notification would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post            There does not appear to be any dispute that  at the time  Mr Summerville was properly served with the relevant notice of listing by the Tribunal  or that  as a result for the purposes of s  AA  the appellant was properly served with that notice      It is very clear that critical issues for the appellant in the reinstatement proceedings on   October   were the merits of the substantive application which had been dismissed on   September   and why the appellant had not appeared at the hearing of   September        In relation to the merits of the substantive case the appellant submitted before the Senior Member at the hearing on   October   that        its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success    it intended to show that  on a proper consideration of all the facts  it was not liable for the GST in respect of which it had been assessed    it would show that it was not liable for the GST and penalties imposed by the respondent by means of substantial documentary evidence    it would show that the monies received by it in respect of which GST and penalties had been levied had been refunded in total       Other than those assertions  no material was provided to substantiate the claim of the appellant that its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success       In relation to its failure to appear at the hearing of   September   the appellant submitted in writing before the Senior Member at the hearing of   October   that        the appellant  and  to the best of the appellant s knowledge  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing held by the Tribunal on   September     in the event that Mr Summerville did receive the listing for   September   the appellant was not informed of the listing by Mr Summerville    the appellant believed that the reason that neither it nor  to the best of its belief  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing arose from the change of representation in the matter    as the appellant had not received a listing for the hearing  the appellant was unable to arrange for itself or a representative of itself to attend the hearing    if the appellant had received a listing of the   September   hearing  the appellant would have attended or arranged for a representative to attend the hearing  or otherwise have informed the Tribunal       However  notwithstanding these submissions  the respondent was able  seemingly without difficulty  having inquired of Mr Summerville  to produce evidence that Mr Summerville had forwarded the notice of listing of   September   to the appellant  and had indicated that he intended send on the original notice     In view of the history of this matter  that Counsel for the appellant was taken by surprise by the email was extraordinary  It was particularly astonishing in light of the facts that    presumably  in advance of the hearing of   October   the appellant could have asked Mr Summerville whether he had received the notice of listing  as the respondent did    although the issue of the appellant s non attendance on   September   was decisive in the dismissal of their application on that date  it appeared that the appellant had not taken that elementary step as its Counsel was unprepared for that evidence to be produced    the appellant for unknown reasons was prepared to make submissions that to the best of its knowledge neither it nor Mr Summerville had received the notice of listing  without apparently ascertaining from Mr Summerville whether that was the case citedKruger v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I note again that the Tribunal is vested with a discretion in s  A

to the email produced at the Tribunal hearing  and in relation to the decision of the Tribunal to refuse to reinstate the matter under s  A AAT Act     The appellant in this case is subject to a significant administrative penalty  It is entitled to dispute that penalty  and to receive a fair hearing in so doing     There is no question that  as explained by Mason J in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   there is a common law duty to act fairly  in the sense of according procedural fairness  in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights  interests and legitimate expectations  In the context of decisions for which provision is made by statute  his Honour went on at      In this respect the expression  procedural fairness  more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case  The statutory power must be exercised fairly  ie in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements  the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes  whether public or private  which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations       Brennan J in Kioa discussed the principles concerning a party having an opportunity to deal with matters relevant to its case as follows     at    A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an interest of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise      The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information  irrespective of its credibility  relevance or significance       Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible  relevant and significant to the decision to be made       These principles were affirmed recently in different contexts by the High Court in Applicant VEAL of   v MIMIA   HCA         ALR   and by the Full Court of the Federal Court in NARV v MIMIA   FCAFC         FCR       In this case the reason that the appellant s substantive application before the Tribunal was dismissed under s  A  AAT Act on   September   was that the appellant did not appear at the hearing on that day  Section  A  provides      If a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in respect of an application for the review of a decision  not being the person who made the decision  fails either to appear in person or to appear by a representative at a directions hearing  or an alternative dispute resolution process under Division   held in relation to the application  or at the hearing of the proceeding  the Tribunal may         a  if the person who failed to appear is the applicant  dismiss the application without proceeding to review the decision  or    b  in any other case  direct that the person who failed to appear shall cease to be a party to the proceeding       There does not appear to be any dispute that the Tribunal was empowered to dismiss the appellant s application on   September   in view of the appellant s non appearance at that hearing     It therefore follows that it was obvious that issues and evidence relevant to the non appearance of the appellant on that day would have been critical at the reinstatement hearing of   October   and that ensuring that all appropriate inquiries had been made by the appellant  and that their Counsel was properly briefed as to this issue  would be important in the conduct of that hearing     As stated by Mason J in Kioa   it is important to consider the issues of procedural fairness as appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case     Here  the Tribunal on   October   had before it a case where  notwithstanding that the case was being prosecuted by the appellant     Over the course of eight months  the appellant had a history of failing to attend hearings  Indeed out of four hearings listed  the appellant attended only one  and another was vacated at its request      The appellant failed to comply with deadlines  including those which it had requested      The notice of the hearing of the substantive matter was sent by the Tribunal to Mr Summerville  the nominated representative of the appellant  in accordance with the AAT Act  Section  AA  provides  so far as relevant     For the purposes of this Act         a  a document  statement  notice or other notification is taken to be given to a person if it is sent by post to whichever of the following addresses is applicable         i  if the document  statement  notice or other notification relates to a proceeding and the person has provided an address to which documents in relation the proceeding may be sent that address                    b  a document  statement  notice or other notification so sent by post is taken to have been given  unless the contrary is proved  at the time when the document  statement  notice or other notification would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post            There does not appear to be any dispute that  at the time  Mr Summerville was properly served with the relevant notice of listing by the Tribunal  or that  as a result for the purposes of s  AA  the appellant was properly served with that notice      It is very clear that critical issues for the appellant in the reinstatement proceedings on   October   were the merits of the substantive application which had been dismissed on   September   and why the appellant had not appeared at the hearing of   September        In relation to the merits of the substantive case the appellant submitted before the Senior Member at the hearing on   October   that        its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success    it intended to show that  on a proper consideration of all the facts  it was not liable for the GST in respect of which it had been assessed    it would show that it was not liable for the GST and penalties imposed by the respondent by means of substantial documentary evidence    it would show that the monies received by it in respect of which GST and penalties had been levied had been refunded in total       Other than those assertions  no material was provided to substantiate the claim of the appellant that its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success       In relation to its failure to appear at the hearing of   September   the appellant submitted in writing before the Senior Member at the hearing of   October   that        the appellant  and  to the best of the appellant s knowledge  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing held by the Tribunal on   September     in the event that Mr Summerville did receive the listing for   September   the appellant was not informed of the listing by Mr Summerville    the appellant believed that the reason that neither it nor  to the best of its belief  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing arose from the change of representation in the matter    as the appellant had not received a listing for the hearing  the appellant was unable to arrange for itself or a representative of itself to attend the hearing    if the appellant had received a listing of the   September   hearing  the appellant would have attended or arranged for a representative to attend the hearing  or otherwise have informed the Tribunal       However  notwithstanding these submissions  the respondent was able  seemingly without difficulty  having inquired of Mr Summerville  to produce evidence that Mr Summerville had forwarded the notice of listing of   September   to the appellant  and had indicated that he intended send on the original notice     In view of the history of this matter  that Counsel for the appellant was taken by surprise by the email was extraordinary  It was particularly astonishing in light of the facts that    presumably  in advance of the hearing of   October   the appellant could have asked Mr Summerville whether he had received the notice of listing  as the respondent did    although the issue of the appellant s non attendance on   September   was decisive in the dismissal of their application on that date  it appeared that the appellant had not taken that elementary step as its Counsel was unprepared for that evidence to be produced    the appellant for unknown reasons was prepared to make submissions that to the best of its knowledge neither it nor Mr Summerville had received the notice of listing  without apparently ascertaining from Mr Summerville whether that was the case citedNARV v MIMIA   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html   On or about   April   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal requesting written reasons for the decision of Senior Member McCabe given   October    Written reasons for decision were made available on   April     REASONS OF THE TRIBUNAL     Senior Member McCabe indicated in par   of his Reasons for Decision that the principles which should be applied in respect of an application for reinstatement pursuant to s  A  and   are those suggested by Manoli v Secretary to the Department of Social Security     ALD    In summary  the Tribunal must consider    the conduct of the appellant    any prejudice  most obviously prejudice to the respondent    the merits of the substantive case and    in considering these matters  the overriding obligation to do what is fair in the circumstances     Applying that approach  the Tribunal     Did not accept that the appellant and Thiel Partners had not received notice of the hearing listed for   September        Did not accept that the appellant had a good excuse for failing to attend the original hearing on   September   at which the case was dismissed      Found that the interests of the respondent were not prejudiced by the delay attending the review  however some prejudice to the interests of the respondent could accrue if the appellant s claim was not prosecuted expeditiously      Found that the appellant s interests would be prejudiced if the Tribunal did not allow reinstatement because it would be unable to continue its challenge to the decision under review      Was of the view that the merits of the case had not been substantiated beyond an assertion by the appellant that it had good prospects of success      Found that the failure of counsel appearing for the appellant at the hearing to explain the discrepancy between the contentions in the outline and the facts as they emerged at the hearing  must count against the appellant  and that the appellant was treating the Tribunal with  indifference       Found that  the excuse  the appellant  offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue       Was not minded to grant an adjournment to allow the appellant to provide material given the delays that had already occurred     In conclusion  the Tribunal held at par      The original application was dismissed after the appellant or its representative failed to attend a directions hearing  Its reinstatement application did not address one of the important issues before the Tribunal at the hearing  the merits of the case  and the excuse it offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue  It is fair to all the parties in all the circumstances that the application for reinstatement be refused     APPEAL     A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal only on questions of law  s   AAT Act     The grounds of appeal in this case are     Whether the Tribunal erred in law in refusing an application by the appellant for an adjournment to place further affidavit material before the Tribunal and therefore denying the appellant opportunity to properly prosecute the application for reinstatement      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed

the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect to the orders made   October   in that the Tribunal has made a decision that is unreasonable   SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT     The appellant submits that the crucial error of the Tribunal appears at pars             of the Written Reasons for Oral Decision of the Tribunal  In summary the appellant submits that    The Tribunal failed to give the appellant a reasonable opportunity to be heard in relation to the email from Mr Summerville  The appellant relied on s   AAT Act which provides that a Tribunal shall ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case     The Tribunal has the power to grant an adjournment at any time and that the efficient running of the court should not prevail over the injustice of preventing the appellant from responding to an adverse inference     The email that was presented to the appellant at the application for reinstatement was information that was adverse to the interests of the appellant  and was used by the Tribunal to make very serious findings against the appellant going to its credit and integrity     There may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant can offer in respect of the email     Although the Tribunal has a duty to discharge its obligations in an expeditious manner  s   AAT Act  the needs of case management do not derogate from the requirements of procedural fairness  State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR       Refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting its case  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       The Tribunal wrongly denied the appellant the opportunity to fully present its case  and denied the appellant procedural fairness     The decision of   October   and the reasons given on   April   in relation to reinstatement were unreasonable in that the reference to the adjournment was in relation to material supporting the merits of the case  and not in response to the email evidence that related to the conduct of the appellant  While the Tribunal must be minded to delays and prejudice caused by delay  it must not subordinate that interest to the need for procedural fairness     The Tribunal acted in error by reaching conclusions which were not open to it  and without any reasonable or logical basis  and committed manifest Wednesbury unreasonableness   RESPONDENT S SUBMISSIONS     In summary  the respondent submits that    Procedural fairness only requires that a party be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case  not that a Tribunal ensure that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which it is entitled  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       It is relevant to enquire whether the party or its legal representative should have reasonably apprehended that

Tribunal at the reinstatement hearing was the email from Mr Summerville to Ms Dimitrijevski  Although  as the appellant submits  there may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant could

was open on the material before it for the Tribunal to make the findings of fact that it made  and the decision of the Tribunal was not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense and therefore no error of law was made out   ISSUES BEFORE THIS COURT     There are essentially two issues of law which arise in respect of the appellant s notice of appeal  namely whether the appellant has been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal and whether the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense     The application by the Tribunal of the principles articulated in Manoli was

law was made out   ISSUES BEFORE THIS COURT     There are essentially two issues of law which arise in respect of the appellant s notice of appeal  namely whether the appellant has been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal and whether the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense     The application by the Tribunal of the principles articulated in Manoli was not in dispute     I propose to deal with each issue in turn   WAS THE APPELLANT DENIED PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS BY THE TRIBUNAL      The appellant has strongly urged the Court  both in written and oral submissions  to allow the appeal on the basis that it was denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal  both in relation to the Tribunal refusing an adjournment to allow Counsel for the appellant to take instructions in relation to the email produced at the Tribunal hearing  and in relation to the decision of the Tribunal to refuse to reinstate the matter under s  A AAT Act     The appellant in this case is subject to a significant administrative penalty  It is entitled to dispute that penalty  and to receive a fair hearing in so doing     There is no question that  as explained by Mason J in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   there is a common law duty to act fairly  in the sense of according procedural fairness  in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights  interests and legitimate expectations  In the context of decisions for which provision is made by statute  his Honour went on at      In this respect the expression  procedural fairness  more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case  The statutory power must be exercised fairly  ie in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements  the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes  whether public or private  which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations       Brennan J in Kioa discussed the principles concerning a party having an opportunity to deal with matters relevant to its case as follows     at    A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an interest of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise      The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information  irrespective of its credibility  relevance or significance       Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible  relevant and significant to the decision to be made       These principles were affirmed recently in different contexts by the High Court in Applicant VEAL of   v MIMIA   HCA         ALR   and by the Full Court of the Federal Court in NARV v MIMIA   FCAFC         FCR       In this case the reason that the appellant s substantive application before the Tribunal was dismissed under s  A  AAT Act on   September   was that the appellant did not appear at the hearing on that day  Section  A  provides      If a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in respect of an application for the review of a decision  not being the person who made the decision  fails either to appear in person or to appear by a representative at a directions hearing  or an alternative dispute resolution process under Division   held in relation to the application  or at the hearing of the proceeding  the Tribunal may         a  if the person who failed to appear is the applicant  dismiss the application without proceeding to review the decision  or    b  in any other case  direct that the person who failed to appear shall cease to be a party to the proceeding       There does not appear to be any dispute that the Tribunal was empowered to dismiss the appellant s application on   September   in view of the appellant s non appearance at that hearing     It therefore follows that it was obvious that issues and evidence relevant to the non appearance of the appellant on that day would have been critical at the reinstatement hearing of   October   and that ensuring that all appropriate inquiries had been made by the appellant  and that their Counsel was properly briefed as to this issue  would be important in the conduct of that hearing     As stated by Mason J in Kioa   it is important to consider the issues of procedural fairness as appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case     Here  the Tribunal on   October   had before it a case where  notwithstanding that the case was being prosecuted by the appellant     Over the course of eight months  the appellant had a history of failing to attend hearings  Indeed out of four hearings listed  the appellant attended only one  and another was vacated at its request      The appellant failed to comply with deadlines  including those which it had requested      The notice of the hearing of the substantive matter was sent by the Tribunal to Mr Summerville  the nominated representative of the appellant  in accordance with the AAT Act  Section  AA  provides  so far as relevant     For the purposes of this Act         a  a document  statement  notice or other notification is taken to be given to a person if it is sent by post to whichever of the following addresses is applicable         i  if the document  statement  notice or other notification relates to a proceeding and the person has provided an address to which documents in relation the proceeding may be sent that address                    b  a document  statement  notice or other notification so sent by post is taken to have been given  unless the contrary is proved  at the time when the document  statement  notice or other notification would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post            There does not appear to be any dispute that  at the time  Mr Summerville was properly served with the relevant notice of listing by the Tribunal  or that  as a result for the purposes of s  AA  the appellant was properly served with that notice      It is very clear that critical issues for the appellant in the reinstatement proceedings on   October   were the merits of the substantive application which had been dismissed on   September   and why the appellant had not appeared at the hearing of   September        In relation to the merits of the substantive case the appellant submitted before the Senior Member at the hearing on   October   that        its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success    it intended to show that  on a proper consideration of all the facts  it was not liable for the GST in respect of which it had been assessed    it would show that it was not liable for the GST and penalties imposed by the respondent by means of substantial documentary evidence    it would show that the monies received by it in respect of which GST and penalties had been levied had been refunded in total       Other than those assertions  no material was provided to substantiate the claim of the appellant that its case had  strong merits and a good chance of success       In relation to its failure to appear at the hearing of   September   the appellant submitted in writing before the Senior Member at the hearing of   October   that        the appellant  and  to the best of the appellant s knowledge  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing held by the Tribunal on   September     in the event that Mr Summerville did receive the listing for   September   the appellant was not informed of the listing by Mr Summerville    the appellant believed that the reason that neither it nor  to the best of its belief  Mr Summerville  did not receive any listing for the hearing arose from the change of representation in the matter    as the appellant had not received a listing for the hearing  the appellant was unable to arrange for itself or a representative of itself to attend the hearing    if the appellant had received a listing of the   September   hearing  the appellant would have attended or arranged for a representative to attend the hearing  or otherwise have informed the Tribunal       However  notwithstanding these submissions  the respondent was able  seemingly without difficulty  having inquired of Mr Summerville  to produce evidence that Mr Summerville had forwarded the notice of listing of   September   to the appellant  and had indicated that he intended send on the original notice     In view of the history of this matter  that Counsel for the appellant was taken by surprise by the email was extraordinary  It was particularly astonishing in light of the facts that    presumably  in advance of the hearing of   October   the appellant could have asked Mr Summerville whether he had received the notice of listing  as the respondent did    although the issue of the appellant s non attendance on   September   was decisive in the dismissal of their application on that date  it appeared that the appellant had not taken that elementary step as its Counsel was unprepared for that evidence to be produced    the appellant for unknown reasons was prepared to make submissions that to the best of its knowledge neither it nor Mr Summerville had received the notice of listing  without apparently ascertaining from Mr Summerville whether that was the case appliedSullivan v Department of Transport     ALR    On or about   April   the appellant wrote to the Tribunal requesting written reasons for the decision of Senior Member McCabe given   October    Written reasons for decision were made available on   April     REASONS OF THE TRIBUNAL     Senior Member McCabe indicated in par   of his Reasons for Decision that the principles which should be applied in respect of an application for reinstatement pursuant to s  A  and   are those suggested by Manoli v Secretary to the Department of Social Security     ALD    In summary  the Tribunal must consider    the conduct of the appellant    any prejudice  most obviously prejudice to the respondent    the merits of the substantive case and    in considering these matters  the overriding obligation to do what is fair in the circumstances     Applying that approach  the Tribunal     Did not accept that the appellant and Thiel Partners had not received notice of the hearing listed for   September        Did not accept that the appellant had a good excuse for failing to attend the original hearing on   September   at which the case was dismissed      Found that the interests of the respondent were not prejudiced by the delay attending the review  however some prejudice to the interests of the respondent could accrue if the appellant s claim was not prosecuted expeditiously      Found that the appellant s interests would be prejudiced if the Tribunal did not allow reinstatement because it would be unable to continue its challenge to the decision under review      Was of the view that the merits of the case had not been substantiated beyond an assertion by the appellant that it had good prospects of success      Found that the failure of counsel appearing for the appellant at the hearing to explain the discrepancy between the contentions in the outline and the facts as they emerged at the hearing  must count against the appellant  and that the appellant was treating the Tribunal with  indifference       Found that  the excuse  the appellant  offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue       Was not minded to grant an adjournment to allow the appellant to provide material given the delays that had already occurred     In conclusion  the Tribunal held at par      The original application was dismissed after the appellant or its representative failed to attend a directions hearing  Its reinstatement application did not address one of the important issues before the Tribunal at the hearing  the merits of the case  and the excuse it offered for its earlier failure to attend turned out to be untrue  It is fair to all the parties in all the circumstances that the application for reinstatement be refused     APPEAL     A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal only on questions of law  s   AAT Act     The grounds of appeal in this case are     Whether the Tribunal erred in law in refusing an application by the appellant for an adjournment to place further affidavit material before the Tribunal and therefore denying the appellant opportunity to properly prosecute the application for reinstatement      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed pursuant to s  A  of the AAT Act  b  by failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant in the circumstances and that any prejudice to the respondent could be remedied by the operation of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect of the order made   October   and the dismissal of the appellant s application to reinstate the application for review      a  by not giving the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances of its non appearance at a hearing held   September   at which the Tribunal directed that the application be dismissed pursuant to s  A  of the AAT Act  b  by failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant in the circumstances and that any prejudice to the respondent could be remedied by the operation of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth        Whether the Tribunal erred in law in respect to the orders made   October   in that the Tribunal has made a decision that is unreasonable   SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT     The appellant submits that the crucial error of the Tribunal appears at pars             of the Written Reasons for Oral Decision of the Tribunal  In summary the appellant submits that    The Tribunal failed to give the appellant a reasonable opportunity to be heard in relation to the email from Mr Summerville  The appellant relied on s   AAT Act which provides that a Tribunal shall ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case     The Tribunal has the power to grant an adjournment at any time and that the efficient running of the court should not prevail over the injustice of preventing the appellant from responding to an adverse inference     The email that was presented to the appellant at the application for reinstatement was information that was adverse to the interests of the appellant  and was used by the Tribunal to make very serious findings against the appellant going to its credit and integrity     There may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant can offer in respect of the email     Although the Tribunal has a duty to discharge its obligations in an expeditious manner  s   AAT Act  the needs of case management do not derogate from the requirements of procedural fairness  State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR       Refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting its case  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       The Tribunal wrongly denied the appellant the opportunity to fully present its case  and denied the appellant procedural fairness     The decision of   October   and the reasons given on   April   in relation to reinstatement were unreasonable in that the reference to the adjournment was in relation to material supporting the merits of the case  and not in response to the email evidence that related to the conduct of the appellant  While the Tribunal must be minded to delays and prejudice caused by delay  it must not subordinate that interest to the need for procedural fairness     The Tribunal acted in error by reaching conclusions which were not open to it  and without any reasonable or logical basis  and committed manifest Wednesbury unreasonableness   RESPONDENT S SUBMISSIONS     In summary  the respondent submits that    Procedural fairness only requires that a party be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case  not that a Tribunal ensure that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which it is entitled  Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR       It is relevant to enquire whether the party or its legal representative should have reasonably apprehended that the issue was or might become a live issue   Re Building Workers  Industrial Union  Aust  Ex parte Gallagher   HCA         ALR   at   and in this matter the appellant did not file any material with the Tribunal in support of its application for reinstatement     It was clear that the appellant was aware of the issue of its non appearance at the directions hearing on   September   that this was a live issue  and that a reasonable explanation and evidence of the reasonable explanation for this non attendance would be required to be put before the Tribunal     The only evidence before the Tribunal at the reinstatement hearing was the email from Mr Summerville to Ms Dimitrijevski  Although  as the appellant submits  there may be several reasonable explanations that the appellant could offer in respect of the document  the appropriate time to provide any explanation was at the reinstatement hearing     There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal     In this case it was open on the material before it for the Tribunal to make the findings of fact that it made  and the decision of the Tribunal was not unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense and therefore no error of law was made out   ISSUES BEFORE THIS COURT     There are essentially two issues of law which arise in respect of the appellant s notice of appeal  namely whether the appellant has been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal and whether the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense     The application by the Tribunal of the principles articulated in Manoli was not in dispute     I propose to deal with each issue in turn   WAS THE APPELLANT DENIED PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS BY THE TRIBUNAL      The appellant has strongly urged

allow Counsel for the appellant to take instructions in relation to the email produced at the Tribunal hearing  and in relation to the decision of the Tribunal to refuse to reinstate the matter under

Neither the Act nor the common law imposes upon the Tribunal the impossible task of ensuring that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is entitled   In my view  the Tribunal was entitled to take into consideration not only the approach the appellant had taken to the case as a whole  but also what appeared to be the approach of the appellant to the case before it on   October    While as a general rule it may be appropriate  on the production of new evidence which surprises one of the parties  for the Tribunal to permit an adjournment for the party to have the opportunity take instructions or consider its position  in the circumstances it is difficult to find otherwise than that the appellant had been provided with a reasonable opportunity to present its case
