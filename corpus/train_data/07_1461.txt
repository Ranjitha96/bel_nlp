SZFJU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I accept that Tribunals  and particularly lay Tribunals  sometimes assert that there is  no evidence  on an issue when they mean that  although there is some evidence on the issue  they do not regard the evidence as sufficient to support a particular finding  see  for example A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at       and Wickramasinghe v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at      In every case the meaning intended to be conveyed by the Tribunal is to be determined by reference to the language used by the Tribunal understood in the context provided by the Tribunal s reasons for decision as a whole  In this case  having twice asserted that there was  no evidence  of a particular character  the Tribunal went on to state that the appellant had not provided  any information which would support  his  claim other than his own speculative assertion    I conclude that the Tribunal s language  understood in the context provided by its written reasons as a whole  suggests that the Tribunal intended to convey that there was no evidence at all on the two matters identified by it

the Tribunal intended to convey that there was no evidence at all on the two matters identified by it citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   I accept the submission of the first respondent that the above submission is inconsistent with the recent decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR    While the full import of that decision awaits clarification  the majority judgment makes clear that s  A has a more limited operation than was previously assumed  It had been argued before the High Court that passages from the appellant s statutory declaration that the Tribunal regarded as inconsistent with his evidence at his hearing should have been the subject of a notice under s  A of the Act because those inconsistencies were the reason  or part of the reason  for the Tribunal s decision to affirm the decision under review   The majority judgment in SZBYR at     at     makes clear that  in the circumstances of that case  the relevant parts of the statutory declaration of the appellant in support of his claims to be entitled to a protection visa were not  information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review    The circumstances of SZBYR are not in this respect distinguishable from the circumstances of this case  I therefore reject the submission of the appellant that the Tribunal was obliged to comply with s  A of the Act with respect to the information available to it concerning the content of his protection visa application  It is therefore unnecessary for this Court to determine whether the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the decision of the Tribunal was not based on an inconsistency between what the appellant said in his visa application and what he said to the Tribunal   The second ground of appeal also fails   The appeal will be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding
