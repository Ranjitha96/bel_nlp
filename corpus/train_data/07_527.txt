Perpetual Trustees Australia Ltd v Wallace   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAttorney General v Breckler   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe applicant submitted that s   does not authorise the Tribunal to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties by the application of the law to determined facts  Rather  it empowers the Tribunal to exercise afresh  discretionary powers that the applicant in question had  By that structure  the Tribunal does not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth  Attorney General v Breckler   HCA         CLR    In order  therefore  for the Tribunal to be able to substitute its decision  it was necessary for it to identify a discretion  which the applicant had exercised  which was not  fair and reasonable  and which the Tribunal could then re exercise  The applicant pointed to the Tribunal s reasoning by reference to the following extract from the Tribunal s Review Determination and Reasons       The Tribunal notes that the Trustee has power to pay a benefit to the Complainant under its compromise power in rules    d  of the   Trust Deed and    d  of the   Trust Deed and the relevant state s Trustee Act      The reasoning was flawed  so the submission went  as was the Tribunal s consequential determination that it could order the applicant to pay the respondent    Clause     of the   Trust Deed provided        Trustee s Powers             The Trustee may do anything it considers appropriate to administer the Fund and comply with Superannuation Law  including                 a  giving receipts and discharges     b  conducting and settling legal proceedings     c  referring claims to arbitration     d  compromising any claim     e  giving any guarantee or indemnity     f  insuring any risks     g  acting as an underwriter     h  making rules for rounding off contributions and benefits     i  providing for and transferring liability for any tax     j  electing to be bound by any legislation  The real issue in the context of these grounds of appeal is whether the respondent s claim is a claim against the Fund or a claim against the applicant  If it is a claim against the Fund  then the applicant is empowered  but not obliged  to compromise it pursuant to cl    d  of the   Trust Deed  A discretion is involved and the exercise of that discretion by the applicant  as trustee  is within the Tribunal s jurisdiction of review without involving the Tribunal in the exercise of judicial power  As was said in the joint judgment  Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ  in Breckler at        The limitation of the grounds of complaint to one that the decision was unfair or unreasonable suggests that what is involved is a complaint as to the exercise by the trustee of a discretion rather than the discharge of duties  for example to distribute to those answering specified criteria  To like effect  Kirby J said at        The majority of the Full Court upheld the conclusion of the primary judge that the Tribunal s jurisdiction was confined to the review of discretionary decisions  Only in discretionary cases would questions as to the unfairness or unreasonableness of the decision under review arise for the Tribunal s determination  Upon this issue the dissenting judge reached the same conclusion  He relied on the fact that  i n the case of non discretionary decisions the Tribunal is denied that ability  of determining whether or not the decision is unfair or unreasonable  by s    That is the subsection which forbids the Tribunal from doing  anything     that would be contrary to law  to the governing rules of the fund concerned and  if a contract of insurance between an insurer and trustee is involved  to the terms of the contract   Having established that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was so confined to functions arguably apt to a non judicial body engaged in broad evaluation of merits  as distinct from the determination of purely legal rights  the point of difference between the majority and dissentient in the Full Court was reached  On the other hand  if it is a claim against the applicant then  on my view of the proper construction of cl    d  of the   Trust Deed  it is irrelevant to the source of the applicant s power to compromise the claim  However  the Tribunal submitted that the following considerations are critical       a  As the High Court pointed out in Breckler   the Tribunal exercises a jurisdiction to which entities choose to subscribe  in return for  inter alia   preferential taxation treatment    b  It has a place within a complex regulatory scheme over superannuation entities  and although its review function is independent  it is  for example  supplied with staff by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission  ASIC  see subs   of the Complaints Act    c  Its secrecy provisions have an express exemption for disclosure of information where the Tribunal is requested to do so by ASIC or APRA  subs   of the Complaints Act    d  Sections   and  A of the Complaints Act impose statutory obligations of notification to ASIC and APRA on the Tribunal followedEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs to the first point  the applicant submitted that a fair minded lay observer seeing the letter might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial mind to bear on the issues before it  The situation it was said is not analytically different from a Supreme Court judge trying a criminal case seeking advice from the police  For that reason a case of apprehended bias is made out  Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR   at       As to the apprehension of bias ground  on the resumed hearing of the appeal  the Tribunal  in its submissions  referred to what was said in the joint judgment in Ebner at          The apprehension of bias principle      in its  application requires two steps  First  it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge  or juror  to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits  The second step is no less important  There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits  The bare assertion that a judge  or juror  has an  interest  in litigation  or an interest in a party to it  will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest  and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making  is articulated  Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed      The need for this two step process was affirmed in Smits v Roach   HCA         ALR   at        Applying the two steps in Ebner   the Tribunal in its submissions asked and answered the following two rhetorical questions       a  What is said by the applicant to be the conduct which gives rise to the apprehension  It is said to be the writing of a letter by the Director of the Tribunal  Ms McDonald  to APRA inviting assistance from APRA  This letter follows a s   referral    b  What is the  logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits  No such connection has been articulated by the applicant  It is difficult to see what the connection could be  given that the author of this letter is a staff member of the Tribunal  and not one of the two members appointed pursuant to s   and constituted pursuant to s   to conduct this review  More so because the person who made the referral was the Tribunal Chairperson himself  and not one of the two constituted members  The Tribunal submitted that the two step process set out in Ebner cannot be satisfied in the present case  Moreover  taking into account the factors set out above  the Tribunal submitted no fair minded lay observer  informed of the nature of the Tribunal s jurisdiction  the way it conducts its hearings and the presence of its obligations under ss   and  A of the Complaints Act  combined with other features of its legislative scheme  would apprehend that contact by Tribunal administrative staff would mean that the two Tribunal members constituted to deal with this review would not bring impartial minds to the review  Further  no such fair minded lay observer  properly informed  would apprehend that a referral made by the Tribunal Chairperson pursuant to a statutory duty would mean that the two  other  Tribunal members constituted to hear this review would not bring impartial minds to their task  As to the denial of procedural fairness ground  the Tribunal submitted that  once the subject matter of the s   referral is understood  it cannot sensibly be argued that whether APRA s investigations would or would not ultimately determine that the applicant had breached the standards set out in reg     was in any remote way  relevant and probative to the issues the applicant was making submissions about   There were no findings about a breach of such standards made by the Tribunal  nor were those standards put in issue  Accordingly  there was no occasion at all for disclosure of the referral to the applicant  In any event  so the submission went  there is no substantive unfairness because the applicant was aware of the referral to APRA  By an email dated   June    that is  two days after the letter of   June     Mr Ian Yard Smith  counsel for the applicant  stated that he had  just been discussing this matter with Suzette Wilson from APRA  citedR v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFinally  the applicant submitted that the argument advanced by the Tribunal that there was no denial of procedural fairness was outside the grant of leave that was afforded to the Tribunal to make submissions about the matters in R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR    The Tribunal  by making this submission  enters the arena properly occupied by the applicant and the respondent  it is difficult to see how the submission is one which is limited to the Tribunal s powers and procedures  The applicant submitted that by making this submission  the Tribunal has taken the respondent s side in the case  The  ambulatory  nature of the Tribunal which has intervened means that the apprehension of bias which arises cannot be resolved by reconstituting the Tribunal in a different way  Apart from that difficulty  according to the applicant  the submission is without merit  The Tribunal argues that there is no substantive unfairness because the applicant was made aware of the notification to APRA  in an email dated   June    However  the applicant continued  the apprehended bias case was not based on the notification to APRA  It was based on the discussions which may have taken place between APRA and the Tribunal after that notification  There is no doubt that the real complaint of the applicant in relation to ground  h  the Tribunal acting in a way  by consulting with APRA  which gave rise to an apprehension of bias was not the s   referral made by the Chairperson of the Tribunal on   May   but the letter of invitation to Mr Venkatramani of APRA  at   sent by Ms McDonald  a Director of the Tribunal  on   June   and the content of that letter  It invited discussion not on possible contravention by the applicant of reg     of the SIS Regs but in assisting the Tribunal in identifying all possible issues and gathering all relevant information before the matter  the respondent s complaint  was listed for a review

per Mason P  Accordingly  a breach of the rules of procedural fairness occurred  By failing to afford the applicant procedural fairness  the Tribunal committed an excess of jurisdiction and hence an error of law citedLaws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     ALR  For that reason  I do not agree with the Tribunal s submission that the Tribunal s statutory functions and procedures  in particular the requirement in s   to refer matters to APRA  informs or circumscribes the practical content of the requirement to avoid apprehension of bias  Nor do I think the rule of necessity operates in the present case to prevail over and displace the application of the rules of natural justice to ensure that the Tribunal is not disabled from performing its statutory functions  cf   Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     ALR   at      The letter at   and the subject matter of the invitation it contained had nothing to do with the statutory functions of the Tribunal under s    However  there are a number of difficulties in the way of the applicant succeeding on this ground and the next an alleged failure to accord the applicant procedural fairness  First  the letter at   was not sent by the members who constituted the Tribunal for the purpose of hearing the respondent s complaint  Indeed  it was not even sent by the Chairperson who made the s   referral  It was sent by a staff member of the Tribunal holding the position of Director  Second  there is no evidence that any meeting or discussions took place in response to the letter and even if a meeting or discussions took place

its submissions in relation to ground  g  of the notice of appeal  the Tribunal submits that this issue whether the respondent s claim is a claim against the Fund or whether it is a claim against the applicant is to be determined by reference to whether or not the applicant  as trustee  has a right of indemnity against the trust assets  In other words  a right to indemnify itself in respect of the loss it will suffer as a result of payment of compensation  If it does  then the claim  so the submission goes  is a claim against the Fund  if it does not  so the submission goes  then the claim is a claim against the applicant  Reliance for this submission is placed on what was said by this Court  Allsop J  in Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd v Crocker     ATR   at             Whether the tribunal deals with it or the Trustee deals with it  the parties concerned  including Ms Crocker  must appreciate that what is involved is not the determination of the rights of the parties  That is for suit in a court  which may  in the end  be the only appropriate forum in which to vindicate her position   Rather it is a decision whether  despite the lack of entitlement under the policy  it is appropriate for the Trustee to compound Ms Crocker s claim and  if it is  in what amount        Of course  in that inquiry  some assessment of legal  as well as factual  issues will have to be made  Did the Trustee s conduct  which is said to give rise to the claim  exhibit a lack of honesty or an intentional or reckless failure to exercise care and diligence   See cl    a i  or  ii  of the trust deed   If so  then it is probably not a claim  against the Plan   ie the trust  for the purposes of cl  c  because the Trustee  in these circumstances  has no right of indemnity against the trust assets  If not  it probably is such a claim   against the Plan  for the purposes of cl  c  because the Trustee would have a right of indemnity  I agree with the Trustee s submissions in this regard      These observations have to be understood in the context of Crocker as a whole  Ms Crocker s complaint was that the trustee had refused to pay her a benefit in consequence of her being totally and permanently disabled  The trustee determined that she was not  The Tribunal decided otherwise and remitted back to the trustee quantum related issues  Allsop J accepted that the Tribunal s reasoning that Ms Crocker was within the definition of totally and permanently disabled was wrong and he set it aside      However  Ms Crocker also advanced a separate argument to the effect that even if she was not totally and permanently disabled  nevertheless  because the trustee had a power to compromise a claim  its discretionary decision not to do so was reviewable by the Tribunal  Clause  c  of the trust deed which applied to Ms Crocker was in the following terms       to institute  conduct  defend  compound or abandon any legal proceedings by or against the Plan or its officers or otherwise concerning the affairs of the Plan and also to compound and allow time for payments or satisfaction and allow time for payments or satisfaction of any debts due and of any claims or demands by or against the Plan      Allsop J found that the trustee did not exercise the power in cl  c  at all    He noted an argument put by the trustee at       It was said by the Trustee before me that the decision made by the Trustee was in respect of a claim by Ms Crocker for her entitlement  that is under the relevant policy  to disability benefits  The Trustee refused that claim  That decision was correct  by reference to the terms of the insurance policy   It was said that the question as to whether the Trustee would be entitled to use cl  c  and thereby trust funds to settle a different claim one for damages or compensation based on its conduct towards Ms Crocker in circumstances predicated upon her lack of entitlement  has not been the subject of a decision  or indeed a claim  Thus  it was said  to the extent that the tribunal dealt with that subject matter in respect of the second unit  it impermissibly embarked on an adjudication of the rights of the parties  not upon review of a decision  reference was made to Briffa v Hay at    The trustee  therefore  ran an argument that the claim against it was a personal claim and was not a claim for a benefit due under the terms of the trust for which it would be indemnified  Thus  so the argument ran  this infringed the requirement that the Tribunal not deal with the adjudication of the rights of the parties  Of that topic  Allsop J had  himself  said at           In the context of a trustee acting as the trustee of a superannuation fund pursuant to a trust deed and an insurer issuing a policy to the trustee on behalf of the members of a fund  allegations of the kind just mentioned might throw up for consideration a number of matters if one were concerned with analysing or determining all the legal rights and obligations of the   parties  member  trustee and insurer  inter se  questions as to whether the member was entitled under the terms of the trust or the terms of the insurance policy to disability cover  questions as to whether  irrespective of the terms of the policy  the trustee had bound itself in some fashion to the member to provide disability cover  questions as to whether any such obligation had been created in contract  by estoppel or in some other legal or equitable framework  and questions as to whether  if the trustee had so bound itself and was not entitled to have the insurer pay the claim  it was entitled to indemnify itself out of the trust fund to meet such obligation        However  the Tribunal s task was not to determine all such rights and obligations of the parties  To do so would  in all likelihood  see it purport to engage in the exercise of judicial power  Rather  the Tribunal s task was confined to the role given to it by the Act  At this point I gratefully adopt the description of the legislative scheme set out by the full court in National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell   FCA         FCR   at       to    This relieves me of referring to the Superannuation  Resolution of Complaints  Act    Cth    other than to the provisions essential to these reasons  The argument put by the trustee at   potentially involved Allsop J in having to consider whether the argument he touched upon at     that the determination of rights involved the exercise of judicial power was correct  His Honour circumvented this problem by holding that the compromise clause applied because Ms Crocker s claim was against the fund and was not a personal claim against the trustee  At     his Honour said        It would have been open to the Trustee on the claim before it to deal with the matter not only by reference to r  A   of the trust deed  but also  having concluded that no entitlements arose under the policy and thus no requirement lay on it to pay an Insured Benefit by reason of the terms of r  A   by reference to cl  c   That is  it would have been open to the Trustee to consider whether  in the circumstances  it was appropriate to compound the claim of Ms Crocker under cl  c         Any such decision would have raised questions as to whether that would be a proper exercise of power  in particular in the light of the expression  the Plan  in cl  c  Recital A and r   and the basis for the exclusion of the Trustee s personal liability under cl      If it were to be concluded that the exercise of the power could possibly be made  that is  bearing in mind cl     it would not be an exercise in self dealing by the Trustee  any such decision would then have raised questions about the merits of the claim both factually and legally  In these circumstances these questions would not be arising in the context of the Trustee deciding the rights of Ms Crocker against itself  but in the context of making a decision as to whether or not it should compound the claim  Explicitly  therefore  Allsop J rejected the argument at   that what was being compromised was a personal claim against the trustee  His Honour then reasoned that the Tribunal had not considered the re exercise of this power and remitted the matter back to it for it to do so      The applicant submits that the following propositions emerge from the foregoing analysis of Crocker        a  Crocker expressly proceeded on the basis that the claim made was not a claim for compensation from the trustee for breach of trust but rather a claim under the policy for a benefit due from the fund    b  it not being a personal claim  it was able to be compromised under clause  c       c  had the claim been a personal claim  it would have been necessary to deal with the argument at   that the determination of the claim would have involved the adjudication of rights   and   d  had those issues arisen and they did not his Honour s expressed view  at     was that such a process by the Tribunal would have involved the exercise of judicial power  I agree with this submission  Understanding the observations of his Honour at   and   extracted at   above in this context  what his Honour was considering at   was whether a claim  which was clearly a claim  against the Plan  was a claim against the trustee because of the lack of any indemnity against the trust assets  That is not this case  Here the claim of the respondent is clearly a claim against the applicant and not against the Fund  In any event  there is no right of indemnity against the trust assets because by the time the claim was made there were no trust assets  It was tentatively suggested by Senior Counsel for the Tribunal that the applicant would have been insured against any loss it suffered as a result of paying compensation to the respondent and in that sense the applicant had the benefit of an indemnity  But even if the applicant carried such insurance  it would be an indemnity sourced outside its position as trustee of the Fund and nothing that was said in the passages extracted from Crocker would work a conversion of the claim from one against the applicant to one against the Fund  On the view I take  the respondent s claim is against the applicant and not against the Fund  As such  the provisions of cl    d  of the   Trust Deed and s  d  of the Trustee Act    NSW  have no relevance or role to play  The decision under review  namely the applicant s refusal to compensate the respondent for his loss alleged to result from the applicant s contravention of SIS Act covenants in the investment strategy it adopted  was not a decision the Tribunal had jurisdiction to review under s   of the Complaints Act  In the circumstances  it is not necessary to consider ground  f   The determination of the Tribunal dated   February   must be set aside and  in lieu thereof  the respondent s complaint to the Tribunal be dismissed  This ground of the amended notice of appeal was predicated on the unstated premise that cl    d  of the   Trust Deed did confer a power on the applicant  as trustee  to compromise a claim against itself  On the views expressed in     above  the ground does not arise citedSmits v Roach   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs to the apprehension of bias ground  on the resumed hearing of the appeal  the Tribunal  in its submissions  referred to what was said in the joint judgment in Ebner at          The apprehension of bias principle      in its  application requires two steps  First  it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge  or juror  to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits  The second step is no less important  There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits  The bare assertion that a judge  or juror  has an  interest  in litigation  or an interest in a party to it  will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest  and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making  is articulated  Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed      The need for this two step process was affirmed in Smits v Roach   HCA         ALR   at       citedVFAB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe Tribunal submitted that the correct approach is that set out by this Court  Kenny J  in VFAB v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at        The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is well settled  The test is whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided  see Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte H   HCA         ALJR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron and Gummow JJ  As their Honours observed  this rule may be expressed differently when applied to administrative proceedings  in order to take account of the nature of the decision maker and its proceedings   R egard must be had to the statutory provisions  if any  applicable to the proceedings in question  the nature of the inquiries to be made and the particular subject matter with which the decision is concerned  see Ex parte H   at    Further  their Honours posited  at   that          Perhaps it would be better  in the case of administrative proceedings held in private  to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings  the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias  Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation  there is  in our view  no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility  as distinct from probability  as to what will be done or what might have been done  To do otherwise  would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof  The Tribunal noted that her Honour also emphasised  at   that the nature of the Tribunal s processes was important to ascertaining the presence or absence of an apprehension of bias       In order to determine whether  in this case  there was disqualifying bias  the court must carefully consider all the circumstances in order to assure itself that the test is by a fair minded lay observer  Accordingly  the Court must consider the nature of the Tribunal  the issues before it  and the conduct of all relevant participants in the proceeding  Applying those authorities to the present situation  the Tribunal submitted the following considerations are important       a  The Tribunal is an administrative tribunal which sits in private    b  Although it has the power to conduct oral hearings  it generally does not  but rather decides matters  on the papers     c  It decided this matter on the papers
