HCA         CLR   and Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR   namely that the case is  so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed  citedEsanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBoth senior counsel for the valuers relied particularly on what was said by Brennan CJ in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords   HCA         CLR   a claim brought by a financier against the auditors of a borrower corporation  The High Court held that the statement of claim did not disclose a cause of action in negligence against the auditors  His Honour said at            that mere foreseeability of the possibility that a statement made or advice given by A to B might be communicated to a class of which C is a member and that C might enter into some transaction as the result thereof and suffer financial loss is not sufficient to impose on A duty of care owed to C in the making of the statement or the giving of the advice      However his Honour went on to say     But  in every case  it is necessary for the plaintiff to allege and prove that the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the information or advice would be communicated to the plaintiff  either individually or as a member of an identified class  that the information or advice would be so communicated for a purpose that would be very likely to lead the plaintiff to enter into a transaction of the kind that the plaintiff does enter into and that it would be very likely that the plaintiff would enter into such a transaction or reliance on the information or advice and thereby risk the incurring of economic loss if the statement should be untrue or the advice should be unsound  If any of these elements be wanting  the plaintiff fails to establish that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care in making this statement or giving advice  The statement of claim does not plead these elements  The significance of the pleading in that case was pointed out by Gaudron J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   where her Honour said at   that in Esanda            it was not pleaded that the auditors in question knew or ought to have known that a finance provider would rely on their audited statement of accounts and thus  it was held  on the pleadings  that no duty of care was owed by the auditors to the finance provider      In the present case of course  as has been seen  that matter has been pleaded in pars  A and  A  It seems to me to be arguable  at least for the purpose of resisting a strike out application  that an identified class in the sense used by Brennan CJ would include the class of persons who were clients of Boyds and who had requested Boyds to seek the advice of valuers in relation to these particular properties  in a context where no doubt Boyds themselves were providing other financial advice  The circumstance that a Melbourne firm of accountants was seeking valuations of farming properties in Tasmania itself arguably tends to show that the valuations were not being sought by the accountants themselves acting as principals  In support of the motions reliance was placed on the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Ta Ho Ma Pty Ltd v Allen   NSWCA         NSWLR    Senior counsel referred to what was said by Giles JA said at        So a valuer who puts out a negligent valuation does not incur an open ended liability to any and every financier who relies on it  even if it was reasonably foreseeable that the financer would rely on it  The particular financier may be outside the class of person to whom the valuer owes a duty to take care in making the statement in the valuation  in the same manner as Esanda was outside the class of persons to whom the auditors owed a duty of care on the case as pleaded in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords   HCA         CLR   the auditors owed a duty of care to the members of Excel  but not to Esanda  citedPerre v Apand Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe significance of the pleading in that case was pointed out by Gaudron J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   where her Honour said at   that in Esanda            it was not pleaded that the auditors in question knew or ought to have known that a finance provider would rely on their audited statement of accounts and thus  it was held  on the pleadings  that no duty of care was owed by the auditors to the finance provider      In the present case of course  as has been seen  that matter has been pleaded in pars  A and  A  The case is certainly not authority for any proposition that a valuer only owes a duty of care to the client who directly retains him or her  If that were the law  there would have been a short answer to the plaintiff s claim since the chain went from valuer defendant to owner to solicitor to lender plaintiff  On the facts  as Handley JA noted at   it was not a case where the valuer contemplated that a class of persons might rely on his valuation  Giles JA at   pointed out that where a valuer puts out a negligent valuation the class of persons to whom the duty of care         will normally be confined  apart from any other considerations  to those persons whom the valuer knows or ought to know will reasonably rely on the valuation    Emphasis in original     In other words  given expectation of reasonable reliance  there can be a duty owed by a valuer to a class of persons  The identification of that class will obviously depend on the circumstances       Perre   a decision of the High Court handed down shortly after Ta Ho Ma  demonstrates the flexibility and pragmatism of the law of negligence in identifying the class of persons to whom a duty of care is owed in a particular case and the absence of any bright line rule  see per Gleeson CJ at    It was held that the defendant  which brought infected seed potatoes on to a farm in South Australia  owed a duty of care to growers within   kilometres of the farm because such persons would be prevented by Western Australian law from exporting potatoes to that State  The plaintiffs  were members of a class whose members  whether numerous or not  were ascertainable by  the defendant  per McHugh J at    As I have said  it is arguable that in the present case there was an identifiable class constituted by clients of Boyds on whose behalf that firm was seeking the valuations in connection with some commercial dealing involving the specified properties  The disclaimers are not conclusive if  as a matter of fact  the valuers must be taken to have expected that such clients of Boyds would reasonably rely on the valuations  Otherwise  one might ask  what would be the point of obtaining the valuations  It was also argued that the allegations of reliance were  mere statements of conclusion   However reliance can be inferred from the representations contained in the valuations and the applicant s purchase of the properties  Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at   Henderson v Amadio  No      FCR   at   Hanave Pty Ltd v LFOT Pty Ltd     IPR   at    To the extent that such authorities deal with proof of reliance in the context of causation there is no logical ground why the reasoning should not apply where reliance is an element in the establishment of a duty of care  On behalf of Mantach it was submitted that the pleading  does not identify the qualities and standards by which it says that only     ha of Broadmoor was available for cropping   This seems to be a matter of evidence  In this context it would seem that pyrethrum is the kind of cropping referred to  The particulars of negligence are reasonably specific and do  contrary to the submissions on behalf of Mantach  identify the basis upon which it is alleged that the firm departed from the standard of care required of an expert in arriving at an opinion  In particular  it appears to be alleged that the valuers failed to independently check the cropping area and simply relied on the vendors  The motions will be dismissed with costs  Counsel for the applicant conceded that some formal amendments may be needed to the statement of claim  There will be leave to file and serve a further amended statement of claim within fourteen days    I certify that the preceding twenty nine   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Peat Marwick Hungerfords   HCA         CLR   the auditors owed a duty of care to the members of Excel  but not to Esanda  In Ta Ho Ma an owner of property obtained a valuation from the defendant  Some   months later the owner telephoned a solicitor  apparently not the owner s own solicitor  seeking a loan and advising of the valuation  The solicitor in turn contacted the plaintiff who advanced a loan on the basis of the defendant s valuation which by this time was   months old  The Court of Appeal held that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff because  having regard to the age of the valuation  there could be no expectation of reasonable reliance by the plaintiff  see per Handley JA at     per Giles JA at       per Sheppard AJA at    The case is certainly not authority for
