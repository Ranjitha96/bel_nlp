SZKMU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredJess v Scott     FCR   The leading authority in relation to the exercise of that discretion is a decision of the Full Federal Court in Jess v Scott     FCR    At page   in that case  it is observed that the term   special reasons   is   an elastic test suitable for application across a range of situations  from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period    I remind myself also that the rules of Court are meant to be a servant of justice  not its master   Later cases have highlighted a number of considerations that are relevant to the granting of an extension of time within which to appeal  These are       a  the length of the delay involved in the filing of the notice   b  where there is an acceptable explanation for that delay   c  whether the respondent will suffer prejudice by reason of the delay  and    d  the nature of the injustice to the applicant if an extension is not granted   As to the last of these considerations  it can  in particular cases  be relevant to consider the merits of the proposed appeal having regard to the draft notice of appeal grounds  There is no asserted prejudice to the Minister or  for that matter  the Executive Government of the Commonwealth  in relation to the granting of an extension  Further  I can well understand the difficulties faced by a person whose first language is not English and whose command of English is  at best  very limited
