As Emmett J remarked  in a different statutory context  in Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Pappas   FCA   at     the power to examine witnesses is a significant one which is conferred in the public interest  His Honour continued    Members of the public should understand that failure to comply with orders of the Court requiring compliance with the Commission s requirements in connection with investigation will not be treated lightly   In my view  his Honour s remarks are equally applicable to the failure to comply with the Board s requirements  in the exercise of powers that are conferred on it in the public interest   It follows from these authorities  and from the statutory regime to which I referred at     of my principal judgment  that an appropriate penalty would be one which signifies to Mr Albarran and to the public  that failure to comply with the obligation to answer the Board s questions will be treated no less seriously than it would in the exercise of similar functions by a Court   Eight of those factors were listed by Emmett J in Pappas at   as relevant to the question of determination of penalty in the case of failure to assist ASIC in connection with an investigation under s   of the ASIC Act    I adopt the factors listed by Brereton J in Anderson   and accepted by Emmett J in Pappas   as guiding principles for the determination of the appropriate penalty  The tenth factor referred to by Brereton J  namely denunciation of the contempt  was not included in Emmett J s list  However  in my opinion it is a factor to be taken into

accidental or unintentional              Reference was also made in Mudginberri to the underlying rationale of every exercise of the contempt power  namely the need to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice  Their Honours quoted from the then current edition of the seminal work on the law of contempt  Borrie   Lowe s Law of Contempt   nd ed    if a court lacked the means to

practical significance  Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at    Nevertheless  a number of relevant principles are to be found in their Honours  analysis of the distinction that was previously thought to underlie the difference between the civil and criminal species of contempt   First  disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking to a court amounts to a criminal contempt if it involves deliberate defiance or is contumacious  Witham v Holloway at    A contempt which is characterised in this way is therefore at the more serious end of the spectrum  although any contempt is a serious matter   Second  proceedings for breach of an order or undertaking have the effect of vindicating judicial authority  and a remedial or coercive effect  Witham v Holloway at     Third  as was
