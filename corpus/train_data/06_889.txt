Vu v Commissioner of Taxation  with Corrigendum dated   July     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedHill v Repatriation Commission     ALR   Division   of the Administration Act imposes several important limitations upon a Tribunal s review of an objection decision  Two are of particular importance for present purposes  Both are contained in s  ZZK of that Act  The first is that  unless the Tribunal orders otherwise  an applicant is limited to the grounds stated in the taxation objection to which the decision relates  The significance of this limitation is that the objection circumscribes the issue or issues raised by the applicant which the Tribunal is required to determine  This contrasts with the usual case of Tribunal review where the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the person whose decision is in question  hearing the matter de novo and reaching its own conclusion on the material before it as to what is the correct or preferable decision  The difference between the forms of text review  as will be seen  can become accentuated when  as in this matter  an attack is made upon the adequacy of the Tribunal s reasons for decision  for the ordinary case of review see e g  Hill v Repatriation Commission     ALR   at     The second limitation on an objection decision review is that the applicant bears the burden of proving  if the decision is an assessment  that the assessment is excessive  s  ZZK b i  of the Administration Act   This onus is of some significance in this proceeding citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro     ATR   The parties are in broad agreement as to the manner in which the discharge or non discharge of the onus can affect a Tribunal s determination of the issues before it  They accept as do I  the

Taxation   HCA         CLR      In McCormack v FCT   HCA         CLR       Gibbs J said that s  b  of the Assessment Act placed the burden of proving that the assessment was excessive upon the taxpayer and that on ordinary principles the taxpayer therefore bore the burden of proving the facts necessary to make out his or her case  at CLR    To discharge the burden of proving that the assessment is excessive the taxpayer in McCormack  a s  a  case  was required to prove affirmatively on the balance of probabilities that the property was not acquired for the purpose of profit making

evidence from which it can be concluded that the relevant purpose of profit making existed  since this would mean that the burden of proving the existence of that purpose lies on the FCT  That would

discussedGalea v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   The only additional matter of principle to which I need refer concerning the onus of proof is that in a Tribunal review of an assessment it is not necessary for the Commissioner to seek to establish that the applicant s assessable income was or was at least a particular figure  As Hill J commented in Galea v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   at      The fact that the Commissioner sought so to do and failed has no bearing  at the end of the day  on the question whether the applicant has discharged the onus of showing  as he is required by sec  b  of the Act to show  that the assessment is excessive  The Commissioner s failure to establish a positive case  if that is what he sought to do  leaves the Tribunal in no different position than it would have been in if the Commissioner had not sought at all to advance a positive case   The Tribunal  necessarily  reviewed jointly the applications of Mr Vu and Mrs Duy as their cases and grounds of objection were interrelated  The primary cases put were that the money deposited in bank accounts during the relevant tax years represented capital and or income of Mrs Duy derived by her in Vietnam prior to becoming a resident of Australia  Mrs Duy stated that she and Mr Vu subsequently carried US  and A  into Australia in cash in fourteen trips made by one or other of them  Reasons at      Only two small amounts allegedly so carried   and   were declared to Australian Customs  Reasons at    A further sum of A  was transferred from Vietnam through a Sydney based company  I would note in passing that the Tribunal found  with considerable reservation  that this last sum was not income but represented funds of Mrs Duy prior to her arrival in Australia  Reasons at   and     The Tribunal accepted that Mrs Duy may well have earned income in a range of activities in which she said she engaged in Vietnam and which on the evidence of Mrs Duy and her witnesses indicated earnings of over US   However  the Tribunal was not satisfied that those activities necessarily resulted in her having available to her in   the equivalent of almost A  million citedCasarotto v Australian Postal Commission     ALR   As I understand the  bank accounts  submission it is said that once the Tribunal rejected Mr Vu s and Mrs Duy s evidence on the provenance of the money in Mrs Duy s accounts and concluded that it could not be satisfied that it came from Vietnam  the evidence was  simply  that Mrs Duy had bank accounts in her name  In these circumstances the Tribunal should have inferred or presumed the moneys were hers  the second ground of appeal   If the Tribunal had a reason for not so inferring or presuming and for finding as it did  it did not state its reason in its decisions  This omission was in relation to a material question of fact  s  B    AAT Act and as such involved an error of law  the first ground of appeal   On such an error see e g  Casarotto v Australian Postal Commission     ALR   at       These grounds of appeal can be answered shortly  The objection decision to be reviewed by the Tribunal was that all of the moneys in the bank accounts were the joint income of Mr Vu and Mrs Duy for the relevant tax years  The grounds of objection taken to the assessment of present relevance were  insofar as Mr Vu was concerned   i  that the moneys in the accounts were brought from Vietnam  were capital and or income derived by him when a non resident of Australia  or were funds given to him by his own and his spouse s family  and  ii  the moneys did not represent assessable income and were not assessable to the taxpayer   These  considered in context  are quite circumscribed grounds of objection  The Tribunal considered  their basic thrust  as relating to the alleged prior earning of funds by Mrs Duy in Vietnam and their later transfer by cash to  and then deposit in banks in  Australia  It would appear that Mr Vu s contentions before the Tribunal were limited to providing particular explanations as to the sources of the money in question which were ascribed primarily to his wife s money in Vietnam appliedHolloway v McFeeters   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I would  though  make the following additional comment  The applicant s characterisation of the resultant state of the evidence  the Tribunal having not accepted his and Mrs Vu s account of the provenance of the moneys in the deposits  is inaccurate  The matter put in issue by Mr Vu and his wife was not the identity of the holder of bank accounts but the alleged particular source of the deposits in those accounts  i e  transfers of Mrs Duy s monies from Vietnam  That positive case failed  Its failure  though  did not authorise or require the Tribunal to infer or to presume that the monies deposited were Mrs Duy s  The Tribunal had not accepted that the moneys had the provenance both Mr Vu and Mrs Duy advanced  The Tribunal s reasons betray an understandable scepticism concerning the actions and statements of the couple  In this setting  where positive proof of the provenance of the moneys in the account was necessary  if Mr Vu was to show his assessments were excessive  there could be no possible place for a presumption such as is now advanced  Equally  in light of the Tribunal s reasoning and finding  the inference proposed could not properly be said to be the most probable and reasonable deduction from the established facts  cf Holloway v McFeeters   HCA         CLR   at    The applicant s failure to discharge the burden cast on him was not an advantage to him  Rather it left unestablished what was needed to be established if he was to succeed before the Tribunal  No process of inference could overcome that disadvantage   I will order that the application be dismissed with costs      I certify that the preceding twenty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy
