Holdings Co Ltd v Trigem Computer Inc   NSWSC   citedML Ubase Holdings Co Ltd v Trigem Computer Inc   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  There is a clear line of authority which establishes that draft documents and other communications of a like nature with an expert witness proposed to be called in litigation are privileged under s  b  whatever may have been the position at common law  Natuna Pty Limited v Cook   NSWSC     New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd  In Liq      Or v Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd   NSWSC     and ML Ubase Holdings Co Ltd v Trigem Computer Inc   NSWSC     The same question has been dealt with by Brereton J in ML Ubase at     where his Honour says      In my view  what Enderby J said in Crawford v Bailey  unreported  NSWSC  Enderby J    October   is no longer the law  if it ever was  What his Honour said is inconsistent with Dingwall   v the Commonwealth   FCA         FCR   and with Tirango   Nominees Pty Ltd v Dairy Vale Foods Ltd     ALR    Moreover  it is not the test enunciated by Evidence Act      NSW  s    In my opinion  service and tender of an expert witness  report in proceedings does not constitute a waiver of the privilege which attaches to communications between the expert and the solicitors who instructed him or her  save to the extent that those communications are associated documents reasonably necessary to an understanding of the report   Proper understanding  of a document or communication will sometimes  but not always require that documents to which it responds or refers be available  It may very likely be so when the primary document contains a summary or excerpt from an earlier communication  or responds to questions which are not themselves restated in it  But I do not accept that  a proper understanding of the communication or document  involves an appreciation of the manner in which the opinions contained in the document have been formed over time  or the iterations and evolutions through which they have passed  The test is concerned with the comprehensibility of the primary communication or document  if it can be completely or thoroughly understood without more  then access to the related communications or documents is not reasonably necessary        Accordingly  for the purposes of s     one starts by looking at the substantive document  made admissible under s   or another of the applicable sections  and asking whether  in order to understand it thoroughly  it is necessary to know what is in the associated material   In the present case senior counsel for Darrell Lea has not been able to point to any particular part of Dr Stavros  report of which it can be said that some further document is required to enable the report to be understood  Still less has it been possible to identify any such document   Reference was made to the role played by the firm QBrand Consulting  which was referred to in paragraph   of Dr Stavros  first affidavit  He deposes there that in preparing this affidavit he has been assisted by staff members of QBrand Consulting        with which firm I have a support arrangement in relation to this type of work  This assistance took the form of administrative tasks  assisting with drafting  preparation of exhibits and obtaining copies of relevant research materials  All opinions expressed in this affidavit are my own   That does not to my mind indicate any uncertainty or ambiguity or confusion in the body of Dr Stavros  affidavit  In any event  the fact that QBrand Consulting is a third party  neither the expert nor the client  does not exclude the situation from the reach of s  b    As a result  I uphold the claim of privilege   I certify that the preceding eight   numbered
