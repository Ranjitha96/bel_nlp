in the Federal Court referred toBHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhen judgment on the substantive claims was delivered   BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd  No     FCA   several issues were left for later consideration  Those issues are    on what claim will BHPB elect to take judgment    in what currency should judgment be given    interest  and   costs  The parties have filed written submissions on each issue  Some raise nice questions of principle  BHPB was successful in several of its claims against Cosco  including a claim that Cosco had breached a warranty that it had authority to act on behalf of New Century International Leasing Co Ltd  NCI  in the negotiations of the charterparty for the Global Hawk  BHPB elects to take judgment on that claim  In the originating application BHPB claimed damages in US dollars  At trial BHPB proved the value of its claim in US dollars  That value is US     This amount comprises unpaid hire  a ballast bonus  bunkers  port costs and miscellaneous expenses  less a payment of US   Although in its originating process BHPB claimed damages in US currency and established the quantum of that claim in US currency  it now seeks judgment for the Australian dollar equivalent calculated as at the date of entry of judgment citedCalderbank v Calderbank   Fam  First  BHPB relies on what it describes as a Calderbank letter  after Calderbank v Calderbank   Fam     which it served on Cosco s lawyers before the trial  The relevant parts of the Calderbank letter read       I n a genuine attempt to resolve its dispute with both Cosco and  Seawise  the second respondent  our client would be prepared to accept the total of US  plus interest and costs as follows           a  as to Cosco  US   plus interest and costs to be agreed or otherwise taxed           b  as to  Seawise  US   plus interest  and costs to be agreed or otherwise taxed           Clearly this figure represents a considerable reduction of our client s principal claim  and we would encourage your client to take advantage of this opportunity to resolve the claim promptly and in its entirety  Further  should Cosco and  Seawise  as between themselves  consider that a different division of the total amount of US  plus interest and costs occur  we would invite you to deal with that as you may see fit  provided the total of our client s offer is met  For good reason BHPB was seeking to compromise its claims against both respondents  For that it wanted a total of US  plus interest plus costs  Accordingly  BHPB made an offer that could only be accepted by both respondents unless one agreed to pay the full claim with interest and costs  and the other respondent agreed to waive any claim for costs  According to the Calderbank principle  indemnity costs will not be ordered if a party acted reasonably in rejecting the Calderbank offer  Cosco s rejection of BHPB s Calderbank offer was reasonable  A party will be acting reasonably in rejecting a Calderbank offer if the offer is unclear or imprecise  In this case  BHPB s offer was imprecise in some respects  The offer did not specify a rate of interest  in circumstances where the applicable rate was open to argument  More importantly  it is unclear whether the offer was being made to Cosco alone  or Cosco and Seawise jointly  The offer appears to have been addressed to Cosco alone  but refers to both Cosco and Seawise making payments  If the offer was made to both Cosco and Seawise jointly  then this raises a further problem the offer was incapable of acceptance by Cosco alone  BHPB is not entitled to charge one offeree with indemnity costs for not having accepted an offer that was incapable of acceptance by that offeree alone  BHPB also seeks indemnity costs by reason of the abandonment by both respondents on the first and second days of the trial of several contentions raised in their respective defences on which BHPB had gone to the trouble of obtaining expert evidence from two lawyers  The particular contentions were that BHPB had failed to exercise rights of lien and possession with the consequence that it was the author of its own loss  These allegations made it necessary for BHPB to call expert evidence on English law  the law of the charterparty  and Thai law  the place where the Global Hawk was to discharge its cargo   The abandonment of part of the defence is not  without more  the occasion to award indemnity costs in respect of those costs which  in the event  have been unnecessarily incurred  Indemnity costs might be justified if the abandoned contentions were hopeless  That  however  is not what is argued here  What happened in this case was that BHPB filed the relevant expert reports around a month or so prior to the trial commencing  When BHPB s case in respect of the abandoned contentions was fully laid out  the respondents realised they could not meet it  So  by abandoning aspects of their respective defences  the respondents saved BHPB incurring unnecessary trial costs as well as saving court time  They should not be punished for that  Accordingly  up to the point where BHPB filed the expert reports  indemnity costs are clearly not warranted  Whether indemnity costs should be paid in respect of costs incurred after the filing of expert reports is more difficult  The respondents took more than a month after receiving the expert reports to indicate they were abandoning the contentions  During that period  BHPB may have incurred further costs regarding the abandoned contentions  although these costs may have been ameliorated by the fact that the experts were to give oral testimony via videolink   On balance  I consider that the respondents  delay in indicating their intentions to BHPB was not so great as to warrant the award of costs on an indemnity basis citedFederal Commerce and Navigation Co Ltd v Tradax Export SA  The Martha Envoy    QB  So  for example  where damages consist of expenses incurred in the currency of the contract  the award should be made in that currency  Federal Commerce and Navigation Co Ltd v Tradax Export SA  The Martha Envoy    QB    If  on the other hand  the expenditure is incurred in another currency and in order to meet it the plaintiff uses his own currency  then the award should be made in the plaintiff s own currency  The Folias   AC       at   citedGould v Vaggelas     CLR  The last contentious matter is BHPB s application for a Bullock or Sanderson order so that Cosco will bear the costs of the successful respondent  Seawise  Such orders may be justified where the applicant has reasonably and properly incurred the cost of joining the successful defendant to establish his claim and it is just that the unsuccessful respondent should bear the costs of the joinder  see generally Gould v Vaggelas     CLR   at pp       Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee v Gibson   NSWCA   at         State of Victoria v Hovarth   VSCA    It will be just to make a Bullock or Sanderson order if the conduct of the unsuccessful respondent has rendered it appropriate to shift the incidents of the successful respondent s costs  That is the position here  BHPB was justified in joining Seawise after Cosco filed a defence denying responsibility for BHPB s losses and laying the blame at the feet of Seawise  That made it inevitable that BHPB would join Seawise and it is equally inevitable that Cosco should bear Seawise s costs notfollowedIn re United

US prime borrowing rate in respect of a judgment in US dollars  This decision was reversed on appeal  but on other grounds  Neuchatel Swiss General Insurance Co v Vlasons Shipping Inc   VSCA    I would also apply that rate calculated on a monthly basis  In the case of judgment for damages to be entered in Australian dollars  the practice is to adopt the rate prevailing in the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the Federal Court is sitting  Namol Pty Ltd v AW Baulderstone Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR   at   citedWestpac Banking Corp v MV  Stone Gemini    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAt one time it was clear that an Australian court could only enter judgment in Australian currency  In re United Railways of Havana and Regla Warehouses Ltd   AC   at      That is no longer the law  In some cases at least  a judgment can be given in a foreign currency  In Miliangos v George Frank  Textiles  Ltd   AC   the House of Lords held that where a contract provides for a monetary obligation to be paid in foreign currency  the judgment ought be given in that currency  It is now also established that judgment can be given in foreign currency for damages in tort   The Despina R   AC   and for breach of contract   Jean Kraut A G v Albany Fabrics   QB     The Folias   AC        Miliangos has been followed in Australia  see eg Mitsui OSK Lines
