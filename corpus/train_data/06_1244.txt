SZEXF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs I have foreshadowed  counsel for the Minister indicated that no opposition was raised to the filing of the amended notice of appeal  nor to the presentation by the appellants of the case articulated by their counsel in belated written submissions  nor to the joinder of the Refugee Review Tribunal as an additional respondent  That joinder occurred consistently with the view of the High Court expressed in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   to the effect that the Tribunal is an officer of the Commonwealth for the purpose of s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Before proceeding further  it is appropriate that I outline the reasons of the Federal Magistrate upon his review of the Tribunal decision below  that is of course the second or later Tribunal decision of   December    Nicholls FM summarised the appellants  complaints  as outlined to the Federal Magistrates Court by way of the amended application for review by way of appeal filed on   November   as follows   i  denial of procedural fairness and natural justice  by reason of the Tribunal s bias or by reason that there was an apprehension of bias         ii  withholding by the Tribunal from the appellants of independent country information about Bangladesh  and of the opportunity to comment thereon  and         iii  failure by the Tribunal to take a  fresh look  into the appellants  protection visa claim  and a  totally ignor ing  by the Tribunal of that claim  which was asserted on behalf of the appellants to be   true  and as involving what was alleged by the appellants to be a  political crisis within the BNP  and an absence of protection available to the appellants by what was described as the adult male appellant s  own party   In the result  his Honour found no substance or viability in relation to those complaints  However as will be seen from my ongoing summary of the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court below  it is necessary for me to set out in more detail his Honour s reasoned findings  given the width of scope of the issues addressed by his Honour  Nicholls FM ultimately addressed what became the critical discretionary issue as to delay by the appellants in their pursuit of their second Tribunal application  before proceeding to address the three issues broadly formulated as above by his Honour  and which I have outlined in the preceding paragraph  That issue of delay became ultimately the basis for dismissal of the appeal  which occurred at the culmination of his Honour s consideration of the various other issues raised in the Federal Magistrates Court below  The issue of delay was described by his Honour as  unexplained and inconsistent with the action of someone who claims to fear persecution and who claims to be aggrieved by a Tribunal decision which did not recognise these claims    His Honour referred to authority involving recognition of the element of discretion attending the exercise of the grant or refusal of prerogative relief in a migration law context  in particular in circumstances of unwarrantable delay  An exemplification of High Court authority on the subject of circumstances of unwarrantable delay identified by his Honour was Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   at   and    Gaudron and Gummow JJ   Reference was also made to what was observed subsequently by McHugh J in SAAP at   on the matter of delay  Returning therefore to the operation of s  A and related matters arising  Nicholls FM found in summary as follows      the context of any SAAP Al Shamry issue  the country information referred to by the Tribunal  the judiciary and politics and in the statutory context clearly fell within the exemption provided in s  A a  from the obligation contained in s  A   The Tribunal s finding on relocation was consistent with the relevant test  and open to it on the material before it      The reference above to Al Shamry was to the Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry   FCA         FCR   I have already of course made brief reference to SAAP  Nicholls FM next addressed another issue which has arisen with more attention on this appeal  which may be described as whether  even if the Tribunal had not fulfilled the requirements of s  A of the Migration Act in relation to any ground or set of reasons upon or by reference to which the decision of the Tribunal was made  there existed at least more unimpeachable grounds or sets of reasons on which the decision had been rightly based  The Tribunal was said by his Honour to have  clearly differentiated between at least the three sets of reasons that it gave for affirming the decision under review    Those three grounds or sets of reasons of the Tribunal  being the subject of subpars  c   d  and  e  of par   of the amended notice of appeal extracted in   above  and described by the Tribunal as  three good sets of reasons for concluding that the applicants have no real chance of persecution for a Convention reason if returned to Bangladesh    are appropriate to reproduce in sequence and to the extent of virtually their entire text below      because the claims made by the applicant on key issues have changed from time to time in significant ways  To prove this point it is enough to see the differences in the claims about the applicant s employment     place of residence     when he reported the claimed   March   attack    and whether there were arrest warrants issued for him  In addition  whichever version of his place of residence one believes  it is remarkable that in both versions he claims to have been at the one address for significant periods either side of the  June    election and thus was at that address at a time when he claims that he was attacked several times by the Awami League it is not credible that a person who is supposedly under serious sustained attack from his enemies would continue to reside at his long term address  which is no doubt why he modified the claim about residence when he initiated his second case  The differences mentioned and this point about the address lead me to conclude that the applicant has exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation he faced and faces in Bangladesh  I attach no significance to the documents he provided because he undercut the credibility of some of them himself and the country information on page   and my own experience of dozens of Bangladeshi cases alert me to the notorious unreliability of such documents      because the applicant s behaviour before and after his various lodgements of claims  relating to the   case and the   case  has not been consistent with that of a person with a genuine fear of persecution for a Convention reason  The only places which he mentioned in relation to his political activity and the threats to him are in Dhaka district and there is no reason to suppose that he was known or threatened outside Dhaka yet he apparently made no effort to relocate within Bangladesh to one of the   districts outside Dhaka  He did not leave Bangladesh until over two months after he obtained his Australian visa      When he left Bangladesh he left legally and by using a passport in his own name      His first application for a protection visa was made in July   four weeks after he arrived in June      He did not supply a set of Convention related claims until   months later  in May    His oral evidence at the RRT hearing in May   was unconvincing  see decision N   He did not bother to be represented at the Federal Court hearing of his appeal in September    He allowed a gap of   months between the final end of his first case  in January   and the initiation of his second case  July    His statutory declaration received by DIMIA in July   was simply a copy of his one submitted   months before     He did not respond to the July   letter from DIMIA      He has never provided the material which he promised in his September   RRT application      He did not bother to attend the   April   RRT hearing he had promised to attend      This catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to co operate leads me to conclude that the applicant was in no hurry to go anywhere or to do anything because there was no reason for him to be in a hurry because he had and has no fear of persecution      because even if his claims about what happened to him in   and before were true  they have been overtaken by events  He has been out of Bangladesh for six years and I see no reason to suppose that any political enemies he had then would continue to be interested in him  The party which he claims to support is now in government and the country information on pages   to   leads me to conclude that that confers advantages on its supporters in terms of benevolent treatment from the organs of the state  In terms of any legal action the applicant faces  I note that he has not been convicted of a crime or any offence      For reasons given elsewhere in this decision I do not believe that his claim that he faces any cases  false or otherwise  is credible but if he does face a case or cases then I conclude from the country information on the judiciary    that he would eventually secure justice  Moreover any cases resulting from the politically motivated animus of his supposed opponents during the previous Awami League administration would clearly be seen for what they are and be treated accordingly      are   districts in Bangladesh      The only district he has mentioned is Dhaka district  The fact that he kept living there for so long despite the supposed threat to him leads me to conclude that he did not fear persecution there because he has exaggerated or fabricated that threat          for any reason the applicant does not wish to live in Dhaka district  the country information    leads me to conclude that there are many other parts of the country in which it would be reasonable to expect him to be able to relocate  He has managed to support himself and his family in an unfamiliar country  Australia  for almost six years so I have no doubt of his ability to support himself and them in the country in which he was born  was educated  spent most of his life and still has family      the applicant wishes to pursue politics in Bangladesh in a manner which does not involve thuggery and criminality of the sort which characterises much of Bangladeshi politics  the material    leads me to conclude that he would be able to do so and have little to fear from rival political groups  especially if he pursued such activities outside of Dhaka district  It was in any event in the context of the appellants  case for contravention of s  A that the appellants drew attention to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at        Allsop J  where in the light of what was said in Aala and SAAP   his Honour observed as follows as to consequences flowing generally from a beach by the Minister of s  A      Section  A not having been complied with  the appellant is entitled to statutory writs under s  B  of the Judiciary Act   unless a legitimate reason to withhold such relief can be identified          subject to what follows  if s  A is not complied with  the Court does not engage in an enquiry as to whether the breach was so trivial as not to warrant relief  The failure to comply with the statutorily mandated provisions leads to the conclusion that there was a lack of statutory authority to make the decision  In the operation of s  A and the principles of procedural fairness  adherence to mandated process and procedure is vital    as a matter of discretion  relief will be withheld for reasons going to the conduct of the applicant as discussed in Aala and SAAP   No such considerations apply here    if it can be shown that there is a basis  otherwise unimpeached  upon which the decision was reached  unaffected by the failure to accord procedural fairness or to comply with the required statutory procedure  relief can be withheld              What the majority in SAAP stated was that one did not engage in an evaluative analysis of the triviality or seriousness of the failure to observe the statutory requirements  The same was said by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Aala  However  Aala and SAAP leave open    the basis to refuse relief if it can be shown that grant of relief would lack utility  The examples given    in Aala     were           a  where the decision maker was bound by the governing statute       b  where the submissions could only have been answered  as a matter of law  against the person denied the opportunity of making them  and      c  if the decision under review has no legal effect      If it can be shown that there was a basis for the Tribunal s decision which can be seen to be entirely independent of the failure to follow s  A  in my view  that is sufficiently analogous to the first of the alternatives referred to in   Aala to warrant withholding of relief          The federal magistrate concluded that the Tribunal found that  even if the claims made by the applicant were true he was not a refugee   Unlike the federal magistrate  I am unable to discern such a clear basis upon which the failure to follow s  A had no possible effect  The influence of credit appears to me to pervade the whole of the reasons of the Tribunal  The failure to comply with s  A has not been shown to be entirely separate from an unimpeached basis for the decision    The further issues remain therefore  first as to whether in all the circumstances  the Tribunal did contravene s  A in the light of what was held at   of SZEEU above as to  a basis for the Tribunal s decision which  is     entirely independent of the failure to follow s  A  and in any event  whether any discretionary factor  being delay in particular  should so operate as to deny relief to the appellants  As to the existence of any contravention of s  A  there remains of course the issue of an absence or otherwise of operation of subsection   thereof in any of the circumstances excepted by the terms of subsection   thereof relating to      information    not about the applicant    and    just about a class of persons of which the applicant    is a member    or   information    that the

the case made the withholding of  relief  the proper course  given that  t he writ issues as of right unless it is unjust to withhold it  the appellants citing in that regard R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Ozone Theatres  Aust  Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and Aala at     and   per Gaudron and Gummow JJ  In cases of unwarrantable delay  so the appellants  submissions on the subject of delay proceeded  the exercise the Court was required to undertake included  weighing the primary consideration of ensuring the legality of government action against the secondary consideration of the finality of litigation  the appellants further citing respectively Aala at    Gaudron and Gummow JJ   That scope of finding by Nicholls J referrable to delay was however in my opinion clearly open to his Honour to find  at least in the circumstances to which his Honour referred  I am unable to accept that his Honour did not pay regard to considerations that were appropriate to the circumstances of the case referred toVFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlA second ground for review raised below by the appellants in their notice of appeal was that of actual bias or apprehension of bias  in the making of the purported decision   The notice of appeal raised a purported natural justice issue based on actual bias or apprehension of bias  Nicholls FM cited a number authorities of the Federal Court and the High Court upon that subject  and concluded on that issue adversely to the appellants  as follows      can see no basis for review of the Tribunal s decision on the basis of actual or apprehended bias  The  appellants  have brought no evidence whatsoever to ground a complaint that the Tribunal did not bring an open mind to the assessment of the claims  It is rarely the case that bias can be made out with reference to the decision record alone  and no further evidence has been provided by the applicant in this respect          In that context his Honour made reference to VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   as an exemplification of those principles  where Kenny J found that a case of apprehended bias had been established adversely to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  but which authority was said to exemplify the difficulty of establishing bias  I am unable to discern any viable footing for the appellants  case on bias  or reasonable apprehension of bias  to the extent that the same was ultimately pursued  if at all  on the present appeal  which was not entirely clear  As his Honour emphasised in any event  the doctrine of actual bias in the form of prejudgment seemingly invoked by the appellants required evidence of any such prejudgment by the decision maker  to the extent that he or she is alleged to have been   so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration  whatever evidence or argument may be presented  his Honour citing thereby Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng   HCA

www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlFor the reasons which I have thus far outlined  Nicholls FM observed that he had been unable to distil any indication of a denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Tribunal below  notwithstanding the case foreshadowed to the Federal Magistrates Court to that effect  His Honour additionally observed on that subject that the Tribunal  in its later letter of   March   had put the first appellant on notice that if he did not attend the Tribunal hearing  the consequences might be that the Tribunal would  make a decision on your case without further notice   see in that regard what appears in the first paragraph of the Tribunal s reasons for decision of   April   under the heading  Finding and Reasons     So much was described by his Honour as an indication by the Tribunal that any rejection of the invitation would lead to the kind of   inevitable consequence   spoken of by the Full Federal Court in NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at    French  Emmett and Dowsett JJ   However as Nicholls FM recorded  there was no attendance by or on behalf of any one or more of the present appellants  being a non attendance which was unexplained  with the consequence of the Tribunal being      authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant s absence    his Honour citing   inter alia   VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at    Sundberg and Hely JJ  and referring to s  A of the Migration Act   Nicholls FM acknowledged that country information issues raised at the instance of the Minister which gave rise to a breach of common law procedural fairness may in particular occur      where the information is critical to the Tribunal decision  and the applicant is not on notice of the issues raised by the information    and in those situations  the applicant for relief  clearly should not be caught unawares or be in the dark about the case against him    It was pointed out by his Honour however that  i  n the case before me and in relation to the use of country information in the context of fairness the applicant was given the opportunity to attend a hearing before the Tribunal  and accordingly  i  n circumstances where the Tribunal had put the applicant on notice that on what was before it  it could not make a decision in his favour     then   i  n the context of the common law principles of procedural fairness the applicant cannot now complain when he chose not to take up that opportunity    Nicholls FM referred in that context to the following passage in the reasons for judgment in NAVX at       assessing the adequacy of these reasons  it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information  Clearly enough  the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China  Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution  it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate  When he failed to accept that opportunity  the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application  referred toVNAA v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlFor the reasons which I have thus far outlined  Nicholls FM observed that he had been unable to distil any indication of a denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Tribunal below  notwithstanding the case foreshadowed to the Federal Magistrates Court to that effect  His Honour additionally observed on that subject that the Tribunal  in its later letter of   March   had put the first appellant on notice

Affairs     ALD  A further element of the case for denial of natural justice advanced by the appellants against the Minister in the Federal Magistrates Court below related to the use made beforehand by the Tribunal of the country information upon which it purportedly relied relevantly to its decision making  The complaints made in that regard  as Nicholls FM recorded in the course of his reasons for decision  were that the Tribunal did not give to the appellants the country information on which it relied  and further that the Tribunal did not extend to the appellants an opportunity to evaluate or make submissions otherwise concerning the use of that information  By reason of those omissions of the Tribunal complained of  the appellants asserted denial of natural justice  His Honour observed that the appellants  application for review of the Tribunal decision predated the enactment of s  B of the Migration Act headed  Exhaustive statement of natural justice hearing rule    with the consequence that  t he common law rules of procedural fairness are not excluded from applying in the case before me    Nevertheless as his Honour proceeded to record       there is no general proposition that the failure to put adverse country information to an applicant  on its own  amounts to a breach of natural justice    citing thereby the Full Federal Court s decision in VHAP of   v

procedural fairness  the documentary material relied upon by the Tribunal  being  CX  described as  US State Department publication  Bangladesh  profile of asylum claims and country conditions  bureau of democracy  human rights and labor  February   was  exactly the same document   as was placed  before the delegate    and accordingly the appellants  would therefore have already known about the existence of this document   given that  they  make reference to the file of the Department    in the application for review to the Tribunal  and  the appellants  were notified of the delegate s decision by letter attaching the same    that document was amongst those listed in Part B to the delegate s decision of   August          ii  as to the Tribunal s compilation of reasons relating to the appellants  behaviour in Bangladesh  that behaviour was inconsistent with persons having a genuine fear of persecution in Bangladesh contexts  in any event as I have elsewhere discussed  the first appellant made claims appertaining only to experience in the Dhaka district  having made no effort to relocate to any of the other   districts in Bangladesh beyond Dhaka  and         iii  the Tribunal found generally that the first appellant s conduct in pursuing his claims reflected a  catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to co operate    which led to the conclusion in his Honour s view that he had no fear of persecution  being a finding that his Honour considered to have been open to the Tribunal to conclude on the material placed before it  and for which conclusion the Tribunal had in any event given reasons  so much has been elsewhere referred to in these submissions upon the critical issue as to delay  Nicholls FM observed that the Tribunal had assumed      the first appellant s claims as to what happened to him up to   in Bangladesh were  still  true    However the Tribunal had found  by reference to the independent information in evidence available at the time of decision making compiled some six years after the appellants had left Bangladesh   that the circumstance  in Bangladesh  had changed to the extent that the party  of  which  the first appellant  claim  s  to be a supporter was now in government   Moreover his Honour considered that after taking into consideration the up dated country information  the Tribunal concluded that the legal system in Bangladesh had evolved to the stage that       the appellants  could eventually secure justice in circumstances where  their complaints  may be true    so much being a further finding described by his Honour as open to the Tribunal to reach on the evidence before it referred toRandhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR  Further findings of the Tribunal recorded and relied upon by Nicholls FM below included the following  to which I have already made partial reference but repeat for completeness     the appellants could safely and reasonably relocate out of their home district  the Dhaka district  in Bangladesh to one of the other   districts in Bangladesh      the Tribunal was clearly conscious of the relevant test to be applied in considering the issue of relocation  namely that the Tribunal should not merely address whether an applicant could relocate to another area but whether the applicants could reasonably be expected to do so   Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at   per Black CJ     the Tribunal did look specifically at the relevant country information about population size and dispersal in Bangladesh  the dispersal and spread of relevant political parties  issues relating to politics and violence in Bangladesh  and the judiciary and police and the role they played in Bangladeshi affairs  and also the appellant husband  father s ability to  support himself and his family in an unfamiliar country  Australia  for almost six years  and found that it had  no doubt  that the appellant husband had the ability  to support himself  and his family  in the country in which he was born  and educated  spent most of his life  and still had family   Upon the footing of each of those  three good sets of reasons  so called by the Tribunal  the Tribunal made supplementary observations to be read in conjunction therewith  including reference to Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at     for the proposition  which I have already foreshadowed  that protection is not available in the case of a well founded fear in an applicant s home region where that applicant can  nevertheless avail  himself or herself  of the real protection of  his or her  country of nationality elsewhere within that country    The Court added the qualification that the applicant must also be able to  genuinely access domestic protection    and relocation needs to be a reasonable option in the particular circumstances  see in that regard Beaumont J at      The Tribunal member concluded his reasons for decision as follows      the above reasons  I conclude that the applicant does not face Convention related persecution in Bangladesh because there is nothing credible in his claims to indicate that he has a profile which would lead to him being wanted by the Awami League or the authorities or anyone else outside of Dhaka let alone in Dhaka      inadequacies and inconsistencies of the applicant s claims and of his behaviour in pursuit of his claims lead me to conclude that the applicant did not and does not have a genuine fear of persecution  The reasons set out above lead me to conclude that he has no well founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention  Accordingly  I am satisfied that he is not a refugee  It was partly in the context of the formulation of those  three sets of reasons  of the Tribunal of a fundamentally factual or circumstantial character  and of his Honour s consideration of the implications thereof  that Nicholls FM concluded his reasons for judgment below by reference to what he described as the critical issue arising on the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court  explained as follows      critical issue therefore  even if the Tribunal breached the requirements of s  A  as understood in the context of SAAP in relation to one ground  sets of reasons  upon which the decision was made  is whether there is one or more other grounds on which the decision was based  which cannot  or are not  impeached  That is  was there another separate basis  or bases  upon which the decisions may be supported  The Tribunal itself by the very language that it used clearly differentiated between at least three sets of reasons that it gave for affirming the decision under review  Bearing in mind the relevant authorities even if there is some difficulty in the Tribunal s first set of stated reasons  the first part of the first set  the second and third reasons  independently and separately from each other  and then the Tribunal s separate and independent finding in relation to relocation are each not in my view affected by jurisdictional error and can independently support the Tribunal s ultimate conclusion that the applicant did not satisfy the relevant criteria for a protection visa  Had I not dismissed on the basis of unwarrantable delay  I would have dismissed on this basis in any event      I have earlier of course made reference to that delay attributed by the Federal Magistrate to the appellants  It is of assistance  in the context of the complexity and detail of the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal and of Nicholls FM below  to read the conclusions of his Honour upon the four principal issues identified by his Honour in association with his summary of the Tribunal s findings appearing in   of his reasons for judgment below  Those issues may be described  as has been foreshadowed  first as to exaggerations and fabrications of the adult male appellant in respect of his political activism  secondly as to behaviour inconsistent with his having any genuine fear of persecution  thirdly as to recent independent country information  and fourthly as to the implications of the country information concerning safety of relocation in Bangladesh available to the appellants  Such four themes are not to be read in any mutually exclusive way  as is apparent from the text of the so called three sets of reasons of the Tribunal   ante    The material presented in writing by the appellants at the hearing of the appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court consisted of an amended notice of appeal and written submissions  which were provided by the appellants only several days prior to the hearing of the appeal  It is appropriate that I reproduce the text or substance  as the case may be  of the appellants  written submissions  and address such oral submissions of additional significance  as ultimately pursued by the appellants  The issues raised by the appellants in the amended notice of appeal were framed mainly in relation to their contentions as to the operation of s  A of the Migration Act in circumstances postulated by the respective parties  and did not explicitly address the critical issue of unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants  which latter issue was however the subject of oral submissions  The Minister submitted that the appeal could be dismissed on the basis that the issue of unwarrantable delay was not touched upon in the notice of appeal or the amended notice of appeal appliedcitedVAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR  Much has been written about the scope and purpose of operation of s  A   but in my opinion two aspects thereof may be conveniently emphasised  each being highlighted in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at       the Tribunal must possess  the   information        the Tribunal must consider that that information  would be the reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review  Moreover when it becomes necessary or appropriate for the Tribunal to make findings and formulate conclusions cumulatively  though in stages  and being unavoidable in situations involving some measure of complexity of evidentiary material  such as here exemplified in relation to the three so called  sets of reasons  of the Tribunal  and reproduced already in these reasons at   above  it is of practical assistance to an implementation of the s  A a  process  to bear in mind the following further observations appearing in the joint reasons for judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF at   and   respectively      It commonly is the case that the detail and complexity of the case advanced by a visa applicant  and the information that is given and garnered for the purposes of considering it  results in the Tribunal being confronted with issues that may be of varying importance  relevance and centrality both to the decision to be taken and to the reasoning that in the event sustains that decision  While the reasoning process may advert to  and express views on  such issues  all will not necessarily constitute part of the reason for the Tribunal s decision  Tribunals  no less than courts  engage in their own species of dicta often enough for reasons related to haste and pressure in composition  When a Tribunal s reasons are to be evaluated for s  A  purposes  the Court as a matter of judgment is required to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunal s decision  That task  necessarily  is an interpretative one  In some instances the differentiation of the integral and the inessential may be by no means easy and made the more so by less than explicit indications in the reasons themselves as to what the tribunal itself considered to be integral       Considered in the context of the Tribunal s reasoning process and having regard to the aggregate of findings made that rejected both that the appellant had been persecuted for a Convention reason and that his situation was such as to give rise to a well founded fear of persecution  reference to the information as to his behaviour in Australia can only be categorised as being relatively minor and unimportant in the scheme of things  It was not so integral to the reasoning process rejecting the appellant s claim as to require as a matter of fairness that the appellant be told that information  cf s  A a  and why it was relevant to the review  cf s  A b    It was stated widely by the appellants at the threshold of their written submissions that Nicholls FM found that the so called first set of reasons appearing in the Tribunal s decision  was affected by a breach of s  A of the  Migration Act     as a consequence of the tribunal using information given by the first appellant  husband father  in his protection visa application as a part of its reasons for affirming the decision of the delegate   That first set of reasons addressed the implications of what the Tribunal described as the claims made by the applicant on key issues having  changed from time to time in significant ways  by reason of the circumstances thereby exemplified   His Honour summarised those circumstances attending the first set of reasons as comprising or involving differences  or inconsistencies  found between details that the first appellant had put to the delegate and the account given to the Tribunal which led the Tribunal to conclude that the first appellant had exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation of harm that he faced in Bangladesh  Nicholls FM observed that the Tribunal relied on the inconsistencies in the appellants  claim in its reasons for decision rather than the information contained in the visa application and that  in the alternative that even if  the first set of reasons  of the Tribunal s decision did not contain jurisdictional error  it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegate s decision  because of other independent reasons given for affirming the delegate s decision    The submissions of the appellants by way of response to the so called second and third sets of reasons commenced to the effect that  i n considering whether to grant relief  the Federal Magistrate found the other two sets of reasons for affirming the decision were not affected by the breach  of s  A    and were said to have provided  an alternative basis upon which the decision could be made   The applicants referring thereby apparently to the Tribunal s decision that the first appellant could  secure justice in circumstances where  he faced  false charges  in Bangladesh  and to the Tribunal s finding as to the appellants  absence of effort to relocate outside the Dhaka district of Bangladesh to elsewhere in  one of the   districts  of that country   His Honour summarised the circumstances attending the so called second set of reasons as being  based on  the first appellant s  behaviour both before and after the lodgement of claims in   and   and on the  Tribunal s finding that his actions were not consistent with a genuine fear of persecution for Convention reasons   His Honour observed that the Tribunal characterised  these actions     on the part of the appellants  as a repeated failure to provide documents and claims as promised   unconvincing oral evidence  and a  catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to co operate   referring thereby to page   of the Tribunal s reasons   His Honour summarised those circumstances attending the so called third set of reasons as being  based on the Tribunal finding that even if the  first appellant s  claims about what happened to him in   and previously  were true  that the events and situations giving rise to those claims have been overtaken by more recent events   and that   i  n particular the Tribunal relied on independent country information which showed that the party which the  first appellant  claimed to support was at the time of the Tribunal s consideration in government  and further that the independent information led it to conclude that this conferred an advantage on its supporters in terms of the level of treatment from the organs of the State   That summary of his Honour continued further that  the Tribunal found that    it did not believe the  first appellant s  claim that he faced  false cases  as being credible  but even in the event that he did face some charges  then the Tribunal concluded from the country information available to it    that he would eventually secure justice  referring thereby to pages   and   of the Tribunal s reasons   Lastly his Honour summarised the circumstances further attending the Tribunal s reasons generally that the Tribunal      also looked at the issue of relocation and whether protection was available in another part of Bangladesh  and  found that as the  first appellant  had only referred in his claims to one  Dhaka  of the   districts in Bangladesh  and  based on independent country information available to it  pages   and   of the Tribunal s reasons appearing under the heading  Country information  the  first appellant  would be able to safely relocate to another part of Bangladesh and that it would be reasonable to expect him to so relocate  pages   and   of the Tribunal s reasons   I should interpolate to point out the compelling force of that location observation referred toSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIt was in any event in the context of the appellants  case for contravention of s  A that the appellants drew attention to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at        Allsop J  where in the light of what was said in Aala and SAAP   his Honour observed as follows as to consequences flowing generally from a beach by the Minister of s  A      Section  A not having been complied with  the appellant is entitled to statutory writs under s  B  of the Judiciary Act   unless a legitimate reason to withhold such relief can be identified          subject to what follows  if s  A is not complied with  the Court does not engage in an enquiry as to whether the breach was so trivial as not to warrant relief  The failure to comply with the statutorily mandated provisions leads to the conclusion that there was a lack of statutory authority to make the decision  In the operation of s  A and the principles of procedural fairness  adherence to mandated process and procedure is vital    as a matter of discretion  relief will be withheld for reasons going to the conduct of the applicant as discussed in Aala and SAAP   No such considerations apply here    if it can be shown that there is a basis  otherwise unimpeached  upon which the decision was reached  unaffected by the failure to accord procedural fairness or to comply with the required statutory procedure  relief can be withheld              What the majority in SAAP stated was that one did not engage in an evaluative analysis of the triviality or seriousness of the failure to observe the statutory requirements  The same was said by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Aala  However  Aala and SAAP leave open    the basis to refuse relief if it can be shown that grant of relief would lack utility  The examples given    in Aala     were           a  where the decision maker was bound by the governing statute       b  where the submissions could only have been answered  as a matter of law  against the person denied the opportunity of making them  and      c  if the decision under review has no legal effect      If it can be shown that there was a basis for the Tribunal s decision which can be seen to be entirely independent of the failure to follow s  A  in my view  that is sufficiently analogous to the first of the alternatives referred to in   Aala to warrant withholding of relief          The federal magistrate concluded that the Tribunal found that  even if the claims made by the applicant were true he was not a refugee   Unlike the federal magistrate  I am unable to discern such a clear basis upon which the failure to follow s  A had no possible effect  The influence of credit appears to me to pervade the whole of the reasons of the Tribunal  The failure to comply with s  A has not been shown to be entirely separate from an unimpeached basis for the decision    The further issues remain therefore  first as to whether in all the circumstances  the Tribunal did contravene s  A in the light of what was held at   of SZEEU above as to  a basis for the Tribunal s decision which  is     entirely independent of the failure to follow s  A  and in any event  whether any discretionary factor  being delay in particular  should so operate as to deny relief to the appellants  As to the existence of any contravention of s  A  there remains of course the issue of an absence or otherwise of operation of subsection   thereof in any of the circumstances excepted by the terms of subsection   thereof relating to      information    not about the applicant    and    just about a class of persons of which the applicant    is a member    or   information    that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application      As to the existence of any such basis for the Tribunal s decision which was entirely independent of a failure to follow s  A   see again   of SZEEU extracted above  the Minister referred to a number of Federal Court authorities exemplifying denial of relief in circumstances constituting an independent basis for a decision unaffected by breach of s  A  including VEAJ of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR    see in particular     per Gray J   Upon that footing  the Minister pointed out that Nicholls FM had concluded that not only the relocation findings  but also the remaining aspects of the Tribunal s so called  three good sets of reasons    which I have reproduced earlier at   of my reasons   were unaffected by any breach of s  A that existed in relation to the first of those separate and independent bases   The appellants submitted in any event that  on the basis of the following principles  an examination of the sets of reasons shows that all three sets of reasons forming the parts of the reasons for affirming the decision of the Tribunal are affected by  a  breach of s  A  the appellants thereby referring to the reasons I have reproduced at length in   above  It was asserted by the appellants that  i nformation given to the Minister s Department  and  obtained by the Tribunal from the Department and not from  the appellants  is not subject to s  A b  and I was referred in that regard to the Full Court s reasons for judgment in Al Shamry at     per Ryan J and myself jointly  and at     per Merkel J  I reproduce below   of the reasons in Al Shamry for ease of reference      Counsel for the Minister accepted that a failure to observe the procedure laid down by s  A is a reviewable error under s  a   It was also accepted that where there is information of the kind described in s  A a  particulars of that information must be given to the applicant for the purpose of obtaining his or her comments  However  it was said that the information constituted by the airport interview came within the exception created by s  A b  in respect of information given by the applicant for the purpose of the application   Application  in that context  was said to mean  all information given by the applicant to officials in the Department  including that provided to the Tribunal  for the purpose of determining whether to grant a protection visa to the applicant   We disagree  In our view   applicant  wherever appearing in s  A means  applicant for review by the Tribunal of a Ministerial decision  and  application  correspondingly means the proceeding before the Tribunal which is the vehicle for such a claim for review  It was then submitted by the appellants that  s uch information that the tribunal uses to make an adverse appraisal of the applicant s case requires disclosure if the appraisal is a part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate   My reservation with that submission concerns the interpolation of the expression  appraisal  in the context of the wording of s  A a    In any event in that context  the appellants cited SZEEU at   and   per Moore J  at     per Weinberg J  and at     per Allsop J for the proposition that  a subsidiary and minor part only  of the reasons will suffice  It suffices for me to point in particular to the dictum of Weinberg J  at   to the effect that the  information  in question  played a part    and to Moore J s reasons where his Honour used less definitive descriptions  at      The appellants asserted further that the conclusion that  all three sets of reasons for the decision are affected by a breach of s  A is readily determinable because the tribunal has clearly indicated in its reasons where and when it has obtained the information from the protection visa   The appellants  submissions continued that  t he tribunal made no disclosure of this adverse information and in accordance with the following principles as such the whole of the decision is affected by a breach of s  A   As I have earlier foreshadowed  the appellants argued that the Tribunal s so called first set of reasons constituted a breach of s  A because the Tribunal used information given by the first appellant in his protection visa application as part of its reasons for affirming the decision of the Minister s delegate  In the course of oral submissions  counsel for the appellants pointed to the Tribunal s reliance on information regarding the first appellant s employment history  place of residence and previous arrest warrants  all being information gleaned from the first appellant s application for a protection visa  and which was purportedly used by the Tribunal in the formulation of its first set of reasons without the appellants being given prior particulars of that information  as stipulated by s  A   That reliance of the Tribunal was undertaken in order to demonstrate differences or inconsistencies between information that the appellants had provided to the delegate of the Minister and the information subsequently given to the Tribunal  being discrepancies that consequently formed the basis of the Tribunal s finding that the first appellant had   exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation of harm that he faced in Bangladesh    In support of the contention that information given to the Minister s Department that is obtained by the Tribunal from the Department  and not from an applicant for refugee status  is not subject to the exception contained in s  A b  and therefore falls within s  A  the appellants pointed to Merkel J s following observations at     in Al Shamry       An applicant for a protection visa will have provided information relevant to the outcome of the application prior to applying for the review of a delegate s decision     f urther  the information given may be supplemented by information provided subsequently to the Department or to the delegate of the Minister  An applicant may have no record of the information provided  but  more importantly  may not be aware of its significance to the review ultimately to be conducted by the RRT  It is therefore understandable that the legislature would require that  in fairness  any adverse information provided prior to review  the significance  his Honour s emphasis  of which the applicant may be unaware  be disclosed to the applicant to enable him or her to respond to it          For the above reasons the construction of the primary judge and I regard as correct gives effect to the beneficial purpose of s  A of affording an applicant with the opportunity to respond to the gravamen or substance of any adverse information upon which the RRT proposes to act  the significance of which the applicant may be unaware  It is consistent with that purpose to take a narrow  rather than a broad  view of the exceptions in s  A     Given those observations of his Honour not being explicitly or implicitly inconsistent with the reasoning of the majority  which I will assume for the purpose of the argument  those observations underline the need for the appellant to be given particulars of any adverse information submitted prior to the application for review and on which the Tribunal proposes to rely  Further to the foregoing contention of the appellants  it was next said on their behalf that SZEEU provides authority for the proposition that s  A will be engaged in situations where the Tribunal finds as relevant to its reasoning some inconsistency or incompatibility between earlier information provided by an applicant and evidence provided thereafter by that applicant  Weinberg J observed at   of SZEEU as follows      appellant s credibility was of critical importance to his claim  Any  information  that the Tribunal considered as casting serious doubt upon his credibility  whether referred to in the early stages of its reasons  or as fortifying its earlier conclusions  seems to me likely to have played  a part  in the decision  For that reason  the Tribunal s failure to provide the appellant with notice  in writing  of its intention to rely upon that  information  gave rise to a breach of s  A  and in accordance with SAAP   to jurisdictional error      By the expression  intention to rely  I assume that his Honour thereby referred to reliance in decision making  Moreover Allsop J said at   as follows          the Tribunal finds as relevant to its reasoning some inconsistency or incompatibility between earlier information and evidence to it as relevant to its reasoning that may well engage s  A if such inconsistency or incompatibility can be seen to have been a part of the reason for affirming the decision      It should be here recorded that the Minister s submissions conceded that  i n the light of SZEEU    Nicholls FM  may have erred in the first part of   where he seems to accept a distinction between relying upon inconsistencies to reach a conclusion rather than the underlying information   However Nicholls FM went on to observe  at   germane to the issues here arising for resolution  as follows          I am also persuaded    in the alternative that even if this part of the Tribunal s decision did contain jurisdictional error  it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegate s decision    For the reasons set out below  the Tribunal s decision can be upheld on the basis of other independent sets of reasons given by the Tribunal  and that any such error  if it does exist in this first set of the Tribunal s reasons  cannot be a basis for setting aside the Tribunal s decision      His Honour referred in that regard to VEAJ   ante    Counsel for the appellants in oral submissions further contended that the second and third sets of reasons  see again   above  were also affected by a breach of s  A because they similarly relied upon information obtained from the appellants  protection visa application  The Tribunal s statement that the appellant   did not leave Bangladesh until over two months after he obtained his Australian visa  was asserted by the appellant to be one of the observations within the Tribunal s second set of reasons that was based on information contained in the protection visa application and which was said by the appellants to have involved a breach of s  A  The appellants  further contended that such a finding amounted to  a part  of the reason of the Tribunal   SZEEU at   per Weinberg J and at   per Allsop J being relied upon to support their argument that  a minor and subsidiary part  of the reasons is all that is needed for a breach of s  A to arise  There is some force in that submission by the appellant  The breach of s  A that was said by the appellants to arise out of the Tribunal s third set of reasons for decision  see again   above  was related to the first appellant s claim that he would face legal action if he returned to Bangladesh  In rejecting that claim  the Tribunal member observed that  i  n terms of any legal action the applicant faces  I note that he has not been convicted of a crime or any offence    The appellants submitted that the Tribunal relied on information contained in the first appellant s protection visa application that indicated he had not been convicted of any crimes  and that such a finding formed  part of the  Tribunal s  reason  because it goes to an integer of the claim and  is  information which requires disclosure under section  A      The Minister contended that while the information regarding the first appellant s previous criminal convictions is  on the face of it   something which the applicant said to DIMIA  the subsequent statement made by the Tribunal suggested that independent country information formed the basis of the reasoning used to dispel the appellants  claim regarding possible future criminal prosecution  The Tribunal stated in that regard as follows      reasons given elsewhere in this decision I do not believe that his claim that he faces any cases  false or otherwise  is credible but if he does face a case or cases then I conclude from the country information on the judiciary on page   that he would eventually secure justice      The Minister submitted that  because of that word   but      and reading that paragraph in context  the Tribunal is saying  well  on the one hand I note that he has not been convicted of any crime or offence  but then saying even if he had been  then because of the independent  country  information on the judiciary no harm is going to come to him   There is force in that submission of the Minister  and upon reading that paragraph as a whole  it would appear that the Tribunal s reasoning was indeed based on independent country information  rather than the first appellant s application visa  The Tribunal s findings in relation to relocation contained in the final or third of the three sets of reasons were in any event not visited with jurisdictional error  since they were based on country information that fell within the exception to disclosure contained in s  A b   On the footing of the appellants  case that all three of the Tribunal s so called  three good sets of reasons  were to no avail because of the Minister s contravention s  of s  A of the Migration Act   the appellants asserted that      the determinative issue on appeal is whether there was unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants disentitling them from the grant of relief   I would interpolate the description  ultimate  for  determination  for what that may matter  I have already summarised the evidentiary material bearing upon that issue of delay  The appellants seemingly acknowledged that Nicholls FM  found the delay unwarrantable because it was for a period of   months between notification of the decision of the tribunal and the application for review  and further that his Honour found that  no explanation for the delay was given despite being sought  and moreover that the appellants  were not unfamiliar with the application process  and their delay      was inconsistent with the action of someone who fears persecution and claims to  be  aggrieved by the Tribunal   So much may be in any event inferred from the evidence placed before his Honour  The rejoinder of the appellants to those findings of the Tribunal was  somewhat confusingly  that Nicholls FM      miscarried in his discretion to not grant the relief sought  because  r ather than ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified withholding the relief in the event that  the  appellants established that the tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error  the Federal Magistrate proceeded on the basis that the appellants were required to satisfy the Court that the discretion should be exercised in  their  favour having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded   months   The reality apparent from the objective circumstances was that the appellants had no viable answer to the Minister s case on delay  Independently of the factor of delay  I am in any event of the opinion  for reasons appearing cumulatively in the course of my consideration and appraisal already of the s  A issues extensively raised by the appellants and debated seriatim by the respective parties  being the issues I have already discussed at some length  that the appellants have not established that all three of the Tribunal s independent grounds for dismissing the appellants  visa applications  as articulated in the Tribunal s  three good sets of reasons  breach s  A of the Migration Act   Reference should again be made in that regard to SZEEU at   where Allsop J observed that where there can be shown an independent basis   otherwise unimpeached  upon which the decision was reached    relief can be withheld   The existence of the unimpeached third set of reasons of the Tribunal s reasons for judgment thus operates as a basis upon which relief can be withheld  regardless of any finding of unwarrantable delay  In the present litigation  the task of the second Tribunal in establishing and assigning significance to the extensive array of circumstances placed before it was a formidable one  as the three grounds or sets of reasons of the Tribunal below  extracted in   above  have duly exemplified  No sufficient or adequate basis for any successful appeal from the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court have been established by the appellants  for the reasons apparent from my analysis of the issues arising and circumstances prevailing  and which I have addressed in the two preceding segments of these reasons  Because of the number and extent of the issues raised by the appellants on this appeal  and which I have resolved in favour of the Minister  it is unnecessary to repeat the same in the context of these conclusions  The appeal must be dismissed  and the

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlReliance was placed by the appellants upon what was said by Sackville J in SZHJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     where his Honour held at   and   as follows  so far as is material         It seems to me that the Magistrate proceeded on an erroneous assumption  namely  that the appellant had to persuade the Court to exercise a discretion in his favour before it could consider whether the RRT had indeed committed a jurisdictional error  The correct position was that the Magistrate had a discretion to withhold relief on various grounds  including unjustified delay  even if the appellant established that the RRT s decision was affected by a jurisdictional error      The difficulty with the approach of the Magistrate is that he did not ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified the withholding of relief in the event that the appellant established that the RRT had committed a jurisdictional error  Rather  the cases upon which he relied suggest that he required the appellant to satisfy the Court that discretion should be exercised in his favour  having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded one year          On any view  the appellant was guilty of long delay and no satisfactory excuse was or could be proffered for that delay  But the question asked by the Magistrate  in my view  was not the correct one and this led to his miscarrying of this issue    In my opinion and contrary to the thrust of the appellants  submissions  Nicholls FM did enquire as to whether the circumstance of the delay justified the withholding of the relief in the event that the appellants established that the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error  and hence his Honour did meet the substance of the test as articulated by Sackville J above  Nicholls FM invited the appellants to comment on why their application was delayed  an invitation that ultimately led the first appellant to respond  I have nothing to say regarding this matter   His Honour proceeded thereafter to explore the issue of jurisdictional error  Incidentally I do not understand Nicholls FM to have relied merely on the fact of   months per se  but rather upon the circumstances which he had otherwise comprehensively reviewed in his reasons for judgment contextually to that delay referred toR v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Ozone Theatres  Aust  Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe appellants contended next that what his Honour was primarily required to consider was whether  the circumstances of the case made the withholding of  relief  the proper course  given that  t he writ issues as of right unless it is unjust to withhold it  the appellants citing in that regard R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Ozone Theatres  Aust  Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and Aala at     and   per Gaudron and Gummow JJ  In cases of unwarrantable delay  so the appellants  submissions on the subject of delay proceeded  the exercise the Court was required to undertake included  weighing the primary consideration of ensuring the legality of government action against the secondary consideration of the finality of litigation  the appellants further citing respectively Aala at    Gaudron and Gummow JJ   That scope of finding by Nicholls J referrable to delay was however in my opinion clearly open to his Honour to find  at least in the circumstances to which his Honour referred  I am unable to accept that his Honour did not pay regard to considerations that were appropriate to the circumstances of the case referred toRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Miah   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFurther as to any issue concerning the grant or withholding of relief in the exercise of discretion  the appellants submitted that the onus rests on the Minister to persuade the court not to grant the relief sought by the appellants  assuming of course the existence of any such entitlement to relief  the appellants referring thereby to relief in their favour that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed  and that the Tribunal thereafter proceed to review the Minister s refusal of the protection visa according to law  The appellants cited in that context Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Miah   HCA         CLR   at   per Kirby J  where the majority decision of the High Court inclusive of his Honour was to the effect that the Minister s delegate had failed to accord natural justice to an applicant for migration relief  The appellants  submissions continued that  w hilst the Federal Magistrate did seek an explanation from the appellant  his approach was erroneous  and  did not demonstrate an onus on the  Minister   and  further the answers of the appellant s  made reference to some fault in an authority yet given his lack of advice on the point it is not clear under what apprehension as to the purpose of the questioning the appellant was under   The appellants  submissions continued further to the effect that  a  broad common sense approach is appropriate when the conduct of a party seeking review is impugned for the purpose of establishing that there are discretionary reasons why the relief should not be granted  and further that  t he applicant is entitled to take advantage of particular circumstances as they appear to him at the time without losing the right to have an unlawful decision set aside  the appellants citing inter alia thereby Peko Wallsend Ltd v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs     FCR   at   per Sheppard J  The appellants yet further contended that  the weight that can be placed upon the explanation is diminishable and affects the required confidence of the Court in refusing relief   To the extent that those submissions were not somewhat tautological or at least confusing  I am unable to distil any force therein  and have only recorded the submissions by way of deference to counsel citedPeko Wallsend Ltd v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs     FCR  Further as to any issue concerning the grant or withholding of relief in the exercise of discretion  the appellants submitted that the onus rests on the Minister to persuade the court not to grant the relief sought by the appellants  assuming of course the existence of any such

discussedSZGZW v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlCounsel for the appellant advanced the yet further submission that the manner in which the Federal Magistrate  obtained the explanation for the delay  from the appellant  was not judicial because he took the information from the bar table   It was submitted in that regard that by obtaining the husband father s explanation for the relevant delay in that manner  the Federal Magistrate was putting himself  in the position of an advocate or an inquisitor and   that  that  process  was  not sufficiently judicial      In support of that submission  reliance was placed on what appears from the unreported reasons for judgment of Jacobson J in SZGZW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     where at   his Honour observed  in relation to a delay of eight years from   to   in applying for review of an adverse Tribunal decision  as follows      It follows from what I have said  that the discretion to refuse relief miscarried within the well known principle stated in House v R   HCA         CLR   at      It was not open to the learned Federal Magistrate to find that the appellant s delay was lengthy or unsatisfactory upon the basis of untested statements made from the bar table  Aside from whatever may have been the content of the  untested statements made from the bar table  in SZGZW   and irrespective of what the objective circumstances might have evinced in any event  the context of the present case can be distinguished from that addressed by Jacobson J in SZGZW   in that his Honour was there addressing circumstances where the Tribunal had challenged an assertion made by the appellant upon the basis solely of statements made by that appellant from the bar table  Jacobson J observed at     and   of SZGZW  so far as is material  as follows          the difficulty with the approach which the Federal Magistrate adopted was that he made findings of fact without hearing any evidence from the appellant  He acted solely upon submissions from the bar table and without testing any of the statements which were made to him by an unrepresented applicant          as a general rule  the judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be exercised to deny relief for admitted jurisdictional error  consisting as it does in this case  of a denial of statutory procedural fairness  without evidence tested in the ordinary way          That is especially so in the present case because the learned Federal Magistrate apparently did not believe the explanation proffered from the bar table  The appellant s overall explanation for his delay was that he did not know of the decision until   November    The Federal Magistrate cannot have believed this because he proceeded on the basis that the appellant knew of the decision either from   or at least when the unsuccessful request was made under s     In the decision below  Nicholls FM did rely upon the content of the appellants  application and amended application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court when determining the issue of unwarrantable delay  rather than merely   relying solely on submissions from the bar table   and his Honour invited the appellant to address or explain the delay otherwise prima facie objectively evident  yet the appellants declined to provide any such explanation  Nicholls FM stated at   of his reasons for decision as follows      the case before me the applicant clearly confirmed having notice of the Tribunal decision complained of on   May    This is clearly stated both in the application and amended application  The application to this Court was filed well over     months later on   July    At the hearing before me I specifically drew the applicant s attention to the issue of delay in bringing these proceedings to this Court and the possibility of how the discretion to grant or refuse the relief sought may be affected by this  I urged the applicant to address or explain the delay  The applicant s response was       I won t say anything regarding this long period  like   to   month s delay  I have nothing to say whatsoever         I pressed the issue he made a reference to  some authority who made the delay   But when I sought an explanation the final response was       I have nothing to say regarding this matter       I do not think that the observations of Jacobson J made in SZGZW may be transposed to the context in which this first appellant responded as above as recorded by Nicholls FM  No factors or circumstances have been advanced by the appellants which would in my opinion operate to require the exercise of discretion in their favour upon any basis articulated on the appeal appliedTin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn making observations upon and responses otherwise to the numerous evidentiary and forensic issues arising  I have borne in mind the distinction drawn by Sackville J in Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     and later approved in Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   by Allsop J  Heerey J agreeing  to the effect that the information of which particulars must be provided to the appellant by the Tribunal  in accordance with s  A   does not include the subjective appraisal or thought process of the Tribunal  I have also borne in mind that the subsection extends not just to the reason but also to a part of the reason  appliedPaul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn

borne in mind that the subsection extends not just to the reason but also to a part of the reason  citedR v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte Fowler and Ors     ALR  I am of the opinion that it was open reasonably to Nicholls FM to have dismissed the appellants  application for review of the Tribunal decision below at least upon the basis  objectively found by his Honour  as to unwarrantable delay  particularly in the light of no reasonable nor realistic endeavour on the appellants  part to establish any justifiable basis for that evident delay  The circumstances reviewed by his Honour and earlier summarised in     above operate to adequately support that finding of his Honour  Apart from the objective circumstances relied upon by his Honour in exemplification of unwarrantable delay  being circumstances mainly of the adult male appellant which are to be correspondingly attributable in principle to his wife and child appellants in the circumstances of the case  there was present the factor  as the Tribunal additionally mentioned and his Honour duly accepted  of his extent of familiarity with the Tribunal process gained in the context of his prior invocation of that process four years earlier  and of his prior unsuccessful application for review of that process by the Federal Court back in    Although it is evident that the adult male appellant was the dominant litigant  his wife and child must bear the consequences of his role in the curial applications and appeals which have been undertaken by each of them as applicants appellants  As the Minister rightly submitted  a refusal of relief on discretionary grounds  in particular as to delay  may occur at the instance of the decision maker in a context of administrative review  or indeed subsequent appeal  with or without the need for the Court to determine whether or not there may have been independently established jurisdictional error in relation to the relevant decision making of the Tribunal and Federal Magistrate that has occurred  I am unable to distil any prevailing facts or circumstance which have operated to subvert the implications and consequences of that delay  It is established by authority  which need not be cited  that a discretionary ground for withholding prerogative relief includes that of delay in the seeking of that and any associated relief  One example cited was R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal ex parte Fowler     ALR   at    Barwick CJ  Gibbs  Stephen  Mason and Aickin JJ
