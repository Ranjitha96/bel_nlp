inconsistent with the appellant s claims to have suffered past persecution that was the reason for decision   Although the appellant now asserts that he was only telling the Tribunal he left on his passport  as opposed to leaving without difficulty  the Tribunal s interpretation of his answer that the appellant had also agreed to that second assertion was not unreasonable  The Tribunal was

support of this ground  In those submissions he referred to SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR     In his submissions  the appellant referred to the Tribunal s decision where the Tribunal states     I t is not consistent with those claims  namely that the police were persecuting him and fabricating charges against him  that the applicant left his country without difficulty to come to Australia in January     The appellant referred in his written submissions to the transcript of the Tribunal hearing       i  Tribunal   By the way  did you have any difficulties making exiting your country  You went together  is that right   ii  Appellant   We did not go together  I left on my own because it took some time and the wife had to stay and fanalise  sic  the sell of the unit and also  that was one reason and the other reason was that I was afraid to be seen in the airport that we were living at once that there will not be any implications    iii  Appellant   I did not break any laws     I just do not know what they are capable of  what to expect  It was just my means of precautions     iv  Tribunal   But you did not have any     you just exited on your passport without any difficulties is that what happened   v  Appellant   Yes  that s right  I think it was one of the main aim of the police  sort of police and they achieved    There is nothing before me to indicate that the Tribunal did not comply with its statutory obligations under s   of the Act  The Tribunal was not under any obligation to give the appellant  a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence  SZBEL   HCA       CLR   at      This ground of appeal also fails   This ground asserts that the Tribunal s finding is based upon the exchange in the hearing to which I have referred  That may or may not be the case  The Tribunal might have concluded that the appellant did not have difficulty leaving Lithuania for any of three reasons  It might have relied on the evidence to which reference has been made  It might also have simply been observing that the appellant was not prevented from leaving by border authorities  It might also have been relying upon the appellant s own evidence which showed that he had travelled extensively with no suggestion that leaving Lithuania involved any difficulty  However  I will assume that the Tribunal reasoned in the way the appellant complains citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In respect to the

suffered past persecution that was the reason for decision   In any event  the information itself did not form part of the reasons for decision because it did not  in its terms  constitute a denial or undermining of the appellant s claims to being a refugee  SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA       ALR   at      For those reasons  I find that there was no error in the Federal Magistrate s decision because in answering the Tribunal s question the appellant was thereby providing this information to the Tribunal pursuant to s  A b    The second ground of appeal also fails distinguishedSZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The appellant referred to the decision of Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   in support of his submissions    The reasons for the decision are not made into information given by the applicant  for the purpose of the application  simply because the applicant for review makes an application under s    It is pursuant to s   of the Act that the original decision  not the reasons for it  is before the Tribunal for review and its statutory function is to review the decision  In conducting that review the Tribunal must conform to the requirements in the Act for the exercise of its jurisdiction  including the requirements of   s  A   The appellant argued that the information of which he now complains was not before the original decision maker as it had not been submitted with his original application and  for that reason also  was not information given for the purpose of the application   The first respondent has addressed both grounds of appeal  The first respondent submitted that the evidence relied upon by the Tribunal formed a sufficient basis for finding that the appellant s claims were not plausible  notwithstanding that alternative inferences may have been open  The first respondent contended that the findings were not perverse or otherwise unreasonable in the sense of being contrary to all of the probative material before the Tribunal   The decision of Rares J in SZGGT   FCA   to which the appellant has referred does not assist the appellant  Justice Rares  dicta was directed to a contention that in  applying for a review of the delegate s decision  that decision itself is  information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application      This is not a case where the applicant for a protection visa provided information to a delegate which was subsequently used by the Tribunal  This is a case where the appellant provided the information to the Tribunal itself
