Secondly  subject to s   of the Constitution and the impairment of capacities doctrine  in the words of Brennan CJ in Re Residential Tenancies Tribunal of New South Wales  Ex parte the Defence Housing Authority  Henderson s Case    HCA         CLR   at          there is no reason why the Crown in right of the Commonwealth should not be bound by a State law of general application which governs transactions into which the Crown in right of the Commonwealth may choose to enter    See also per Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ at       In Tasmania  as in all Australian States and Territories  the Commonwealth in its various manifestations is a highly pervasive presence  Discrimination is  as a matter of reality  committed by people  not abstract entities  In Tasmania at any one time there would be many people acting in a myriad of areas on behalf of the Commonwealth in situations where discriminatory conduct could occur  Apart from the Tasmanian capacity  the Crown s capacity in the right of the Commonwealth is  of all the Crown s capacities  the one most likely to be exercised in Tasmania  as the Tasmanian Parliament would be well aware  It is unlikely that the Parliament was too concerned with the Crown in the right of Saskatchewan or Bermuda  There is no logical reason to impute to the State Parliament an intention not to bind the Commonwealth  insofar as it has the power to do so  in relation to this important area of social policy   Turning to the text of the Act  since s   provides expressly that the Crown in the right of Tasmania is bound  the Crown  at least in that capacity  must be a  person  for the purposes of s    The applicants submitted that the intention of the Parliament was to ensure that a respondent to a complaint had  legal personality and capacity   Thus  the argument went  the  person  must therefore be  a natural person  corporation or some other body such as a body politic or entity with legal capacity   I do not agree  In legal discourse   person  often is confined to a natural person or some entity on which the law confers legal personality  such as a corporation  However  in the present case those drafting the Act have been at pains to ensure that  person  is not so limited  The term is defined to include an  organisation   The ordinary meaning of  organisation  extends to all sorts of bodies  such as unincorporated associations  clubs or government departments  which strictly speaking do not have legal personality   Such a construction is consistent with the policy of the Act  The areas of activity in which discrimination may occur which are enumerated in s   include some in which it would be expected that unincorporated bodies such as clubs would be substantially involved   The applicants argued that certain powers conferred on the Tribunal by s   such as orders for re employment  s  c  or orders for payment of a fine  s  e  could not have been intended to apply to the Commonwealth   There is a distinction between  on the one hand  the capacities of the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth and  on the other hand  the exercise of those capacities  State legislation cannot modify the nature of the executive power vested in the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth but it can regulate activities in which the Crown may engage in exercise of those activities  The distinction is discussed by Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Henderson at      Their Honours noted at   that the laws of the land are not confined to the laws of the Commonwealth but include the common law and the statute law in force in each of the States  Thus in Pirrie v McFarlane   HCA         CLR   a person acting in the course of his duties as a member of the RAAF was held to be bound by the provisions of a Victorian Act requiring him to hold a driver s licence when driving a vehicle on a public highway citedCain v Doyle   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The assumptions underlying that argument are not necessarily correct  For example  even if sanctions for discriminatory conduct could be characterised as criminal  which seems unlikely  the Crown may still be bound  There is a presumption against a statute imposing criminal liability upon the Crown  and it has been said to be a very strong one   Cain v Doyle   HCA         CLR   at   but it remains a presumption and thus can be overcome by a clear indication of legislative intention to the contrary  At the very least  this is what has occurred in the Anti Discrimination Act with the Crown in the right of Tasmania   In any event  it does not follow that  because some remedies are incapable of exercise against some categories of person  Parliament did not intend such persons to be subject to the Act at all  Even if orders of the kind mentioned could be made against the Commonwealth  that would not be because of any lack of intention on the part of the Parliament  but rather because of the operation of s   and or the impairment of capacities doctrine  Parliament in s   expressly recognised that the extent of its powers in respect of the Crown in capacities other than in right of Tasmania were not unlimited  Its intention was to bind the Crown as far as it was able   A similar argument based on the obligations of organisations to make their members  officers  employees and agents aware of the kind of conduct which the Act prohibits  s   must meet the same fate distinguishedTelstra Corporation Limited v Worthing   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicants relied on Telstra Corporation Limited v Worthing   HCA         CLR    One of the questions in that case was whether the Workers Compensation Act    NSW  applied to the Commonwealth  That Act contained a provision  s   very like s   of the Anti Discrimination Act   that the Act  binds the Crown  not only in right of New South Wales but also  so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits  in all its other capacities   The High Court said at    citations omitted     As to the   State Act  it contains the express statement in s   as to the Crown being bound in all its other capacities  which has been set out earlier in these reasons  However  a central provision of the legislative scheme established by the   State Act is the requirement  under the sanction of a penalty  that an employer  other than a self insurer  obtain and maintain in force a policy of insurance which complies with the requirements of the legislation  s    Further  a  self insurer  who holds a license granted  as the   State Act originally stood  by the State Compensation Board constituted thereunder  was obliged  under penalty  to maintain with the New South Wales Treasurer a deposit in an amount determined by that Board  s        It will require the clearest indication of a legislative purpose to demonstrate that these penal provisions attach to the Commonwealth  No such indication is to be seen in the   State Act  To the contrary  s   states that nothing in that statute renders  the Crown  liable to be prosecuted for any offence  These penal provisions are central to the structure upon which the regulatory scheme established by the State legislation rests       Worthing is an application of the principle that the question whether a State statute binds the Commonwealth is a matter of construction  turning on the intent of the State legislature as manifested by the text and purpose of the particular statute  The Anti Discrimination Act could not be said to have central penal provisions comparable to those in the New South Wales Act  Nor is there any equivalent to s   of that Act   I conclude therefore that as  by s   Parliament intended to bind the Crown in capacities other than in the right of Tasmania  those capacities must include the Crown s capacity in the right of the Commonwealth  Subject to the constitutional issues which are discussed below  the Anti Discrimination Act binds the Commonwealth  It must necessarily follow that agents of the Commonwealth are bound   Part   of the Anti Discrimination Act is entitled  Dispute resolution   It commences with Div    Complaints  s   of which provides      Any of the following may complain to the Commissioner about discrimination or prohibited conduct       a  a person against whom the alleged discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed           b  a person              i  against whom the alleged discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed  and                      ii  who is a member of a class of persons against whom alleged similar discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed  on behalf of that class  if the Commissioner is satisfied that a majority of those members are likely to consent               c  a trade union that represents              i  a member of that union against whom the alleged discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed  or                      ii  a class of members of that union against whom the alleged discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed  if the Commissioner is satisfied that a majority of those members are likely to consent               d  an organisation against which the alleged discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed  if the Commissioner is satisfied that a majority of members of that organisation are likely to consent           e  an agent of a person referred to in this section       f  a person on behalf of the person against whom the alleged discrimination or prohibited conduct was directed        The Commissioner may investigate any discrimination or prohibited conduct without the lodgement of a complaint if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so   A law of a State will be inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth      where simultaneous obedience to both laws is impossible  Blackley v Devondale Cream  Vic  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       where

  at   citedStephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR   The present case is neatly bracketed by two authorities concerning deceased persons and anti discrimination legislation  In Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR   a complainant under the Sex Discrimination Act    Cth  died after her complaint was lodged  The Full Court of the Federal Court held that the complaint survived and could be pursued by the complainant s executrix  In CUNA Mutual Group Ltd v Bryant   FCA         FCR   the alleged discrimination occurred after death  An insurer under a loan protection policy refused payment because the deceased insured had falsely declared that he had never tested positive for HIV  Branson J held that no claim lay under the Disability Discrimination Act    Cth   In the present case the alleged discrimination occurred before death but the claim was lodged after death   In Stephenson at   Wilcox J  with whom the other members of the Court agreed  said the common law rule that personal actions do not survive the death of the plaintiff had no application where a right of action is created by statute  Guidance must be sought in the statute itself   It is clear from s   that a complainant need not be the person against whom the discriminatory conduct was directed  Section  f  specifically so provides  Moreover  pars  b ii   c ii  and  d  of s   provide for complaints on behalf of classes of persons discriminated against  The Act contains no restriction on the size of the classes  It is an obvious enough possibility that between the alleged discrimination and the lodging of a complaint some members of the class might have died   The orders that the Tribunal may make under s   include   b  an order that the respondent  redress any loss  injury or humiliation suffered by the complainant  and  d  an order that the respondent pay  to the complainant     an amount the Tribunal thinks appropriate as compensation for any loss or injury suffered by the complainant and caused by the respondent s discrimination        In this context   the complainant  suffering the loss  humiliation  etc must be the person discriminated against  even though the complainant for the purposes of s   may be  as we have seen  some other person  There seems to be no logical reason  consistent with the beneficial policy of the Anti Discrimination Act   why redress and compensation should not be ordered in respect of a deceased person   Redress of humiliation  par  b  may serve the educative function of the Act by a public finding that particular discriminatory conduct was unlawful  As Wilcox J pointed out in Stephenson at   the primary purpose of anti discrimination legislation is directed towards the elimination of discrimination  An inquiry and determination by the Tribunal into a complaint may assist that purpose by a formal declaration as to the unlawfulness of the conduct concerned  notwithstanding the death of the person discriminated against   Compensation  par  d  may benefit those who have suffered financially as a result of the discriminatory conduct  To expand on the last mentioned point  one obvious field where discrimination may occur is in employment  Indeed it is the first of the  areas of activity  mentioned in s    Suppose a man is dismissed by his employer on a ground prohibited by s    He cannot get another job  He has a wife and young children to support  Then he dies  It would be an odd construction of the Act which had the effect of exempting the unlawfully discriminating employer from any liability to the dependents of the deceased   I conclude that Ms Campbell can bring her complaint notwithstanding that it relates to discrimination against a person who has died  Indeed  so much more should this be the case when the complaint is that there is a direct connection between the discrimination and the death citedCUNA Mutual Group Ltd v Bryant   FCA         FCR

the Anti Discrimination Act itself characterises the Tribunal  but whether the Tribunal answers the description of a  court  in ss   and    iii  of the Constitution and s   of the Judiciary Act   Secondly  the terms  court  and  court of a State  are to be construed in a context where  subject to such qualifications as may arise from the Kable doctrine   Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions   HCA         CLR   the separation of powers  strictly applied in relation to the federal judiciary  does not apply at the State level   The applicants accepted that there is no comprehensive test by which it is possible to define the characteristics of a court of a State  However they point to the following features    The Tribunal is not called a court    Not all members of the Tribunal must be lawyers  although the chairperson must be a legal practitioner of not less than seven years standing  a magistrate or former judge  If there is only one member  he or she must have these qualifications  s     Members do not take an oath of office    Members have no security of tenure  they are appointed by the Minister  s    b  and  c  and can be suspended or removed by the Minister   Acts Interpretation Act    Tas  s  a      Proceedings in the Tribunal are commenced by referral by the Commissioner  not by the complainant  s     A person may be represented before the Tribunal only

is no contempt power conferred on the Tribunal itself   On this issue the State of Tasmania supported the applicants  However  the second respondent pointed out    The Tribunal s function is to apply the legal standards prescribed by the Anti Discrimination Act to the facts it finds  it does not operate by way of conciliation  arbitration or rule making    The Tribunal is empowered to make orders

administrative tribunals and other administrative decision makers from courts is that the former are made the sole repository of questions of fact and policy  Judicial review or appeal is typically limited to questions of law  as for example in s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  or confined to statutory grounds such as those contained in ss   and   of the Judicial Review Act    Tas  or common law grounds  Craig v South Australia   HCA         CLR    A full appeal on fact and law suggests that the body whose decisions are subject to such rights is a court because it is a part of a system which resolves  at trial and appellate level  legal and factual disputes between citizens and between state and citizen   Other features relied on by the applicants are at best equivocal as to the characterisation of the Tribunal as a court of a State  For example  to provide that the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence is to do no more than legislate as to the law of evidence which is to be applied in a particular Tasmanian court  The common law of evidence has already been substantially modified by the Evidence Act    Tas  citedTana v Baxter     CLR   Pointing out that the Tribunal is called a tribunal  not a court  the applicants referred to Tana v Baxter     CLR    The issue in that case was whether certain claims for relief before the Industrial

Ltd v Burns  EOD    NSWADTAP   at        His Honour analysed in detail the decision in Orellana Fuentes   He observed at   that the Court of Appeal had taken a  balance sheet approach  comparing conventional attributes of a court in the Australian system with elements in the structure that deviated from the conventional attributes  many of which were plainly of a non judicial character and did not connote the level of independence expected of a court  He found at   that the key factors which tipped the balance were the  significant administrative and non judicial attributes   These are discussed in the judgement of Ipp JA in Orellana Fuentes at     and notably included the conciliation function of Arbitrators  who were members of the Commission  and appointed by the Commission s President  in itself something  foreign to the notion of a court    and the reference of medical disputes to  approved medical specialists   Comparable features were not present in the body under consideration in Radio  UE   nor are they present in the Tribunal  Indeed a feature of the Anti Discrimination Act is the conferral of conciliation functions on the Commissioner  rather than the

the same as that in the Commonwealth legislation considered in Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   HCA         CLR    However  this circumstance rather tends to support a conclusion that the Tribunal is a court of State  At a federal level  a purported conferral of judicial power on a body which is not a court in the federal sense  i e  one constituted by judges appointed until age   under s   of the Constitution   will be invalid because the separation of powers  mandated at a federal level  has been breached  But this separation of powers is not applicable

terms are commonly appointed in some State and Territory courts   In the case of inferior courts  less stringent conditions are necessary in order to satisfy security of tenure  Ell v Alberta     SCR   at    Supreme Court of Canada  cited in Bradley at    As Major J  in giving the judgment of the Supreme Court  went on to say  at      The essence of security of tenure is that members of a tribunal be free from arbitrary or discretionary removal from office   In Bradley at     McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ pointed out that  until quite recent times in Australia  State and Territory summary courts have been constituted by members of the public service and subject to the regulation and discipline inherent in that position  One might add that this circumstance is explicitly recognised in s  d  of the Judiciary Act   The federal jurisdiction of a court of summary jurisdiction of a State shall not be judicially exercised except by a Stipendiary or Police or Special Magistrate or  some Magistrate of the State who is specially authorized by the Governor General to exercise such jurisdiction   At the time the Judiciary Act was passed  such magistrates would have been salaried officials  as distinct from honorary justices of the peace  and members of their State public service  with nothing like Act of Settlement tenure   And  as late as the  s Stipendiary and Police Magistrates in some States were not required to be lawyers   Moreover  the fact that Parliament thought it necessary to impose such a condition suggests that at the time of the drafting of the Constitution a few years earlier it was contemplated that even honorary justices  who had no security of tenure at all  would  in the absence of such a condition  constitute a court of a State   To my mind  reasonable and informed members of the public would think that the Tribunal was free from influence of the other branches of the Tasmanian government  and particularly the Executive  On reading the Anti Discrimination Act   such persons would observe that it specifically applied to the conduct of the Tasmanian government  and other governments  They would also note that the Tribunal was empowered to do most of the things courts do  to conduct hearings in public of disputes between parties  to summon witnesses  to find disputed facts and apply legal rules to facts as found  to give reasons for its decisions  and to make orders which can be immediately enforced  Let it be supposed somebody put to such reasonable and informed members of the public that the Minister could just ring up the Tribunal and tell it how to decide cases  and that if a member of the Tribunal did not do the Minister s bidding  he or she could be dismissed  Such reasonable and informed members of the public would point out that there are very practical political sanctions against such an eventuality  To take the most obvious example  where the Minister dismisses a Tribunal member because he or she dislikes a decision made against the government  Public  political and media attacks on the government would be inevitable  Ministers would know this  and members of the Tribunal would know Ministers knew this  The legal recourse that may be available to members of the Tribunal will be examined in a moment  but one cannot ignore the practical political setting in which the Tribunal exists  The Anti Discrimination Act holds out to the Tasmanian public a clear promise that the Tribunal will hear and determine complaints of unlawful discriminatory conduct  that in doing so it will act fairly and independently and make orders remedying breaches of the Act  if necessary against the Tasmanian Government  A public expectation that the independence of the Tribunal will be respected by the Government is in itself a circumstance of some significance   The legal remedies that may be open to a member of a putative court faced with adverse governmental action  or inaction  are relevant in assessing whether the requirements of appearance and reality of independence are satisfied  Such factors formed part of the reasoning in Bradley at     It would be open to a member of the Tribunal to challenge  and have set aside  a decision for suspension or dismissal on grounds under s   of the Judicial Review Act   including        Breach of the rules of natural justice  par  a    Improper exercise of power  par  e    No evidence  par  h          The improper exercise of power ground is defined by s   to include      Taking irrelevant considerations into account  par  a    Failing to take relevant considerations into account  par  b    Exercise of the power for a purpose other than the purpose for which the power is conferred  par c          Bad faith  par  d          An exercise of power so unreasonable that no reasonable person could so exercise the power  par  h          Any other exercise of a power in a way that is an abuse of power  par  i    The last mentioned ground would seem particularly apt for a dismissal grounded in Ministerial dissatisfaction with a particular decision of the Tribunal  or for reasons otherwise arbitrary or capricious  Moreover  there is a right  enforceable by the Supreme Court  to obtain reasons for a decision  ss         Practically speaking  a member of the Tribunal with a right to challenge suspension or dismissal before an independent Supreme Court may be in a stronger position than a Supreme Court judge faced with a hostile government which happens to control both Houses of the legislature citedEll

agree with the applicants that it has little relevance to the issue of the present case now under consideration  although it will need to be considered later  Mr Henderson owned a house which he leased to the Defence Housing Authority  a Commonwealth body  He sought the Authority s permission to inspect the premises and provision of a key for that purpose  This seemingly humdrum event provoked massive constitutional litigation  Mr Henderson asked for orders from the New South Wales Residential Tenancies Tribunal  a body established under the Residential Tenancies Act    NSW   A majority of the High Court held that the matters dealt with by the State Act did not fall within the Commonwealth s exclusive powers under s  ii  of the Constitution   that the State Act was not inconsistent with the Commonwealth legislation establishing the Authority  and that the principle in Commonwealth v Cigamatic Pty Ltd  in liq    HCA         CLR   did not prevent the valid operation of the State Act in the circumstances   As a fourth alternative  the Commonwealth in Henderson argued that s   of the Judiciary Act did not operate to subject it to the orders sought under the State Act  Section   provides that in  any suit  to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party  the rights of parties shall be as nearly the same as in a suit between subject and subject   There appears to be a misprint at   CLR    where the arguments are summarised   invalid  should be  valid    While the Commonwealth argued that  suit  in s   refers to a suit  in a court properly invested with federal jurisdiction   at   it seems the State of New South Wales did not assert the contrary  Its counsel  at   accepted there was no  suit in federal jurisdiction  as did Mr Henderson s  noted by Gummow J at    It was not necessary to decide the s   point discussedRadio  UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Burns  EOD    NSWADTAP   at      http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWADTAP  html  There have been decisions of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal some of which hold  and others of which deny  that that body is a court  Recently Judge O Connor of the Appeal Panel of the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal held that that body was a  court  both in the  general sense  and  in the Judiciary Act sense  Radio  UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Burns  EOD    NSWADTAP   at        His Honour analysed in detail the decision in Orellana Fuentes   He observed at   that the Court of Appeal had taken a  balance sheet approach  comparing conventional attributes of a court in the Australian system with elements in the structure that deviated from the conventional attributes  many of which were plainly of a non judicial character and did not connote the level of independence expected of a court  He found at   that the key factors which tipped the balance were the  significant administrative and non judicial attributes   These are discussed in the judgement of Ipp JA in Orellana Fuentes at     and notably included the conciliation function of Arbitrators  who were members of the Commission  and appointed by the Commission s President  in itself something  foreign to the notion of a court    and the reference of medical disputes to  approved medical specialists   Comparable features were not present in the body under consideration in Radio  UE   nor are they present in the Tribunal  Indeed a feature of the Anti Discrimination Act is the conferral of conciliation functions on the Commissioner  rather than the Tribunal  whose role  undoubtedly a judicial

it is not intended to make exhaustive or exclusive provision with respect to the subject with which it deals  thereby enabling State laws  not inconsistent with the Commonwealth law  to have an operation  Here again the Commonwealth law does not of its own force give State law a valid operation  All that it does is to make it clear that the Commonwealth law is not intended to cover the field  thereby leaving room for the operation of such State laws as do not conflict with Commonwealth law   The present case  in my opinion  is an example of the principle of which Mason J speaks  The applicants  focus on s   of the Air Force Act draws particular attention to the Manual   issued by the Chief of Air Force in the course of exercising his statutory power and duty to administer the AAFC  The exercise of that power and duty is of course subject  amongst other things  to the Cadet Forces Regulations   But the Regulations themselves  relevantly for present purposes  do not go beyond the specific grounds available for discharge and the procedure to be followed in relation thereto  Plainly the legislators  including those who made the Regulations   contemplated that the vast bulk of other administrative provisions essential for the conduct of the AAFC would be left to the Chief of Air Force in the exercise of his power and duty under s     The Manual   as has been seen  is replete with express references to State authorities and State laws  and also Commonwealth authorities  the Ombudsman and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  entirely unconnected with the Air Force   This is hardly surprising  Cadets are not members of the Australian Defence Force  Although they engage in activities and training of a military kind  they do not undertake the obligations and restrictions of military life  Since cadets may be thirteen or even younger  children in the most literal sense  the AAFC is  as is said in Ch   par   of the Manual  in loco parentis with respect to those who are minors  Discrimination  sexual harassment and like conduct have only become the subject of legislative attention in the last few decades  It can give rise to difficult and delicate problems  especially where children and young people are concerned in activities with older instructors  It is not an area in which the military is perceived to have any special expertise

is concerned with the application of a Tasmanian statute proscribing discriminatory conduct in that State in various areas of activity  including education and training  It is consistent with similar beneficial legislation in other States and Territories and in the Commonwealth itself  which explicitly leaves open resort to State and Territory legislation  Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act    Cth  s    The executive capacity of the Commonwealth will not be impaired by agents such as Mr Smith being required to conduct themselves in accordance with the Anti Discrimination Act   along with other Tasmanian laws  as the Manual recognises  Certainly this is so in the absence of any express Commonwealth law to the contrary  cf Pirrie at     The Anti Discrimination Act applies to the Commonwealth and its agents  The Act authorises complaints where the person discriminated against has died  Ms Campbell has an arguable complaint in her own right of discrimination contrary to the Act  In conferring on the Anti Discrimination Tribunal jurisdiction to adjudicate complaints against the Commonwealth the Act does not breach Ch III of the Constitution   The Act is not inconsistent with the Air Force Act or the Cadet Forces Regulations within the meaning of s   of the Constitution   The Act does not impair the capacities of the Commonwealth Executive   There
