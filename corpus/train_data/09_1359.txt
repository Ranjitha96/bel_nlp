matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There are a number of principles relevant to the exercise of the Court s power under s  B   These principles were set out in Stewart  in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd   FCA   as follows  at         the court does not simply  rubber stamp  whatever is put forward by a liquidator  As Giles J said in Re Spedley Securities Ltd  In liq    HCA         ACLC     at   in relation to the powers of a liquidator to compromise claims             T he Court is necessarily confined in attempting to second guess the liquidator in the exercise of his powers  and generally will not interfere unless there can be seen to be some lack of good faith  some error in law or principle  or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator s conduct  The same restraint must apply when the question is whether the liquidator should be authorised to enter into a particular transaction the benefits and burdens of which require assessment on a commercial basis  Of course  the compromise of claims will involve assessment on a legal basis  and a liquidator will be expected  as was made plain in Re Chase Corporation  Australia  Equities Ltd   to obtain advice and  as a prudent person would in the conduct of his own affairs  advice from practitioners appropriate to the nature and value of the claims  But in all but the simplest case  and demonstrably in the present case  commercial considerations play a significant part in whether a compromise will be for the benefit of creditors               a court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear  Re United Medical Protection  No     FCA         ACLC               the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator s proposal  Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable  Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd     ACLC             in reviewing the liquidator s proposal  the task of the Court is             not  to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal  and to substitute its determination for his in     a hearing de novo  but      simply to review the liquidator s proposal  paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation  satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety  and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the  expeditious and beneficial administration  of the winding up             See ASC Timber at   see also Re Gate Gourmet Australia Pty Ltd  in liq      ACLC   at   and Warne v GDK Financial Solutions  Peridon Village Nominees   FCAFC         ACLC     at    The Court s approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter            further  in judging whether or not a liquidator should be given permission to enter into a funding agreement  whether retrospective or not  it is important to ensure  inter alia  that the entity or person providing the funding is not given a benefit disproportionate to the risk undertaken in light of the funding that is promised or a  grossly excessive profit  Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd   NSWCA         ACLC     at   and Re ACN       Ltd   FCA         ACLC     at             generally  the Court grants approval under s  B  of the Act only where the transaction is the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company  GDK Financial Solutions at   and the cases cited
