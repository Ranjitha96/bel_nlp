citedCarey v Carey   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   August   Cowdroy J made orders under O  A  r   Carey v Carey   FCA    In making those orders  Cowdroy J recounted that the Applicants are the executors of the estate of Grace Dorothy Carey  a retired medical practitioner  and that the Respondent is the brother of the Applicants and a beneficiary of that estate  His Honour concluded    The applicants have made inquiries of banking institutions in Sydney and the accountants for the deceased but they have not been able to ascertain any further details of any overseas accounts of the deceased  The Court is satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has or is likely to have information relative to the foreign owned assets in accordance with O  A r   of the Rules and that it is in the interests of the administration of justice that the applicants be given the opportunity of obtaining such information   The Respondent resides in the Netherlands   Since that date there has been a series of revisions to the orders as first made   A further Motion has since been filed on   April    That Motion   filed on behalf of the Respondent  seeks a variety of orders including an order that the preservation order as previously made by Cowdroy J  and later varied  be discharged unless the Applicants file and serve proceedings seeking the recovery of assets within   days   Of immediate concern  however  is a further order seeking to vacate the order requiring that the Respondent attend in person for cross examination  It is this issue which must be resolved as quickly as possible  If the Respondent is to attend in person  albeit pursuant to an order previously made and long outstanding  it is nevertheless appropriate to have that issue resolved expeditiously   In respect of the hearing on   and   May   Counsel for the Respondent has previously confirmed that Affidavits filed thus far by the Respondent will be relied upon  No question thus arises as to the Court itself requiring a party to attend   for examination    An   Addendum   however  has since been filed on behalf of the Respondent on   April    The effect of that   Addendum   if properly understood  is that the Respondent now wishes to reserve his position and give such evidence   by way of reply only to the matters the Applicants seek to agitate    He also contends that   justice will only be served if the Respondent s evidence is limited to evidence in chief  unless the Respondent submits by consent to cross examination    Notwithstanding that   Addendum   Counsel for the Respondent has this morning confirmed that he will seek to   tender   the Respondent s Affidavits previously filed  albeit for the limited purpose of establishing   compliance   with previous orders citedCarey v Carey   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   October   the Applicants filed a Notice of Motion seeking a further variation of the orders  as did the Respondent on   November    On   November   both Notices of Motion were set down for hearing on   December    That date was vacated on   November   and the Notices of Motion were again set down for hearing on   and   March    One of the orders made on   November   was that the Respondent was to   attend in person on the adjourned hearing date so as to be able to be cross examined    Affidavits   it should be noted  had previously been filed by the Respondent upon which reliance was to be placed  A further application to vary the orders previously made was rejected on   December   Carey v Carey   FCA     On at least one prior occasion a hearing date has been vacated  with the consent of the Applicants  to accommodate the personal circumstances of the Respondent and  in particular  his wife   Both of the present Notices of Motion are set down for hearing on   and   May   citedHooper v Kirella Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  For

Australia Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at     per Palmer J    NSWLR   followedSmithKline Beecham PLC v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The variety of orders as sought by the Respondent in the most recent Motion desirably should have been resolved at the one time  The Respondent in an Outline of Submissions filed on   March   thus contends that the order as first made under O  A    and as subsequently varied    has served its purpose and that   Order  A is now exhausted    On behalf of the Respondent  reliance is placed upon the following observations of Finkelstein J in SmithKline Beecham PLC v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA       There is a limit to the discovery to which an applicant is entitled under O A  As I have indicated  O A is not a substitute for general discovery  The object is to disclose what is sufficient to permit the applicants to establish whether the elements of a cause of action are made out and to plead sufficient particulars to support a claim   Even though the Respondent has previously filed Affidavits   it is simply submitted that there should be no cross examination because the object and purpose of O  A in the present proceedings has been fulfilled   That there is a limit to the power conferred by O  A may readily be accepted  A question which will have to be resolved is to determine whether that limit has now been reached  But that is a matter which can be resolved at the hearing on   May    That is a course which was not opposed this morning by Counsel for the Respondent   It is inappropriate to require Senior Counsel for the Applicants to detail in advance the precise questions or even the detailed subject matter of those areas of factual dispute which will be the focus of any cross examination  To do so may of itself frustrate the effectiveness of any cross examination  But it is appropriate to oblige any counsel requiring a deponent who normally resides overseas to attend in person  to satisfy the Court that there is a legitimate reason for requiring him to do so  To that end  it was put on behalf of the Applicants  without being exhaustive  that there would be cross examination on the following issues   i  why there has been production of a number of Swiss bank accounts but non production of the first pages of those accounts  the first pages presumably disclosing the names of the beneficiaries of each of those accounts     ii  the references contained within those Swiss bank accounts to other accounts described as   fiduciary accounts   without any further explanation as to the identity of those accounts or those having an interest in them  and    iii  assets asserted by the Respondent to belong to himself and not to his mother but in respect to which legitimate bases for reservation exist     Some of the documents upon which the Respondent is to be cross examined have previously been seen by him  others  however  have apparently not been seen by him followedSt George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Contestable issues of fact may just as likely arise in applications under O  A as they may in other proceedings  And they may be resolved in the same manner  with the Court always conscious of the need to ensure that the process itself does not become a   full blown   hearing or an abuse of process  In Tyco Australia   Hely J relevantly observed    Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O  A for preliminary discovery  St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd   FCA         ALR    There is no reason why the ordinary interlocutory procedures should not be available to assist in the resolution of those contestable issues of fact  subject to the overriding consideration that the invocation of those procedures does not amount to an abuse of the process of the Court  Kimberley Mineral Holdings Ltd  In Liq  v McEwan     NSWLR    Thus  at least prima facie  it would be an abuse of process for an applicant for preliminary discovery to seek to compel the production of documents by notice to produce  when the production of those documents is sought under O  A r    But it does not follow  for example  that a subpoena sought to be issued by an applicant for preliminary discovery against a third party would necessarily be an abuse  depending upon the scope and purpose of the subpoena   Even short of an abuse of process  considerable caution should be exercised before exposing any witness to the inconvenience of travelling from overseas to Australia unless it is considered necessary in the interests of the administration of justice   Those are areas of cross examination which  it is considered  can be further pursued in an application under O  A  But it must further be recognised that the point of time at which the Applicants must be required to file an application and statement of claim and thereafter invoke the general rules for discovery conferred by O  A must be very imminent  Whether such an order should be made  as is sought by the Respondent  will be further considered at the hearing on   and   May    Rule   is a rule   designed to amplify the court s

cases cth FCAFC  html  Counsel for the Respondent accepts that there may  in an appropriate case  be cross examination of deponents of affidavits filed and read in proceedings commenced under O  A  So much may presently be accepted  An application under O  A does not exclude the availability of other interlocutory procedures of the Court nor exclude the normal rule that a   party may require the attendance for cross examination of a person making an affidavit   Federal Court Rules    Cth  O   r    When addressing the availability of interlocutory procedures  including the ability to issue a notice to produce  Hill J  with whom Hely and Conti JJ agreed  concluded in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR       However  for the reasons I have given  I am of the view that there is power to issue  in an appropriate case  a notice to produce in pre action discovery proceedings  Whether the notice should be confined clearly depends upon the issues that are said to arise and in respect of which the production of documents is sought  An applicant who seeks to use a notice to produce  in effect  to gain production of the very documents which are the subject of the pre action discovery will not have given the notice to produce in good faith  but rather  will have acted in a way that is an abuse of process  Otherwise  in principle at least  the notice to produce procedure may be exercised by both parties if otherwise relevant to issues in dispute  However  I would emphasise that it clearly is not contemplated that a pre action discovery proceeding become a full blown factual contest between the parties  The judge hearing the application will  no doubt  confine cross examination and examine the subject matter of any notice to produce to ensure this does not become the case
