Pattenden v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCarltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works     All E R   In terms of Australian jurisprudence  the lawfulness in particular circumstances of a practice within public administration of delegates of a responsible Minister or permanent head or equivalent such as the Commissioner authorising subordinates to exercise delegated powers in their name finds recognition at ultimate appellate level in O Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners   HCA           CLR   at     per Gibbs CJ  Murphy J agreeing in this regard and at     per Wilson J  It is also the subject of an influential advisory opinion given by Brennan J in his Honour s then capacity as President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Reference under Ombudsman Act s       ALD    These  in turn  give local recognition to a principle of public law in the United Kingdom in relation to the administration of large Departments of State which has come to be known as  the Carltona principle  so named for a leading authority on the subject in that country  Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works     All E R    These and other authorities on the subject are helpfully collected and discussed in Aronson  Dyer and Groves  Judicial Review of Administrative Action    rd Edition  at pp       I am relieved from considering whether authorisation in accordance with the Carltona principle was possible at all in relation to the making of a DPO because it was not submitted that the power to make a DPO  though described in Poletti s Case  at   as a  severe intrusion into a person s liberty  privacy and freedom of movement  was of such a nature as to require the decision personally to be made by the Commissioner or a delegate  It was accepted by the Appellant that it was permissible for the authorised person to decide to make the DPO with that decision being the act of the delegate   The submission made on behalf of Mr Pattenden was that  accepting that the regime of delegation and authorisation was lawfully possible  it was not permissible for the authorised person  in turn  to consign substantive aspects of the making of the decision to subordinates  It was  rightly  no part of that submission that it was impermissible for an authorised person such as Mr Benson  having made a decision to make a DPO  to consign to a subordinate consequential  wholly procedural  clerical or  ministerial  tasks such as the affixing of a facsimile of the Deputy Commissioner s signature to the DPO or the communication to Mr Pattenden of the making of the DPO  Rather  the submission was that  when one examined the facts of this case  the decision as made and evidenced by the DPO was not that of Mr Benson in all key respects   For the Commissioner  the submission was advanced that  in a relative sense  the assessment debt and the credits which were inserted were minor  That  with respect  is an unattractive submission  Assuming  as the parties have  that the nature of the power to make a DPO admits of the application of the Carltona principle at all  it nonetheless remains a power that entails a serious intrusion on a person s freedom of movement  There is therefore every reason to expect that the non procedural aspects of the decision will be made only by the authorised officer  Mr Benson never made a decision to make a DPO in respect of the taxation liability specified in the purported DPO of   May    The decision to insert a different taxation liability in that order was that of unauthorised subordinates   I have no reason to doubt that  when Mr Sivasubramaniam affixed the Deputy Commissioner s signature to the DPO which issued to Mr Pattenden  he did so in good faith  It was nonetheless not only an insubordinate act but an unauthorised one  In so doing  he presumed that on   May   knowing of the further taxation liability and of the credits  Mr Benson would remain of the view that the making of a DPO was appropriate  Like comment may be made in respect of the actions of whomever it was in  Debt Management  who presumed  without authority  to insert into the draft of the DPO liabilities and credits or payments of which Mr Benson was unaware when he made the decision to make a DPO on   April    The addition of the additional taxation liability and of the further payments or credits was not a procedural step  Neither  in light of that  was the affixing of the facsimile of the Deputy Commissioner s signature to a DPO in that form   What Mr Benson s subordinates have done is to conflate two features of the DPO regime  Section  S contemplates the making of a DPO in respect of a taxation liability  It is the amount of that liability which must be inserted into the DPO  Once a DPO has been made   a  it remains in force until it is revoked or until it is set aside by a court  s  S  of the TAA  and   b  s  T of the TAA then has effect

of the present kind  it is not for a court entertaining an appeal against a DPO to usurp the function of the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when deciding an appeal against or  as the case may be  when reviewing  an objection decision in respect of an assessment  There was  even in   nothing new in such a conclusion  A like position prevailed by virtue of the effect of s   of the ITAA  in respect of recovery related proceedings arising under the earlier regime for the restriction of the departure from Australia of taxation debtors  Re Scottish Loan   Finance Co Ltd     SR  NSW    at      Nicholas CJ in Eq  citedDalco v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   Having reflected on the language employed in s  S b  of the TAA and on what was said of that provision by Young J in Dalco v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at      later endorsed by Einfeld J in Edelsten v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at   and by Pincus J  as his Honour then was  in Skase v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR     at   and   Jessup J in Troughton v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at       recently offered the following summary of how that provision falls to be construed        It follows that s  S b  should be read not literally  but as though it referred to a belief by the Commissioner  on reasonable grounds  that it was desirable that the person not leave Australia without discharging the tax liability or making the arrangements there referred to  Thus it is not to be taken as a given that  in every case  the departure of the person from Australia will make it unlikely  or at least less likely  that the tax liability will be discharged  or that the ability of the Commissioner to recover the tax will be impaired  These are things which must be considered by the Commissioner in every case  The purpose of s  S  and accordingly a central purpose of Part IVA   is not the prevention of persons  owing tax  from leaving Australia simpliciter  it is the prevention of such persons from leaving Australia where  in the Commissioner s belief reasonably arrived at  the recovery of tax would or might thereby be impaired       In that result  at least so far as revealed by s  S  the general scope and objects of Part IVA of the Administration Act are as contended for by both sides in the present case  As contended for by the Commissioner  they are the protection of the revenue  As contended for by the applicant  they are the prevention of persons  owing tax  from leaving Australia where that would affect the recoverability thereof appliedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Broadbeach Properties Pty Ltd   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At the time when the submission was made the appeal to the High Court from the Queensland Court of Appeal s submission had yet to be decided  Shortly after I reserved my decision on this appeal  the High Court in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Broadbeach Properties Pty Ltd   HCA     Broadbeach Properties   unanimously reversed the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal  thereby exposing a false line of Queensland authority the origins of which may be traced back via Willemse Family Co Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     Qd R   to Re Softex Industries Pty Ltd  Softex Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR    I therefore invited the parties to make such further submissions as they may be advised in relation to the relevance of the objection   For Mr Pattenden  the submission was that the existence of an objection remained relevant with it being put that Broadbeach Properties concerned a provision which deemed a company to be insolvent whereas the present  as with an order for the winding up of a company or a sequestration order against the estate of a debtor concerned a change in status  in this case  the fundamental right to freedom of movement   Further  the focus of the  residual discretion  seemed to change from that said to be possessed by the Court to one said to be possessed by the Commissioner  The Commissioner maintained his position that the existence of the objection was not a relevant consideration   Just what purpose is served by the words   in its discretion  in s  X of the TAA is moot  It is  for example  difficult to envisage a circumstance in which  even assuming that they bespeak a  residual discretion  a court which had concluded that reasonable grounds did not exist for the belief referred to in s  S b  of the TAA would do anything other than set the DPO aside  Likewise  if each of the questions inherent in an appeal against the making of a DPO were resolved against the appellant  it is difficult to envisage how any order other than the dismissal of the appeal might be made  In the event that all existing tax liabilities had been paid  that there were no prospective tax liabilities and that the Commissioner refused to revoke the DPO under s  T  the appropriate course would be to challenge the adverse revocation decision  not to institute or further to prosecute an appeal against a DPO the making of which satisfied each of the three questions derived from Poletti s Case in the hope of nonetheless securing a favourable exercise of a  residual discretion  from a court   Further and more fundamentally  as the Full Court reminded in Poletti s Case  supra  at    F ederal courts or other courts exercising federal jurisdiction exercise only the judicial power of the Commonwealth  and do not act administratively or exercise administrative or executive powers by  for example  substituting their own discretion for the discretion of the original decision maker   It is the Commissioner  not the Judiciary  who administers the TAA  Whatever the words   in its discretion  mean  they do not offer a basis for any consideration of the merits of an objection in the face of the engagement of s   of the ITAA  by appropriate tender of duly authenticated copies of the assessments concerned  In that circumstance  for reasons given above  the tax liability is a given  While  as an administrator  it would not be an  irrelevant consideration   as opposed to being a  relevant consideration  for the Commissioner  if so disposed  to consider the merits of an objection in deciding whether to make a DPO  it is not for a court to do that on an appeal  even assuming that there is a  residual discretion   In this regard  this particular submission of Mr Pattenden is subversive of s   of the ITAA  and seeks to resurrect what I have described as a false line of authority  I reject it appliedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA           CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commissioner is entitled to raise alternative assessments  What he is not entitled to do is twice or more to recover tax in respect of the same income  The prevailing position was summarised and pertinent authorities were collected by Brennan J  as his Honour then was  in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA           CLR   at   The appropriateness of alternative assessments to tax of two taxpayers in respect of the same item of income was recognized in a dictum of this Court in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v  Moorebank Pty  Ltd  And the courts  if not the Commissioner  can diminish the difficulty of concurrent assessments by ensuring that there is no double recovery of tax  The co existence of tax liabilities arising from concurrent assessments is entirely consistent with the operation of s    If the Commissioner employs s   in a proceeding to recover tax from taxpayer A  the liability of that taxpayer cannot be avoided by pointing to an outstanding assessment against taxpayer B  Section   operates as between the Commissioner and the taxpayer served with the notice of assessment in a proceeding between them and the notice of assessment issued to another taxpayer does not qualify or affect the operation of s     Footnote references omitted  See also to like effect in that same case the reasons for judgment of Dawson J at p     and of Toohey J at p    The relevant root authority is Richardson v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR     Had Crown Insurance paid the deemed assessments prior to the making of the DPO and either this fact not drawn to the attention of Mr Benson or if it had and its implications had not been taken into account in considering the extent to which Mr Pattenden s tax liability had thereby been discharged  there may have been a basis for the submission which came not to be pressed but it is unnecessary to decide the point  The mere fact that Mr Benson was unaware that deemed assessments existed in respect of Crown Insurance had no impact on the reaching of a conclusion that Mr Pattenden was subject to a taxation liability that had not been wholly discharged  I consider below whether there is any other ramification of his ignorance of the deemed assessments   There was no suggestion that bad faith on the part of the Commissioner or his staff attended the issuing of the amended assessments to Mr Pattenden in January    The production and tender in evidence of the authenticated copies of those amended assessments and the other assessment establishes conclusively in this appeal that those assessments were duly made and that the amount and all particulars of each assessment are correct  s   ITAA  distinguishedDin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   Two authorities were principally relied upon  Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR    Wilcox J  and passages in the dissenting judgment of Mason J  as his Honour then was  in O Reilly s Case  supra  Din s Case though was determined on a basis not relied upon for Mr Pattenden i e  that the nature of the statutory power and administrative necessity were not such as to make it impractical for decisions personally to be made by the Minister and his appointed delegates  The dissent of Mason J in O Reilly s Case was influenced by similar considerations   The authorities relied upon do not directly support the submission  which is not to say that it lacks merit  The essential point advanced was that  in permitting a decision by an authorised officer to make a DPO in the name of the delegate  the law did not thereby allow the authorised officer to give a blanket authority to an unauthorised officer to affix  at some uncertain time in the future  the signature of the delegate to a DPO in respect of whatever the total tax liability of the recipient might then be and irrespective of whatever other changes may have occurred in the interval   Paragraph  S a  uses the indefinite article to qualify  tax liability    Tax liability  is defined by s   of the TAA to mean  a liability to the Commonwealth arising under  or by virtue of  a taxation law   In turn  s   defines  taxation law  by reference to the definition of that term in the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   ITAA   Section     of the ITAA  provides   taxation law  means       a  an Act of which the Commissioner has the general administration  including a part of an Act to the extent to which the Commissioner has the general administration of the Act  or    b  regulations under such an Act  including such a part of an Act  consideredEdelsten v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   Having reflected on the language employed in s  S b  of the TAA and on what was said of that provision by Young J in Dalco v

Taxation   FCA         FCR     at   and   Jessup J in Troughton v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at       recently offered the following summary of how that provision falls to be construed        It follows that s  S b  should be read not literally  but as though it referred to a belief by the Commissioner  on reasonable grounds  that it was desirable that the person not leave Australia

Rockett   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Whether reasonable grounds existed for the holding of the requisite belief is  an objectively determined postulate  Poletti s Case  at    The following passage from the joint judgment of the Full Court of the High Court in George v Rockett   HCA         CLR   at   definitively states the relevant law  When a statute prescribes that there must be  reasonable grounds  for a state of mind   including suspicion and belief   it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person  That was the point of Lord Atkin s famous  and now orthodox  dissent in Liversidge v  Anderson   UKHL       AC   see Nakkuda Ali v  M F  De S  Jayaratne   AC     at pp     Reg  v  I R C   Ex parte Rossminster   UKHL       AC     at pp         Bradley v  The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     at pp     W A  Pines Pty  Ltd  v  Bannerman     FLR   at pp       FCA       ALR     at pp      That requirement opens many administrative decisions to judicial review and precludes the arbitrary exercise of many statutory powers  see  for example  Attorney General v  Reynolds   AC    Therefore it must appear to the issuing justice  not merely to the person seeking the search warrant that reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion and belief exist   Put in the context of an appeal under s  V  what this means is that it is for the appellant to prove that  viewed objectively and on the material before the decision maker or otherwise then available  reasonable grounds for the requisite belief did not exist   The submission to Mr Benson recommending the making of a DPO in respect of Mr Pattenden put the following version of what were said to be  material facts   findings  and made the following comments  Material Facts   Findings       Mr Pattenden was issued with Notices of Amended Assessment  for   and Penalty Notices  amounting to   on       Mr Pattenden s current consolidated account balance is   Dr     When contacted by an advanced  High Value Debt  Recovery ATO Officer  Mr Craig Duly  TAG  on   stated that he would lodge an objection against the total debt in     weeks time     After the     weeks had expired  the ATO office re contacted Mr Duly on    Mr Duly stated that he not yet contacted Mr Pattenden s solicitor  who was tasked to prepare the objection     On   Mr Duly stated that he not yet contacted Mr Pattenden s solicitor  who was tasked to prepare the objection     As on   there is no record of an objection being received anywhere in the ATO  Mr Duly is also not contactable     A second Interim Decision Summary  Position Paper  was issued by facsimile and by post on       In the above correspondence  the ATO provided a reply by date timeframe of   for Mr Pattenden to provide comments and any additional information or evidence     The second Interim Decision Summary proposed ITR amendments and penalties of a further     million     During the interview of   Mr Pattenden advised that both his luxury home units  in RUNAWAY BAY  QLD  had been sold two weeks prior to    The units are cumulatively worth at least   million     Mr Pattenden previously sold a portion of his equity in his associated ACBF Group in July   for   million     Mr Pattenden reportedly sold his racehorses at a significant loss     In his letter of   Mr Hughes advised that Mr Pattenden had now ceased all involvement in the ACBF Group  other than his shareholding  By virtue of this statement  Mr Hughes conceded that Mr Pattenden maintained substantial business ties  directorships and shareholdings  in Australia in the recent past     Also in the recent past  Mr Pattenden has made numerous trips in and out of Australia     In light of all of the above  I believe that this evidence shows Mr Pattenden is in the process of divesting himself of his Australian assets and is removing them from our jurisdiction  Due to this behaviour together with the fact that he holds a British passport  he also represents a flight risk     I also specifically make mention of my earlier minute of   that Mr Pattenden knew conclusively that his PAYG W  obligations under the TAA   and intentionally chose to disregard them in the   FY     In his responses of   and   Mr Duly has neither refuted nor provided any evidence to the contrary      Other Relevant comments          Mr Pattenden holds the remaining   shares  valued at   million  in ACBF Group Holdings Pty Ltd     I hypothesize that Mr Duly s delays in lodging an objection may be strategy to delay legal action by the ATO to recover debts owed by Mr Pattenden     Mr Pattenden s noncompliant history clearly evidences his disregard for Income Tax and other laws   I respectfully agree with that summary  In particular I prefer it to the submission made on behalf of the Commissioner that the use of the word  desirable  in s  S  meant that not much was required to warrant the making of a DPO   Desirable  is certainly a word of lesser moment than  essential  but  to repeat an observation of Jessup J   The purpose of s  S     is not the prevention of persons  owing tax  from leaving Australia simpliciter    That was a purpose evident in the earlier regime  The word  desirable  must be read in the context of affecting recovery  Further  part of that context  are the words  reasonable grounds  which  as the passage quoted above from George v Rockett underscores  are a protection against the exercise of arbitrary power  The word  desirable  does not offer a basis for trivialising that protection   Having regard to this approach to the construction of s  S b  it is  in my opinion  relevant to take account when considering whether reasonable grounds for the requisite belief existed  to take account of the ability to enforce an Australian revenue debt in places for which a debtor might reasonably be expected to reside abroad  insofar as it may be possible to identify the same referred toGovernment of India v Taylor   AC   So far as the United Kingdom is concerned  the consensus between the parties was that  though provision is made by and under the Foreign Judgements  Reciprocal Enforcements  Act    UK  for the registration of  materially  judgments of this Court or of the Supreme Court of a State  an exception prevails in respect of  a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature   see s    That being so and having regard to Government of India v Taylor   AC     it was common ground that a judgment obtained here in respect of a revenue debt could not be enforced in the United Kingdom  Accepting this though  the conclusion reasonably to be drawn on the whole of the evidence that existed when the DPO was made was that the prospect of Mr Pattenden s returning to the United Kingdom for anything other than short term visits was remote  Further  there was no evidence that he had any assets of any significance in that country   There was no evidence before me as to the position which prevails in relation to the enforcement of an Australian revenue debt in Vanuatu  If there were some benign feature of the law there that would permit the enforcement of an Australian revenue debt judgment there it was for Mr Pattenden to prove that  Mr Pattenden does  it seems  have assets there  but the impression reasonably to be formed on the evidence of his situation in May this year was that  in his retirement  he is increasingly likely to spend less time there than he does in New Zealand  Mr Pattenden s physical presence in Australia can have no effect on the position which prevails under Vanuatu law in relation to the enforcement of an Australian revenue debt judgment   So far as New Zealand is concerned  it appears that the common law public policy against the enforcement of a foreign revenue debt judgment as described in Government of India v Taylor has been reversed by domestically enacted treaty  In   the TAA was amended so as to include in Sch   a new Div    Mutual assistance in the collection of foreign tax debts  s   and Sch   item   International Tax Agreements Amendment Act  No      Cth   The new Division makes provision for bilateral enforcement treaties for tax debts  The first country with which Australia entered into treaty relations for bilateral enforcement of tax debts was New Zealand  This was achieved by the inclusion of a newly numbered Article   into the Double Taxation Agreement between the two countries  That Protocol was included in Schedule  A to the International Tax Agreements Act    Cth  by the International Tax Agreements Amendment Act  No      Cth   The Protocol entered into force on   January    Any Australian revenue law judgment in respect of Mr Pattenden s Australian tax liability could be enforced in New Zealand against assets which he has there   Mr Pattenden s history is one of attending requests made by the ATO for interviews  He has known that he and companies in the ACBF Group were the subject of increasing scrutiny by the ATO for some five years  He had ample opportunity  prior to the making of the amended assessments in January   to depart Australia permanently and to send his wealth abroad  One might reasonably apprehend that he could have adopted a like attitude to divorce proceedings here  There is no evidence that he did  For all of that time  he has held a British passport  Notwithstanding this  he has resisted the temptation either to  flee  there  to adapt the language of the ATO in the DPO submission  or to retire there  Instead  the only temptation to which he has succumbed is to retire to New Zealand  a country in which the recovery of Australian tax is readily possible   Further  in terms of assets against which recovery in respect of the liabilities noted in the schedule to the DPO might readily be possible  he has shares in the ACBF Group worth some  M  a luxury unit at Runaway Bay  by inference on the available evidence worth in the order of  M  and his residence in New Zealand notfollowedNeutral Bay Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ACLC   Mr Pattenden s submission seemed to be that  even assuming the three questions which  in light of Poletti s Case  fall to be answered in an appeal of this kind  were determined adversely to an appellant  the Court nonetheless retained a residual discretion to set aside the DPO having regard to the terms of s  X of the TAA  Section  X provides  Section  X   Orders of court on appeal A court hearing an appeal under section  V against the making of a departure prohibition order may  in its discretion       a  make an order setting aside the departure prohibition order  or   b  dismiss the appeal     Support by analogy for the submission was said to be found in the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Neutral Bay Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ACLC    In that case  the Court of Appeal had concluded  inter alia  that the existence of a  genuine dispute  as to the underlying tax liability may be taken into account as one factor in exercising the discretionary power to set aside a demand under para  b  of s  J  of the Corporations Act    Cth    In this fashion it was submitted that it was relevant  as a matter of discretion  to take into account the merits of the objections to the amended assessments   As it happens  I have answered two of the three questions described in Poletti s Case favourably to Mr Pattenden  I did not understand the Commissioner to submit that  if so  I retained a discretion to preserve the DPO  Nonetheless  some comment ought to be made about this further submission of Mr Pattenden consideredO Reilly v State Bank of Victoria

subordinate to exercise in the name of a Minister of State a statutory power conferred on the Minister need not be found in a formal instrument of authority but may permissibly be found in departmental practice  Woollett v Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries     QB   at   per Jenkins LJ and at   per Morris LJ  In this case the delegate has executed a formal instrument of authority  That instrument carefully delineates the extent to which particular subordinates are entitled to exercise delegated power in the name of the delegate  It is necessarily to be inferred that the instrument evidences a considered decision by a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation as to which subordinates  having regard to the knowledge and experience required to hold particular subordinate positions  ought responsibly to be given authority to make a particular type of decision in the name of that Deputy Commissioner  The instrument of authorisation gives a desirable certainty of authority to subordinates  as opposed to consigning such matters to informal practice and to the uncertainty of whether that practice would be regarded as acceptable having regard to the nature of the power and the level at which authority was exercised  The deliberate exclusion in the instrument of persons of lesser seniority than Mr Benson from having authority to decide on behalf of the delegate to issue a DPO tells against such persons possessing any authority by informal practice
