Pothuwila v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlaffirmedPothuwila v Minister for Immigration and Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  By a notice of appeal filed on   April   the appellant has attempted to appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in Pothuwila v Minister for Immigration and Anor   FMCA    The judgment was given on   March    The learned federal magistrate dismissed the appellant s application to the Federal Magistrates Court and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the first respondent to that proceeding  also the first respondent to this proceeding  the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   The history of the proceeding is as follows  The appellant made an application to the relevant department on   August   for a visa under the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   of the kind known as a Sri Lankan  Temporary   Class TT  visa  The reason for the application appears to have been that a previous visa that had been granted to the appellant had expired on   July    A delegate of the then relevant Minister refused to grant the visa  The appellant applied to the Migration Internal Review Office  which affirmed the delegate s decision   The letter by which the appellant was advised of this decision informed the appellant that he needed to make an application for review by the Immigration Review Tribunal within   days of the date of the letter  The time period was calculated on the basis of reg     of the Migration Regulations    Cth  which was later found to be an invalid regulation  It was also later held by this Court that a failure to give a notice complying with s   of the Migration Act   because of a failure to state accurately the time limit in which an application to review could be made  led to the conclusion that the obligation imposed by s   was never discharged and there was no valid notification of the decision  On this basis  in the absence of a statutory time limit  the application for review of the decision refusing a visa was revived many years later  when it came before the Migration Review Tribunal referred toJefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd and Others   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The federal magistrate then proceeded to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding  It seems clear that a judgment given on such a basis is an interlocutory judgment for the purposes of s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and that the leave of the Court or a judge is therefore required before an appeal can be brought from such a judgment  The relevant provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and the relevant principles are set out conveniently in the judgments of Rares and Gordon JJ in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd and Others   FCAFC       FCR   at       and     respectively   Accordingly  there seems little doubt that the appellant needed to have leave to appeal  He was so advised both by the Australian Government Solicitor  acting on behalf of the first respondent  and by the registry of the Court itself  but did not file any application for leave to appeal  By O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   such an application needed to be made within   days after the judgment was pronounced  subject to the fixing of any later date  Not only has the appellant not attempted to make any application for leave to appeal  he has not made any application for the fixing of a later date than that prescribed by O   r   by which he might do so   It was reported to me yesterday that the appellant s daughter came to the registry of the Court  handed over a bundle of material relating to the appellant s health  and informed the registry that the appellant would be unable to appear at the hearing of this proceeding today  The appellant certainly has not appeared in response to his name being called outside the courtroom  The material consists of a letter from the appellant  dated   August   to the registrar of this Court  and a number of attachments
