cth HCA  html  The test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction was most recently considered by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         ALJR    I refer to the observations of Gleeson CJ and Crennan J at       and Gummow and Hayne JJ at           Capital Steel submits that Orrcon has not established that there is a serious question to be tried that the steel pipe Capital Steel supplied under the contract was defective in the sense that it did not comply with the terms of the contract between it and Orrcon  If a serious question to be tried is not established in relation to that matter then  it is submitted by Capital Steel  Orrcon s case falls away  Further  or in the alternative  Capital Steel submits that Orrcon has not established that there is a serious question to be tried that relief would be granted restraining payment under the letter of credit  The focus of the argument here was that there was not a serious question to be tried that Capital Steel has been guilty of unconscionable conduct within s  AA of the TPA  Further  or in the alternative  Capital Steel submits that the balance of convenience favours refusing the interlocutory relief sought by Orrcon   Orrcon relied on evidence from Dr Graham Powell who is a research metallurgist  He has prepared a report dated July   and a supplementary report dated August    Orrcon also relied on evidence from Dr John Field who is a statistical consultant  He has prepared a report dated   August   and a supplementary report dated   August    Orrcon also relied on evidence from Mr Victor Konstantinoff who holds a Bachelor of Science degree and is the branch operations manager employed by ETRS Pty Ltd  ETRS  referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Court said that the above list may not be exhaustive  The Court made the point that unconscionable conduct within s  AA was not limited to cases where advantage was taken of a person under a special disability  At the same time the Court said that equity does not provide a remedy simply on the basis that  in the opinion of the judge  conduct is unfair  The section cannot be applied  to unconscionable conduct at large   at      The Court referred with approval to a passage in the earlier decision of French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR    In that case French J said  at      It  prohibits conduct in respect of which a judge in equity would have been prepared to grant relief  The imposition of the prohibition precedes any actual or notional judicial decision  The judge deciding a case under s  AA will be asking himself or herself whether he or she would have been prepared to grant relief at equity on the basis of an assessment of the conduct in question as unconscionable   It is not immediately apparent that the facts alleged by Orrcon fall within one of the five categories identified in Samton   In one sense one can say that it is unconscionable or unconscientious to enforce legal rights oppressively or in bad faith but on one view of the authorities the real question is whether there is oppression or bad faith because the circumstances fall within one of the well known cases in which equity will intervene on the ground that the conduct is unconscionable or unconscientious   Orrcon referred to three first instance decisions in support of its contention that the facts as pleaded by it arguably constitute unconscionable conduct within s  AA of the TPA referred toBoral Formwork and Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Action Makers Ltd  in administrative receivership    ATPR     In Boral Formwork and Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Action Makers Ltd  in administrative receivership    ATPR       Boral Formwork   Austin J considered whether an order should be made restraining a bank which had issued a letter of credit from paying any amount in excess of an undisputed amount to the beneficiary under the letter of credit  The parties seeking the order alleged that the beneficiary under the letter of credit had engaged in conduct that was unconscionable within s  AA of the TPA  Austin J noted that the principle of autonomy applicable to a standby letter of credit could not override the provisions of the TPA  He referred with approval to the observations of Batt J in Olex Focas   Austin J considered the significance of the beneficiary being insolvent when the call is made on an irrevocable instrument  He said  at      If the parties have agreed to protect the beneficiary from credit risk  there is unlikely to be anything unconscionable in the consequence that the beneficiary may  for the benefit of its creditors  call on the irrevocable instrument at the account party s expense  leaving the account party to claim in the beneficiary s insolvency if the dispute is resolved in its favour    A little later  his Honour said  at      I hope it is clear  that in deciding to grant the relief sought by Boral  I have given anxious consideration to the principle of autonomy and the dangers associated with any judicial intervention with the performance of unconditional commercial obligations  The terms of the irrevocable instrument and the underlying contract  properly construed  are highly relevant to the decision whether conduct in connection with those arrangements is unconscionable for statutory or equitable purposes  It is not normally unfair or unreasonable or otherwise unconscionable to exercise commercial rights under an autonomous commercial contract  even if  for example  for the purpose of applying pressure to resolve a dispute  Even if the conduct is unconscionable  the principle of autonomy is relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion to grant injunctive relief or leave the plaintiff to other remedies  Here the circumstances  involving as they do a call on the letter of credit on a false basis  are sufficiently special to overcome the hesitation which the principle of autonomy generates   Shortly after his Honour made these orders  the banks applied to have them set aside  Gilmour J refused to set aside the orders  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited  No     FCA    His Honour said  at      I remain satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether ONGC has acted unconscionably in contravention of s  AA of the Act in calling on or threatening to call on the performance guarantees despite there being no legal right on its part to do so  As Austin J said in Boral Formwork v Action Makers   ATPR     at   when referring relevantly to s  AA of the Act   the principle of autonomy applicable to a standby letter of credit  cannot override the statute   I am also satisfied that upon the same factual matrix  there is a serious issue to be tried whether ONGC is in breach

favourable  referred toClough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Clough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd   FCA     Gilmour J was concerned with an application for leave pursuant to O   of the Federal Court Rules to serve an application out of the jurisdiction and for orders to restrain Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  ONGC  from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew such demand in respect of certain performance guarantees granted by the three respondent banks to ONGC  The applicant  Clough Engineering Limited  sought a declaration that ONGC by demanding and threatening to make a demand on the performance guarantees granted by the banks had engaged in  or proposed to engage in  unconscionable conduct in contravention of s  AA of the TPA  Gilmour J granted leave to serve and he made an order restraining ONGC from taking any further step to demand or obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew a demand for payment from the banks under the performance guarantees  Gilmour J said that there was authority which clearly supported the proposition that an inappropriate threat to call or a call on performance guarantees can be unconscionable conduct within s  AA of the TPA and he referred to the decision in Samton   His Honour considered that it was appropriate to grant an injunction restraining ONGC from making a call on the performance guarantees and he appears to have relied on the fact that there was a serious question to be tried as to whether ONGC s conduct was unconscionable within s  AA of the TPA  He also relied on another exception to the autonomy principle  namely  breach of a negative stipulation referred toClough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Shortly after his Honour made these

if  sic  the negative stipulation conditioning the right to call up the performance guarantees  referred toCodelfa Construction Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is alleged by Orrcon that it was a term and condition of the contract that Capital Steel was not entitled to make a claim for payment under the letter of credit unless all of the pipe delivered complied with the specification and AS  in all respects  Orrcon alleges that such a term and condition arises as a matter of construction from the description and specification of the pipe to be delivered and the requirement that payment was not due unless the pipe was delivered  In the alternative  Orrcon alleges that such a term arises by implication and pleads the well known factors for the implication of a contractual term  see Codelfa Construction Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR     Codelfa     In December   and in accordance with the specification  a pre production meeting was convened at Dongbu s manufacturing plant in Korea for the purpose of reviewing the quality plan and manufacturing procedures to be followed during production of the pipe  The meeting was attended by representatives of Capital Steel  Dongbu and Orrcon  It is said that during the meeting the representatives of Orrcon were told of certain aspects of the manufacturing process which bore upon the minimum yield strength of the pipe and that Pohang Iron and Steel Company  otherwise referred to as  Posco  was to provide the raw material  hot rolled coil  There was discussion about the minimum yield strength of similar sized water pipes manufactured by Dongbu  There then followed communications between Capital Steel and Orrcon  and the upshot of those communications for present purposes was that Orrcon agreed to what it alleges were reduced minimum mechanical properties  the most important one of which was the proposed minimum for yield strength of the steel pipe of   MPa  aim   MPa   I note that Capital Steel asserts that a figure of   MPa was agreed  but it accepts that question is one for trial   On   December   Orrcon entered into a formal contract with the State of Queensland for the supply of pipe for the SEQ Water Grid Projects  It alleges that it did so relying on the November conduct and the representations at or about the time of the pre production meeting  Also relying on those matters it alleges that it instructed Westpac to issue an irrevocable import documentary credit number SD BM  in the amount of AUD  in favour of Capital Steel  That was done on   December   and the letter of credit was said to contain the following terms       Partial shipments were permitted      Credit was payable within   days from the bill of lading date      The latest date of shipment was   June        The date of expiry was   July             The documents required to be presented to Westpac were a full duplicate set of clean  on board  or  shipped  negotiable marine bill of lading to order blank endorsed marked  freight pre paid  and commercial invoices      The payment documents must be presented to Westpac within   days after issue of the transport document but within the validity of the letter of credit   Before leaving the issue of whether there is a serious question to be tried  I should mention that in the course of submissions Orrcon suggested that the breach of a negative stipulation exception to the autonomy principle may be relevant  Orrcon alleged in its statement of claim that it was a term and condition of the contract that Capital Steel was not entitled to make a claim for payment under the Westpac letter of credit unless all of the pipe delivered complied with the specification and AS  in all respects  The Westpac letter of credit refers only to AS  and that Australian Standard does not refer to the minimum yield strength alleged by Orrcon  I agree with the submission of Capital Steel that none of the documents which are alleged to form the steel contract contain the words pleaded and  accordingly  there is no express term to the effect alleged  Nor do I think it can be said that there is a serious question to be tried that there was an implied term to that effect  having regard to the factors referred to in Codelfa    There was also a suggestion in Orrcon s written submissions that the presentation of mill test certificates to Westpac was misleading or deceptive conduct and that a contravention of s   of the TPA may be sufficient to found interlocutory relief  That submission was not developed in any detail by Orrcon and it is difficult to see how it could succeed in light of the fact that  among other things  mill test certificates are not necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit   I will consider first the balance of convenience having regard to the interlocutory orders as sought in the application  I will then consider the balance of convenience having regard to the reformulated orders referred toLegione v Hateley   HCA         CLR  http www

rendered one side s situation more favourable  referred toUnited City Merchants  Investments  Limited v Royal Bank of Canada     AC   In United City Merchants  Investments  Limited v Royal Bank of Canada     AC   the plaintiffs sued the defendants under a letter of credit  Lord Diplock  with whom the other law Lords agreed  discussed the autonomy principle and the reasons for it  Although a lengthy passage  I set it out in full  Lord Diplock said  at        It is trite law that there are four autonomous though interconnected contractual relationships involved    The underlying contract for the sale of goods  to which the only parties are the buyer and the seller    the contract between the buyer and the issuing bank under which the latter agrees to issue the credit and either itself or through a confirming bank to notify the credit to the seller and to make payments to or to the order of the seller  or to pay  accept or negotiate bills of exchange drawn by the seller  against presentation of stipulated documents  and the buyer agrees to reimburse the issuing bank for payments made under the credit  For such reimbursement the stipulated documents  if they include a document of title such as a bill of lading  constitute a security available to the issuing bank    if payment is to be made through a confirming bank the contract between the issuing bank and the confirming bank authorising and requiring the latter to make such payments and to remit the stipulated documents to the issuing bank when they are received  the issuing bank in turn agreeing to reimburse the confirming bank for payments made under the credit    the contract between the confirming bank and the seller under which the confirming bank undertakes to pay to the seller  or to accept or negotiate without recourse to drawer bills of exchange drawn by him  up to the amount of the credit against presentation of the stipulated documents      Again  it is trite law that in contract   with which alone the instant appeal is directly concerned  the parties to it  the seller and the confirming bank   deal in documents and not in goods  as article   of the Uniform Customs puts it  If  on their face  the documents presented to the confirming bank by the seller conform with the requirements of the credit as notified to him by the confirming bank  that bank is under a contractual obligation to the seller to honour the credit  notwithstanding that the bank has knowledge that the seller at the time of presentation of the conforming documents is alleged by the buyer to have  and in fact has already  committed a breach of his contract with the buyer for the sale of the goods to which the documents appear on their face to relate  that would have entitled the buyer to treat the contract of sale as rescinded and to reject the goods and refuse to pay the seller the purchase price  The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods that does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non payment or reduction or deferment of payment   Lord Diplock said that there was one established exception to the general statement of principle as to the contractual obligations of the confirming bank to the seller and that was where the seller   for the purpose of drawing on the credit  fraudulently presents to the confirming bank s documents that contain  expressly or by implication  material representations of fact that to his knowledge are untrue   at    Capital Steel accepts that there are two other exceptions and they are breach of a negative stipulation and unconscionable conduct within s  AA of the TPA  That concession by Capital Steel appears to be correct having regard to the authorities   In view of Capital Steel s concession  the real issue in this case is whether Orrcon has established a serious question to be tried that Capital Steel has been guilty of unconscionable conduct   Orrcon submits that there was unconscionable conduct in this case because Capital Steel was purporting to exercise a legal right  namely  the right to claim payment under the letters of credit in circumstances in which the purported exercise of that right is harsh or oppressive or unreasonable and in bad faith
