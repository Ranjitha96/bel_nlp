Traxon Industries Pty Ltd ACN       v Emerson Electric Co  No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedTraxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Traxon Industries Pty Ltd  Traxon  applied to the Court by motion dated   April   for leave to serve proceedings on Emerson Electric Co  Emerson  in the United States of America  USA   The proceedings arose out of a dispute between Traxon and Emerson connected with the performance of a Confidentiality Agreement and a Distributorship Agreement relating to the marketing and sale  in the USA  of oil level control devices manufactured by Traxon  Traxon s causes of action against Emerson were for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  breach of contract  breach of duty of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty  For reasons published on   April   the motion was adjourned and Traxon given leave to amend its statement of claim and to file further affidavit evidence in support of its application Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co   FCA    The principal reason for the decision not to accede to Traxon s motion was its inclusion in the application and statement of claim of the causes of action arising out of breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty  These causes of action were based entirely on conduct allegedly committed by Emerson in the United States  They did not otherwise fall within any of the categories of causes of action to which the relevant rule of Court  O   authorising service out of the jurisdiction  applies   Traxon has now filed a proposed amended application and proposed amended statement of claim together with a proposed further amended application and further amended statement of claim  It has also filed additional affidavit material  In its proposed amended application and amended statement of claim Traxon seeks to join Traxon International Ltd  Traxon International  as a second applicant  It abandons the claim for breach of duty of confidence but maintains the claim based on breach of fiduciary duty  As an alternative position  it relies upon a further amended application and further amended statement of claim which would also omit the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty   For the reasons which I now publish  I am prepared to grant leave to serve an application and statement of claim on Emerson in the United States in the form set out in the further amended application and further amended statement of claim  So that Emerson may also be served with a reasonably self contained set of reasons for that decision these reasons repeat elements of those published on   April   adapted to take account of the amendments to the pleadings and the additional evidence which has been filed   Traxon  on   April   commenced proceedings in this Court against Emerson  It claimed damages for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act   at common law for breach of contract and  alternatively  in equity for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty  Traxon is an Australian company which carries on the business of manufacturing  marketing and selling oil level control devices  one of which is known as the TraxOil Management System  the TraxOil Device   Emerson is incorporated in Missouri and currently trades under the business name Emerson Climate Technologies  It used to trade as Alco Controls   By a notice of motion filed on   April   Traxon sought leave to serve its application  statement of claim and supporting affidavits on Emerson in the USA  Its motion was filed pursuant to O   of the Federal Court Rules  citedDelco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The cause of action in breach of fiduciary duty is based on conduct engaged in in the United States  Even though the duty pleaded depends upon conduct in Australia that does not mean that its breach by acts outside Australia give rise to a cause of action  arising in the Commonwealth  under O   r  a   As von Doussa J observed in Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers   FCA     the authorities establish that  cause of action  within the meaning of O   r  a  does not refer to all the elements of the cause of action  It refers rather to the act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff his cause for complaint  In Distillers Co  Biochemicals  v Thompson   AC   at   Lord Pearson said  at     It is not the right approach to say that  because there was no complete tort until the damage occurred  therefore the cause of action arose wherever the damage happened to occur  The right approach is  when the tort is complete  to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask the question  where in substance did this cause of action arise      Theory no  iii  is that the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction if the act on the part of the defendant  which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint has occurred within the jurisdiction  That is the rule laid down in Jackson v Spittal   LR  CP   which is an authoritative case  and the rule is inherently reasonable  as the defendant is called upon to answer for his wrong in the courts of the country where he did the wrong      Counsel for the applicants contends that the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty falls within O   r  ab ii   That is to say the proceeding  in so far as it seeks relief for breach of fiduciary duty is one which  otherwise affects a contract   In my respectful opinion that contention is unsustainable  While it may rightly be said that the fiduciary obligation  as pleaded  arises out of the asserted contractual relationship  the proceeding based upon breach of fiduciary duty does not of itself affect the contract  In my opinion  therefore  the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is not one to which O   r   applies   As I concluded in the reasons published on   April   the fact that the causes of action in misleading or deceptive conduct and breach of contract are within O   r   would be insufficient to satisfy the requirement that the rule  applies to the proceeding  within the meaning of O   r  b  for so long as the claim for breach of fiduciary duty is included  As von Doussa J said in Delco Australia  at      In this Court r  n  makes express provision for a proceeding where a proceeding does not fall squarely within one of the heads enumerated in the earlier paragraphs  In my opinion r  n  makes it clear that an originating process to be served out of the Commonwealth must be confined to causes of action that fall wholly within one or several of the heads in r    An originating process that includes a claim that does not fall within one or more of the heads is not an originating process that meets the description of r   in that it is not one  in  any of the cases described in the rule  It is not a  proceeding to which rule   applies  so as to meet the requirement of r  c b   A similar conclusion was expressed by Wilcox J in Tycoon Holdings Ltd v Tencor Jetco Inc     FCR   at     In the circumstances  because of the inclusion of the claim for breach of fiduciary duty  it is not possible to conclude that  the proceeding  reflected in the amended application and the amended statement of claim is one to which O   r   applies  However the minute of further amended statement of claim which is proposed would omit the claim for breach of fiduciary duty and  on that basis  would transform the action into a proceeding to which O   r   applies  I am therefore prepared to make an order for service on Emerson in the United States of America of an application and statement of claim in terms of the further amended application and further amended statement of claim filed on   May    A minute of proposed orders has been filed also to take account of that contingency  I will make orders in terms of the minute      I certify that
