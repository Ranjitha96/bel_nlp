Black   Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd  No     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedCelanese International Corp v BP Chemicals Ltd   RPC   Counsel also said that it was necessary to look at the business as a whole  to the extent it engaged in infringing activities  and not at separate product lines  The analysis  he said  should take into account GMCA s business activities which infringed both patents  The infringer is treated as if he conducted his business on behalf of the patentee  He relied on the decision of Laddie J in Celanese International Corp v BP Chemicals Ltd   RPC   and in particular a passage at   where his Lordship said  An account of profits is very different  from damages   Instead of looking to the harm inflicted on the plaintiff it considers the profit made by the infringer  The defendant is treated as if he conducted his business and made profits on behalf of the plaintiff  A number of consequences flow from this  One of them is that the maximum payment which can be ordered is the total profit made by the defendant  It may be that that figure far exceeds the damage suffered by the plaintiff as was pointed out in Colburn v  Simms   EngR         Hare    The hope of obtaining more is the normal reason why plaintiffs elect an account in those comparatively rare cases in which they do so  Furthermore there is only one profits  pot   If different plaintiffs seek accounts in respect of different infringing activities of a defendant within a single business  the totality of the profits ordered to be paid should not exceed the total profits made by the defendant in that business   Celanese involved an account of profits for infringement of a patent for an improved method for the manufacture of acetic acid with reduced iodide content  The infringer used the patented process in two separate factories  with profit in one but not the other  see at    The main dispute in the case was that the infringer argued for an  incremental  approach  ie the difference between the profits in fact made and the profits  if any  that would have been made if a non infringing process were used  at    The patentee argued for an  apportionment  approach in which all profits are recoverable  subject to apportionment of those profits between those to which the infringement contributes and the remainder  at       Laddie J  in a very detailed discussion of principle and authority  at     adopted the apportionment approach  His Lordship then discussed the application of the apportionment approach to the facts of the case  at       The facts in Celanese are quite different from the present case where no apportionment based on infringing and non infringing parts of T  or T  is claimed  The passage quoted at   above deals with the situation of different infringing activities within a single business  but only to make the points that the maximum payment is the total profit made and that if there are several plaintiffs they are limited to the one  pot  of profit  The present case does not raise such issues  What is relevant to the present case is a passage at   where Laddie J said  The general proposition that nothing is payable to the plaintiff if the defendant s business is loss making ignores the possibility of a case in which those loss making activities can realistically be treated as a sequence of separate and self contained businesses where profits made on one are obliterated by losses on others so that  looked at as a whole  the profits attributable to infringement are hidden  In such a case it may be possible to disentangle the profits made on the infringing business and order them to be paid to the plaintiff notwithstanding the losses made elsewhere  It was not suggested that any such analysis was possible on the facts of this case   The present case is a straightforward one and consistent with the hypothetical example discussed by Laddie J  GMCA made a profit on some infringements but a loss on others  It should disgorge the profits it made  It would be ironic in the extreme if GMCA could take the benefit of its own infringing conduct in respect of T  by setting off the losses made in such activity against the profits on the T  infringements which it is required to disgorge to Black   Decker distinguishedDart Industries Inc v The D cor Corporation Pty Ltd

Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   that was on a quite different point  namely the allowance of a proportion of overhead expenses  As has already been indicated  that is not an issue in the present case  A claim for a proportion of overhead expenses has been made by GMCA and accepted by Black   Decker appliedLeplastrier   Co Ltd v Armstrong Holland Ltd     SR  NSW    The point was specifically dealt with by Harvey CJ in Equity in Leplastrier   Co Ltd v Armstrong Holland Ltd     SR  NSW    at      The case concerned infringement of a patent for concrete mixing machines  His Honour said  Every sale of a machine gives the plaintiff a separate right to recover profits made on the sale of that machine  and the plaintiff has a right to require that he shall have details of the sale and cost of every individual machine  That is the enquiry that is directed  If the defendant has made a profit on some machines and a loss on others he cannot and this seems too clear for argument claim to be allowed the losses he has suffered on the sale of machines  What he has to account for is the profits on any machines on which he happens to have made a profit   In Leplastrier the losses the infringer sought to set off were made on sales of non infringing products  see at    However  for the reasons already stated  the present case seems stronger against allowing any set off   While Leplastrier was the
