Tristar Steering   Suspension Australia Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of NSW   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedRe Cortaus Limited  in liq  Sheahan v Joye   Ors  No        ACSR  Senior Counsel for Tristar relied on the decision of this Court  Branson J  in the case of Re Cortaus Limited  in liq  Sheahan v Joye   Ors  No        ACSR   in support of his submission that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of such relief  In that case  each of the first  fifth  sixth and seventh respondents had been issued with a summons pursuant to s  B of the Corporations Law    Cth  for examination relating to the affairs of a company in liquidation  Cortaus Limited  It was not in dispute that a final determination of the issues heard by a Full Court of this Court earlier in Southern Steel Supplies Pty Ltd   Anor v Favelle Favco Holdings Limited might result in a determination that this Court lacked jurisdiction to issue summons pursuant to s  B of the Corporations Law  Her Honour also noted that such final determination might also result in termination  to use her expression   a neutral term  of the appointment of Mr Sheahan as liquidator of Cortaus Limited  She observed that if Mr Sheahan s appointment as liquidator of Cortaus Limited were to be terminated  he would lose his qualification as an eligible applicant for the issue of a summons within the meaning of s  B of the Corporations Law  In response to a submission on behalf of these respondents that the principal prejudice to each was identified as that of being required to travel to Adelaide and there submit to questioning with respect to matters about which they could otherwise not be required to speak  and that the additional prejudice which  at least  some of the respondents would be likely to suffer was identified as interference with their respective professional practices and a measure of loss of income  her Honour responded at   in the following terms       If the respondents are required to attend for examination relating to Cortaus  and are so examined  and it is subsequently determined that this Court had no jurisdiction to issue the summonses respectively served upon them  their civil liberty to attend to their ordinary affairs without interference  and to keep to themselves information unless and until they choose to disclose it  will have been seriously interfered with  In my view  that case was very different from the situation here  The persons summonsed were all parties to the inter partes proceedings  They were required for examination  Here Tristar  a company  is merely required to produce documents  albeit under compulsion  Tristar cannot claim balance of convenience for the interruption caused to the daily lives of its employees  be they directors or members of the union or unions to which their unionised employees belong  It was different in Cortaus where the summonsed parties were parties to the proceeding itself  I am not persuaded in all the circumstances that the interlocutory relief in the form of the second alternative should be granted when to do so would only impede the ability of the Commission to efficiently conduct the Inquiry according to its terms of reference  The claim for interlocutory relief is refused citedRe Pacific Coal Pty Ltd  Ex parte Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSenior Counsel for the Minister submitted that  first  even if s   of the IR Act is invalid by reason of s   of the WPR Act  that did not render para  d  of the IR Act invalid so as to prevent the continuation of the Inquiry  Second  he submitted that the use of the Commission s powers to summons witnesses would not cause obligations to be binding upon Tristar or its employees  respectively qua employer and employee as defined in s   of the WPR Act  And third  he submitted that  moreover  the obligations that may be imposed under s   of the IR Act cannot be said to prescribe the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations  referring me to what had been said by Gaudron J in the High Court in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd  Ex parte Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union   HCA         CLR   at
