html  The parties proceeded on the basis that  as the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was determined summarily as an abuse of process  it is an interlocutory judgment  see Re Luck   HCA         ALJR   SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     MZWHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Rana v University of South Australia   FCA         FCR   at         SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA    The nature of the present application  being an application for leave to appeal  appears to recognise that position  see s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the FCA   By way of contrast  an appeal lies as of right from a final decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  see s  d  of the FCA   The respondent submitted that the applicant s application for leave to appeal was out of time as O   r  A b  allows seven days to file the application from the date judgment was pronounced  That Rule applies only where leave to appeal is sought from an interlocutory judgment of the Federal Court  The time for filing an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court is set out in O   r   which allows   days  Consequently  this application  if it is properly an application for leave to appeal  having been made on   October   was made in time   In my view  leave to appeal the Federal Magistrate s decision is not required as I think the decision of Raphael FM was a final decision   The differences stem from the application of two decisions of the High Court to the different circumstances of each case  Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   and Re Luck   HCA         ALJR    In SYWB   FCA   at     Lander J suggested that those two decisions may not sit readily together   In the more recent case of Re Luck   HCA       ALJR   at   the High Court  McHugh ACJ  Gummow and Heydon JJ  said     An order is an interlocutory order  therefore  when it stays or dismisses an action or refuses leave to commence or proceed with an action because the action is frivolous  vexations or an abuse of the process of the court or does not disclose a reasonable cause of action    The High Court was concerned with whether summary dismissal in that circumstance would finally determine the rights of the parties  In that case  Ms Luck had been refused leave to serve a writ and statement of claim that appeared to be an abuse of the process of the Court or a frivolous or vexatious proceeding  It was concluded that her rights had not been finally determined because she retained the right to issue proper proceedings appliedPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The differences stem from the application of two decisions of the High Court to the different circumstances of each case  Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   and Re Luck   HCA         ALJR    In SYWB   FCA   at     Lander J suggested that those two decisions may not sit readily together   But their Honours did not seek to qualify or explain what had earlier been said in Anshun   HCA       CLR   and the unequivocal statement at page   does not specifically refer to decisions such as in this case  where the applicant s application to review the decision of the RRT for the second time sought to go behind an already final judgment which had finally determined his rights   Anshun   HCA       CLR   recognises that different results flow  depending on the grounds on which a proceeding is deemed to be an abuse of process  At   Gibbs J said     There may well be a difference between a case in which the action is frivolous or vexatious in the ordinary sense  or in which the proceedings disclose no reasonable cause of action  and a case in which the abuse of process lies in an attempt to litigate an issue which is res judicata       The Court held in Anshun   HCA       CLR   that summary dismissal in the latter circumstances did finally determine the rights of the parties and so should be considered a final  rather than interlocutory  judgment   In this matter  the applicant seeks to challenge afresh a decision that he has already unsuccessfully challenged in the Federal Magistrates Court and in this Court  His application for special leave to appeal is still before the High Court  The decision of Raphael FM  that the fresh application was an abuse of process  was based upon the application of the principles in Anshun   HCA       CLR    In my view it was therefore a final judgment  I consider that it finally determined the applicant s rights  as he has now  subject to the present proceeding before this Court  no right to further challenge the RRT decision  except by pursuing his earlier application for special leave to appeal to the High Court   Accordingly  strictly speaking  in my view leave to appeal from the decision of Raphael FM was not necessary   In the result  my view on that issue does not matter  If leave to appeal were necessary  I would refuse it for the reasons set out below  If leave to appeal were not necessary  I would dismiss the appeal for the same reasons
