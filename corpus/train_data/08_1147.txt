circumstances in which the orders were made  on   July   the unusual course of permitting cross examination was again raised with Counsel for the Applicants and  more relevantly  Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis  Reference was made to the observations of Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold   HCA         CLR    Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis requested  and was granted  a short adjournment to obtain further instructions in light of reference being made to the unusual course being pursued  The cross examination thereafter continued without any submissions being advanced on his behalf  As events unfolded  it was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent  As a result of the cross examination  the Applicants were proved right  An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents  without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery  may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided   At least two observations need to be made   First  some evidence given during cross examination was that documents had been destroyed  As explained by Mr Kiriakidis  the destruction of documents occurred by reason of either    such records as had been kept by Mr Kiriakidis being stored in boxes in a room behind a caf  where he was then residing  and being thrown out when he was in Greece for a period of six months from July   to January    The owner of the premises was said to have thrown out the boxes when Mr Kiriakidis did not return after what was expected to be only a three month visit  and     such other records as may have been maintained being routinely destroyed by employees  upon instructions  at the conclusion of every two week period  Mr Kiriakidis explained his concern as to whether or not the business was illegal and that he did not want records being maintained in such circumstances  Whether or not there was a basis for those concerns was not an issue pursued by Counsel for the Fourth Respondent during his cross examination  It is a matter  however  which it is expected will emerge as an issue to be resolved at the final hearing followedSeven Network Ltd v News Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A fourth matter was sought to be raised by way of a Notice of Motion filed by the Fifth Respondent on   July   seeking to set aside part of a Notice to Produce served by the Applicants upon the Fifth Respondent  Documents pursuant to that Notice to Produce were produced on   July    When such documents as were produced were made available  neither the Court nor the Applicants were told that there were additional documents which  it was later said  also fell within the terms of one of the Subpoenas presently sought to be set aside by the Fifth Respondent and that those documents were being withheld  A notice to produce has the same coercive effect as a subpoena  Federal Court Rules   O   r   Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd  No     FCA   at   per Sackville J  The procedure to be followed when there is a   call   upon a notice to produce has been long settled  Glass H  ed  Seminars on Evidence   at      If documents which fall within a notice are not produced  it is incumbent upon those who have been served with such a notice to unequivocally identify those documents and the reason for their non production   All other outstanding Motions in the proceeding are to be heard on   August    The First Respondent s Notice of Motion filed   July   can also be heard on that date  The intent in resolving all outstanding interlocutory matters as quickly as possible is self evidently to facilitate a final hearing at the earliest possible date  This proceeding has already taken far longer to resolve than is desirable    or necessary  given the issues in dispute  It is hoped that on   August   dates for the final hearing can be fixed for later this year   The relevant orders as to costs against the First  Second and Fourth Respondents as made on   April   were as follows     The First  Second and Fourth Respondents are to file and serve any Affidavit and submissions as to why an order for the payment of the Applicants  costs to date on an indemnity basis payable forthwith should not be made for any particular period from the commencement of this proceeding to date  by  pm on   April       If the First  Second and Fourth Respondents do not file and serve an Affidavit

followedSony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Dannoun  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The discretion in respect to costs conferred by s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  unquestionably extends to a power to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis  In Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Dannoun  No     FCA     Lindgren J helpfully summarised the approach to be adopted in ordering indemnity costs as follows    The question of the circumstances in which costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis has been discussed in many cases  recently in this Court by me in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd  No     FCA   and by Katz J in Waverley Council v Refkin Pty Ltd   FCA    I will not refer to the various judicial formulations to date of the grounds on which it is proper to award costs on an indemnity basis  It suffices that I acknowledge that the circumstances must be  special  must take the case out of the  ordinary  category of case  and must involve behaviour associated with the conduct of the proceeding by the person sought to be made liable which is so unreasonable as to make it unjust that the other party should be limited in its recovery to party and party costs   Notwithstanding the manner in which the proceeding has been conducted to date  the four factors relied upon by the First  Second and Fourth Respondents to oppose an order for costs on an indemnity basis are   a  the fact that those Respondents have made   significant admissions   being admissions in respect to matters previously denied in their Defence but later admitted   consequent on service of evidence by the Applicants    b  the conduct of those Respondents in respect to discovery  including the fact that their very consent to the order for cross examination of the Fourth Respondent is a tacit acknowledgment on their part that the deficiencies therein are sufficient to justify the unusual exercise of the Court s power to permit cross examination on Affidavits filed in respect to discovery   c  a contention that such delay as has occurred is   not all     attributable to the Respondents   and    d  a contention that a number of the Affidavits as filed by the Applicants   go predominately  sic  to the assessment of damages   and therefore would have been filed in any event   A review of the materials as filed discloses that the First  Second and Fourth Respondents initially put in issue all aspects of the Applicants  case  They thus disputed  for example  whether the films in issue were   cinematograph film  s  and the subsistence of copyright in those films and ownership of copyright  These matters were the subject of some admissions on   August   but it was only on   April   that orders for declaratory and injunctive relief were made by consent followedSpencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd     NSWLR   A like comment may be made in respect to paragraphs     and   of the

au cases cth FCA  html  In Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association  No     FCA   Bennett J summarised the principles to be applied when considering an application that costs be paid forthwith  Her Honour observed        the following principles emerge    The general principle is that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded and the rights of the parties have been finally determined  However  O   rule   contemplates that  in certain circumstances  the general principle can be varied  as a matter of the court s discretion    The exercise of the discretion should only be exercised where the interests of justice in the particular case require a departure form the general practice    The discretion should be exercised in favour or  sic  a party who establishes that the demands of justice require that there be a departure from what appears to be the general practice envisaged by the rule    One consideration is the length of time that the proceedings will conclude  in the ordinary course of events    Where costs are sought in respect of a successful strike out application  the fact that the unsuccessful party failed to remedy defects despite clear notice of those defects  may make appropriate immediate taxation and payment    Costs incurred by reason of an ill considered pleading may give rise to an exception to the principle that the costs await the final resolution of the issues between the parties    In ordinary circumstances  it would be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately  since that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding   The making of declaratory and injunctive orders on   April   unquestionably brought that aspect of the claims for relief as against those Respondents to an end  Left to be resolved was a determination of damages followedTrade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd     ALR   When
