Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v FKP Limited   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd  in liq   No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There is no general rule that parties having knowledge of a prior contract between different parties may not subsequently enter into a contract with fundamentally inconsistent terms  As I explained in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd  in liq   No     FCA   at         the lack of any such rule is the inevitable consequence of the efficient breach theory of contract  which  although it has occasionally been criticised  remains the controlling theory of contract damages under Australian law  Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR   at    citedButt v M Donald     QLJ   The respondents admit they breached an implied term of the Offer Letter  namely that the respondents would not seek to prevent performance of the Offer Letter or withhold its benefits  Butt v M Donald     QLJ       cited and referred to in Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investment Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR       Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL   VSCA   and CGU Workers Compensation  NSW  Ltd v Garcia     NSWLR    The event which the respondents said gave rise to the breach was the execution of the Woolworths  Letter of Offer on   March    However  despite the generous admission of the respondents  I cannot accept that execution of the   March   letter constituted a breach of the Butt v M Donald term   As noted earlier  there is no obligation in contract not to enter a later agreement containing terms inconsistent with a prior contract  Butt v M Donald does not hold otherwise because it states only that a party will be in breach if it withholds benefits or frustrates the performance of another  In other words  the implied term will be breached only when the party does something that    positively impairs or frustrates another party s ability to perform its obligations  or   actually deprives  not just possibly will deprive  the other of a contractual benefit  Entering into an inconsistent contract such as the Woolworths  deal here in itself does neither where  as here  the party subjecting itself to the conflicting obligations is still free to choose which it will perform  confer the benefit  and the date for performance has not yet come due  For example  the respondents could have changed their minds on   March   and decided that it would be better to give the lease to Coles and instead breach their agreement with Woolworths  Then they could have changed their minds again on   March   and so on  Thus  there was no breach on   March of which I can be independently satisfied  notwithstanding the respondents  admission   For its part  Coles submitted that the respondents breached the Offer Letter on   March    see     above  when they informed Coles that they had ceased negotiations but that that breach  was the intended culmination and inevitable consequence of earlier breaches of terms of the Offer Letter    namely       clause   which obliged FKP to enter into an AFL     an implied obligation to act in good faith to do all things necessary to grant Coles a lease  the good faith breach     the clause of the Offer Letter which obliged FKP to keep the terms of the Offer Letter confidential   Whether an implied obligation of good faith independently exists and to what extent it might differ from the Butt v M Donald term are complicated and hotly debated issues in contract law  Moreover  it would not be a simple matter to determine the extent of the respondents  obligation under cl   to negotiate and accept an AFL and Lease   Indeed  that is always a problem in Masters v Cameron heads of agreement type cases where later negotiations break down   For example  at what point could Coles throw its hands up and say that the respondents were unreasonably refusing to negotiate or accept an AFL or Lease such that the default terms ought to apply  Fortunately  it is not necessary to resolve the issues between the parties by reference to the admitted Butt v M Donald breach or the first two breaches alleged by Coles because I am satisfied on the evidence that more straightforward breaches exist  First  the evidence that the respondents did not and could not obtain the necessary development approvals by   October   necessarily implies that those approvals were not obtained by the   March   date specified in the Offer Letter  Accordingly  I find that the respondents breached cl  b  on   March     Secondly  the respondents breached the confidentiality clause of the Offer Letter on   February    At the end of the Offer Letter  a clause headed  Confidentiality  provided  in part  as follows      The terms and conditions of this offer are strictly confidential   Confidential Information    The Lessor must             i  not disclose any of the Confidential Information to any person  firm or body corporate     ii  not directly or indirectly use  reproduce or deal with the Confidential Information for any purpose without the prior written consent of the Lessee  except on a confidential basis to professional consultants of the Lessor                   In any case  where the Lessor must obtain the Lessee s prior written consent  the Lessee is entitled to withhold the giving of its consent for any reason in its discretion  or to give its consent subject to such conditions as the Lessee imposed in its discretion   The respondents admit that they breached this clause when  on   February   they disclosed to Woolworths terms of the offer that Coles had agreed   to enter into a   year lease with an option to take a lease for two further   year terms  cll   and     to pay a percentage at   of annual gross sales  excluding GST  in excess of    cl  b  and   to participate in base rent reviews every five years during the term and options to the average of total base and percentage rents payable in the preceding three years  cl  d   That they would admit this is not surprising because during the course of the trial Mr McCoy gave evidence during cross examination  corroborated by certain of his emails which were tendered as exhibits  that he did in fact disclose this information to a representative of Woolworths on or about   February   citedCarminco Gold   Resources Ltd v Findlay   Co Stockbrokers  Underwriters  Pty Ltd     ALR   My present view is that the proper party to the Offer Letter  objectively considered  was and remains Lifestyle  primarily because it is the owner of the Tarneit Property and thus the only party directly capable of conveying a leasehold interest in the property to Coles  see Carminco Gold   Resources Ltd v Findlay   Co Stockbrokers  Underwriters  Pty Ltd     ALR   at    stating that the identity of the parties is a  simple question as to who  objectively considered  were intended to be the parties to the contract   Another reason for this view is that the negotiations resulting in the Offer Letter were carried over from a period when FKP was not even in the picture  ie when Lifestyle was still Wilbow and was not owned by FKP  objectively suggesting that for Coles it was never a question of doing a deal with FKP but was rather a question of doing a deal with the owner of the Tarneit Property  whoever that was   There is of course room to take the opposing view  For example  cl  b  of the Offer Letter permits Coles to terminate the agreement if the  Lessor  does not own all of the land comprising the Centre by   March    From this  one might reasonably infer that the parties contemplated that  whether or not FKP at the time of the execution of the Offer Letter owned the land  it was taking steps to purchase or otherwise acquire that land  whether from Lifestyle or otherwise   No doubt if it were Coles on the other side of the proceeding  Coles would claim that FKP was the lessor  FKP did not own all the land by the specified date and therefore it was entitled to terminate   Ultimately  this issue is not one to which I have given extended consideration for several reasons  For one thing  the respective positions of each side on this issue were never properly developed or addressed in oral submissions  For another  the issue seems like one that the parties ought to be able to come to some kind of agreement about  especially because it is not clear that the question has any practical significance in light of these facts and circumstances  ie where Coles is the complaining party   FKP is the   owner of Lifestyle and there does not seem to be any concern that one FKP entity or the other is lacking in resources  regardless of which entity might be made the subject of an order to pay a money judgment  Even if there is an order for specific performance compelling the respondents to grant a lease  which Coles seeks  Lifestyle would not necessarily have to be the party against whom it was directed  it could be crafted as an order directing FKP to cause Lifestyle  as its wholly owned subsidiary and owner of the property  to grant a lease   I reject those contentions  As the history of the negotiations records  it was just that  negotiations  No concluded AFL or Lease was ever prepared or executed  Moreover  there was also no informal agreement  whether by   January   or otherwise  evidenced by the chain of drafts in respect of major points objectively demonstrating a present intent of the parties to be bound so as to fall within the so called fourth category of

Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Finally  I am of the view that when the respondents informed Coles on   March    see     above  that they were ceasing negotiations with it  that conduct constituted anticipatory breach of the Offer Letter which  in the circumstances which followed  was also a repudiation of that contract  DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    The relevant circumstances include the fact that the respondents refused to sign the eleventh draft of the AFL sent by Coles to FKP on   June   which by then included the resolution of the three outstanding issues in the manner proposed by FKP on   January    see     above  which had initially been rejected by Coles  If that were not enough  by the time these proceedings were commenced in July   it was clear from the manner in which the respondents have defended these proceedings that they have not and do not intend to further perform the Offer Letter  however construed  see DTR Nominees   CLR at     I should note that my review of the Offer Letter in light of the evidence suggests that the respondents probably committed additional breaches of it  For example  cl   of the Offer Letter required the respondents to retain ownership of the premises at least until the Lease was executed  The clause also stated that the Lessor would be liable for  loss  expense or damage  caused by disposal of all or part of its interest in the Centre prior to execution of the Lease  If the respondents conveyed a leasehold interest over the Tarneit Property to Woolworths  there was no evidence of an executed or registered Lease between Woolworths and the respondents  only a letter of offer and an admission of an executed AFL  it would appear to be a breach of cl    However  as this and other potential additional breaches were neither pleaded nor squarely raised by the evidence or submissions  I will not address them further

addressed in subsequent proceedings  With respect to the third breach  the anticipatory breach  for example  there is a question as to whether a plaintiff s election to hold the party to the agreement

example Concrete Constructions Group v Litevale Pty Ltd     FLR   Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR   Mander Forklift Pty Ltd v Dairy Farmers Co operative   ATPR  Digest        In Futuretronics at   Ormiston J  expressed  his  doubts whether a contractual promise of itself carries with it any representation as to fact or conduct  actionable by reason of s  A  His Honour explained the issue  at     in the following terms      It is hard to believe that normally any promisee with ordinary contractual rights would     describe himself as having been deceived or misled  based on the mere acceptance of a promise    It is only when it becomes apparent that the promise cannot be enforced  because  for example  it is either unenforceable or the promisee s rights are valueless or diminished  that one may return to the original promise to inquire whether that promise was of so little substance that it can be concluded that the promisee was indeed misled or deceived in the first place  at the time of his acceptance of the promise  Thus it may then be seen that the promisor originally had no intention to perform his promise or that he originally had no capacity or ability to perform it                 It would seem on the authorities that  at the least  a contractual promise would amount to an implied representation that the promisor then had an intention to carry out that promise  If it can be shown that he had no such intention  he would be guilty of misleading or deceptive conduct  Likewise it would seem that such a representation connotes a present ability to fulfil that promise which  if shown to be untrue at the time of making  would likewise characterise the implied representation as misleading or deceptive   As this passage reveals  an express contractual promise or representation will constitute an actionable implied representation under s   of the TPA only if the party making the promise or representation had no intention or capability of carrying it out at the time it was made  ie the promisor had no reasonable grounds for making the promise   The questions which then arise are   what is the contractual promise in this case and   did the respondents have the intention and ability to carry it out at the time it was made  In the present case  the specific promise relied on by Coles is the promise to grant a lease  It cannot be doubted that  on the evidence before the Court  the respondents had both the ability and intent to fulfil that promise at the time it was made  More broadly  the respondents admit that they impliedly represented to Coles that they would perform all obligations under the Offer Letter including an obligation to execute an AFL  Despite extensive cross examination of the respondents  witnesses  Coles failed to establish that the respondents did not have such an intention or capability at the time the representations were made and at all times prior to   February   when Lifestyle commenced negotiations with Woolworths to lease part of the Tarneit property to Woolworths  In my view  the evidence establishes that the respondents had reasonable grounds for making representations and promises of the kind contained in the Offer Letter and thus those representations and promises were not misleading or deceptive within the meaning of ss  A and   of the TPA   The question which then arises is whether the respondents  conduct in the period from   February   to   March   said to constitute representations by silence and implication  was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Coles  The answer to that question is no as well citedGolden Sands Pty Ltd v Excel Quarries Pty Ltd   VSC  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VICSC  html  This view has been consistently followed over the years  most recently in Golden Sands Pty Ltd v Excel Quarries Pty Ltd   VSC   at   n    Again  however  even if it were not a matter of settled authority  I would apply such a rule as a matter of logic and basic principle  As a matter of basic contract law  a term will not be implied except in very limited circumstances  primarily where it is obvious  reasonable and necessary to make the contract work  Golden Sands at   and authorities there cited  In this case  Coles  alleged representation by silence and implication effectively amounts to a claim that there was an implied term of exclusivity   that is  that the respondents would negotiate exclusively with Coles   in circumstances where such a term could not be implied under contract law because it is not necessary to make the contract work  Thus not only would the rule that s   imposes a duty to advise as to the subjective interpretation of the contract destroy objective contract theory  it would also provide a means around the limitations on the implication of terms under the law of contract   So radical a position cannot be accepted  In my view  the failure of the respondents to disclose their subjective view that the Offer Letter  or a particular clause therein  was not binding  that they would not adhere to a particular interpretation of a clause  or that they considered themselves free to take on or pursue agreements containing obligations inconsistent with those arising under the Offer Letter is not actionable under s   of the TPA   Further  I should note that even if  contrary to the view I have formed  the representations alleged by Coles were actionable under s     there would be a real question as to whether Coles is entitled to any relief over and above what it might get in contract  given that Coles seeks only damages under s   of the TPA citedHospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
