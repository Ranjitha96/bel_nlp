Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Court finds that there is no scope for the application of the doctrine of legitimate expectation as claimed since the obligations of Australia concerning extradition are wholly contained in the Extradition Act   There has been no claim of ambiguity in the provisions of the Extradition Act and the decision of the Minister made pursuant to it is not the subject of challenge by the applicant  Further there is no decision in respect of which a writ of prohibition could issue  To obtain a grant of injunctive relief the applicant must show the existence of a legal or equitable right  the protection of which the grant of such relief could ensure  see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     No such rights exist  For the reasons provided above  the applicant has no basis for relief   It follows that the proceedings must be dismissed   I certify that the preceding thirty five   numbered

scheme were described in Harris v Attorney General of the Commonwealth     FCR   at   which was referred to by the Full Court in Rivera   FCAFC    For convenience  the Court will restate the process as quoted from Harris   FCR   by the Full Court as follows    The Act contemplates four stages in extradition proceedings as follows    Commencement    Remand    Determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender    Executive determination that the person is to be surrendered  In summary form  the scheme is as follows  The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s   or by the giving of a notice under s    Once arrested  the person is required by s   to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s    Where a person is on remand under s   and the Attorney General has given a notice under s   provision is made under s   for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender  If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate  provision is made by s   for the Attorney General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered followedMinister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant submits that Australia s ratification of the Torture Convention also provides the foundation for a legitimate expectation that Australia s Convention obligations would prevail over the Minister s decision to execute the surrender warrant  In support of such submission the applicant relies upon the decision of the High Court of Australia in Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR   especially the observations of Mason CJ and Deane J at     where there Honours said    Junior counsel for the appellant contended that a convention ratified by Australia but not incorporated into our law could never give rise to a legitimate expectation  No persuasive reason was offered to support this far reaching proposition  The fact that the provisions of the Convention do not form part of our law is a less than compelling reason legitimate expectations are not equated to rules or principles of law  Moreover  ratification by Australia of an international convention is not to be dismissed as a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act   particularly when the instrument evidences internationally accepted standards to be applied by courts and administrative authorities in dealing with basic human rights affecting the family and children  Rather  ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention  That positive statement is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation  absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary  that administrative decision makers will act in conformity with the Convention   and treat the best interests of the children as  a primary consideration   It is not necessary that a person seeking to set up such a legitimate expectation should be aware of the Convention or should personally entertain the expectation  it is enough that the expectation is reasonable in the sense that there are adequate materials to support it   Relying upon such extract  the applicant submits that Australia s obligations to act in accordance with the provisions of the Torture Convention are embodied in domestic law  Further  those obligations must be given full effect since Australia is a party to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties  the Vienna Convention  and pursuant to Article   of the Vienna Convention Australia is bound to give effect to the Torture Convention  Article   provides    The invalidity  termination or denunciation of a treaty  the withdrawal of a party from it  or the suspension of its operation  as a result of the application of the present Convention or of the provisions of the treaty  shall not in any way impair the duty of any State to fulfil any obligation embodied in the treaty to which it would be subject under international law independently of the treaty   Article   thereof reinforces the above obligation and provides    Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith   The statements contained in Teoh   HCA       CLR   relied upon by the applicant do not assist him in the present proceedings  The ratification of an international convention gives rise to a legitimate expectation that   the executive government and its agencies  will act in conformity with the terms of such convention  absent   statutory or executive indications to the contrary    see Teoh   CLR    There is no scope for argument that the Minister has not acted in conformity with the provisions of the Torture Convention by ignoring the possibility of torture on return  since provisions to safeguard such consequence have been enacted in domestic legislation by s  b  of the Extradition Act   The Minister is bound to follow the provisions of the Extradition Act   which he did  and as such there is no basis upon which the claimed breach of procedural fairness brought about by a legitimate expectation of conformity with the Torture Convention could arise   The affidavit of Ms Kristy Lee Alexander  solicitor for the Minister  sworn on   August   filed in the High Court in support of an application for expedition of the applicant s application for special leave  states the action proposed to be taken by the Minister once the applicant s application for special leave to the High Court had been determined  However  such action did not involve the making of any further decision by the Minister as the implementation of the extradition process had been invoked by the decision made under s   of the Extradition Act   Rather the affidavit simply described the steps which would be taken to complete the extradition  No obligation existed upon the Minister to inform the applicant of such procedures   By letter dated   April   to the UN the applicant requested that he be provided with some documentation which he might use at the hearing before the Full Federal Court on   May   for the purposes of his appeal  The letter asserts that racial segregation is a form of torture  and after seeking information upon the question whether racial segregation in prisons in California constitute  torture  within the Convention definition the letter states    As I understand it  the Committee only meets twice a year to determine filed communications  I appreciate that this process may be lengthy  However  my appeal will be heard on   May    I kindly ask if your office could provide me with something tangible to put before the Australian court that would show the Committee s provisional view on my prospects of success involving the outcome of this communication consideredNagaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant further submits that between April   and September   the Minister did not give any indication that he would execute the surrender warrant without first providing the applicant the opportunity of having his communication determined by the UN Committee  Had he had such opportunity  the applicant says he would have sought the application of interim measures which were referred to in the UN letter detailed above  The applicant claims that by implication Australia s obligations would require it to abide by the provisions of Article   of the Torture Convention  In support of such submission the applicant relies upon Nagaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   where Lee and Katz JJ referred to Australia s ratification of the Torture Convention and particularly to Australia s obligation under Article   of the Torture Convention  The applicant also relies upon the inaction of the Minister in failing to avail itself of the opportunity to move to strike out the applicant s present application before this Court upon the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action   Additionally  the applicant submits that he was not able to lodge his communication with the UN Committee prior to the Minister s s   decision because  by virtue of Article  b  of the Torture Convention  the UN Committee would not consider any communication from an individual until the individual has exhausted all available domestic avenues of review  The applicant says that the torture he suffered in California at the hands of the police before he left the US  satisfies the definition of torture  in Article   of the Torture Convention which includes  any act by which severe pain or suffering  whether physical or mental  is intentionally inflicted on a person     Significantly  the applicant has emphasised that he does not challenge the Minister s decision to issue the surrender warrant under s   of the Extradition Act   If such decision is not challenged  the question remains whether there is another decision made by the Minister in respect of which the relief sought can be granted   The decision of the Full Federal Court in Nagaratnam   FCA       FCR   is not authority for the proposition argued by the applicant  namely that Australia has an obligation to allow the UN Committee to determine communications such as that made by the applicant prior to the execution of a surrender warrant  Whilst reference was made in that decision to Article   of the Torture Convention  no reference was made to the statutory requirement provided in s  b  of the Extradition Act   Even if Australia were in breach of its international obligations under Article   of the Torture Convention  this is a separate issue which does not impact upon the rights of the applicant which are governed solely by Australian domestic legislation referred toPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd       CLR   The Minister submits that the applicant is estopped from now seeking to raise his communication to the UN Committee by the doctrine of res judicata  since it was not raised before Moore J as a ground to challenge the Minister s decision  and relies upon Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and   and Wong v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at         The applicant submits that he could not have lodged his communication with the UN prior to the delivery of his Honour s judgment  since he was required by Article  b  of the Torture Convention to first  exhaust all available domestic remedies   referred toRivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  On   August   the Minister made the surrender determination pursuant to s   of Extradition Act  the surrender decision   By application filed on   September   pursuant to s  B of the Judiciary Act   the applicant applied to this Court in relation to the surrender decision  Moore J dismissed the application on   December   see Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA    The applicant appealed from the decision of Moore J to the Full Court of this Court  Such appeal was dismissed on   August   see Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC     The stages in the legislative extradition scheme were described in Harris v Attorney General of the Commonwealth     FCR   at   which was referred to by the Full Court in Rivera   FCAFC    For convenience  the Court will restate the process as quoted from Harris   FCR   by the Full Court as follows    The Act contemplates four stages in extradition proceedings as follows    Commencement    Remand    Determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender    Executive determination that the person is to be surrendered  In summary form  the scheme is as follows  The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s   or by the giving of a notice under s    Once arrested  the person is required by s   to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s    Where a person is on remand under s   and the Attorney General has given a notice under s   provision is made under s   for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender  If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate  provision is made by s   for the Attorney General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered referred toRivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   August   the Minister made the surrender determination pursuant to s   of Extradition Act  the surrender decision   By application filed on   September   pursuant to s  B of the Judiciary Act   the applicant applied to this Court in relation to the surrender decision  Moore J dismissed the application on   December   see Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA    The applicant appealed from the decision of Moore J to the Full Court of this Court  Such appeal was dismissed on   August   see Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC     The applicant submitted that the decision which he was challenging was not the surrender decision under s   of the Extradition Act which had already been the subject of challenge before Moore J  the Full Federal Court and the High Court  Rather  his challenge is made to the Minister s decision to proceed to execute the surrender warrant before the applicant s communication with the UN Committee has been determined and while the applicant s ongoing litigation remains unresolved   The applicant submitted that Article   of the Torture Convention entitles him to remain in Australia pending the determination of the UN  Article   provides       No State Party shall expel  return  refouler  or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture       For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds  the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including  where applicable  the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross  flagrant or mass violations of human rights   The applicant also relies upon Article   of the Torture Convention which provides      A State Party to this Convention may at any time declare under this article that it recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of individuals subject to its jurisdiction who claim to be victims of a violation by a State Party of the provisions of the Convention  No communication shall be received by the Committee if it concerns a State Party which has not made such a declaration   and Article  b  of the Torture Convention which provides that the committee shall not consider a communication from a person unless it is satisfied that    The individual has exhausted all available domestic remedies  this shall not be the rule where the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or is unlikely to bring effective relief to the person who is the victim of the violation of this Convention consideredVasiljkovic v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   The applicant submits that Chapter III of the Australian Constitution provides a foundation for his legitimate expectation that he would be permitted to conduct outstanding litigation before the execution of the surrender warrant  He relies upon the dissenting judgment of Kirby J in Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth of Australia and Others     CLR   especially at     and submits that the act of the Executive arm of government in executing the warrant for surrender interferes with the role of the Judiciary  The applicant further submits that it is immaterial to his legitimate expectation arising under Chapter III of the Constitution that his communication to the UN Committee was made subsequent to the surrender decision   Whilst the applicant relied upon the observations of Kirby J in Vasiljkovic   CLR   it is clear that his Honour s observations that the Judiciary prevails over the Executive in extradition matters were pivotal to his dissenting judgment  The majority in the High Court held that Part II of the Extradition Act  which incorporates ss   to   inclusive  is a valid exercise of the power of the Commonwealth distinguishedWong v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Minister submits that the applicant is estopped from now seeking to raise his communication to the UN Committee by the doctrine of res judicata  since it was not raised before Moore J as a ground to challenge the Minister s decision  and relies upon Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and   and Wong v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at         The applicant submits that he could not have lodged his communication with the UN prior to the delivery of his Honour s judgment  since he was required by Article  b  of the Torture Convention to first  exhaust all available domestic remedies     Since the hearing and delivery of Moore J s decision occurred prior to the applicant making his communication to the UN Committee  the issue could not properly belong  to the subject of the earlier litigation and which the parties  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier litigation    as referred to in Wong   FCAFC       FCR    Accordingly  the doctrine of issue estoppel and res judicata does not apply in relation to the issue of the applicant s communication to the UN before the Full Court hearing the appeal from Moore J s decision  The Court considers that the applicant is not estopped from raising such issue in this application
