Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor     ALR   PCR has submitted that it is not the true  aggressor  in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor     ALR     Amalgamated Mining    In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman s solicitors alleging that Warman s copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining s supplier were unjustified  In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs  Wilcox J said  at        If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ  in Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co and Ors     KB   of asking who  in the litigation  was the attacker and who was the defender  I think it must be said that the first attack came in the letter from  Warman s solicitors    Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining  it is that company which has an interest in defending and  in a commercial sense  probably has very little alternative other than to take that course  I think that it is an accurate analysis of the matter to say  therefore  that it is the respondents to the principal proceeding who are the attackers and that Amalgamated Mining is  in substance  the defender    His Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Willey v Synan   HCA         CLR     I consider the facts of the present case to be different from those in Amalgamated Mining and Willey v Synan   Those were both cases in which proceedings had been instigated to forestall a threat by a respondent to existing entitlements of the applicant  In these proceedings the respondents have not threatened existing rights of PCR  PCR does not have any specific entitlement to the licence  Although it is true that the decision of ACMA has led to PCR being unable to operate its radio station  PCR only ever held a temporary licence and never had an ongoing right to operate  It cannot be said that the action of either respondent deprived  or threatened to deprive  PCR of its rights such that it was forced to bring these proceedings to protect itself  Accordingly I do not consider that PCR can reasonably be construed as   the party attacked   in these proceedings  or that either of the respondents can be considered as the true attacker   PCR also submits that GCB is joined only as an interested party  and not as an  adversary  to PCR  PCR refers to the fact that no relief is sought against GCB specifically  and says that GCB was only joined in the present proceedings because Wilcox J had required its joinder in the previous litigation  PCR also refers to the fact that  despite the fact that PCR was successful before Wilcox J  GCB was not required to pay PCR s costs  which it submits recognised GCB s non adversarial status in the proceedings  The submission is that GCB  although joined  has no real need to participate in these proceedings because no relief is claimed against it consideredBarton v Minister for Foreign Affairs     FCR   The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts  see The Airtourer Co operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Airtourer    As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs     FCR   at      It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs  In Pearson v  Naydler     W L R    Megarry V C said         The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs  however poor he is  is ancient and well established  As Bowen L J  said in Cowell v Taylor     Ch  D    at   both at law and in equity  the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant   The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts          However  as Branson J noted in Airtourer at      Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant  An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious  An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant  consideredBell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation     FCR   In an often cited passage of the Full Federal Court  Sheppard  Morling and Neaves JJ in Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation     FCR   said at      In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the appellant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful  whether they be shareholders or creditors or  as in this case  beneficiaries under a trust  are also without means  It is not for the party seeking security to raise the matter  it is an essential part of the case of a company seeking to resist an order for security on the ground that the granting of security will frustrate the litigation to raise the issue of the impecuniosity of those whom the litigation will benefit and to prove the necessary facts   The fact that PCR has chosen to oppose the application without providing adequate evidence of its financial position poses a difficulty for the Court  However  given the evidence that PCR is a not for profit organisation managed by volunteers  I think it is reasonable to infer that those supporters will not benefit from the litigation in any pecuniary sense  especially since these proceedings seek administrative law remedies rather than damages referred toBuckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   The application by GCB has been promptly brought  having been filed one day after the first return date for the application  PCR submitted that the motion was premature  because the leave application had not yet been heard  I see no reason why GCB should have waited until after the leave application before bringing its application for security for costs  Had it done so  it would have been open to PCR to submit that GCB had delayed in bringing an application for security for costs  by reason of which expenses had been incurred in prosecuting the application  see Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at   Gartner v Ernst   Young  No     FCA   at     Further  GCB may have been unable to recover its costs on the leave application if PCR was unsuccessful  It was appropriate for GCB to bring its application when it did citedCameron s Unit Services Pty Ltd and Anor v Kevin R Whelpton   Associates  Australia  Pty Ltd and Anor     FCR   In these proceedings PCR has an interest in the litigation since ACMA s decision resulted in PCR s inability to continue to broadcast  This is not a case where PCR is being used as a   stalking horse to enable someone else to evade personal responsibility   see Cameron s Unit Services Pty Ltd and Anor v Kevin R Whelpton   Associates  Australia  Pty Ltd and Anor     FCR   at   referred toChang v Comcare Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This passage accords with the comments of Moore J in Chang v Comcare Australia   FCA   at   where his Honour said     While impecuniosity is not  by itself  sufficient to warrant an order for security  it is generally a relevant consideration      Several of the factors outlined above have relevance to the facts of the present case   GCB submitted that PCR s claim was unlikely to succeed since it was brought out of time and was an appeal against a decision made by ACMA on remitter from a successful appeal by PCR to this Court  GCB said that after ACMA s initial decision was set aside  ACMA was concerned to ensure that the process for the award of the licence was thorough and complete and that for this reason PCR s challenge is likely to fail consideredChapman v Luminis Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Several authorities of this and other courts have considered the factors which should be taken into account in a security for costs application  see for example Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   Ors   ATPR     per Hill J  KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd and Ors     FCR   at     per Beazley J  Cultivaust Pty Ltd v Grain Pool Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Finn J  Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Tamberlin J   Chapman v Luminis   Croker v Sydney Institute of TAFE  State of New South Wales    FCA   per Bennett J  In summary  those considerations are      the chances of success of the applicant and whether the claim is bona fide    the risk that the applicant could not satisfy a costs order    whether the application for security for costs has been promptly brought          whether the application for security for costs is being used oppressively to deny an impecunious litigant access to the court    whether the applicant s impecuniosity arises out of the act in respect of which relief is sought    whether there are third parties standing behind the applicant who are likely to benefit from the litigation and if so  whether they have proffered security for the costs of the litigation    whether an order for security for costs would frustrate the litigation    whether there are any public interest considerations to be taken into account    any matters relevant to the discretion which are distinctive to the circumstances of the case   I am unable at this early stage of proceedings to form a conclusion concerning the merits of the application  As Tamberlin J said in Chapman v Luminis at      It is neither possible nor appropriate on a security for costs application to reach any firm conclusions as to the prospects of an appeal being successful beyond a general consideration of the reasons for decision and the formation of a general overview   Although the appeal is from a decision by ACMA rather than from a decision of this Court  I consider Tamberlin J s observations are pertinent  The notice of appeal in these proceedings makes numerous challenges to the decision making process engaged in by ACMA  and I am not able to assess the merits of those challenges without investigating factual material  The fact that the appellant s challenge relates to the second decision of ACMA does not give rise to the inference that the appeal will not succeed   PCR has not provided any direct evidence to the Court with respect to its incorporation  office bearers  or financial position  although in its oral submissions it made brief reference to the fact that it was impecunious  The only evidence relating to the current financial status of PCR is the statement contained in the affidavit of Mr Norbert Lindberg  secretary of PCR  that the delay by PCR in bringing proceedings has resulted  in part  from the need to raise funds to finance the litigation  The Court has no information with respect to the success of PCR s fundraising activities and no recent financial statements have been produced  The Court has been provided with financial statements from     but because PCR was still operating the radio station and was in receipt of community grants at this time  the statements provide very little guidance as to the current finances of PCR  Since early   PCR  because of the loss of its broadcasting licence  has not been eligible for the community grants which has presumably had an adverse effect on its financial position referred toCroker v Sydney

Publications  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR   Order   r  b  of the Federal Court Rules states that the Court may order that a person be added as a party where such joinder   is necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceeding may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated on    It is important that the Court have an opportunity to hear from GCB in respect of any prejudice which it would sustain because of PCR s delay in bringing these proceedings  Further  GCB has a direct interest in the outcome of these proceedings  since an order by the Court quashing ACMA s decision would affect GCB s right to continue broadcasting  see Re Trade Practices Commission v Milreis Pty Ltd and Ors  Application by Thomson Publications  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR   at    In these circumstances  although no relief is sought against GCB  its position is threatened by the relief sought by PCR  GCB s role is not akin to an  observer  having no active role  Accordingly it is entitled to defend these proceedings and to seek security for its costs in so defending them consideredThe Airtourer Co operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts  see The Airtourer Co operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Airtourer    As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs     FCR   at      It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs  In Pearson v  Naydler     W L R    Megarry V C said         The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs  however poor he is  is ancient and well established  As Bowen L J  said in Cowell v Taylor     Ch  D    at   both at law and in equity  the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant   The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts          However  as Branson J noted in Airtourer at      Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant  An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious  An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant   I consider that the circumstances of the present case are  despite some similarities  also distinguishable from those considered by Branson J in Airtourer   That case involved an impecunious co operative which was pursuing litigation out of a limited pool of funds  There was evidence before her Honour that the applicant planned to exhaust its funds to meet its own legal costs  leaving no funds in reserve for any costs order made against it  Branson J commented at      I do not conclude that an order requiring the applicant to provide a relatively modest sum by way of security for costs would preclude the applicant from pursuing its application to the Court  It might require the directors of the applicant to request additional funds from members of the applicant but  as the proceeding is presumably being pursued by the applicant in the interests of its members  I see nothing inappropriate in such an outcome   Since PCR is a not for profit organisation which aims to provide radio broadcasts serving youth and ethnic minority groups  the proceedings are not being pursued by PCR in the interests of its  members  so much as in the interests of the wider community group which it serves  I am not satisfied that volunteer members of a not for profit organisation should be required to provide funds for litigation when the organisation is impecunious  To impose such a requirement would mean a not for profit community organisation with a history of providing services to the public  which was legitimately bringing proceedings to the Court  might be prevented from pursuing an action to protect its interests merely on the ground of impecuniosity  This would  in my opinion  breach the principle that impecuniosity should not  without more  prevent a litigant from accessing the courts   However  the difficulty which remains in this instance is that  because PCR has provided very limited information with respect to its financial status  members  objectives  any possible sources of funding and other relevant details  no conclusive finding can be made on the evidence as to the effect which an order for security for costs may have in these proceedings  Further  in the absence of a direct submission from PCR that the proceedings would be stifled if an order were made  I am unwilling to draw the inference that this consequence would follow distinguishedTruth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd     ACSR   A further consideration is that PCR is not a mere nominal applicant  In this sense  the present facts are distinguishable from those considered by Hely J in Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd     ACSR   in which the applicant had no private right or interest  Hely J observed in that case at      In my view  the fact that no private right or special interest of the applicant is involved in these proceedings is a factor which weighs in favour of making an order for security  rather than against it   His Honour added at      If those who control the applicant wish to have the benefit of litigating when no private right or special interest of the applicant is at stake in the proceedings and when the applicant is impecunious  then it is appropriate that security for the respondent s costs be provided  distinguishedWilley v Synan   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  PCR has submitted that it is not the true  aggressor  in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor     ALR     Amalgamated Mining    In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman s solicitors alleging that Warman s copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining s supplier were unjustified  In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs  Wilcox J said  at        If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ  in

attack came in the letter from  Warman s solicitors    Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining  it is that company which has an interest in defending and  in a commercial
