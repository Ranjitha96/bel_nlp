SZCZF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBrannan v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOne express exception set forth in the Act is s  B bc  which permits the Court to   vary or set aside an order   made pursuant to s  B bb  namely an order dismissing an appeal by reason of an appellant s failure to attend a hearing relating to the appeal  That power is a power conferred   in general terms   and   should be construed liberally and without the making of implications or the imposition of limitations not found in the words used by Parliament   SZISM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   at       FCR   at   per Black CJ  Weinberg and Allsop JJ  As contemplated in SZISM  the power conferred by s  B bc  is a power which can be exercised even after the orders have been entered  See also  SZCOZ v Minister for Immigration and

Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt has further been suggested that the Court has limited power to make   supplemental orders   Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Lee  Hill and Cooper JJ there observed at   to     There is no doubt that the common law rule is that once a judgment of the Court has been passed and entered  the Court thereafter lacks power to make an order which alters or sets aside that judgment  The only remedy in such a case for a dissatisfied litigant is  where available  an appeal  Re St Nazaire Co     Ch D     Re Suffield and Watts  Ex parte Brown     QBD   at   per Fry LJ and at   per Lopes LJ  and cf Gamser v Nominal Defendant        The general rule admits to certain exceptions but these are  so the respondent submits  severely circumscribed   One such exception is the  slip rule  see L Shaddock   Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council  No     HCA         CLR     another exception is fraud and a third relates to self executing orders  None of these is relied on in the present case      Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules sets out exceptions to the general rule that the court will not vary or set aside judgments  These examples largely reflect the common law position  None is here relevant  However  Caboolture relies upon what is said to be the power of courts to make supplemental orders where circumstances make it necessary so to do  That in an appropriate case a supplemental order may be made after judgment is entered  is clear from Preston Banking Co v William Allsup   Sons     Ch    The true principle was expressed in that case by Lord Lindley  at     as follows     This is not an application to alter an order on the ground of some slip or oversight  Nor is it a case in which the order has not been drawn up  Here the order has been drawn up  and it expresses the real decision of the court  and that being so  the Court has no jurisdiction to alter it  If this summons had proceeded on the theory that the order of the   th of July was right  and that circumstances had since occurred which had rendered a supplemental order necessary  the Court might have entertained the application  but this summons proceeds on the theory that the order of   July is wrong  In my opinion  it is of the utmost importance  in order that there may be some finality in litigation  that when once the order has been completed it should not be liable to review by the judge who made it       Critical to the jurisdiction of the Court is first that the application not be one in any way to vary or alter the initial order  The present application does not seek to do this  It is  in the sense used in the cases  a supplemental order              The principle behind denying the right of a court to vary or alter a judgment regularly given and entered is the need for finality of litigation  The Court has adjudicated upon the facts of the claim brought by a plaintiff against a defendant  found for one side and entered the relevant judgment  Neither the facts nor the law are to be agitated again  save on an appeal  But the issues involved where a claim is made against a solicitor for costs by a party to the litigation have not been determined by the judgment which has been entered  They remain yet to be resolved     The power to make such   supplemental orders   it will be noted  is not a power   to vary or alter a judgment regularly given       The revocation of the July   Order certainly cannot be characterised as   supplemental orders    No other source of power to vary or revoke the order as made in July   has been identified citedDJL v The Central Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAn order  once made and entered  is normally final  In DJL v The Central Authority   HCA         CLR     the High Court held that the Full Court of the Family Court did not have power to re open final orders after their entry  And  in reliance upon that decision  in Pantzer v Wenkart   FCAFC   at     Black CJ observed that it was   hard to see     how  in the face of DJL v The Central Authority   there can be any foundation for the contention that the Full Court of the Federal Court has power to re open final orders duly entered       The Chief Justice further observed      Even if there were power to re open the orders then it is clear that such a power should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances  The public interest in finality requires as much  see  albeit in a different context  Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council   HCA         CLR   at    Mason ACJ  Wilson and Brennan JJ  Autodesk Inc v Dyason  No       HCA         CLR   at    Mason CJ  and    Dawson J   Considerable doubt has been thrown upon the observations in S  by the decision of the Full Court in SZISM  In SZISM   the Court concluded that s  B bc  was the power there available to be exercised and made the following observations as to the approach being advanced in S        This conclusion about the content of s  B bc  makes it unnecessary to deal with the arguments put forward on the appeal concerning the second asserted basis of power to set aside the orders implied or inherent power  This  of course  was the subject of DJL v The Central Authority   HCA       CLR   in the context of a discussion of the powers of the Family Court of Australia  It is not appropriate for us to deal with these arguments and the issues raised by them  including the scope and effect of s   of the Act in the absence of the need to do so  We should note  however  that the reasons of the Judges of the Full Court in S  of   v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   were given in the context of a concession by the Minister that power existed to set aside the order  though entered  The comments of Emmett J at   with which Allsop J and Middleton J agreed referred to the inherent power of the Court to set aside an order made in the absence of a party or at a hearing of which the party had no notice  Reference was made by Emmett J only to Taylor v Taylor   HCA         CLR   at    In the light of DJL v The Central Authority   HCA       CLR     such an unqualified proposition even supported by Taylor v Taylor   HCA       CLR   is difficult to maintain  see the comments of Black CJ in Pantzer v Wenkart   FCAFC    The comments made by Emmett J  with which Allsop J and Middleton J agreed  were obiter dicta and made in the context of the concession to which we have referred  They should not be taken as authority for an unqualified proposition of the lack of relevance of DJL v Central Authority   HCA       CLR   to any examination of this Court s power  What authority this Court has by implication to take any particular step and the relevance of s   of the Act to any such question need not be considered for the disposition of this application  Although the Court may not have an   inherent power   as a Court created by statute  it does have all the   powers expressly or by implication conferred by the legislation which govern s  it   and has   in addition such powers as are incidental and necessary to the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred   DJL v The Central Authority   HCA         CLR   at

contended on behalf of the Minister  were confined to those situations identified in Harvey v Phillips   HCA         CLR   at   to   as follows    The question whether the compromise is to be set aside depends upon the existence of a ground which would suffice to render a simple contract void or voidable or to entitle the party to equitable relief against it  grounds for example such as illegality  misrepresentation  non disclosure of a material fact where disclosure is required  duress  mistake  undue influence  abuse of confidence or the like     See also  SZJBW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at     Tresize v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCA   at       ALR   at    It is unnecessary to resolve the extent of any   inherent power   or any   incidental power    The power referred to in S  was a power which was said to be available to vary orders made in the absence of a party  Such was not the present case  The orders as made in July   were made with the express consent of the now Applicant  The Minister does not consent to the July   orders now being set aside and the facts do not come within the limited exception embraced by Harvey v Phillips   No injustice  it is considered  is occasioned by holding the Applicant to the decision he made in July    A further potential difficulty is whether the application which is now made to the Court should have been made by way of a new application rather than by way of Motion in the same proceeding in which North J originally made the July   Order  After having referred to the ground upon which a consent order could be set aside in Harvey v Phillips   Handley JA in Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     NSWLR   at   observed that      it is also established that the jurisdiction to set aside a consent order on such a ground should be invoked by a new action brought for that purpose and not by a motion in the original proceedings      The difficulty could  perhaps  have been overcome by simply treating the existing Notice of Motion as a fresh proceeding  cf Pembroke School Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA   at       ALD   at    No objection  however  was taken on behalf of the Respondent Minister to the manner in which the Applicant has proceeded and accordingly this further difficulty need not be resolved  Even if the Court had power to revoke the Order as made in July   any such relief would have been refused in the exercise of discretion assuming that the Court has such a discretion  cf Harvey v Phillips   HCA         CLR   at    The resolution of the present Notice of Motion is no occasion to conduct a de facto hearing of the Appeal which was dismissed by consent  It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the Refugee Review Tribunal set forth its reasons and findings in considerable detail  The learned Federal Magistrate also addressed each of the grounds advanced before that Court  The Notice of Appeal to this Court identified the Grounds of Appeal as follows  without alteration    His Honour Scarlett ignored the written case filed in Court on   March   and failed to give me yet a detailed judgment  I rely on the order dated   March   and yet will provide further grounds when I receive the judgment      His Honour Federal Magistrate Scarlett overlooked Consent Order appearing on page   of the court book dated   May   and order by His Honour Smith FM appearing on page   of the court book filed   June   and the comment made and filed on   September   in court book p      which would lead to see that the Tribunal made a judicial error under s   of the Act which provides an opportunity for the applicant for further comment and such did not happen     Neither of these grounds would appear to have any substance  The decision of the Federal Magistrate previously under appeal dealt with each of the grounds being advanced before that Court  The reasons for decision are expressed in sufficient detail to set forth the basis upon which each of the grounds was rejected  The reference in the second Ground of Appeal to a   Consent Order   was an order previously made by a Federal Magistrate quashing a previous decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  Its relevance to the subsequent decision of a different Federal Magistrate is elusive  And the decision previously under appeal addressed and resolved the question as to whether an opportunity had been extended to the Applicant to present his case  The Notice of Appeal does not expose any self evident error on the part of the Federal Magistrate  There was  moreover  no acceptable explanation as to why the Order as made in July   was only sought to be impugned by a Notice of Motion filed in February    The only explanation advanced was that there had been a change in government citedJackson v Sterling Industries Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAlthough the Court may not have an   inherent

Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   at     Order   r   is thus not an available source of power to vary or set aside the Orders made by North J  In S    for example  such an   inherent power   was referred to but not invoked  Emmett J  with whom Allsop and Middleton JJ agreed  there referred to Order   r   and set forth the circumstances in which this   inherent power   could be exercised as follows      However  no provision of the Rules can deprive the Court of the inherent power that it has to set aside an order made in the absence of a party or an order made at a hearing of which the party had no notice  see Taylor v Taylor   HCA         CLR   at    That is to say  it is an incident of the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth that the Court may  in an appropriate case  set aside its own order if it is satisfied that there is a proper explanation for the non attendance of a party at a hearing at which the order is made  However  given that the power exists  it is clearly discretionary  see Taylor at       In the absence of an adequate explanation for the non attendance  the orders previously made were there not set aside  In Singh v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA   at     Beaumont  Kiefel and Hely JJ also acknowledged a limited power in an   exceptional case   to revoke orders made by consent  Considerable doubt has been thrown upon the observations in S  by the decision of the Full Court in SZISM  In SZISM   the Court concluded that s  B bc  was the power there available to be exercised and made the following observations as to the approach being advanced in S        This conclusion about the content of s  B bc  makes it unnecessary to deal with the arguments put forward on the appeal concerning the second asserted basis of power to set aside the orders implied or inherent power  This  of course  was the subject of DJL v The Central Authority   HCA       CLR   in the context of a discussion of the powers of the Family Court of Australia  It is not appropriate for us to deal with these arguments and the issues raised by them  including the scope and effect of s   of the Act in the absence of the need to do so  We should note  however  that the reasons of the Judges of the Full Court in S  of   v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   were given in the context of a concession by the Minister that power existed to set aside the order  though entered  The comments of Emmett J at   with which Allsop J and Middleton J agreed referred to the inherent power of the Court to set aside an order made in the absence of a party or at a hearing of which the party had no notice  Reference was made by Emmett J only to Taylor v Taylor   HCA         CLR   at    In the light of DJL v The Central Authority   HCA       CLR     such an unqualified proposition even supported by Taylor v Taylor   HCA       CLR   is difficult to maintain  see the comments of Black CJ in Pantzer v Wenkart   FCAFC    The comments made by Emmett J  with which Allsop J and Middleton J agreed  were obiter dicta and made in the context of the concession to which we have referred  They should not be taken as authority for an unqualified proposition of the lack of relevance of DJL v Central Authority   HCA       CLR   to any examination of this Court s power  What authority this Court has by implication to take any particular step and the relevance of s   of the Act to any such question need not be considered for the disposition of this application  It is unnecessary to resolve the extent of any   inherent power   or any   incidental power    The power referred to in S  was a power which was said to be available to vary orders made in the absence of a party  Such was not the present case  The orders as made in July   were made with the express consent of the now Applicant  The Minister does not consent to the July   orders now being set aside and the facts do not come within the limited exception embraced by Harvey v Phillips   No injustice  it is considered  is occasioned by holding the Applicant to the decision he made in July   citedSingh v Secretary  Department of Family and Community Services   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn S    for example  such an   inherent power   was referred to but not invoked  Emmett J  with whom

Beaumont  Kiefel and Hely JJ also acknowledged a limited power in an   exceptional case   to revoke orders made by consent citedSpies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     NSWLR  A further potential difficulty is whether the application which is now made to the Court should have been made by way of a new application rather than by way of Motion in the same proceeding in which North J originally made the July   Order  After having referred to the ground upon which a consent order could be set aside in Harvey v Phillips   Handley JA in Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     NSWLR   at   observed that      it is also established that the jurisdiction to set aside a consent order on such a ground should be invoked by a new action brought for that purpose and not by a motion in the original proceedings      The difficulty could  perhaps  have been overcome by simply treating the existing Notice of Motion as a fresh proceeding  cf Pembroke School Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA   at       ALD   at    No objection  however  was taken on behalf of the Respondent Minister to the manner in which the Applicant has proceeded and accordingly this
