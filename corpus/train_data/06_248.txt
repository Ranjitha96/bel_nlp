cases cth federal ct  html  The applicants in this matter  Robert McDermott  Maxwell Latimer and Ann Langdon  were defendants in an earlier proceeding before me  That proceeding began as an ex parte application  filed by Paul Burness as liquidator of Richmond Sales Pty Ltd  Richmond Sales  for a warrant under s  C of the Corporations Act    Cth   The procedural history of that matter is outlined in reasons for judgment delivered on   February   see Richmond Sales Pty Ltd  In Liq  v McDermott   FCA   at          It is unnecessary to review all of the procedural history of the earlier proceeding involving these parties  For the present purposes  the following facts are relevant      Merkel J issued a warrant on   December   and it was served the next day  Pursuant to the warrant  Burness seized seven vehicles    On   March   Burness filed an interlocutory application asking that he be directed to sell the seven seized vehicles     By   December   only three vehicles remained in Burness s possession and the subject of dispute  McDermott  Latimer and Langdon  as defendants  opposed the sale of these vehicles     Burness s application to dispose of the vehicles was part heard on   and   July        On   August   McDermott  Latimer and Langdon  together with fellow defendants Michael Giuffre  John McDonald and Mary Ann Martinek  filed an application seeking to set aside the warrant issued on   December       On   October   the parties informed the Court that they had reached a settlement concerning Burness s application of   March   to dispose of the seized vehicles  The parties requested that the Court make consent orders consistent with the terms of this settlement  Accordingly  amongst other things on that day the Court ordered     The motor vehicle identified as a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost chassis No    which is in the possession of the Plaintiff be delivered to the Defendant nominated by Walter Percival Edwards at an address in Melbourne specified by him forthwith upon nomination of that Defendant         In the event that the Defendants pay the sum of     to the Plaintiff on or before   January   the Plaintiff deliver the motor vehicles identified as a Rolls Royce Phantom II Sedan chassis No   GY and a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow II Saloon chassis No  SRH  to the Defendant or Defendants nominated by Walter Percival Edwards at an address specified by him within   hours of receipt of the said sum       A  In the event that the Defendants fail to pay the sum of     to the Plaintiff on or before   January   the motor vehicles referred to in paragraph   hereof be the absolute property of Richmond Sales Pty Ltd  in liquidation  and the liquidator of that company be at liberty to sell those vehicles and retain the proceeds of sale as absolute property of the company in liquidation       B  Reserve liberty to the parties to apply                 On   October   the Court also made orders concerning the timing of submissions regarding the defendants  application of   August   to set aside the warrant     On   February   the Court delivered reasons for judgment dismissing the defendants  application to set aside the warrant   On   February   the applicants filed this application  under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  seeking that paragraphs   and  A of the orders of   October   be varied  The applicants ask the Court to extend the time for payment of the sum of   referred toWestsub Discounts Pty Ltd v Idaps Australia Ltd  No       ALR   In his second affidavit  Edwards deposed that     Pursuant to the Court Orders made by consent on   October   the Liquidator failed to deliver Vehicle   to the person that I nominated  as specified in clause   of the Orders  until some two weeks after the making of the order      On   January   I informed McDermott s Workshop of my trust account details as he had indicated to me that he was providing by direct transfer of funds the amount of     being the sum required to payout the Liquidator pursuant to clause   of the   October   orders          Funds were shown as having been  cleared  into my trust account on   February        I informed the Applicants that I had received the funds into my trust account on   February   however  the Applicants indicated to me that the funds were in fact deposited into my trust account on   January        Counsel for the applicants submitted that the Court has the power to vary the order under O   r  c  of the Federal Court Rules   which allows the Court to  vary or set aside a judgment or order after the order has been entered where       the order is interlocutory   The applicants argued that the consent orders were interlocutory because they included an order reserving liberty to apply  Counsel for the applicants also relied on O   r    and  in this connection  Westsub Discounts Pty Ltd v Idaps Australia Ltd  No       ALR   and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court   In the applicants  view  a number of factors support the conclusion that this is an appropriate case to exercise the discretion conferred by O   r   or O   r   or in the Court s inherent jurisdiction  First  so the applicants claimed  the consent orders show that the intention of the parties was that   be exchanged for the relevant vehicles  Secondly  this money was available to be transferred to the respondents on   January    or at the latest   February    Thirdly  according to the applicants  the reason that the money was not delivered on   January   was that  contrary to both parties  expectations  reasons for judgment regarding the application to set aside the warrant were not delivered until after than date  Fourthly  the money is available to be paid immediately  Fifthly  the respondents would not  so the applicants said  be prejudiced by a variation in the order  Sixthly  having regard to the liquidator s own delay in delivering vehicle   there should have been no difficulty in the parties agreeing to disregard the delay on the applicants  side  Finally  if the time were not extended  then the liquidator would  so the applicants said  receive a windfall gain not intended by the settlement giving rise to the orders of   October     The applicants conceded that they had not paid the   before   January   because they expected a different result in the application to set aside the warrant  They argued that while this view may have been  na ve  they should not suffer prejudice as a consequence  They also sought the costs of their application   The orders in paragraphs   and  A of the orders of   October   were final orders with respect to the application of   March    Thus  the Court has no power to vary these orders pursuant to O   r    Further  the Court has no power under O   r   to make the orders the applicant seeks  As a Full Court said in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd  in liq  v White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd     ALR   at   per Lee  Hill and Cooper JJ  regarding O   r    c ritical to the jurisdiction of the court is first that the application not be one in any way to vary or alter the initial order   The applicants seek orders to vary the orders in paragraphs   and  A of the   October   orders  and O   r   does not give power to do this  In the face of Full Court authority  the earlier decision in Westsub Discounts Pty Ltd v Idaps Australia Ltd  No       ALR   is either to be distinguished or is no longer good authority referred toLindon v Stanton  Supreme Court of Western Australia  Adams M    November   BC  The respondents further submitted that a consent order giving effect to a settlement could only be set aside on grounds that would justify setting aside the contractual agreement on which the settlement was based  In support of this proposition  they referred to Lindon v Stanton  Supreme Court of Western Australia  Adams M    November   BC    The respondents also argued that the applicants received no support from O   r   and nor could they avail themselves of the Court s inherent jurisdiction  They contended that O   r   conferred power to make orders that were truly supplemental and did not confer power to vary or alter the initial order   Ultimately  so the respondent said  the applicants made a decision not to pay before the end of January  This decision was based on the applicants  view that it was not in their interest to pay the money at that time  The respondents submitted that they should not be penalized for the applicants  error  The respondents noted that they would be prejudiced by any variation of the kind sought in the orders of   October   because the vehicles were likely to be worth more than   referred toNicholson v Nicholson     NSWLR   At the hearing  the respondents contended that O   r  c  did not provide a basis for the orders sought  They submitted that paragraphs     and  A of the orders of   October   were final rather than interlocutory  They noted that the orders finally disposed of the subject matter of the   March   application  They cited Nicholson v Nicholson     NSWLR   in support of the proposition that reservation of liberty to apply  in the context of such orders  is simply a device by which further orders may be made when necessary for the purpose of implementing and giving effect to the principal relief already propounded  The respondents submitted that the reservation of liberty to apply in a final judgment or order did not permit the making of orders materially varying the substance of the order   The respondents submitted that the orders made in paragraphs     and  A of the   October   orders were final and unconditional  like the settlement agreement underlying them  Crucially  there was no condition that the settlement was dependent on the outcome of the defendants  application to set aside the warrant  In these circumstances  there was no reason to believe that the delay in payment that the applicants sought was consistent with the orders or the settlement   Moreover  it is settled law that orders may be final even though the Court reserves liberty to apply  see  e g
