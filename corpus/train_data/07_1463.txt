Le v The Queen   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedHamm v Middleton     IPR  In its written submissions  the Crown submitted that        In considering a severity appeal for Commonwealth offences  the court is required to have regard to the matters set out in Part  B of the Crimes Act   and more specifically to the matters set out under s  A   which provides a list of non exclusive factors that a court should take into account when sentencing a federal offender  R v El Karhani     NSWLR       The governing principle under s  A  is the imposition of a sentence which is of a  severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence      The Court must consider the matters adverted to under s  A    together with the important consideration of general deterrence  R v El Karhani   R v Paull     NSWLR   per Hunt J     The following sentencing principles are directly applicable in the present case    General Deterrence       In R v El Karhani   the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal reaffirmed the principle of general deterrence when sentencing for Commonwealth offences and agreed with Hunt J R v Paull at  F  The Court  Kirby P  Campbell   Newman JJ  at  H also cited Street CJ  writing for the Court  in Rushby     NSWLR   at         General deterrence is of particular importance in sentencing for Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act offences     In Hamm v Middleton     IPR   Von Doussa J sentenced the defendant to three offences under s  b   A a  and  d i  of the Copyright Act and remarked  at          However  there is also the question of general deterrence  It is important in these types of offences  which are not always easy to detect and that have the potential to interfere with important rights in the community  that the penalty fixed be sufficient to deter others that might be minded to engage in similar conduct  That is a matter which I must take into account here             The legislature has also reflected the seriousness with which it considers such offences by prescribing custodial sentences as maximum penalties  In particular  the Copyright Act offences stipulate a maximum penalty of five years

principle of general deterrence  s  A  of the Crimes Act provides a  check list  which the Court is to have regard to when sentencing an offender for a Commonwealth offence    Section  A a   The

imprisonment for the copyright offences and   months imprisonment for the trade mark offences  see   above     The appellant traded in the pirated videos by renting them to the public for monetary gain  The presence of the television and extensive video equipment in her home and the large quantity of copyright infringed video cassettes  over   demonstrates the high volume commercial extent of her criminality  The fact that the appellant has previously been convicted of similar offences also negates any suggestion that this was an isolated or  one off  offence     The Court is entitled to take into account the context and surrounding circumstances of the crime  Although   representative charges were ultimately prosecuted and the appellant pleaded guilty to these  this Court is not limited to only considering the facts arising from just these charges  While this Court cannot rely on the surrounding circumstances to aggravate penalty and increase the sentence  it is entitled to take these factors into account in reaching the conclusion that this was not an isolated incident so there is no warrant to extend leniency  see Holyoak     A Crim R    at     per Allen J  Handley JA

facilitated the course of justice   otherwise referred to as the utilitarian effect  R v Ellis     NSWLR   at   R v Winchester     A Crim R       However  the pleas of guilty entered by the appellant were made in circumstances where she faced an overwhelming Crown case  namely          Just prior to the execution of the search warrant  the appellant had on three prior occasions rented out pirate

 In any event  the Courts have repeatedly held that less weight is accorded to good character for  white collar  or fraud related crime where the need for general deterrence is strong  R v Thompson

probable effects of any sentence on offender s family or dependants       Section  A p  of the Crimes Act requires the Court to consider the probable effects of any sentence would have upon the

criminality of the offences  R v Maslen   Shaw     A Crim R   at       The appellant has a son aged   years old who has been diagnosed as having a  severe level of Intellectual Disability     Autism Spectrum Disorder and a Mood Disorder   According to a report provided by the Department of Ageing  Disability   Home Care dated   January   the appellant s son had received treatment and accommodation from several residential health care centres  As at June   the appellant reported in her pre sentence report that  her son is currently residing in hospital care due to associated problems with having autism    at page      Reliance on third party reports tendered at sentence       Considerable caution should be exercised in relying on reports containing hearsay material provided by an offender and such evidence should be given limited weight    Appropriate Sentencing Range       The proper approach to sentencing involves the weighing of all relevant factors in order to reach a conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed  In doing so a court should avoid taking a mathematical approach in which there are increments to or decrements from a predetermined range of sentences  Such an approach departs from principle because it does not take into account the fact that there are many conflicting and contradictory elements which bear upon sentencing an offender  It is also wrong because singling out a circumstance and attributing to it a specific numerical or proportionate value distorts the difficult balancing exercise which the sentencing judge must perform  Markarian v The Queen   HCA         ALR    per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ at     and Wong v The Queen   HCA         CLR    at         However  in a simple case where the circumstances of the crime have to be weighed against one or a small number of other important matters  some  indulgence  in an arithmetical process  legislative requirements apart  may

seriousness of the offence  the repeal of s  G of the Crimes Act and the applicable maximum penalties  the Magistrate at first instance was well within his discretion to impose concurrent full time custodial sentences in relation to the six Copyright Act offences and five Trade Marks Act offences     In imposing these penalties  the Magistrate had proper regard for the following principles         a  the need for general deterrence   b  the need for specific deterrence  in circumstances where the appellant had previously been convicted for similar offences under the Copyright Act    c  the

ALR  It was submitted that these procedural errors are significant and that their intrinsic part in the sentencing process has the result that the discretion exercised by the sentencing court has miscarried  is unsound or unreasonable in its exercise  and this is reflected in the severity of the sentence actually handed down  The appellant asks that the sentence the subject of appeal be set aside and that this Court substitute its own sentence in lieu  Kovac v The Queen     ALR    The balance of the appellant s submissions were directed to       The circumstances that do not justify full time custody  three key matters that are to be considered under s  A of the Crimes Act         a  the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence   b  the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person   c  the prospect of rehabilitation of the person          A just and appropriate sentence to be substituted in lieu such as community service  as was recommended to Liverpool Local Court by the Probation and Parole Officer s Pre Sentence Report of   June    Dealing with each of the matters in turn  the appellant submitted that the time in full time custody already spent  five days  together with a community service order  lengthy if need be  would be adequate punishment  and that any greater level of punishment meted by the Court would exceed that which is just and appropriate with respect to the objective features of the offence committed  In this regard  the appellant relies on sentencing statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in   and annexed to her written submissions which illustrate that over the period October   to September   in the case of   offenders convicted of breaching s   of the Copyright Act and in respect of   offenders convicted of breaching s   of the Trade Marks Act   none were imprisoned  Any that were given a custodial sentence were immediately released pursuant to s  b  of the Crimes Act   This  the appellant submits  provides a measure for this Court to assess the objective criminality of the offence and thus a guide as to what level of punishment is adequate  In Kovac   a Full Court of this Court said  at          In Harris v R   HCA         CLR   the High Court considered an appeal against sentence under s   of the Papua New Guinea Act   to hear and determine appeals from all judgments  decrees  orders and sentences of the Supreme Court of the Territory  The court held that it would not interfere with a sentence of imprisonment imposed unless it was satisfied that the discretion exercised by the court imposing the sentence miscarried or was unsound or unreasonable in its exercise  In a joint judgment  Dixon CJ  Fullagar  Kitto and Taylor JJ cited with approval a passage from the decision of the High Court in Cranssen v R   HCA         CLR    In the latter case  after pointing out that an appeal against sentence is an appeal from a discretionary act of the court responsible for the sentence  Dixon  Evatt and McTiernan JJ  at   said   The jurisdiction to revise such a discretion must be exercised in accordance with recognized principles  It is not enough that the members of the court would themselves have imposed a less or different sentence  or that they think the sentence over severe  There must be some reason for regarding the discretion confided to the court of first instance as improperly exercised  This may appear from the circumstances which that court has taken into account  They may include some considerations which ought not to have affected the discretion  or may exclude others which ought to have done so  The court may have mistaken or been misled as to the facts  or an error of law may have been made  Effect may have been given to views or opinions which are extreme or misguided  But it is not necessary that some definite or specific error should be assigned  The nature of the sentence itself when considered in relation to the offence and the circumstances of the case  may be such as to afford convincing evidence that in some way the exercise of the discretion has been unsound  In short  the principles which guide courts of appeal in dealing with matters resting in the discretion of the court of first instance restrain the intervention of this court to cases where the sentence appears unreasonable  or has not been fixed in the due and proper exercise of the court s authority  Following this citation their Honours  at p   in Harris  Case added   It is not enough in applying those principles that the judges of this court should regard the sentence as greater than they themselves would have imposed   citedMarkarian v The Queen   HCA         ALR  http www

important in these types of offences  which are not always easy to detect and that have the potential to interfere with important rights in the community  that the penalty fixed be sufficient to deter others that might be minded to engage in similar conduct  That is a matter which I must take into account here             The legislature has also reflected the seriousness with which it considers

Full Court in R v Tait     ALR   following which the Court said  at        An appellate court does not interfere with the sentence imposed merely because it is of the view that that sentence is insufficient or excessive  It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error in acting on a wrong principle or in misunderstanding or in wrongly assessing some salient feature of the evidence  The error may appear in what the sentencing judge said in the proceedings  or the sentence itself may be so excessive or inadequate as to manifest such error  see generally  Skinner v R   HCA         CLR   at     R v Withers     SR  NSW    at   Whittaker v R   HCA         CLR   at   Griffiths v R     ALR   at      As indicated at   above  the appellant identified two errors in the sentencing procedure in the present case  The first was said to be a failure to consider all possible alternatives to full time imprisonment  contrary to the provisions of s  A of the Crimes Act   The difficulty with this alleged error is that  at the time of sentencing  his Honour said       I have considered all other appropriate penalties and I consider nothing other than full time gaol is the appropriate penalty       In my view  this alleged error cannot be sustained  The other error in the sentencing procedure identified by the appellant is the alleged failure of his Honour to apply and properly record the utilitarian discount given for a plea of guilty  In prefacing the imposed sentence  his Honour did refer to the appellant s guilty plea and was obviously mindful of it  It is just not possible to know to what extent  if any  his Honour took it into account in the exercise of his sentencing discretion  I would not be prepared to interfere with the sentence his Honour imposed on the basis of this alleged error  In my view  the only real question raised by this appeal is whether the nature of the sentence imposed  when considered in relation to the offences and the circumstances of the case  is so excessive as to manifest  convincing evidence  that in some way the exercise of the discretion has miscarried or is unsound  As the authorities to which I have referred make clear  it is not enough that I might regard the sentence as greater than what I would have imposed  It appears to be common ground between the appellant and the Crown that no person convicted of the offences for which the appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted has been incarcerated in prison  Custodial sentences have been imposed but invariably have been effectively suspended by orders made pursuant to s  b  of the Crimes Act directing the immediate release of the offender sentenced to imprisonment upon giving security  by recognizance or otherwise  to the satisfaction of the court  for compliance with the conditions referred to in para  a  of s    However  those facts themselves do not lead to the conclusion that the sentence imposed on the appellant was so excessive as to manifest  convincing evidence  that the exercise of his Honour s discretion miscarried  Any such conclusion could only be reached by weighing those comparative facts against the maximum penalties as a measure of the seriousness with which the legislature views such offences five years imprisonment for the Copyright Act offences having regard to the principle of general deterrence  the need for specific deterrence particularly in the face of conviction for a past similar offence  rejecting as I do  the appellant s submission for discounting this factor for the media publicity this case received  and the scale of the illegal commercial operation carried on by the appellant  So weighed and measured  the sentence imposed by his Honour does not  on its face  exhibit the character of being so excessive that the exercise of the discretion is put in doubt  I have come to the conclusion that I should not interfere with the term of imprisonment of   months for each offence to be served concurrently  however  I reduce the non release period from eight months to three months on the same recognizance    I certify that the preceding thirty one   numbered paragraphs

custodial sentences in relation to the six Copyright Act offences and five Trade Marks Act offences     In imposing these penalties  the Magistrate had proper regard for the following principles

Magistrate s sentence of   months imprisonment as a head sentence with an effective custodial sentence of   months was within the permissible range     While the penalties for the Copyright Act offences may be at the higher end of the scale  the Crown submits that they are not manifestly excessive  given that the allowable maximum penalty for offences under ss  AA  and  A  of the Copyright Act is five years imprisonment on summary conviction citedWong v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn its written submissions  the Crown submitted that        In considering a severity appeal for Commonwealth offences  the court is required to have regard to the matters set out in Part  B of the Crimes Act   and more specifically to the matters set out under s  A   which provides a list of non exclusive factors that a court should take into account when sentencing a federal offender  R v El Karhani     NSWLR       The governing principle under s  A  is the imposition of a sentence which is of a  severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence      The Court must consider the matters adverted to under s  A    together with the important consideration of general deterrence  R v El Karhani   R v Paull     NSWLR   per Hunt J     The following sentencing principles are directly applicable in the present case    General Deterrence       In R v El Karhani   the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal reaffirmed the principle of general deterrence when sentencing for Commonwealth offences and agreed with Hunt J R v Paull at  F  The Court  Kirby P  Campbell   Newman JJ  at  H also cited Street CJ  writing for the Court  in Rushby     NSWLR   at         General deterrence is of particular importance in sentencing for Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act offences     In Hamm v Middleton     IPR   Von Doussa J sentenced the defendant to three offences under s  b   A a  and  d i  of the Copyright Act and remarked  at          However  there is also the question of general deterrence  It is important in these types of offences  which are not always easy to detect and that have the potential to interfere with important rights in the community  that the penalty fixed be sufficient to deter others that might be minded to engage in similar conduct  That is a matter which I must take into account here             The legislature has also reflected the seriousness with which it considers such offences by prescribing custodial sentences as maximum penalties  In particular  the Copyright Act offences stipulate a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment on summary conviction  s  AA  Copyright Act      In the present case the appellant s high level of criminality is reflected in her role of infringing copyright and affixing false trade mark labels on a large number of pirated video cassettes  before renting these copyright infringed items to the general public    The Section  A   Check List  Considerations       In addition to the principle of general deterrence  s  A  of the Crimes Act provides a  check list  which the Court is to have regard to when sentencing an offender for a Commonwealth offence    Section  A a   The Nature and Circumstances of the Offence        The offences for which the appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted are objectively serious  as reflected by the maximum penalties five years imprisonment for the copyright offences and   months imprisonment for the trade mark offences  see   above     The appellant traded in the pirated videos by renting them to the public for monetary gain  The presence of the television and extensive video equipment in her home and the large quantity of copyright infringed video cassettes  over   demonstrates the high volume commercial extent of her criminality  The fact that the appellant has previously been convicted of similar offences also negates any suggestion that this was an isolated or  one off  offence     The Court is entitled to take into account the context and surrounding circumstances of the crime  Although   representative charges were ultimately prosecuted and the appellant pleaded guilty to these  this Court is not limited to only considering the facts arising from just these charges  While this Court cannot rely on the surrounding circumstances to aggravate penalty and increase the sentence  it is entitled to take these factors into account in reaching the conclusion that this was not an isolated incident so there is no warrant to extend leniency  see Holyoak     A Crim R    at     per Allen J  Handley JA and Hulme J agreeing     Section  A c   If the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character that course of conduct        Under s  A c    the Court is entitled to take into account the fact that the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same and similar character  Hamm v Middleton at       Prior to the search warrant being executed  undercover representatives of the copyright holder rented copyright infringed videos from the appellant on three occasions     This course of conduct serves to further demonstrate that the purpose of the appellant s possession of the copy infringed items was to achieve a commercial gain for her own benefit    Section  A f   The degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence   i  by taking action to make reparation for any loss resulting from the offence  or  ii  in any other manner  and s  A g   If the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence that fact        The offences committed by the appellant were detected after the execution of a search warrant on her home on   February   by the NSW Police  On   March   the appellant was arrested and charged  After two court dates   April   and   June   the appellant entered pleas of guilty and was convicted and sentenced on   June   at Liverpool Local Court     The Crown acknowledges that the appellant s pleas of guilty to the charges occurred at a relatively early stage  By her plea  the appellant can be said to have  facilitated the course of justice   otherwise referred to as the utilitarian effect  R v Ellis     NSWLR   at   R v Winchester     A Crim R       However  the pleas of guilty entered by the appellant were made in circumstances where she faced an overwhelming Crown case  namely          Just prior to the execution of the search warrant  the appellant had on three prior occasions rented out pirate videos to undercover representatives of the copyright holder  Status Investigations   Security Pty Ltd  and    Over   copyright infringed videocassettes  the large majority bearing the  TVB  trade mark  and recording equipment   video recorders and two television sets  were located in her home        Accordingly  the appellant s pleas of guilty must be seen in the context of an acknowledgement of the strength of the Crown case and a recognition of the inevitable  R v Winchester     Section  A h   The degree to which the person has co operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences        The appellant has not cooperated in any way with the authorities in the investigation of the offences    Section  A k   The need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence        The following should be taken into account          The strength of the Crown case     The objective gravity of the offence     The need for general deterrence     The need for a strong subjective deterrence aspect      Section  A m   The character  antecedents  age  means and physical and mental condition of the person    Criminal antecedents       On   May   the appellant was convicted on a number of Copyright Act infringement offences at Liverpool Local Court  see criminal history tendered on sentence   In relation to these offences  the appellant was placed on a good behaviour bond for two years with a self surety of   and fined various amounts  Accordingly  the appellant cannot claim to be a person of good character     In any event  the Courts have repeatedly held that less weight is accorded to good character for  white collar  or fraud related crime where the need for general deterrence is strong  R v Thompson     SASR    per Bray CJ at   R v El Rashid  unreported  Court of Criminal Appeal  NSW    April   R v Williams   NSWSC     R v Ronen and Ors   NSWSC     R v Cooper   NSWSC      The Appellant s Subjective Features       The appellant s subjective features are identified in two pre sentence reports dated   June   and   September    She is a single mother aged   with two children  one being an autistic son now aged   who is living at a residential home and away from the appellant  see     below      At the time of the preparing of these reports the appellant was unemployed and receiving social security benefits  She does not suffer from any physical or mental health conditions  At the time of execution of the search warrant  the appellant was living in her mortgaged home    Section  A p  probable effects of any sentence on offender s family or dependants       Section  A p  of the Crimes Act requires the Court to consider the probable effects of any sentence would have upon the offenders  family or dependants  The applicable test is whether the family members will suffer  exceptional hardship  as a result of any sentence imposed when evaluated against the objective criminality of the offences  R v Maslen   Shaw     A Crim R   at       The appellant has a son aged   years old who has been diagnosed as having a  severe level of Intellectual Disability     Autism Spectrum Disorder and a Mood Disorder   According to a report provided by the Department of Ageing  Disability   Home Care dated   January   the appellant s son had received treatment and accommodation from several residential health care centres  As at June   the appellant reported in her pre sentence report that  her son is currently residing in hospital care due to associated problems with having autism    at page      Reliance on third party reports tendered at sentence       Considerable caution should be exercised in relying on reports containing hearsay material provided by an offender and such evidence should be given limited weight    Appropriate Sentencing Range       The proper approach to sentencing involves the weighing of all relevant factors in order to reach a conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed  In doing so a court should avoid taking a mathematical approach in which there are increments to or decrements from a predetermined range of sentences  Such an approach departs from principle because it does not take into account the fact that there are many conflicting and contradictory elements which bear upon sentencing an offender  It is also wrong because singling out a circumstance and attributing to it a specific numerical or proportionate value distorts the difficult balancing exercise which the sentencing judge must perform  Markarian v The Queen   HCA         ALR    per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ at     and Wong v The Queen   HCA         CLR    at         However  in a simple
