Hilditch Pty Ltd v Dorval Kaiun KK  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBorealis AB v Stargas Ltd   UKHL         AC   By force of ss   and   of the Sea Carriage Documents Act   Hilditch as a lawful holder of the bill of lading for the Yubase   cargo was entitled to assert the rights of the shipper and was subject to its liabilities under the bill of lading  Because Art   of the amended Hague Rules makes the carrier subject to the responsibilities and liabilities and grants it the entitlement to the rights of immunities set out in the Rules as part of the contract of carriage of goods by sea incorporated in the bill of lading  the contractual analysis adopted by Devlin J is apposite here  cf  Borealis AB v Stargas Ltd   UKHL         AC   at           per Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough   Even if Dorval had been entitled to rely on the immunity in Art   r  i  because the causes were at least concurrent  it would have remained liable to Hilditch in damages  I am of opinion  however  that the responsibility for the damage  as a matter of commonsense  was substantively greater on the part of Dorval  Its breach of Art   r   caused the contamination to occur in the first place  The crew of the vessel were in as good a position as Hilditch to see the contamination as the cargo was passing through the ship s manifold  Both the ship s crew and Hilditch s surveyors observed  by sampling at the ship s manifold  the condition of the Yubase oil in its contaminated form  Each had the opportunity to stop the discharge  Neither did  To that extent their contribution to the damage may have been of equal efficacy  but superimposed on that were the obligations of Dorval under Art   r    There was no explanation  for example  how a proper system could have allowed the cargo to be discharged in the state it did  Dorval called no evidence as to how the cargo could have been discharged by the ship in the circumstances where there was evident contamination when it was passing through the ship s manifold which indicated the source was on the ship  I accept Capt Edgerton s evidence that good tanker practice required the valves in the tanks and connecting pipes which could permit the entry of caustic soda into the conveying lines for the Yubase to be sealed when the Yubase was being discharged  It is likely that there was some failure in that sealing process which led to the damage through contamination of the Yubase prior to its discharge from the Golden Lucy I   That being so  had the ship s crew been applying due care and acting under a proper system  they would not have permitted the discharge of the Yubase   to commence or continue without first investigating and stopping the source of the contamination   At the hearing  Dorval only pressed an argument on the exception under Art   r  i  and did not advance any assertion that it relied on any other exception in that rule referred to in the parties  filed statement of

unless the delivery of one part of the bill of lading  duly assigned  had the same effect as the delivery of all the parts would have had   His Lordship observed that he had never been able to learn

opinion that Hilditch became a lawful holder of the bill of lading for the purposes of the Sea Carriage Documents Act   This is because it had come into possession of the bill  in good faith  as a

ship did not properly and carefully discharge the Yubase    It permitted the admixture  The exceptions in Art   r   and particularly Art   r  i  simply cannot be engaged by a carrier who seeks to assert  as Dorval did here  that the cargo interest must direct it in performing its responsibilities under Art   r     Article   r   expressly prohibits a carrier contracting out of its responsibilities and liabilities under the amended Hague Rules  I am of opinion that Dorval s contention that Hilditch had a responsibility to stop Dorval discharging when it was in breach of its obligations under Art   r   should be rejected   Mr Kanagasabai and Mr McCarthy both gave evidence that during the discharge operations  the ship s officers observed the taking of samples from the ship s manifold from time to time  They said  and I accept  that each of those samples was contaminated  Each said that not all of the samples which he took were retained  I accept their evidence  I find that it was evident to both the ship s officers and crew and Hilditch s surveyors that the Yubase   was being discharged in a damaged condition and that the damage had occurred on the ship  Hilditch could have asked for the discharge to be halted and the cause of contamination investigated  Mr Kanagasabai did make such a request  but it appears to have been put to one side by him and the ship s officers  Just as obviously  the ship s officers could have  and should have  halted the discharge operation after seeing that the cargo was discharging in a contaminated condition  There is no

the ship or its servants  Quite the contrary  the damage arose because the ship s officers and crew could easily have stopped the discharge but did not  Nor did they explain their failure to give evidence  In Gamlen Chemical   HCA       CLR   Mason and Wilson JJ were considering the Hague Rules  but their comments are equally applicable to the amended Hague Rules  They said that the scheme of the Rules was to impose certain responsibilities and liabilities on the carrier of goods by sea from which it could not contract out  by force of Art   r   but to give it immunity in respect of loss or damage caused otherwise than by negligence for which it is responsible  save in special cases to which they referred  Gamlen Chemical   CLR at     In Gamlen Chemical   CLR at     Mason and Wilson JJ considered the question of concurrent causes of a loss under the Hague Rules  There  the carrier argued that even though in breach of Art III r   the goods had not been properly stowed  it was entitled to the benefit of the exception in Art IV r  c  because the vessel had encountered conditions which amounted to a peril of the sea  The trial judge had found that had the goods been properly stowed  the damage would not have occurred  Thus  the negligent stowage and the perils of the sea were concurrent causes of the loss  Mason and Wilson JJ said     It seems to us that an accurate reflection of these findings requires one to treat the two concurrent causes of the loss as inseparable  and therefore joint  The loss would not have occurred but for the faulty stowage  but on the other hand  the faulty stowage did not cause the loss by itself  On this view  and treating the matter strictly as a matter of construction of the rule  it cannot be said that the damage resulted from a peril of the sea  and the appellant fails   Thus  the carrier could not escape liability by proving the existence of a circumstance excepting it under Art IV r   where its negligence in breach of Art III r   had caused damage to the cargo  Mason and Wilson JJ said that a construction which excepted the carrier from liability in that scenario would denude the obligation imposed by Art III r   of much of its substance  They recognised that a number of the exceptions in Art IV r   involved situations which were beyond the control of the carrier or its servants  They said that any reference in that context to negligence was inappropriate because the events excepted were  of their nature  ones which occurred independently of negligence on the part of the carrier   Mason and Wilson JJ explained   Gamlen Chemical   CLR at      To the extent to which Art  III  r    by using the word  properly  imposes on the carrier a more onerous duty than an absence of negligence then clearly to that extent the immunities described in Art  IV  r    operate to qualify the liability otherwise resting on the carrier  indeed  if this is not the case then as Temperley points out in his monograph  Carriage of Goods by Sea Act      rd ed  p   pa r  q  is not an immunity at all  for it would do no more than shift the onus of proof on to the carrier  On the other hand  if such a line of reasoning seeks to extract a greater symmetry of purpose than the Rules viewed in their entirety will admit  then the proper observation is simply that it must not be thought that the effect of the prefatory words to Art  III  r    is to compel some impact on the scope and operation of the obligation imposed by that rule from every provision in Art  IV   At the end of the day  the question of whether a carrier can rely upon an immunity under Art IV r   must be answered by reference to all the circumstances of a particular case  Gamlen Chemical   CLR at   per Mason and Wilson JJ  Where the facts disclose that a loss was caused by the concurrent effects of an excepted and non excepted circumstance  the carrier remains liable  The carrier will only escape liability if it proves that the loss or damage was caused by an excepted circumstance alone  cannot The Torenia     Lloyd s Rep   at   see also Tetley W  Marine Cargo Claims   rd ed    p     Accordingly  I am of opinion that the predominant responsibility for the damage lies with Dorval  And  even if Hilditch s and Dorval s responsibility for the continuation of the discharge while contamination was occurring on board the Golden Lucy I
