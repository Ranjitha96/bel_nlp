Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission   FCAFC   at     which in turn referred to the case of Commonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR    That case in turn referred to Commonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR    The fountainhead of this jurisprudence  at least in modern times for Australia  is R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR    It is suggested that the role that the Commission has in this case is no different to the role that it had in the other cases in which its participation has been heavily criticized  I will come back to that point in a moment  The application on the part of the Commonwealth was  in effect  sparked by that problem  bearing in mind again the rather trenchant criticism by the Full Court of the lack of the Commonwealth s participation in Peacock   FCAFC   citedCommonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission     FCR   There are several
