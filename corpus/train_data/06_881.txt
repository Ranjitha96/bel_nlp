before me is the judgment of Thomas J in Akai Pty Ltd v Peoples Insurance Co Limited     Lloyd s Rep    In that case his Lordship concluded that Peoples Insurance had not submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales  He held that the judgment of the High Court of Australia   Akai Pty Ltd v Peoples Insurance Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   was not one that was recognised as giving rise to a decision binding on Peoples Insurance in accordance with the rules of private international law operative in England  He concluded that because the parties had freely bargained for the English choice of law and jurisdiction clauses  that bargain should be upheld  unless there were strong reasons for not doing so and should not as a matter of comity give effect to the decision of the High Court of Australia which overrode that bargain and that choice     Lloyd s Rep at    The effect of allowing the Australian proceedings to proceed  his Lordship held  would deprive Peoples Insurance of the results of that bargain by imposing a set of statutory provisions which made the contract much less favourable to the insurer than English law provided   I am of opinion that those threats clearly conveyed that on the basis of English law as evidenced in Akai Pty Ltd v People s Insurance Co Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   the owners would seek to enjoin the further progress of these proceedings and the issue of any statement of claim pursuant to r   of the Admiralty Rules    The basis on which the plaintiff seeks an injunction is  in effect  to preserve the subject matter of such rights as the plaintiff may have  having regularly invoked  as the concession of the unconditional appearance demonstrates  the jurisdiction of this court to decide the in rem proceedings   The power of the court to protect its own processes is one that is not susceptible of definition in closed categories  The purpose for which the court  as a superior court of record  has inherent powers is to protect its processes is so that  inter alia  all persons may approach the court and so that its jurisdiction may be not merely invoked but exercised where it exists   If the defendant were permitted to bring injunctive proceedings in London then on the evidence before me  which is uncontested  it is highly likely that the Commercial List Judge would grant an injunction on the basis and for similar reasons to that granted by Thomas J in Akai Pty Ltd v Peoples Insurance Co Ltd     Lloyd s Rep    If that were to happen then these proceedings would be unable to be pursued by the plaintiff at all and such rights as the plaintiff may have under the laws passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth  and which the public policy of this nation regards as being ones which ought to be able to be availed of

Australia Limited   HCA         CLR   at     Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Kirby JJ said     The counterpart of a court s power to prevent its processes being abused is its power to protect the integrity of those processes once set in motion  see  eg  with respect to the power to grant a Mareva injunction  Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at    See also Ridgeway v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at    And in some cases  it is that counterpart power of protection that authorises the grant of anti suit injunctions  Thus  for example  if  an estate is being administered     or a petition in bankruptcy has been presented     or winding up proceedings have been commenced     an injunction  may be  granted to restrain a person from seeking  by foreign proceedings  to obtain the sole benefit of certain foreign assets    Soci t  Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak   AC   at    See

NSWLR   at     a court may grant an injunction to restrain a person from commencing or continuing foreign proceedings if they  the foreign proceedings  interfere with or have a tendency to interfere with proceedings pending in that court      The inherent power to grant anti suit injunctions is not confined to the examples just given  As with other aspects of that power  it is not to be restricted to defined and closed categories     Rather  it is to be exercised when the administration of justice so demands or  in the context of anti suit injunctions  when necessary for the protection of the court s own proceedings or processes   In Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales   HCA   Gleeson CJ and Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ said at      What amounts to

granted to parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are important considerations in determining whether or not stays should be granted under s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  and

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The proceedings were brought on quickly and the ship was arrested just immediately before its detention by the authorities was about to cease  Since then the solicitors have concentrated on the agitation of the inter jurisdictional dispute  In Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at         the High Court made it quite clear that the pleadings and the rules were not the masters but were the servants of the interests of justice  If by oversight  or because of pressure of time  or otherwise the plaintiff has not hitherto been able clearly to articulate a formulated cause of action which could be maintained in this court but may not be able to be maintained in English courts  there should be some recognition that this court should allow its procedures to be invoked in a regular way and in a way in which rights  that do exist under Australian law  can be articulated and recognised   I was of opinion that in order to protect the processes of this court and its ability to hear and determine what appears to me to be a bona fide dispute between these parties that the injunctive relief that I granted earlier this afternoon was appropriate  While ordinarily one would expect to see the precise definition of the issues in dispute and the controversy for the purposes of identifying the relevant constitutional matter under Chapter III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth in pleadings  r   of the Admiralty Rules recognises that indeed such a course is likely not to occur necessarily immediately the writ is issued  That is why there is a provision for time to be given to a plaintiff  after the writ in rem has issued  and after the defendant has appeared to it  to put on a statement of claim in personam appliedRaymond v Honey   UKHL         AC   Just as the court can protect the efficacy of execution in proceedings which it has not yet decided  it can also protect the ability of persons to approach the court who seek the regular invocation and exercise of its jurisdiction  The law of contempt both in England and Australia enables courts to grant injunctions to protect the administration of justice by protecting them from interferences by outside influences  So  in Raymond v Honey   UKHL         AC   at  D Lord Wilberforce said         any act which is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice  or the lawful process of the court is a contempt of court   His Lordship held     AC at  C  that the actions of prison officers in interfering with the plaintiff s mail by stopping him applying to the High Court in England even though it was only a temporary interference was a contempt   In my opinion it is part of the court s inherent power to protect the efficacy of proceedings already on foot which the Admiralty Rules contemplate can be supplemented by the pleading of a statement of claim  That may include in personam claims and other claims outside those contemplated under the Admiralty Act    Cth   These proceedings  which have been regularly instituted should not be interfered with peremptorily by the threats which the defendant has made to enjoin the plaintiff from proceeding with its rights to invoke and have the court exercise its judicial power referred toRe Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at     Gummow and Hayne JJ with whom  Gleeson CJ and Gaudron J  expressly agreed   CLR at       said that     The central task was to identify the justiciable controversy  In civil proceedings that will ordinarily require close attention to the pleadings  if any  and to the factual basis of each claim   Having regard to the facts articulated in the evidence before me  the factual basis of the claims demonstrate that there is the potential for a controversy that will invoke or be capable of invoking relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  at the very least  in addition to whatever contractual remedies might be available  In my opinion  the plaintiff ought to have a reasonable opportunity in order to do so   No serious opposition was made by the defendant to the application of the plaintiff that it should be allowed till   July   in order to put on a statement of claim were I otherwise to grant an interim injunction  I took the view that the interim injunction that I was minded to grant was one to preserve a particular subject matter  namely  the ability of the plaintiff to invoke and have the court exercise jurisdiction under Acts of the Commonwealth that would not be recognised in English proceedings and which it would then be prevented from being able to litigate  Inter alia  there was the potential  as adverted to by counsel for the plaintiff  of involving brokers as third parties or defendants to the proceedings in personam and that was another consideration that I had in mind when granting the order referred toWalter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This court has recognised that rights
