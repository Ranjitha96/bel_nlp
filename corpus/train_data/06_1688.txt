Dalco   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commissioner contends that there is now no basis upon which the claims asserted in the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim could succeed because         those issues have been ventilated and determined in the District Court proceedings  and     in any event  s   of the ITAA precludes all challenges against the  due making of an assessment  and the nature of the allegations are in fact in substance challenges to the due making of the assessments the subject of the notices  see Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco   HCA         CLR   citedGeneral Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is plain that s  A of the FCA Act is intended to relax the test imposed by General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   as to the circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out or summarily dismissed   Section  A  provides that the Court may exercise that power if the Court is satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or the relevant part of the proceeding  and s  A  explains to a degree when a proceeding should be found to have no reasonable prospect of success   In my judgment  the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim should be dismissed  whether one applies the test prescribed by s  A of the FCA Act  or whether one applies O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   as explained in General Steel Industries   In my view  there is simply no real question to be tried on the issues raised by the Amended Application and by the Amended Statement of Claim in the circumstances of this matter   It is appropriate first to advert briefly to the statutory background or context in which the assessments came to be made and the Notices issued  Section   of the ITAA requires the Commissioner to make an assessment of the taxable income of a taxpayer and of the tax payable thereon  If the Commissioner is not satisfied with the tax information provided by the taxpayer in the tax return furnished by the taxpayer  the Commissioner is empowered by s   to make an assessment of the amount upon which  in the Commissioner s judgment  income tax ought to be levied  Section   then requires that a notice of assessment of the tax to be paid be served on the taxpayer  Section   provides that the validity of any assessment shall not be affected by reason that any of the provisions of the ITAA have not been complied with  Relevantly to the District Court proceedings  for the reasons which are referred to above  s   provides that the production of the Notices under the hand of the Commissioner is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment  and  other than in respect of proceedings under Pt IVC of the TAA by a review or appeal relating to the assessment  is also conclusive evidence of the amount and particulars of the assessments as being correct  The procedure to be followed by a taxpayer dissatisfied with an assessment is the objection and appeal process available under Pt IVC of the TAA referred toTepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Section  A commenced operation on   December    It applies only in relation to  proceedings commenced on or after the commencement day  see item   of Sch   to the Migration Litigation Reform Act     and item   of that Act which inserted s  A into the FCA Act  The Commissioner has submitted that s  A applies in this instance because the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim were filed only on   August   and that the assertion in this proceeding seeking to invalidate the Notices by reason of improper conduct on the part of officers of the respondent was first made only by the  Statement of Claim  filed on   July    The effect of the  Statement of Claim  first filed on   July   would appear  by O   rr   and  A of the Federal Court Rules   to operate from that day as a proceeding commenced on or after that day  see Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     I do not need  however  to decide that question discussedBriglia v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Briglia v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at     Kenny J pointed out that  although s   of the ITAA may operate to preclude a Court from examining the validity of an assessment once a notice of assessment is tendered  it can only operate provided there has been a bona fide attempt by the Commissioner to exercise the power of assessment  the attempt to exercise the assessment power relates to the subject matter of the ITAA  and the exercise of the assessment power is reasonably capable of reference to the Commissioner s power of assessment  That expression of the limitations upon the apparent scope of s   is derived from the observations of Dixon J in R v Hickman  Ex parte Fox   HCA         CLR   at    It is clear from Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   that s   does not  and cannot  deprive the High Court of its constitutional jurisdiction  and to the extent to which this Court is conferred with such jurisdiction under s  B  of the Judiciary Act    Cth  cannot deprive this Court of its jurisdiction under that provision  The so called Hickman principles  based upon the decision in Hickman   and which formed the basis of Kenny J s observations in Briglia   were considered by the High Court in Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR    I do not think it is necessary to explore whether the result of the decision in Plaintiff S  is to explain the application of the Hickman principles in a way which may broaden the capacity of the taxpayer to challenge the due making of an assessment notwithstanding s    That is simply because  in my view  on any analysis of the allegations made by Mr Jewiss in the Amended Application and in the Amended Statement of Claim  they cannot establish relevantly a failure on the part of the Commissioner in the due making of the assessments referred toR v Hickman  Ex parte Fox

Australian Federal Police   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my judgment  the matters which Mr Jewiss now raises in the Amended Application and in the Amended Statement of Claim correspond with the allegations made in the District Court proceedings  including on his appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia  It would be an abuse of the Court s processes to permit Mr Jewiss to re litigate in this proceeding the same matters that have previously been determined by the District Court  cf Shumack v Commissioner  Australian Federal Police   FCA   at     There is no prospect of Mr Jewiss now succeeding on those claims because they have already been decided adversely to him referred toEffem Foods Pty Ltd v Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Ltd  Receivers and Managers appointed in Liquidation      ALR   The parties in the District Court proceedings and in this proceeding are the same  The allegations generally under the umbrella of bad faith are the same  They relate to the circumstances of and conduct at the search of Mr Jewiss  premises  conduct subsequent to the raid in respect of Mr Jewiss  and use of documents which are allegedly known to be false in making the assessments and issuing the Notices  Those issues were all raised by Mr Jewiss in the District Court proceedings  They have been resolved adversely to him  There is no reason why he should be permitted to re litigate those matters  It is in precisely such circumstances that the Court in other matters has found there to have been an abuse of process of the Court and to have exercised the power to have dismissed the proceedings  see e g  Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Ltd  Receivers and Managers appointed in Liquidation      ALR   at    As Dixon J observed in Blair v Curran   HCA         CLR   at      A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once and for all of the issue  so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies  referred toBlair v Curran   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The parties in the District Court

v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I note that such a course was adopted in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia     FCR   on the basis of an Anshun type estoppel  see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    I accept that  in many cases where the claim is made that there is an estoppel by judgment or an issue estoppel or an Anshun type estoppel  it is more appropriate for those issues to be determined on pleadings rather than by the summary dismissal of proceedings  But I consider that this case is a clear one  where Mr Jewiss has previously raised and had a full opportunity to ventilate the very matters which he has sought to raise by way of his Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim and those issues have been determined against him  There is no reason why he should be given a further opportunity to re ventilate those issues in the present proceeding   In this matter  I do not think there is scope for the Anshun principle to be applied  simply because in my judgment the issues now sought to be raised by Mr Jewiss are the same issues as those he sought to raise in the District Court proceedings and upon which an adjudication adverse to those claims has been made  It is not a matter of him raising matters now which he did not  but could have  raised in the earlier proceedings  cf Anshun at      It is simply a matter of him now making the same allegations  Perhaps to a minor degree Mr Jewiss now asserts the availability of further or different evidence in support of those allegations than that which he adduced at the hearing before the District Court  but that is to a degree speculative  Even if it were so  the issues themselves have been determined  They have been determined adversely to Mr Jewiss   For those reasons  in my judgment  the claim in the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim have no prospect of success  They have already been decided against Mr Jewiss  Those claims are therefore an abuse of process and should be dismissed   I also accept the contentions of counsel for the Commissioner  that in significant respects the allegations now  and previously made  by Mr Jewiss could not give rise to invalidity of the assessments and of the Notices  The power of search and seizure exists under s   of the ITAA  It is not a power which is to be construed in the same way as a search warrant  It does not require routinely the production of a written authority to support the exercise of the power  There was no obligation to produce the written authority in support of the search unless requested  and no request was made  s    The fact that Mr Jewiss was not present when the search was carried out does not support any suggestion that it was an improper investigation  The way in which that part of the investigation was carried out was not itself capable of affecting the validity of the assessments or of the Notices  The complaint of the lack of opportunity to assert legal professional privilege in respect of the seized documents is not supported by any evidentiary allegation  It is simply a general allegation which is not made out  It does not in any event go to the validity of the Notices  In addition  as noted above  there is nothing to connect the decision making process in respect of the Notices with those involved in the search and seizure processes or the method of their implementation
