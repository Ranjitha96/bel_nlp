Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  As to inferences  Sundberg  Emmett and Finkelstein JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi   FCA       ALD   said this        The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law  Likewise  the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law  That is because  before the inference is drawn  there is a preliminary question as to whether the evidence reasonably admits a difference conclusion  Accordingly  in the context of judicial review  the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law  On the other hand  there is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact  Even if the reasoning whereby the Court reached its conclusion of fact were demonstrably unsound  that would not amount to an error of law  A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process  for example  by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning  Thus  at common law  want of logic is not synonymous with error of law  So long as the particular inference is reasonably open  even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning  there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place quotedcitedNAHI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The satisfaction or otherwise of whether the appellant is a person to whom Australia owes protection obligations on the ground of a contended well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason might be determined by the Tribunal in the purported exercise of the statutory review function in a way that reveals a failure to reach findings supported by any evidence or reveals findings based on inferences drawn by the Tribunal from facts that do not support those findings  as a matter of law  Such a determination might be characterised as irrational  illogical  arbitrary  capricious or made according to humour or private opinion rather than by reference to a reason or justice  Such a decision is unreasonable  However  for present purposes  I use each of these terms to describe a decision of the Tribunal based on findings unsupported by any evidence or based upon findings thought to be supported by inferences drawn from primary facts where those inferences are not open as a matter of law  Decisions made by the Tribunal in such circumstances are not made in the performance of the duty imposed on the Tribunal by the Act and thus involve jurisdictional error  Such decisions do not simply reflect insufficiency or inadequacy of evidence but rather an absence of any foundation in fact for the state of satisfaction or otherwise of the Minister or decision maker  As to the role of independent country information  the Full Court of this Court per Gray  Tamberlin and Lander JJ in NAHI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     said this at             There can be no objection in principle to the Tribunal relying on  country information   The weight that it gives to such information is a matter for the Tribunal itself  as part of its fact finding function  Such information as the Tribunal obtains for itself is not restricted to  guidance  as the appellants submitted  It may be used to assess the credibility of a claim of a well founded fear of persecution  It is not  as the first appellant submitted  an error of law or a jurisdictional error for the Tribunal to base a decision on  country information  that is not true  The question of the accuracy of the  country information  is one for the Tribunal not for the Court  If the Court were to make its own assessment of the truth of  country information  it would be engaging in merits review  The Court does not have power to do that   In analysing in NAHI the extent to which the Tribunal relied upon country information in reaching its decision and the relationship between findings on credit and the use of country information  the Tribunal said this at         The appellants  submissions asserted that the Tribunal rejected all of the appellant s claims on the basis of  country information   The Tribunal s reasons for decision do not substantiate this assertion  It is plain that the Tribunal relied to a substantial extent on the inherent probability of some aspects of the first appellant s story  inconsistencies between different parts of his story and the fact of his frequent returns to Sri Lanka and the length of his sojourns there  to form its views about his credibility  In turn  it relied on its assessment of the first appellant s credibility in determining whether it accepted some of the  country information       The very function of the Tribunal was to assess the appellants  claims  both as to their inherent credibility and as to their consistency with other information known to the Tribunal about circumstances in the appellants  country of origin   emphasis added  The central matter therefore is to assess whether there was material before the Tribunal upon which it was entitled to rely as a result of the process it undertook in weighing the merits of the appellant s claims   The appellant arrived in Australia in August   and lodged an application for a protection visa on   August   supported by a six page handwritten statement of those matters said to demonstrate a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  The application document contains a short answer to question    Why did you leave  India  to which the appellant said  I had political and commercial problems in India  If I go back to India the police and local political people try to kill me
