Walker on behalf of The Noonukul of Minjerrabah v Queensland   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Unlike O   r   which applies generally  s  C is clearly limited to native title determination applications under the Act  The language of s  C and O   r   is dissimilar in that s  C refers to  strike out  of the application  whereas O   r   deals with permanent stay or summary dismissal of the proceedings  Further  the issues of which proof is required under each provision differs in that s  C applies where an application does not comply with ss      A or   whereas O   r   is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed  the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious  or the proceeding is an abuse of process  To that extent  s  C is concerned with matters of form and authority rather than the merit of any native title determination  Branson J in Bodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR   at     The cautious approach of the Court as described in Williams   FCAFC   was more recently reaffirmed by the Full Court in Bodney   FCR at   where Stone J  with whom

McKenzie v State Government of South Australia     ALR   at   citedBooth v State of Queensland   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The importance of the authorisation of a claim was emphasised by Tamberlin J in Booth v State of Queensland   FCA   at       where his Honour said in relation to that case    The applicant must be authorised by all members of the Native Title Claim Group  In the present application the persons who compromise the Native Title Claim Group are not identified either by name or by reference or by any sufficient description   There is also a lack of evidence that the Native Title Claim Group  which is alleged to have authorised Mr Booth  had any applicable traditional decision making process or that any particular process was followed  There is no evidence that the Native Title Claim Group agreed to and adopted some other decision making process in relation to authorising the applicant to make the application  Nor is there any evidence that the process has been recognised or that any process has been followed   These comments are equally applicable in the case before me  Other than an assertion by the applicant that the late Oodgeroo  the late Kath Walker  has authorised the applicant to make the application  and that such authorisation is through  Traditional Custom and Lore  there is no evidence that the applicant is authorised by the claim group  even to the extent that the claim group in this case can be identified  No details of the decisions that the claim group made are provided  There is no evidence of the process  or that any particular process was recognised or followed by the claim group  cf Booth   FCA   at       I again note the affidavit of Ms Waters which states that the Oodgeroo descendants are part of the Gonzales family group  one of   family groups forming the Quandamooka Claim group  QSNTS has submitted that there is no suggestion that the smaller family group  the Oodgeroo group  could establish particular rights and interests which the larger Quandamooka Claim group cannot  Further  I note the affidavits filed by Jonathon Patrick Malone sworn   January   and Edward Ruska sworn   February   who depose that they are members of the Noonukul of Minjerrabah and that they did not authorise the making of the Noonukul Application and were not advised of or involved in the process of authorisation citedBriggs on behalf of the Gumbangirri People v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As pointed out by Mansfield J in Landers   FCR at      The proper identification of the native title claim group is the central focus or focal issue of a native title determination application  It is the native title claim group which provides authorisation under s  B   and it is the group on whose behalf the claim is then pursued and  if successful  in whose favour a determination of native title is then made    cf Briggs on behalf of the Gumbangirri People v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales   FCA         FCR   at    citedDieri People v State of South Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I agree with the submission of QSNTS that the group is not described sufficiently so as to allow one to ascertain whether any particular person is in that group  cf Dieri People v State of South Australia   FCA         FCR   at   Harrington Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia  No     FCA   at          Indeed  if anything  the descriptions of claimants provided in various places in the application are contradictory in that  the members of the family bloodline groups to the island of Minjerribah and the waters of Quandamooka  is clearly a larger group than the  identified descendants of Oodgeroo the Late Kath Walker   I note in this regard the affidavit of Ms Waters  consultant historian  sworn   January   where she deposes that   family groups make up the Quandamooka Claim groups   Accordingly in my view  and in circumstances where  despite the applicant s non appearance in Court  the applicant has had an opportunity to put forward evidence in relation to this and other issues  I am satisfied that not only is there a lack of clarity as to the persons who make up the claim group  but that in any event the applicant was not authorised to make the application on behalf of such people of the claim group as have been identified  It therefore appears that the applicant is not authorised to make an application on behalf of all of the claim group  If the applicant represents a family subgroup which claims to hold native title  it is not the group which holds the common or group rights or interests within s   of the Act   Risk v National Native Title Tribunal   FCA   at     Dieri   FCR at   Hillig   FCA   at     citedHarrington Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v

Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  QSNTS submits that if the claim group has not been properly identified in accordance with s     then it is not possible for the claim to be authorised in a manner which complies with ss       and s  B   even if the requirements in s  B are met  QSNTS cites Hillig as administrator of the Wormi Local Aboriginal Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales  No     FCA   at   in support   QSNTS further submits that in any event  the Noonukul Application does not meet the authorisation requirements of s   and s  B  Indeed  QSNTS submit that there is simply no evidence presented that any type of authorisation process was followed to authorise the making of the Noonukul Application   Part A s   of the Form   of the Native Title Act  Native Title Determination Application Claimant Application  provides for details about authorisation  The applicant asserts in that part of the Noonukul Application that    This Application has been authorised pursuant to s  B a  of the Native Title Act          The Applicant has been authorised to make this application for a claim over the determination area through Traditional Custom and Lore by the authority of the late Oodgeroo the late Kath Walker and carry out the business pertaining to it   Accordingly in my view  and in circumstances where  despite the applicant s non appearance in Court  the applicant has had an opportunity to put forward evidence in relation to this

Notwithstanding these distinctions  the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike out under s  C with those of summary dismissal under O   r    As observed by Lander J  North and Dowsett JJ agreeing  in Williams v Grant   FCAFC         Section  C only applies to applications which do not comply with ss      A and     However  an application under s  C  if successful  has the very serious consequence that the native title application is struck out  Such a result is akin to a court proceeding being summarily dismissed  or at least dismissed before any hearing on the merits  No court proceeding is summarily dismissed except in a very clear case  Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner   HCA         CLR   at   per Dixon J  General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways   HCA         CLR   at       Applications for native title are brought by representatives of the native title claim group  The dismissal of an application because  for example  the applicant has not been authorised means the dismissal of the native title claim group s claim  The repercussions  therefore  are far reaching  I see no reason why an application to strike out a native title claim under s  C should be treated any differently to any other application to dismiss a claim summarily  The power should be exercised sparingly and with caution  and only when the Court is satisfied that the moving party has made out a clear case that the applicant has not complied with the relevant section and cannot  by amending the application  comply  Section  C assumes that a party might respond to a strike out application by amending the claim to comply with the requirements of the Act  A claim can be amended without obtaining leave   The cautious approach of the Court as described
