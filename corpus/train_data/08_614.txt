Liang   HCA   Indeed  the Tribunal s reasons set forth a detailed account of the evidence before it and a detailed account as to its   Findings and reasons   based upon the evidence  Findings were made on   material questions of fact   and reference made to the evidence upon which those findings were based  The reasons of the Tribunal  it is considered    inform   the Appellant  and others  as to why the application for review was unsuccessful  Those reasons are not to be scrutinised in any   over zealous   manner seeking to discern some inadequacy by the way in which the reasons have been expressed  cf Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA       CLR   at   per Brennan CJ  Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ   The second Ground of Appeal is also rejected   The third Ground of Appeal asserts a jurisdictional error by reason of the fact that the Tribunal   mentioned that    the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant s business suffered losses as a result of a harm from Hindu    and thereafter the fact that the Tribunal   mentioned that the Tribunal has accepted that the applicant s business has suffered losses in India and has been forced to close

Section  A a  excludes from the operation of s  A information   that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member    This provision imposes one test and does not contain two disjunctive elements  that is to say  the provision is referring to information that is not specifically about an applicant or another person  such as a witness  but is   by way of contradistinction about a class of persons of which an applicant or the other person is a member   Minister for Immigration

exposes information that is   not specifically about   the Appellant   The   information   set forth by the Tribunal contains an outline of the formation of the   People s War Group   its aims and ideology and an extract of a United States Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices     Further   information   is also set forth by the Tribunal as to freedom of religion in India and a Report from the UK Home Office on communal violence  None of this   information   refers at all to the Appellant followedRe Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The findings of fact made by the Tribunal were findings open to it  especially bearing in mind the adverse findings which had been made as to credit  If a tribunal does not believe a particular witness  no detailed reasons need be given for those adverse findings  Re Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA       ALR    Justice McHugh there concluded      In addition  the prosecutor alleges that the Tribunal breached s  by failing to set out reasons for its finding that the prosecutor s claim that members of PLOTE tried to recruit him were  utterly implausible   However  this was essentially a finding as to whether the prosecutor should be believed in his claim    a finding on credibility which is the function of the primary decision maker par excellence  If the primary decision maker has stated that he or she does not believe a particular witness  no detailed reasons need to be given as to why that particular witness was not believed  The Tribunal must give the reasons for its decision  not the sub set of reasons why it accepted or rejected individual

CLR     SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       FCA       ALR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ   Even if the deficiencies in the Notice of Appeal be left to one side  a review of the terms of the   April   letter and the terms of the decision of the reconstituted Tribunal does not reveal any relevant   information   which should have been brought to the Appellant s attention and which was not referred to in the letter  In particular  it should be noted that the term   information   in s  A  does not extend to   the existence of doubts  inconsistencies or the absence of evidence   SZBYR v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       FCA       ALR   at    Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ there held        if the reason why the tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the tribunal s disbelief of the appellants  evidence arising from inconsistencies therein  it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting  information  within the meaning of para  a  of s  A   Again  if the tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants  evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus  it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute  information   Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word  information      does not encompass the tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes or determinations     nor does it extend to identified gaps  defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps  etc     If the contrary were true  s  A would in effect oblige the tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process  However broadly  information  be defined  its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation  not the existence of doubts  inconsistencies or the absence of evidence  The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant  information  was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief  as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself   This may have been what was envisaged by the Appellant  The grounds of the application as made to the Federal Magistrates Court similarly contended that there had been a failure to comply with s  A and separately contended that the Tribunal had not informed   the applicant regarding the inconsistent evidence    It may be that the Appellant sought to combine these contentions into the first Ground of Appeal   But that is speculation  Even if that was what was intended  there has been no failure to inform the Appellant of the inconsistencies relied upon and no failure to comply with s  A citedSZJJC v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  A reconstituted Tribunal heard the application and again the decision not to grant a Protection  Class XA  Visa was affirmed  Again the Tribunal made adverse findings as to the applicant s credit  The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application to review this subsequent decision of the Tribunal  SZJJC v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA     The proceeding presently before this Court is an appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  The Grounds of Appeal seek to raise three contentions  namely   i  that there has been a breach of s  A  and   of the Migration Act    Cth   ii  that there has been a breach of s   of the   Act  and    iii  that the Tribunal made a   jurisdictional error when the Tribunal mentioned that   the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant s business suffered losses as a result of a harm from Hindu   Then the Tribunal mentioned that the Tribunal has accepted that the applicant s business has suffered losses in India and has been forced to close      None of these Grounds has been made out and the appeal is  accordingly  dismissed  No error has been demonstrated in respect to the reasons for decision of the learned Federal Magistrate   The Appellant appeared before the Court this afternoon unrepresented  although he did have the assistance of an interpreter followedVHAJ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  This class of   information   is that which falls within s  A a  VHAJ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       FCR    Justice Kenny there referred to information about entry rights of non nationals and considered that such information was   just about   a class of persons  Her Honour continued      In reaching this conclusion  it is helpful to consider other instances in which a similar question has arisen  One example is country information  It is usual for the Tribunal to have regard to information about the social  political  religious and other conditions prevailing in a country relevant to an applicant s claim for refugee status  with a view to assessing whether other individuals who share his or her racial  religious  political  social or other attributes suffer treatment of a kind amounting to persecution on Convention grounds in that country  Sometimes information of this kind concerns religious practice  government elections  educational opportunities or other matters  This kind of country information is relevant to the Tribunal s decision making task only because the applicant falls within the class of persons who share an attribute  which  according to his or her claim  gives rise to a well founded fear of persecution in the country concerned  In this circumstance  the information does not cease to be information  just about  a class of persons simply because it can also be characterised as information about religious practice  government elections or educational opportunities  It has been repeatedly held that information of this kind falls within para A a  of the  Migration  Act        Justice Downes agreed  His Honour considered that   Official and semi official information contained in documents assessing conditions in countries from which persons seeking refugee status regularly come     has been held to fall within para  A a    at     In any event  it should be noted that the Tribunal disbelieved the evidence of the now Appellant as to his association with the   People s War Group    The Tribunal s relevant finding was as follows  Having considered this evidence  the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is  or has been  a member of the PWG  Nor does the Tribunal accept that the applicant has been a member of the All India Revolutionary Students Federation  AIRSF  or a member of the Communist Party of India  The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has been targeted or in any way harmed by police or Hindus generally because of his involvement or association with the PWG or that he has been targeted by the PWG because he has attempted to resign from the PWG and or because he has attempted to join other political parties  The Tribunal also does not accept that the applicant lost a child as a result of his membership or association with the PWG  that his house was bombed or that his wife was harmed as a result of his membership association with the PWG   The first Ground of Appeal is thus rejected
