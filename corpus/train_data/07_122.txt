Snelgrove v Roskell   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAdams v Lambert   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Adams v Lambert  Adams    HCA         ALR   the High Court held that a misdescription of the statutory source of an entitlement to claim interest on a judgment debt was a formal defect or irregularity within the purview of s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   the Act   However  in the present proceedings  Federal Magistrate Driver found that a misdescription of the statute under which post judgment interest was claimed was a substantial defect in the bankruptcy notice which could not be cured by reference to that provision   Thus  the learned Federal Magistrate s decision appears  at first sight  to be at odds with the unanimous judgment of the High Court in Adams  The principal question which arises on this appeal  therefore  is whether his Honour correctly applied the principles stated by the High Court   In deciding that the defect was substantive  Driver FM had regard to the certificate supporting the bankruptcy notice which stated that interest was not payable on the amount claimed whereas the bankruptcy notice claimed interest in the sum of       His Honour accepted that this was a claim for post judgment interest but he took into account the terms of an earlier bankruptcy notice served on the debtor which made no claim for interest  His Honour concluded that this  coupled with the misdescription of the statute under which post judgment interest was claimed  and an incorrect reference in the costs certificate to a provision in the Legal Profession Act    NSW  dealing with pre judgment interest  would have left the debtor  hopelessly confused  as to what was necessary to comply with the notice   The creditor appeals against his Honour s order dismissing the petition  He seeks an order under s   of the Act  However  if the appeal is allowed a difficulty arises because the creditor s petition appears to have lapsed under s   of the Act  in the circumstances referred to below   The appellant  Mr Snelgrove  is a solicitor  In legal proceedings which appear to have a long history dating back to the  s  he represented a company of which Mr Roskell was a shareholder and director  The proceedings were unsuccessful  the company went in to liquidation  and Mr Snelgrove claimed his costs from Mr Roskell personally   Driver FM found at   that in the course of the proceedings Mr Roskell agreed to become personally liable for the costs  although he later sought to dispute his liability  As a result  Mr Snelgrove brought proceedings against Mr Roskell in the Supreme Court of New South Wales   On   May   a costs assessor of that Court issued a certificate as to determination of costs in the amount of      This was the certificate upon which bankruptcy notice NN  was founded   His Honour heard Mr Snelgrove s creditor s petition against Mr Roskell on   August   prior to the decision of the High Court in Adams  The petition was filed on   April     The only ground on which Mr Roskell opposed the petition was that he was not personally liable for the debt  His Honour satisfied himself that this objection had no substance but during the hearing he raised two issues concerning the validity of the bankruptcy notice  Mr Roskell was not legally represented and was happy to adopt those points as grounds of opposition to the petition  see at     The first ground was that the certificate stated that interest was not payable on the amount of costs assessed but the bankruptcy notice claimed interest of       The second ground was the incorrect statement of the statutory source of liability for post judgment interest   Having raised both of these issues  his Honour adjourned the matter pending delivery of the judgment by the High Court in Adams  A fter the decision in Adams was handed down  Driver FM called for written submissions to be delivered by the parties by   April     He then determined the matter  delivering judgment on   June     When his Honour handed down judgment he noted  at footnote   that there may be a third error in the bankruptcy notice because of the illegible certificate of judgment attached to the notice  He noted that judgment was entered in the Local Court on   June   but queried whether the annexure satisfied the description of a certificate of judgment  However  this issue was not raised before Driver FM and his Honour did not deal with it   His Honour described the bankruptcy notice and the certificate of judgment attached to it as  scrappy    It was in this context that he went on to deal with the two errors that he had identified   His Honour seems to have proceeded on the basis that the statement in the costs certificate that interest was not payable was an error  He described it as an error in   although he accepted the appellant s submission that it was a reference to pre judgment interest  It would have followed from this that the statement was perfectly correct  the only error being the incorrect reference to s  E of the Legal Profession Act    Indeed  his Honour went on to say that if the correct provision of the Legal Profession Act had been identified  Mr Roskell could probably have worked out that the statement in the costs certificate referred only to pre judgment interest   His Honour then referred to the second error  namely the statement in the interest calculation attached to the bankruptcy notice  that interest was claimed under s   of the District Court Act   He referred in this regard to the fact that the reference to the District Court  Civil Claims  Act had been struck out   The learned Federal Magistrate then went on to deal with these errors upon the footing that they were compounded by the fact that this was the second bankruptcy notice served on Mr Roskell  see at     The substance of his Honour s reasons appears in the following two paragraphs as follows      Mr Roskell was then confronted with a second bankruptcy notice which claimed a smaller principal sum than the first bankruptcy notice but which included a claim of interest in the sum of     making a total of      In my opinion  a debtor in the position of Mr Roskell would have been left hopelessly confused  Interest was initially not claimed and then claimed  The certificate of judgment annexed to both bankruptcy notices appeared to indicate that no interest was payable     It would have been next to impossible for him to check his liability because both the certificate of judgment and the bankruptcy notice referred to incorrect statutory provisions        It is true that Mr Roskell could have disputed the claim of interest on the second bankruptcy notice by giving notice pursuant to s    He did not do so  However  in my view  the bankruptcy notice  coupled with the costs certificate and the earlier bankruptcy notice was so confusing as to have left Mr Roskell in no position to determine whether he was entitled to make such a claim  Notice pursuant to s   must be given before the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice expires  It is now too late for such a notice to be given  In my view  the confusion created by the errors in the second bankruptcy notice and its attached certificate gave rise to confusion resulting in injustice which is now irremediable  It follows that the defects are substantive and not formal and cannot be corrected pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act    The High Court said in Adams at   that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Bankruptcy Act or the Regulations  the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s    If it is  it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court  It must be borne in mind that these are separate and distinct questions   The first question  that is  whether the defect or irregularity is formal  involves two levels of enquiry  These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   and applied in Adams at  ff   The relevant enquiry is  does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations  or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  see Kleinwort Benson at   Adams at     Moreover  consistently with the observation of the Court in Adams   it cannot be said that a mistaken reference to the section of the Legal Profession Act could be said to have been an essential requirement for validity of the notice or to have misled the debtor as to what was necessary to comply with it   Upon the proper construction of the bankruptcy notice as a whole  it was plain that interest was being claimed only post judgment  The notice stated in express terms that judgment was entered in the Local Court on   June   and that interest was claimed for the period from   June   to   December    This appeared in  b  and  c  of the interest calculation attached to the notice  The summary of interest calculation in  c  set out precisely how the amount of     was calculated for that period   The bankruptcy notice in the present case is therefore indistinguishable from the notice in Adams   That is to say the only defect was the second error identified by Driver FM  namely an incorrect citation of the source of entitlement to post judgment interest  That was a formal defect within the purview of s   of the Act  not a substantive one as found by the Federal Magistrate  see Adams at       There was no suggestion in the present case that post judgment interest was incorrectly calculated  Indeed the figure seems to have been correct  the rate prescribed under the District Court Act being exactly the same as that prescribed from time to time under the Local Courts  Civil Claims  Act    The learned Federal Magistrate s view that a debtor in Mr Roskell s position would have been hopelessly confused cannot  with respect  be sustained  As I have already said  the bankruptcy notice  considered as a whole  made it plain that interest was only claimed for the period after judgment   Mr Roskell asserted that the errors in the bankruptcy notice  when viewed together  were sufficient to render it invalid  He referred in his written submissions to the citation of the wrong statutory provisions and the fact that interest was claimed notwithstanding the note in the costs certificate that interest was not claimed  These submissions are contrary to the plain construction of the notice and to the observations of the High Court in Adams   Mr Roskell also contended that a certificate of judgment was not annexed to the bankruptcy notice  I will deal with that issue below   Mr Roskell appeared in person on the appeal  He argued  strenuously and with apparent conviction  that he was not personally liable for the costs  or at very least that the amount was overstated   In summary therefore  in my opinion the learned Federal Magistrate failed to correctly apply the principles stated in Adams   The only defect in the bankruptcy notice was a formal one which fell within the purview of s    There was no substantial injustice caused by the defect   Mr Roskell did not file a notice of contention in accordance with O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   However  he submitted that  a copy of the record of judgement  sic  was not attached to the bankruptcy notice  Since he was not legally represented  I took this to be a submission to the effect that the notice was affected by a defect  analogous to the further issue mentioned by the Federal Magistrate and which I set out above at    This was whether the costs certificate satisfied the description of a certificate of judgment  Accordingly  I propose to grant leave to Mr Roskell  nunc pro nunc  to raise this submission without the need to file a notice of contention   Here the petition was presented on   April   but  at the creditor s request  the Federal Magistrate adjourned it pending the delivery of judgment in Adams   At the time when the adjournment was granted  no consideration seems to have been given to the question of the lapsing date of the petition   The Federal Magistrate s order dismissing the petition was made on   June   more than twelve months after the petition was presented   Nor was any application apparently made before the lapsing date for an extension of time under s   citedClyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   In determining whether a bankruptcy notice could reasonably mislead a debtor the court is not confined to an examination of the notice  it may look at facts extraneous to the notice  including the terms of an earlier bankruptcy notice served on the debtor  see Re Wimborne  Ex parte the Debtor     ALR    Lockhart J  Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ALR    Lockhart J  Roufos v Andrea     FLR   at      Deane  Fisher   Fitzgerald JJ  citedFranks v Warringah Council   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The form prescribed by the Bankruptcy Regulations requires the notice to attach a copy of the judgment or order relied upon  see Reg     and Form   see also Franks v Warringah Council   FCA         FCR   at      The schedule to Form   provides  in note   that if legal costs are claimed in the notice  a certificate of the assessed costs must be attached to the notice  The certificate is  upon filing in the office or registry of a court of competent jurisdiction  taken to be a judgment of that Court for the amount of the unpaid costs  Legal Profession Act   s  J    However  a certificate that sets out a determination of the costs assessor  without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction  is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice  Franks at     Here  there was evidence in the affidavit of Mr Snelgrove filed on   July   that judgment was entered in the Local Court on   June    Also Ms Rachel Menassa s affidavit of   December   deposes to the fact that a certificate of judgment was obtained from the Local Court on   June   and she annexes that document to her affidavit  This was the backsheet from the Local Court with the attached costs certificate in the same form as was annexed to the bankruptcy notice   It follows in my view that there was evidence before the Federal Magistrate that the costs certificate was filed in a court of competent jurisdiction  It is therefore taken to be a judgment of the Local Court and it was annexed to the bankruptcy notice  This was sufficient to found the notice   Section   of the Act provides that a creditor s petition lapses twelve months after the date of presentation  unless before that time a sequestration order is made or the petition is dismissed or withdrawn   Provision is made for an extension of the twelve month period but s   provides  expressly  for the extension to be obtained before the expiration of the initial twelve month period followedKleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The first question  that is  whether the defect or irregularity is formal  involves two levels of enquiry  These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   and applied in Adams at  ff   The relevant enquiry is  does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations  or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  see Kleinwort Benson at   Adams at   citedMakhoul v Barnes     FCR   However  the learned Federal Magistrate declined to exercise his discretion to go behind the judgment  satisfying himself that there was no substance in Mr Roskell s objection  It is true that in an appropriate case  where substantial reasons are shown  the Court may exercise a discretion to go behind the judgment debt  see Wren v Mahony   HCA         CLR   at     Makhoul v Barnes     FCR   at      But in the present case  no error has been demonstrated in the Federal Magistrate s determination of this question referred toProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Regulation     and Form   of the Bankruptcy Regulations    Cth  requires the bankruptcy notice to state the provision under which interest is being claimed  Here  interest was not being claimed on pre judgment costs  Accordingly  I do not see how the Regulations contained any requirement with respect to this statement  let alone one which would strike down as invalid an act done in breach of it within the principles stated in
