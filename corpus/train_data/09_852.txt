Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Axis International Management Pty Ltd   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAinsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Court s discretion under s   of the FCA  is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power   Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at    Accordingly  this Court s original jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by ASIC is found in either s  B of the Act or s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth   The question is whether this proceeding involves a  matter  within the meaning of those provisions  Owston accepts that declaratory relief is often given on the motion of a regulator  but it says that usually a declaration is only granted in conjunction with substantive relief which is in its nature either protective such as by the grant of injunctive relief or corrective advertising orders or alternatively a punishment by awarding  for example  civil penalties  It contends that a bare declaration will be made only in rare circumstances  absent other relief that gives effect to a right or obligation  It cites Gaudron J in Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Limited   HCA         CLR   at       There may be cases where a bare declaration that some legal requirement has been contravened will serve to redress some or all of the harm brought about by that contravention  Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   was such a case  But a declaration cannot be made if it  will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties     That is not simply a matter of discretion  Rather  a declaration that produces no foreseeable consequences is so divorced from the administration of the law as not to involve a matter for the purposes of Ch III of the Constitution   And as it is not a matter for those purposes  it cannot engage the judicial power of the Commonwealth   See Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ   Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   was cited by Owston in support of the proposition that the Court may not be  forced to consider a hypothetical situation where its decision will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties   Jododex is not authority for such a proposition  Rather  this formulation reflects the language of the joint judgment in Ainsworth at p   adopting what had been said in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse   HCA         CLR   at   as to a hypothetical question and in Gardner v Dairy Industry Authority  NSW      ALJR   at   as to  foreseeable consequences   It is also the formulation adopted by Gaudron J in Truth About Motorways at    Gibbs J at   in Jododex said that the jurisdiction to make a declaration is a very wide one  Jododex is  as was also approved by the majority judgment in Ainsworth  authority  at   that the power of superior courts to grant declaratory relief is discretionary which  it is neither possible nor desirable to fetter     by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise   The jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is wide  In JN Taylor Holdings Ltd  in liq  v Bond     SASR   at     there is a useful collection of relevant authority to that effect  King CJ  with whom Prior and Perry JJ agreed observed    Authoritative judicial statements make it clear that the jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is very wide and that judicial pronouncements appearing to restrict the circumstances in which such relief will be granted relate to the sound exercise of the discretion rather than to jurisdiction  Ibeneweka v Egbuna     WLR   at   Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd esp per Gibbs J at   Salmar Holdings Pty Ltd v Hornsby Shire Council     NSWLR   per Mason JA at    It is not necessary that the plaintiff have a cause of action against the defendant  Guaranty Trust Company of New York v Hannay and Co     KB    A statement by Lord Sterndale MR in Hanson v Radcliffe Urban District Council     Ch   at   quoted by Gibbs J in Forster v Jododex at   appeared to confine the otherwise unlimited character of the jurisdiction to cases involving  a question of defining the rights of two parties   As was pointed out  however  by Street CJ in Johnco Nominees Pty Ltd v Albury Wodonga  NSW  Corporation     NSWLR   at   that statement was made  at a time when the declaratory jurisdiction had not achieved the full development manifested in the last   or   years   By   the Privy Council could say in Rediffusion  Hong Kong  Ltd v Attorney General of Hong Kong   AC   at   that to exclude the jurisdiction it must appear  that the questions were purely abstract questions the answers to which were incapable of affecting any existing or future legal rights of the plaintiffs   emphasis mine   In Johnco Nominees Pty Ltd v Albury Wodonga  NSW  Corporation  above  Street CJ  at   repudiated the notion of jurisdictional cut off points in relation to declaratory relief  Moffitt P said  at     The proper conclusion to be drawn concerning the power to make a declaration is that the jurisdiction  in the strict sense  to grant declaratory relief in a properly constituted action is very wide  so that no particular limitation can be pointed to         I can find no warrant for the imposition by the courts of a self denying restriction on their jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief  In my opinion there is no jurisdictional limit  The court s power to grant such relief is  only limited by its own discretion    Hanson v Radcliffe at   and the boundaries of judicial power  Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at     citedAnn Street Mezzanine Pty Limited  in liq  v Beck     ALR  Second  there is a real risk of the same facts being re litigated  That is plainly oppressive to Owston  Owston should not be exposed to two  or possibly more  trials of the same issue  particularly given the nature of the relief sought in this action  As non parties the investors are not bound by any findings in Owston s favour  Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Limited  in liq  v Beck     ALR   at   and   per Finkelstein J  Owston s primary submission is that it will not be bound in later proceedings by a finding of fact or law  other than the latter s precedential value that is made against its interests in this action  Although unable to bring proceedings which amount to a collateral attack on the result in these proceedings  Owston submits it is entitled to defend itself from attack by re litigating issues decided against its interest   Hon K Handley   Res Judicata  General Principles and Recent Developments       Aust Bar Review   at   and the authority cited   That findings made in these proceedings are not binding in any later proceedings brought by any investors is consistent  it says  with the structure of the Act  It observes that ASIC can bring  but has not brought  representative proceedings under s   of the Act provided certain condition are met  It also points to the fact that under s  F certain findings of breach of a civil penalty provision are binding on the defendants  The legislature has decided that only findings in civil penalty proceedings are binding  and not findings in other proceedings brought by ASIC  Owston acknowledges that these submissions  may not be unquestionably right   Third  where the relief sought in these proceedings is calculated to encourage re litigation of the issues this will likely bring the administration of justice into disrepute  The possibility of re litigation according to Owston is not a mere risk but rather is the very purpose of these proceedings  It is not the function of this Court  or proper exercise of a power under the Act  to promote litigation  Fourth  in the event of the issues in these proceedings being re litigated there is the obvious potential for inconsistent findings  That is a possibility to be avoided  not encouraged  These proceedings are calculated to promote the re litigation of the same issues in which inconsistent findings are possible referred toAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlGray J in ASIC v West     SASR   at   adopted the same approach to the grant of declaratory relief in favour of ASIC  More recently a bare declaration was granted by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    The Court declared that the  scheme  in question was an unregistered managed investment scheme in contravention of s  ED  of the Act  His Honour said that the power to do so may be exercised whether or not other relief is sought and rejected the defendant s submission that a mere declaration would have no utility as the scheme had already been wound up following the winding up of the HLP companies  for the reason that        it is appropriate to make the declaration sought by ASIC  Many people put money into the scheme  They are entitled to know that the scheme was illegal and that is one reason why the HLP group was wound up  The declaration will not enable the investors to recover their money  But at least it will inform them what they had got themselves into referred toAustralian Securities   Investments Commission v McDougall     ACSR  Owston submits that the s  B order is not consequential on the declarations sought and that in terms it can only be consequential on a finding of a breach of the Act  It says that here the order sought is relevantly disconnected from the breach with no sufficient nexus  citing ASIC v McDougall     ACSR   at    It says that it is not a remedy in the true sense for the alleged wrong  but amounts  in effect  to advice from ASIC  with the Court s endorsement  to the shareholders concerned  It says that a final determination between the parties of an issue that has no practical consequence between those parties does not convert a hypothetical question into a  matter  otherwise all hypothetical questions would be a  matter  once a contradictor was found  As Young J

 FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOwston submits that no final determination or resolution of the alleged contravention will take place without additional factual findings and determinations of issues of law and that accordingly  the Court is being asked to consider a hypothetical situation where its decision will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties as to which it relies upon Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner   FCA         FCR    Owston also cites Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner   FCA         FCR    However in that case the applicant sought declarations  independently of any specific factual allegations    which went  merely to future events or circumstances  which would not quell any existing controversy between the parties to the proceedings   and which was  in effect  seeking an advisory opinion    A Full Court of this Court has expressed doubt as to whether an application for a declaration as to the legality of proposed future conduct involves a  matter  within the meaning

at    As Sheppard J said     a s in   Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW  Ex rel Corporate Affairs Commission   HCA         CLR     it is often useful to be able to make a declaration in a case that does not warrant the granting of injunctive relief  The making of declaratory orders in such cases without the grant of injunctive relief in litigation brought under the general law to enforce public rights is not an uncommon course      In the same case  Hill J said  at        t here can be little doubt that a declaration might be obtained by a regulatory authority that particular conduct is in breach of a statutory provision     It has never been suggested that no power exists to grant such declaratory relief merely because the consequence of a declaration is to declare the existence of a wrong  The declaration that an offence has been committed is the concomitant of the non existence of a right  Semantically  it may be said to be the declaration of a

Gaudron and Gummow JJ  The majority of the members of the High Court in Re  Judiciary and Navigation Acts explained that  a matter under the judicature provisions of the Constitution must involve some right or privilege or protection given by law  or the prevention  redress or punishment of some act inhibited by law   at    Owston contends that in light of the statutory scheme there is no right  privilege or protection given to ASIC which is sought to be enforced  nor is the relief sought in the nature of preventative relief  or redress  or a punishment  I do not accept Owston s submissions  In my opinion  the present proceedings fall within the majority s several alternative descriptions of  matter  in Re  Judiciary and Navigation Acts  They concern the rights and protections conferred by s   of the Act as well as the redress available under ss  B and  B of the Act and under s   of the Federal Court Act and s  B A  of the Judiciary Act for contraventions of s   of the Act  Re  Judiciary and Navigation Acts is not authority for the proposition that for a  matter  to exist  a claim of civil penalty or for recovery of damages or some relief which undoes the wrong must be present  or that somehow the proceedings must ensure finality of litigation by ensuring that there is no real possibility that another plaintiff will commence proceedings in relation to some or all of the issues in the proceedings  Nor is it authority to support a contention that bare declaratory relief which does not meet or aid one of those ends will not ordinarily be granted  Involved in this proceeding is at least the question of the right of investors to receive a prospectus under the provisions of the Act and the corresponding duty of Owston to provide one  Owston is liable to the

    CLR     it is often useful to be able to make a declaration in a case that does not warrant the granting of injunctive relief  The making of declaratory orders in such cases without the grant of injunctive relief in litigation brought under the general law to enforce public rights is not an uncommon course      In the same case  Hill J said  at        t here can be little doubt that a declaration might be obtained by a regulatory authority that particular conduct is in breach of a statutory provision     It has never been suggested that no power exists to grant such declaratory relief merely because the consequence of a declaration is to declare the existence of a wrong  The declaration that an offence has been committed is the concomitant of the non existence of a right  Semantically  it may be said to be the declaration of a negative right  It is appropriate  in my view  to refer to it as a declaration of right  Austin J in Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Sweeney   NSWSC   at     said    It is beyond contest that this Court has plenary jurisdiction to make a declaratory order concerning contravention of the Corporations Law  by virtue of ss   and   of the Supreme Court Act    NSW   In Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    HCA         CLR     the High Court expressly disagreed with the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  which had declined to grant a declaration with respect to contravention of the  prescribed interests  provisions of the Companies Act    NSW   Gibbs CJ remarked that it was proper to grant a declaration in that case although it had been agreed that an injunction was not an appropriate remedy  at        In Corporate Affairs Commission v Transphere Pty Ltd     ACLC       Young J dealt with the question more fully  He observed that  while a declaration will not ordinarily be made that a defendant has committed a crime  there is jurisdiction to do so in a proper case  In his Honour s view  older cases which discouraged a statutory authority from commencing proceedings for declaratory relief are no longer applicable  in view of the changed social climate  and the Court will now grant declaratory relief at the suit of the statutory authority which exists to regulate an industry  in an appropriate case  at    In his Honour s view  the fact that the subject matter of the declaration is of public interest is an important consideration in favour of the granting of declaratory relief  even though the order may be of only slight utility  at    In that case the Court declined to make a declaratory order  because  inter alia  the declaration would affect investors who were not parties to the proceedings  That consideration is not present here  The approach taken in the Federal Court is very similar  Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc   FCA         ALR       and at       The present proceedings have been brought by the public regulator to enforce the corporations and securities legislation  According to s   of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  in performing its functions and exercising its powers  the plaintiff must strive to achieve various objectives  including    to promote the confident and informed participation of investors and consumers in the financial system  to administer the laws that confer functions and powers on it effectively and with a minimum of procedural requirements  and  to take whatever action it can take  and is necessary  in order to enforce and give effect to the laws that confer functions and powers on it     These provisions imply that it is appropriate for the Commission to take civil proceedings for declaratory and injunctive relief in respect of past events  even if there is no risk of repetition  where the outcome may establish that the conduct complained of was wrongful  and thereby mark the Court s and the community s disapproval of it  and may deter other wrongdoers  It is appropriate for the Court to take these matters into account in the exercise of its discretion to grant or refuse such relief citedTruth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOwston accepts that declaratory relief is often given on the motion of a regulator  but it says that usually a declaration is only granted in conjunction with substantive relief which is in its nature either protective such as by the grant of injunctive relief or corrective advertising orders or alternatively a punishment by awarding  for example  civil penalties  It contends that a bare declaration will be made only in rare circumstances  absent other relief that gives effect to a right or obligation  It cites Gaudron J in Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Limited   HCA         CLR   at       There may be cases where a bare declaration that some legal requirement has been contravened will serve to redress some or all of the harm brought about by that contravention  Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   was such a case  But a declaration cannot be made if it  will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties     That is not simply a matter of discretion  Rather  a declaration that produces no foreseeable consequences is so divorced from the administration of the law as not to involve a matter for the purposes of Ch III of the Constitution   And as it is not a matter for those purposes  it cannot engage the judicial power of the Commonwealth   See Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ   Forster v Jododex Australia
