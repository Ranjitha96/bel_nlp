Dale v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAkins v Abigroup Ltd     NSWLR   Third  the exhibits were filed pursuant to a direction of the Court for Veda to  file and serve any     affidavits   Veda is to be regarded as acting under compulsion of law by reason of the direction  see Akins v Abigroup Ltd     NSWLR   just as it would be doing if it had been required to give discovery of the documents or to produce them in compliance with a subpoena or notice to produce  Whatever the position may be when a party simply leads evidence on the final hearing without having been required to file and serve its affidavits in advance  that is not the case here  Veda would not have filed and served its affidavits and their exhibits if it had not been directed by the Court to do so distinguishedCadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Seventh  in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Limited   FCA     which concerned discovered documents  Finkelstein J held that disclosure to a litigation funder was not caught by the implied undertaking  His Honour s reason was that a litigation funder  although not a party  was not a stranger to the proceeding and had a sufficient interest to be provided with the documents  or at least to those documents it needed in order to assess the merits of the action   Neither DR Capital nor CRA is a litigation funder  Nor are they expert witnesses  On the present state of the evidence  it is not clear to me that they have any proper role in relation to the prosecution of these proceedings  The evidence shows only that DR Capital and CRA    assist individuals to have their credit information files corrected    have acted as some kind of intermediary between the applicants and a proposed litigation funder  and    introduced the nine applicants or some of them to their present solicitors citedCommonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The conclusion I have reached is that the position of Mr Dale s legal representatives and Mr Dale  and the other eight applicants  should be left to be governed by the implied undertaking in accordance with Harman     AC    I accept a submission of senior counsel for Mr Dale that his legal advisers should be at liberty to explain to their client  if and as and when they think appropriate  what the exhibits reveal  and to show the exhibits to him for that purpose  subject  of course  to their also explaining to him the implied undertaking he gives to the Court and the potential consequences for him of a breach by  for example  disclosing what he has learned from the exhibits to DR Capital or to CRA  As Toohey J observed in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR   at   an undertaking by a litigant s legal representatives not to disclose to the litigant can give rise to considerable difficulties citedHarman v Secretary of State for the Home Department     AC   Fourth  the principles of Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department     AC     Harman   signify that Mr Dale and the other applicants  and counsel and solicitors representing them in the proceedings  impliedly undertake to the Court not to use the exhibits or the information contained in them for any other purpose than that of the present proceedings  The implied undertaking is reflected in para   of the undertaking proposed by Veda  set out at   above  No doubt solicitors and counsel will draw the implied undertaking to the attention of Mr Dale and the other eight applicants if they have not already done so  The implied undertaking also applies  of course  to all the affidavits and exhibits that have already been served  It would be a punishable contempt of court if any of the applicants or any of their legal advisers were to make use of  or to disclose the content of  any of the affidavits or exhibits  including  but not limited to  the four in dispute  to anyone for any other purpose   Fifth  O   r   of the Federal Court Rules provides that except with the leave of the Court or a Judge  a non party must not inspect  relevantly  an affidavit in a proceeding  I treat the reference to  affidavit  in the rule as embracing exhibits to the affidavit  in any event subr   of O   r   provides that except with the leave of the Court or a Judge  or with the permission of the Registrar  a non party must not inspect any document in any proceedings that is not referred to in subr   or    Although those rules are concerned with inspection of documents on the Court s files  it is noteworthy that Dun   Bradstreet  DR Capital and CRA and their employees would not be entitled to inspect the exhibits in the Registry without leave   Sixth  I accept that exhibits RAB  RAB  RAB  and RAB  are confidential to Veda  but  as noted above  I do not find it necessary to determine whether they are confidential in any way or to any extent different from the internal procedural records and instructions maintained by any business   The conclusion I have reached is that the position of Mr Dale s legal representatives and Mr Dale  and the other eight applicants  should be left to be governed by the implied undertaking in accordance with Harman     AC    I accept a submission of senior counsel for Mr Dale that his legal advisers should be at liberty to explain to their client  if and as and when they think appropriate  what the exhibits reveal  and to show the exhibits to him for that purpose  subject  of course  to their also explaining to him the implied undertaking he gives to the Court and the potential consequences for him of a breach by  for example  disclosing what he has learned from the exhibits to DR Capital or to CRA  As Toohey J observed in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR   at   an undertaking by a litigant s legal representatives not to disclose to the litigant can give rise to considerable difficulties   I propose to publish these reasons and stand over the motion to a date for the making of any orders  including orders as to costs  My present thinking is that there should be no order as to costs because both parties had a measure of success on the motion  In favour of Veda  I have held that at present exhibits RAB  RAB  RAB  and RAB  should be withheld from DR Capital and CRA  and I have rejected a submission made on behalf of Mr Dale that the exhibits should be treated as if they had become part of the evidence on the final hearing  In favour of Mr Dale  I have not required that he or the solicitors or barristers representing him in this proceeding sign written undertakings to the Court  and have been content to allow their positions to be governed by the undertaking to the Court that is implied in accordance with the principles of Harman     AC    The Privacy Act part of the motion took virtually no time at all and was not seriously contested by Mr Dale   I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of
