www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second proposed ground is said to be a breach of s  R  of the Act  The appellant contends that the Tribunal was in error of failing to find that the confiscation of the appellant s land amounted to persecution for a Convention reason  The appellant also contends that the Tribunal failed to consider the question of state protection ie  that state acquiescence in the use of private power may constitute persecution for a Convention reason  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar   HCA         CLR     The third ground is failure to properly apply the provisions of s  R  of the Act  In particular  the appellant contends that the Tribunal s finding that he did not suffer serious harm was flawed by a failure to consider the cumulative effect of various matters including the confiscation  his arrest and mistreatment and his inability to pursue his compensation claim   The fourth ground is related to the second and third grounds  It is that the Tribunal failed  either actually or constructively  to exercise its jurisdiction under s   of the Act  In particular  the appellant contends that the Tribunal failed to consider the issue of state protection and the cumulative effect of the matters referred to in the third ground   The essence of the appellant s submission is that the Tribunal misapplied the law because in making this finding it failed to appreciate that persecution may result from the conduct of private persons and the state or its agents  Khawar at   per Gleeson CJ   As the Chief Justice observed in Khawar at     tolerance or condonation by the state of the criminal conduct of private persons resulting in the withholding of protection may amount to persecution on one of the Convention grounds   However  the difficulty with the appellant s submission on this ground of appeal is that it focuses upon the issue of the state s apparent acquiescence in the act of confiscation without addressing the question of whether the act of confiscation amounted to serious harm   The confiscation of the appellant s land was the starting point of his claim to have a well founded fear of persecution  It was an essential part of the claim but it was not to be considered in isolation   In my opinion  the substance of the appellant s complaint is similar to that which was made in Khawar   It is that he suffered serious harm  albeit economic harm  that he is unable to take action to redress that harm without threat to his life or liberty because of the involvement of state authorities in the infliction of the harm  and that this amounts to persecution by those authorities  Khawar at       The necessary Convention nexus is said to be imputed political opinion or membership of a particular social group  namely dispossessed farmers from the Fuqing Economic Zone   In accepting that the appellant s mistreatment following the demonstration was serious enough to amount to persecution  the Tribunal must be taken to have formed the view that the appellant had suffered serious harm  But it failed to deal with the relationship between these events and the initial act of confiscation which it apparently regarded as a criminal act by the local government and the developers referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA

Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As Weinberg J said in MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     the Tribunal was bound to consider each incident of alleged persecution  not merely in isolation but also in conjunction with the others  An act that might not amount to persecutory conduct involving serious harm when viewed in isolation may do so when considered in its full context   In my opinion  the essential error in the Tribunal s decision is that it failed to consider the appellant s claims in their totality  In doing so  it failed to complete the exercise of its jurisdiction   This error appears from a careful  but not over zealous reading of the Tribunal s findings and reasons set out at pp   and   of its decision   It is true that  overall  based on the evidence  the Tribunal was satisfied that the appellant s fear was not well founded  But the difficulty with this statement is that it appears after the Tribunal had considered each step in the claim in isolation and without considering the impact of state involvement in the conduct  MZWPD at     appliedNABE v Minister for

at     Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Applicant S      ALR   at     Eshetu at     consideredSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     CLR   This ground of review is based upon the decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     CLR    The High Court characterised this species of error as a failure to accord procedural fairness   The issues in relation to which the Tribunal is said to have denied the appellant procedural fairness are        whether the appellant had an ongoing interest in pursuing the compensation claim    whether the appellant avoided protest activities or the pursuit of his compensation claims after he was released from detention because he feared harm from the authorities    whether the appellant s relatives had been arrested or had experienced harm  or were likely to  for lodging an appeal in the compensation claim   The principles of procedural fairness which the High Court identified in s   of the Act are as follows    But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive  and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is  the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are  the issues arising in relation to the decision under review           unless the Tribunal tells the applicant something different  the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision      See SZBEL at       The High Court accepted in SZBEL at   that it is open to the Tribunal to identify additional issues to those identified by the original decision maker  Two questions therefore arise  First  are the  issues  to which the appellant refers issues in the sense stated in s   of the Act  Second  if so  did the Tribunal sufficiently identify them  It seems to me that the effect of the High Court s explanation of the statutory scheme is that the issues to which s   refers are particular factual aspects of an applicant s claim in respect of which the Tribunal is not persuaded when it extends to an applicant an invitation to attend the hearing  SZBEL at       In some cases everything may be in issue  in others  the issues may be specific aspects of the material that is already before the Tribunal  SZBEL at       Here  although the delegate did not make express reference to the three  issues  it is apparent from the strong terms in which he rejected the claim that the appellant should have been sufficiently on notice that the entirety of his factual account was in issue in the review   Moreover  the exchanges between the appellant and the Tribunal were in my view sufficient to bring home to the appellant that the entire factual basis of his claim was in issue  The Tribunal member said in plain terms on several occasions that he did not understand how the confiscation of the appellant s land in   was relevant to his claim to have a well founded fear of persecution when he left China in December     Nevertheless  the Tribunal s questions and the apparent testiness of the Tribunal member s remarks in the second excerpt must have put the appellant on notice that the foundation of his claim was in issue  It is well established that it is for an applicant to make out his or her claims  SZBEL at    That was what the Tribunal s questions called for   In my view  the  issues  which the appellant identifies do not fall within the principle stated in SZBEL  Rather  they are either gaps in the appellant s account of his claim or part of the mental processes of the Tribunal  The Tribunal member was not required to disclose them to the appellant  SZBEL at   Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   at   Minister for Immigration

found to ask the appellant to explain  SZBEL at    Rather  as I have said  the reasons given by the Tribunal addressed gaps in the applicant s evidence  It was for him to give his full account and for the Tribunal to determine whether to accept it  Abebe v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at    referred toSZFDE v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship     ALJR   The effect of the appellant s submission in the present proceeding is that the Tribunal failed to identify the third  fourth and fifth reasons for rejecting the appellant s claims  which I have set out at   to   as issues arising on the review  The appellant submits that this has the effect of stultifying the operation of the legislative scheme to provide natural justice embodied in Part     Division   of the Act  SZFDE v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship     ALJR   at   and     It is an agreed fact between the parties that at the hearing before the Tribunal on   November   the Tribunal member did not ask the appellant whether      he had an ongoing interest in pursuing the compensation claim after his release from detention    he avoided protest activities or the pursuit of his compensation claim after his release from detention because he feared harm from the authorities    his relatives had been arrested or had experienced any harm for lodging an appeal in respect of his compensation claim   These  issues  correspond to the third  fourth and fifth reasons given by the Tribunal for rejecting the appellant s claim  It may therefore be accepted that the Tribunal considered them to be dispositive

to do to complete the exercise of its jurisdiction was to apply the  real chance test  that was stated by the High Court in Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo   HCA         CLR    It was for the decision maker to determine whether the past events relied upon by the appellant gave rise to a likelihood of future harm  VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at      As Gleeson CJ and Kirby J said in VBAO at   the decision maker is required to consider the likelihood of future persecution that involves serious harm  and one instance of this is a threat to a person s life or liberty   Although the Tribunal came to the view that there was no real likelihood of such a threat  it did so without considering all the integers of the claim  It is well established that this vitiates the purported exercise of the power   I propose therefore to grant leave to raise grounds   and   and to allow the appeal on that basis appliedVTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   It is well established that in

Affairs   FCAFC   commented on the practice of raising arguments for the first time on appeals in migration matters   The approach stated by the Court in VUAX at   is that leave may be granted if a point is advanced  which clearly has merit  and the respondent suffers  no real prejudice   An adequate explanation is also required for the failure to take the point at first instance   Here  the appellant is represented for the first time by counsel  The Minister does not point to any prejudice other than costs  The essential question is whether the grounds have merit  I will deal with that when addressing each of the grounds   I do not consider that there is sufficient merit in the second ground of appeal to grant leave in accordance with the approach taken in VUAX   Nevertheless  the question of whether the Tribunal s finding in relation to the confiscation of the land was flawed falls for consideration under grounds   and     Grounds   and   may be considered together  Mr Mantziaris put three submissions in support of them  first  that the Tribunal failed to consider the appellant s claims in their totality  second  that the Tribunal looked only at the question of past conduct without considering whether it gave rise to a real chance of persecution in the future  third  that the Tribunal erred in law in inferring that the appellant s post   inactivity meant that he
