Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR p   The Commission relies on s   of the Trade Practices Act to extend the operation of s   to natural persons if their conduct relates to trade with Australia  This would make the liability of the individual respondents direct and not ancillary to that of the corporate respondents  There was some discussion of the availability of that section in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR p     The Commission points to the various positions of employment of the individual April foreign respondents  the structure of the APRIL Group s operations  the nature of the meetings and the arrangements entered into to infer that the

reasons  Annexure A  is a chart provided by the Commission of the structure of the APRIL Group and the position of the individual April foreign respondents within that structure  The evidence supports the conclusions drawn in the chart as to the relationship of the corporations and individuals named  The evidence also provides the basis for an inference that Mr Lim and Mr Choo were officers of

individuals is attributable to those corporations citedBeluga Shipping GmbH   Co KS  Beluga Fantastic  v Headway Shipping Ltd  No     FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe question is whether  on the material before the Court  facts are established or inferences are open which  if translated into findings of fact  would support the relief claimed  The reference in these reasons to the evidence and conclusions should be understood as referring to what the evidence establishes and what conclusions may be drawn at a prima facie level  The material relied upon by the Commission is in the form of untested allegations and evidence but it is appropriate to proceed on the basis of them in order to assess whether facts are established and inferences can be drawn which would establish a prima facie case   Beluga Shipping GmbH   Co KS  Beluga Fantastic  v Headway Shipping Ltd  No     FCA         ALR   at   per Rares J   The prima facie case against the April foreign respondents The Commission s case is that individuals employed within the APRIL Group and representing each of April FPT  April Holdings and April Management attended meetings of a club called the AAA Club at which price fixing agreements were made  being arrangements or understandings within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act and the Codes  The AAA Club refers to an alleged loose association or club  the members of which were the APRIL Group  the Advance Agro Group and the APP Group  as well as the Thai Paper Group and the UPM Group  The case made by the Commission is that the primary object of the AAA Club was to discuss and reach consensus about prices at which each group of companies would supply paper products in various markets  including Australia referred toBray v F Hoffman
