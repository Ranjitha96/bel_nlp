SZKLW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredJess v Scott     FCR   It is possible under the rules of court for an extension of that   day period to be granted  The rules of court require that a special reason form the basis of any such extension  The leading authority in relation to whether or not to grant an extension is a decision of the Full Court in Jess v Scott     FCR     In essence  special reason is intended to distinguish a particular case from the usual course  according to which the time limit is   days  Under the rules of court  I have a discretion to exercise  if satisfied that there is a special reason which justifies departure from the general rule in a particular case  I also remind myself that the rules of court are meant to be a servant of justice  rather than a master of justice  An application for extension of time was not lodged in court until   November     The Applicant has  by his affidavit  sworn that he did not receive the judgment until   October   when he personally got it from the Federal Court Registry in Queens Square  I take it that what is meant by this  is that he did not get a written copy of the Magistrate s decision and reasons until then  That particular statement is not challenged by the Minister  I accept that it was not until   October   that the Applicant received the written version of the Court s decision and reasons  Even allowing for that  more than   days expired prior to the application for an extension of time
