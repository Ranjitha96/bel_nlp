eight factors and the alternative postulate   Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart  supra  at   Gummow and Hayne JJ   open on the evidence  the Tribunal concluded as was open to it  that the dominant purpose of entering into and carrying out the scheme was to obtain a tax benefit of non inclusion of the amount of a capital gain in the assessable income of each taxpayer that would have been realised upon disposal  as contemplated by s  C a    Each taxpayer says that no tax benefit arose in connection with the scheme and thus s  D a  is not satisfied with the result that Part IVA does not apply to the sequence of transactions found to be a scheme  In other words  s  D falls at the threshold and Part IVA has no application to the sequence of transactions  That result is said to arise because the statutory definition of a tax benefit contained in s  C a  is subject to an express exclusion which removes the non inclusion of a postulated capital gain from the assessable income of a taxpayer where the non inclusion is attributable to the making of a choice or election expressly provided for by the   Act  or the   Act    The relevant provisions are these      SECTION  C TAX BENEFIT      C   Obtaining a tax benefit  Subject to this section  a reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as a reference to         a  an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income where that amount would have been included  or might reasonably be expected to have been included  in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out  or          b            and  for the purposes of this Part  the amount of the tax benefit shall be taken to be         c  in the case to which paragraph  a  applies the amount referred to in that paragraph  and                        C   Exclusions  A reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as not including a reference to           a  the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income not including an amount that would have been included  or might reasonably be expected to have been included  in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out where             i  the non inclusion of the amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer is attributable to the making of an agreement  choice  declaration  election or selection  the giving of a notice or the exercise of an option  expressly provided for by this Act or the Income Tax Assessment Act     by any person  except one under subdivision   B    B or   D of the Income Tax Assessment Act     and      ii  the scheme was not entered into or carried out by any person for the purpose of creating any circumstance or state of affairs the existence of which is necessary to enable the declaration  agreement  election  selection  choice  notice or option to be made  given or exercised  as the case may be quotedWalstern v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As to the integer influencing the question of whether Part IVA applies to the scheme as found  each taxpayer contended that no  tax benefit  arose for the purposes of s  C a  and s  D a  by operation of the exclusion contained in s  C a i   However  since the non inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of each taxpayer was not attributable to the roll over choice made under subdivision  A of the   Act  each taxpayer obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme  s  C a   The scope of the exclusion is limited to the non inclusion of the relevant amount directly attributable to the roll over choice  Since the Tribunal correctly found that the sequence of inter related transactions between     April   comprising the scheme is the source of the non inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of each taxpayer rather than the roll over choice made under s     of the   Act  it can be seen  having regard to the facts found  that the argument of the taxpayer concerning the construction and application of that integer is wrong  However  that is not the end of the matter  Even though the argument is incorrect  the question is whether the argument contended for by each taxpayer is one that could be argued  objectively   on rational grounds to be right    Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at         The principles identified by Hill J  which apply with equal force to s   of the   Act  are these   Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation  supra    propositions   to     The test to be applied is an objective one  the comparison is one between the taxpayer s argument and the argument which is considered to be the correct argument  a determination must then be made whether the taxpayer s argument although considered wrong  is about as likely as not correct  when regard is had to the  authorities   including the income tax law  material for the purposes of s  AB  of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  and decisions of Courts  the Tribunal or a Board of Review  s  C  it is not necessary that the taxpayer s argument  in an objective sense  is  more likely to be right than wrong  as the taxpayer s argument will have been found to be wrong as an underlying premise  nor is it necessary that the taxpayer s argument is  just as likely correct  as the principal argument will have been found to be wrong  the word  about  indicates the need to balance two competing arguments so that  on balance the taxpayer s argument can objectively be said to be one that while wrong could be argued on rational grounds to be right  and        the view advanced by the taxpayer must be one where objectively it would be concluded that having regard to the material included within the definition of  authority  a reasoned argument can be made which argument when contrasted with the argument which is accepted as correct is about as likely as not correct  That is to say the two arguments  namely  that which is advanced by the taxpayer and that which reflects the correct view  will be finely balanced  The case must thus be one where reasonable minds could differ as to which view  that of the taxpayer or that ultimately adopted by the Commissioner  was correct  There must  in other words  be room for a real and rational difference of opinion between the two views such that while the taxpayer s view is ultimately seen to be wrong  it is nevertheless  about  as likely to be correct as the correct view      A question of judgment is involved   The Tribunal has not addressed itself to the principles governing the question of whether the argument advanced by the taxpayer is one which is sufficiently  finely balanced  to be reasonably arguable  The Tribunal concluded that since the  point raised    of the Tribunal s reasons  ie  the taxpayer s argument in relation to the effect of the election was  not easy to refute  each taxpayer did have a reasonably arguable contention
