The applicants emphasise the expression used by Sheppard J in Van Reesema v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy     FLR   at   when his Honour used the expression  great power  of the trustee in bankruptcy in preventing a discharge from bankruptcy occurring by entering an objection to discharge  That expression was used by the Full Court in Prentice v Wood   FCA         FCR   at   in discussing the power in s  C c   I do not find those expressions of any particular assistance in construing ss   and   and in ascertaining the statutory consequence of any failure to comply  if that occurred  with ss   and    appliedProject Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  These considerations go not only to the construction and interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act   but also to assess the consequences of any breach of that which the statute provides for  Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR    When a statute provides for compliance with procedures laid down therein  the consequences of an absence of such compliance upon acts performed pursuant thereto must be assessed  Those procedures  if breached in some aspect  must be examined in their context in order that the Court can understand what Parliament intended to be the consequences of such breach   The question whether information put forward by the bankrupts is sufficient in detail and underlying commercial substance to amount to a proposal will generally be a judgmental decision for the trustee  It may arise at the point of refusal by the trustee to convene a meeting on the basis that there is insufficient reliable material to allow her or him to give an opinion for the purposes of s  A   It may arise at the point of someone seeking to restrain a meeting on the basis that what is being put is not a proposal  In those cases  a substantial question that will arise will be whether there is a proposal of sufficient clarity and reality to permit a judgment of the trustee under s  A    Here  the trustee took the view that there was a proposal  An opinion purporting to be under s  A  was given  Voting took place  The issues are whether there was a proposal and whether the trustee gave an opinion for the purposes of s  A  and if not  whether that made the resolutions  the meeting  the composition and the annulments nullities   Here Mr Thomas took the view that  though there were certain inadequacies in the proposal  it was a proposal  I do not think he was wrong in that  However  even if he were  he decided to take it to the creditors and what followed has been set out above  As I have said in relation to my views on Project Blue Sky   HCA       CLR   even if the first proposal was not a proposal and even if he could not have been forced to take it to a meeting  I do not think that has the consequence of invalidating everything that followed  As I said  I think it was a proposal in that there was an arrangement capable of being accepted  whether or not its implementation was certain I think more went to its attractiveness than as to whether it was a proposal  There was no time expressed for implementation  The law will always imply a reasonable time  Again  if I am wrong and that was such as to make it not a proposal  Mr Thomas  view that it was and that it should go to the meeting was not a failure of procedure which nullifies all that flows thereafter referred toRe Barton     FLR   The public and private importance of the change of status in making a party bankrupt is too well

and see also Ex parte Selby  in the matter of Selby and Norton     ER   per Lord Justice Knight Bruce   Relevant also  in addition to the interests of the parties  is the interest of the public  as I have said  in a discharge context  see in particular Re Barton   FLR    The important changes  retrospectively  to the status of the former bankrupt brought about by annulment and the operation of s     with the consequential permission of the erstwhile bankrupt to move about the community with full status  also inform the need to construe the provisions with an eye to substance over formality and not subvert the intended practical freedom sought to be given to the bankrupt by procedural issues not affecting in any given case the substance of the legitimacy of the expression of the creditors  views discussedRe Bendel  Ex parte Bendel v Pattison     FCR   It is said that the trustee did not provide an opinion of the purposes of s  A  because the trustee only said that it would appear that both alternatives  that is the McGurk contract and the first Naylor proposal  benefited the bankrupts  creditors  There is some force in that  Re Bendel  Ex parte Bendel v Pattison     FCR   at    But once again  any failure of the trustee to comply with s  A  would not necessarily invalidate what flowed thereafter for the reasons I have already given  I do not see any non compliance here as fatal to a vote  That is not to say that if the context of the case was injunctive relief to prevent a meeting going ahead because of inadequate information in the opinion of the trustee that such an injunction would not be given   Also  to reinforce what I said earlier  to the extent that there has been inadequate information in the opinion of the trustee  the egregiousness or otherwise of any such error would be  as the asserted error of the trustee here is  a relevant consideration for the operation of ss           and  C   Also  for completeness  I do not think it should be accepted as it was submitted here that the first Naylor proposal was not bone fide   The Naylors  who put on evidence  were not cross examined about that  cf Re Bendel   FCR   at     The second Naylor proposal was equally not too vague or uncertain in my view  There was an unconditional offer of payment even if it came from a finance company who had a letterhead without an address except a post box  The terms of any mortgage were not necessary to vote on  The reduced security from the Naylors  mother dropping out was not a matter for the creditors to be concerned with save and except that it may have meant that the Naylors were not able to last very long out of bankruptcy  But again  given that the creditors were being paid in one lump sum that was not their concern  As to whether there was a certainty of the money being available  these were matters  once again  for the creditors to assess and the trustee to give his opinion on   The second proposal can be seen  I think  to be an amendment of the first proposal  The provider of the money changed  the mortgage arrangements changed and although there were the variations from   down to   this was in substance no different to the earlier proposal  Even if I am wrong that there was not an amendment but a new proposal  once again  given the fact that the matter went to the creditors pursuant to the meeting  I do not see the breach of procedure  if it be such  has a nullifying effect on what occurred referred toRe Coyle     FCR   It goes without saying that the procedures required should be viewed from the perspective of the interests of all creditors  In a given case  which is not this one  a Court might look very carefully at any procedure leading to a composition dominated by creditors related to the bankrupt or

Battenberg   NSWCA         NSWLR   discussedRe Edwards     FCR   The first argument is that the first Naylor proposal was an impermissible joint or unitary composition  Section     it was submitted  did not permit two bankrupts to put a proposal in one document  I do not agree  The proposal was joint and several  Section   requires a proposal to the bankrupts  creditors  There is no reason why one proposal cannot be put forward  as long as it was put forward to all three groups of creditors  as it plainly was and was intended to be  The proposal  if put to a meeting of an individual body of creditors  can be seen as a proposal put forward by the bankrupt for his creditors to deal with  It is said that the proposal to each estate cannot come in the same joint form and that three cases stand as authority for that proposition  Re Pepper     FLR     Re Tynan  Ex parte Tynan     FCR   and Re Edwards     FCR     In Re Edwards   FCR   French J dealt with one joint composition covering two estates  a joint estate and a several estate  Despite some of the language in the judgment  it is clear that the vice identified by his Honour was the single approval for all the estates in one meeting  This can be seen by his Honour s reliance upon the reference to Re Forbes   FLR    French J said the following at     In a case where the bankrupts have some joint creditors and some separate creditors it would be inappropriate to submit the separate creditors to a binding composition on which they may have been out voted by joint creditors with quite different interests  Similarly it would be inappropriate to admit to a vote on a joint composition  separate creditors whose interests might conflict with those of the joint creditors      Re Forbes was a decision of Judge White in the Court of Insolvency of South Australia in which his Honour declared void a composition purportedly entered into under Part X of the Act  by a husband and wife who were not in partnership but who had substantial joint creditors  Each also had separate debts      A joint meeting of creditors was called at which a composite special resolution was passed  Creditors of all classes voted on the composite resolution     His Honour then quoted White J at page    French J concluded his judgment by saying    The proposal if it is to be proceed will have to be recast in the form of separate proposals for each of the bankrupts  Each will require a separate meeting of creditors although the meetings can be held concurrently provided that the procedure necessary to maintain the distinction between the two proposals is followed  On this basis I have no alternative but to dismiss the application   In Re Tynan   FCR   French J had a case before him where there were bankrupts who had been partners with no separate bankrupt estate  Some passages of the judgment of French J appear  taken literally  to prevent under s   any joint composition to be entered where there is more than one estate  I do not think his Honour s reasons should be so read  especially in the light of the terms of Re Edwards   FCR   in the same year  By his Honour s reference to Re Pepper   FLR   and Re Edwards   FCR    and through it Re Forbes   FLR   and via what his Honour said at pages   and   about the need for separate meetings  I conclude that his Honour was dealing with the same essential difficulty  that is  of mixing up the voting of different creditors at different meetings discussedRe Forbes     FLR   In Re Forbes     FLR   White J of the Court of Insolvency of South Australia discussed Part IX and s   of the Bankruptcy Act   The issue there identified was not the putting of a composite proposal  but the putting of a composite proposal to one undifferentiated meeting  The essence of the matter was put at pages   and   as follows    In my opinion  this procedure is not open to debtors under Part X and the alleged composition is void  They should have held separate meetings  albeit concurrently  to which separate special resolutions could have been submitted to the relevant classes of creditors  in order that the wishes of interested parties be ascertained  including the existence or otherwise of the appropriate majorities both in number and value  Where there are joint creditors  it is a matter of necessity rather than convenience that meetings are held at the one time and the one place  As will be seen later  care must be taken at such concurrent meetings to separate out the different resolutions relating to each debtor and the classes of creditors entitled to vote in relation to each resolution              I am happy to say that I reached this conclusion before reading Mr Irlicht s small but excellent book  Assignments  Arrangements and Compositions by Debtors  where he expresses the opinion       There should be a separate meeting with respect to each debtor  although there is no objection against holding meetings of more than one debtor concurrently  providing that a special resolution is passed with respect to each debtor  of course only the creditors of the debtor in question can vote on the relevant resolution  but creditors to whom debtors are jointly indebted may vote on the resolutions with respect to each debtor   This procedure of holding concurrent meetings is best adopted when there are a number of joint debtors    The case does not assist with the question whether one group of creditors should not have the opportunity to vote on a proposal which involved another debtor   In Re Edwards   FCR   French

my view  that did not stop there being a proposal  rather it said something as to its attractiveness  It is true  as Beaumont J said in Wenkart v Pantzer   FCA   at   that s  A  and   indicate the following    Both these paragraphs indicate that the trustee is concerned here with matters of substance and not governed by any mechanical form in deciding how to respond  Thus  if the trustee does not have sufficient material upon which the trustee could indicate one way or the other whether a proposal would benefit the bankrupt s creditors generally  then  in my opinion there is no absolut e and certainly no unconditional obligation on the trustee to call a meeting of creditors   This does not mean  however  that  if a proposal which in all the circumstances the trustee decides is sufficiently formulated to go to creditors with the view of the trustee contemplated by  A  that a resolution accepting or rejecting it by creditors cannot be seen to have taken place  It will be a matter for the trustee to judge whether or not there is sufficient information for there to be a proposal requiring him or her to go to a meeting  A Court may have to assess that at a point in time before any meeting  It is unnecessary to lay down definitional criteria for that beyond the words of the Bankruptcy Act   Each individual case will be different  the circumstances of the estate and
