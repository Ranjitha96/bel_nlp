www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the case of a literary work  copyright is the exclusive right  amongst other things  to reproduce the work in a material form and to communicate the work to the public  see s  a i  and  iv   In s     the word  communicate  is defined as  make available online or electronically transmit  whether over a path  or a combination of paths  provided by a material substance or otherwise  a work or other subject matter   Hence  in making the   questions and answers available on line over the Internet  RMC and Dallas Gibson communicated the works to the public  These   questions and answers were also reproduced in a material form when Dallas Gibson converted them from files stored on Mr Van Tran s compact disks into files stored on Dallas Gibson s laptop and ultimately converted into the practice exams files made available to students through the Icarus College learning management system  see s  A   Pursuant to s     as applicable at the relevant time   material form  in relation to a work  included  any form  whether visible or not  of storage from which the work     or a substantial part of the work     can be reproduced   In the present case  the difficulties discussed in Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment   HCA         CLR   do not arise   Section  b  of the Copyright Act provides that  unless the contrary intention appears   A  reference to a reproduction  adaptation or copy of a work shall be read as including a reference to a reproduction  adaptation or copy of a substantial part of the work

exams to Icarus College students over the Icarus College website  Icarus College had   practice exams that it provided over the Internet to students who paid for UMAT preparation courses  MedEntry s

Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In order to attract copyright protection  a literary work that is a compilation must be original  As Dixon J said in Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor   HCA         CLR   at   No doubt the expression  literary work  includes compilation  The definition section says so     But some original result must be produced  This does not mean that new or inventive ideas must be contributed  The work need show no literary or other skill or judgment  But it must originate with the author and be more than a copy of other material   In that case  the High Court held that copyright did not exist in information posted by the race course proprietors inside the course as to the name and numbers of the starting and scratched horses and the numbers of the winners referred toDesktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Whether or not a compilation has sufficient originality to attract copyright depends on the degree of skill  judgment or labour involved in producing it  The Full Court of this Court in Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCAFC         FCR     Desktop   discussed the concept of originality  Lindgren J  with whom Black CJ agreed  summarised the principles concerning originality  at     where  amongst other things  his Honour said       One must apply the test of originality to the literary work  including a compilation  in which copyright is claimed to exist  as a whole  rather than dissecting it and applying the test to the individual parts        The test of originality is whether the work was not copied  but originated from the putative author        The test is not an  all or nothing  one but raises a question of fact and degree as to the extent of the putative author s contribution to the making of the particular literary work in questions  in the present case  a compilation        For this purpose  no particular kind of antecedent work contributed by the putative author is  a priori  to be left out of account  except  perhaps  antecedent work which was undertaken for a purpose or purposes which did not include the making of the literary work at all                 T here is no principle that the labour and expense of collecting  verifying  recording and assembling  albeit routinely  data to be compiled are irrelevant to  or are incapable of themselves establishing  origination  and therefore originality  on the contrary  the authorities strongly suggest that labour of that kind may do so     See also Desktop at   per Sackville J  with whom Black CJ also agreed   Sackville J s summary of the relevant principles  at   included the following statements   i  A compilation will ordinarily be an original literary work for copyright purposes if the compiler has exercised skill  judgment or knowledge in selecting the material for inclusion in the compilation     or in presenting or arranging the material      ii  In addition  a compilation of factual information will ordinarily be an original literary work for copyright purposes if the compiler has undertaken substantial labour or incurred substantial expense in collecting the information recorded in the compilation citedAcohs Pty Ltd v RA Bashford Consulting Pty Ltd     IPR   Where the skill  judgment and labour involved in making a compilation is trivial or insubstantial  there may be no originality sufficient to attract copyright  see Desktop at   per Lindgren J and Acohs Pty Ltd v RA Bashford Consulting Pty Ltd     IPR   at   per Merkel J  This is not the case here  The evidence disclosed that the Boyapatis had contributed a sufficient amount of independent skill  judgment and labour to satisfy the requirement for originality citedInterlego AG v Tyco Industries Inc   UKPC       AC   The evidence established that Ann Boyapati created about half the questions and answers in the works in suit from scratch  Whilst the evidence established that she derived the balance of the questions and answers from third party sources  she used these sources in different ways  selecting  adapting and modifying them to varying degrees to suit her purpose of compiling sets of practice exams that simulated the UMAT  Even where she made minimal modification to a pre existing question  she exercised skill and judgment in selecting the question and including it in either section   or     depending on whether it concerned logical reasoning or interaction skills  There was also a degree of skill and judgment involved in organising the sequence and  to a lesser extent  the number of questions in sections   and   so as to simulate the UMAT  The practice exams that she created were therefore a product of her skill  judgment and labour  combined with that of Ray and Edward Boyapati to the extent that they contributed to the process  The skill  judgment and labour involved were sufficiently substantial to attract copyright  compare Desktop at   per Sackville J  The preparation for  and the creation and development of  the practice exams were not easy tasks and involved some considerable time and effort on the Boyapatis  part  compare Interlego AG v Tyco Industries Inc   UKPC       AC   at   citedDesktop and Autodesk Inc v Dyason   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondents invited me to infer from the evidence that the third party sources would attract copyright since it might be inferred that the sources had been produced in the last fifty years  The respondents cited Desktop and Autodesk Inc v Dyason   HCA         CLR   in support of the proposition that there could be no originality in a work that derived  from other copyright sources without permission  or acknowledgement   This was  so they said  due to a lack of originality  These two cases concerned copyright in factual information and  accordingly  are not directly in point in the present case  In any event  I would reject the respondents  basic submission on two bases  First  I accept that  as the applicants submitted  it would be a question of fact in each case as to whether the applicants had infringed copyright in any particular pre existing work  Secondly  even if copyright in a pre existing work was infringed  the proposition for which the respondents contend is unsupported by the authorities and authors learned in the field of copyright citedLadbroke  Football  Ltd v William Hill  Football  Ltd     WLR   In Copyright and Designs  Butterworths  Australia    at       James Lahore and Warwick A Rothnie state  Copyright can subsist in a selection of material such as poems  short stories or letters  although the material selected is in the public domain  The copyright is in the selection  not in the component parts of it  and the originality of the work lies in the labour  skill  and discrimination of the author in putting together the material      The selection is a new work quite separate from the works selected  Copyright will subsist  for example  in Palgrave s Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics although the songs and lyrics may themselves be in the public domain     The selection by Palgrave was the subject of copyright as a work in itself and irrespective of whether or not copyright subsisted in the individual items selected      In the case of compilations that consist entirely of existing material the originality may be found in the selection alone  that is  in the skill labour and judgment involved in making the selection   There are numerous authorities that can be cited in support of the statements in this passage  see  for example  Ladbroke  Football  Ltd v William Hill  Football  Ltd     WLR     Ladbroke  Football  Ltd   at     per Lord Reid      per Lord Hodson      per Lord Devlin  and     per Lord Pearce  See also S Ricketson and C Creswell  The Law of Intellectual Property  Copyright  Designs   Confidential Information  Lawbook Co    nd ed  revised    at         citedA One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd     IPR   The judgment of Drummond J in A One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd     IPR   at   is particularly helpful  The applicant claimed to be the copyright owner in the literary work that was its motorcycle parts catalogue  as updated from time to time  It alleged that the respondents had infringed its copyright by producing the respondents    parts catalogue  A major issue in the case was whether the applicant s catalogue was the product of copying other catalogues  with the result  so the respondents argued  that the applicant s catalogue was not the subject of copyright  Drummond J rejected this argument  His Honour observed  at   that  the question is whether the compilation  looked at as an entity  is original  it is not proper to dissect the work into its parts  and by determining that the individual parts lack originality  to deny originality to the whole work   He concluded that the original version of the applicant s catalogue infringed the copyright in an earlier work  His Honour went on to say  however  that  But  in my opinion  the fact that the   A One catalogue may be an infringement of the copyright in the   Phoenix catalogue does not prevent A One having copyright in its own   catalogue  I do not read Ladbroke  Football  Ltd     as limiting the proposition that  so far as compilations that consist of or include existing material are concerned  originality for the purposes of copyright can be found in the work of selection  to compilations consisting only of material that is not the subject of copyright  In that case  Lord Pearce  in the course of dealing with the question whether the defendants had infringed the plaintiff s copyright in their football coupon by reproducing a substantial part of it  said  at       The reproduction of a part which by itself has not originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be protected  For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will  when robbed of that collocation  not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement  It is this  I think  which is meant by one or two judicial observations that  there is no copyright  in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright  They afford no justification  in my view  for holding that one starts the inquiry as to whether copyright exists by dissecting the compilation into component parts instead of starting it by regarding the compilation as a whole and seeing whether the whole has copyright  It is when one is debating whether the part reproduced is substantial that one considers the pirated portion on its own       Although Lord Pearce was dealing with the question of infringement where the copyright work was composed of non original and original material  his Lordship  in the latter part of this statement  in my opinion  clearly accepted that copyright can exist in a compilation even though the compilation consists of partly pirated material and partly non pirated material  This would seem to follow logically from what the House of Lords had to say in Ladbroke  Football  Ltd to the effect that  so far as compilations of existing material are concerned  originality sufficient to attract copyright in a compilation can be found entirely in the work of selecting the material to be included in the compilation  as opposed to the work of reducing those selections to written form   As I have already found  copyright in the works in suit rests with the applicants  Dallas Gibson and RMC uploaded the works in suit onto the Icarus College website as part of their own course materials for their own students  These infringing copies are deemed  by virtue of s   of the Copyright Act   to be the property of the copyright owners  being the Boyapatis  see A One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd     IPR    A notice on the Icarus College website stated that it was the owner of the copyright in the materials published on the website  When the respondents made the works in suit available to their students via the Icarus College website  they treated the infringing copies as their own and acted in a manner inconsistent with the applicants  rights as deemed owners and  accordingly  converted them  see Caxton Publishing Co Ltd v Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd   AC   at   per Lord Russell of Killowen and   per Lord Porter  citedRedwood Music Ltd v Chappell   Co Ltd   RPC   Drummond J also referred to Redwood Music Ltd v Chappell   Co Ltd   RPC   at   per Goff J and Warwick Film Productions Ltd v Eisinger     Ch   at     per Plowman J  both of which supported the proposition that a work might be an original work in which copyright subsisted  even though infringing copyright in an earlier work because it is in part a copy of a substantial part of the earlier copyright work citedWarwick Film Productions Ltd v Eisinger     Ch   Drummond J also referred to Redwood Music Ltd v Chappell   Co Ltd   RPC   at   per Goff J and Warwick Film Productions Ltd v Eisinger     Ch   at     per Plowman J  both of which supported the proposition that a work might be an original work in which copyright subsisted  even though infringing copyright in an earlier work

cases cth HCA  html  The respondents also submitted that the evidence showed that it was common for providers of preparation courses for the UMAT and the like to reproduce material from other copyright sources without permission or acknowledgment  Relying on Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design   Developments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Concrete   at     per Kirby and Crennan JJ  they argued that this  might be said to give rise to an implied licence or right based on industry practice to  borrow  or reproduce such material  even though it is accepted that there was no direct or other contractual relationship between the applicants and the respondents in relation to the material   The relevant passage in Concrete referred to the principle established in cases concerned with architectural drawings and plans  that a licence may be implied where architects  artists and other persons prepare written material on the basis that it should be used in a particular manner for a particular purpose  I do not consider that there is any basis for applying this principle to the subject matter of this case  even if the evidence were as the respondents contended  The evidence supports the proposition that practice exams are written on the basis that they should be used by students enrolling in the providers  courses for the purpose of preparing for the UMAT and not for the purpose of assisting other commercial providers to make their products   It follows from the foregoing that I would reject the respondents  submissions on lack of originality   In view of the conclusions I have reached above  it is unnecessary to consider the applicants  claim in so far as it was based on s   of the Copyright Act or involved an alleged breach of moral rights  In any event  at trial  the applicants did not strenuously press these alternative bases for the respondents  liability citedPolygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd  No       IPR   The applicants also relied on s   of the Copyright Act   This provision treats a copyright owner as if the copyright owner were also the owner of the infringing articles  see Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd  No       IPR     Polygram   per Lockhart J  Section   is in the following terms        The owner of the copyright in a work or other subject matter may bring an action for conversion or detention in relation to     a  an infringing copy  or            b  a device  including a circumvention device  used or intended to be used for making infringing copies               A  In an action for conversion or detention  a court may grant to the owner of the copyright all or any of the remedies that are available in such an action as if             a  the owner of the copyright had been the owner of the infringing copy since the time the copy was made  or   b  the owner of the copyright had been the owner of the device since the time when it was used or intended to be used for making infringing copies               B  Any relief granted by a court in an action for conversion or detention is in addition to any relief that the court may grant under section         C  A court is not to grant any relief to the owner of the copyright in an action for conversion or detention if the relief that the court has granted or proposes to grant under section   is  in the opinion of the court  a sufficient remedy      D  In deciding whether to grant relief in an action for conversion or detention and in assessing the amount of damages payable  the court may have regard to the following             a  the expenses incurred by the defendant  being a person who marketed or otherwise dealt with the infringing copy  in manufacturing or acquiring the infringing copy   b  whether the expenses were incurred before or after the infringing copy was sold or otherwise disposed of by the defendant             c  any other matter that the court considers relevant      E  If the infringing copy is an article of which only part consists of material that infringes copyright  the court  in deciding whether to grant relief and in assessing the amount of damages payable  may also have regard to the following             a  the importance to the market value of the article of the material that infringes the copyright   b  the proportion the material that infringes copyright bears to the article   c  the extent to which the material that infringes copyright may be separated from the article               A plaintiff is not entitled by virtue of this section to any damages or to any other pecuniary remedy  other than costs  if it is established that  at the time of the conversion or detention             a  the defendant was not aware  and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting  that copyright subsisted in the work or other subject matter to which the action relates   b  where the articles converted or detained were infringing copies the defendant believed  and had reasonable grounds for believing  that they were not infringing copies  or   c  where an article converted or detained was a device used or intended to be used for making articles the defendant believed  and had reasonable grounds for believing  that the articles so made or intended to be made were not or would not be  as the case may be  infringing copies   Section  B  provides that the relief that the court grants for conversion is in addition to any relief that the court may grant under s   of the Copyright Act   The grant of relief for conversion is  however  subject to the proviso in  C  that the  court is not to grant any relief to the owner of the copyright in an action for conversion     if the relief that the court     proposes to grant under section   is  in the opinion of the court  a sufficient remedy   In deciding whether to grant relief for conversion and in assessing the amount of damages payable  the court s attention is directed to the factors in s  D  of the Copyright Act   to which it may have regard  see generally Sony Entertainment  Australia  Ltd v Smith   FCA         IPR   at   per Jacobson J and Polygram     IPR   at     per Lockhart J   As indicated above  the applicants have made out their case respecting the conversion of infringing copies by the respondents  Neither the applicants nor the respondents have yet made submissions  however  concerning the application of ss  C  and  D  of the Copyright Act   This may be on account of the Court s order of   July   which deferred any questions concerning quantum of damages to a later stage in the proceeding  Accordingly  I propose to invite the parties to make such submissions as they consider appropriate on the application of ss  C  and  D  of the Copyright Act   The respondents rely on ss

Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd     CLR   at     There is a price to be paid for the advantages flowing from the possession of an eloquently descriptive trade name  Because it is descriptive it is equally applicable to any business of a like kind  its very descriptiveness ensures that it is not distinctive of any particular business and hence its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public  In cases of passing off  where it is the wrongful appropriation of the reputation of another or that of his goods is in question  a plaintiff which uses descriptive words in its trade name will find that quite small differences in a competitor s trade name will render the latter immune from action     The risk of confusion must be accepted  to do otherwise is to give to one who appropriates to himself descriptive words an unfair monopoly in those words and might even deter others from pursuing the occupation which the words describe  If this be so in the case of passing off actions the case of s     concerned only with the interests of third parties  is a fortiori  To allow this section of the  TPA  to be used as an instrument for the creation of any monopoly in descriptive names would be to mock the manifest intent of the legislation  Given that a name is no more than merely descriptive of a particular type of business  its use by others who carry on the same type of business does not deceive or mislead as to the nature of the business described     Evidence of confusion in the minds of members of the public is not evidence that the use of the Hornsby Centre s name is itself misleading or deceptive but rather that its intrusion into the field originally occupied by the Sydney Centre has  naturally enough  caused a degree of confusion in the public mind  This is not  however  anything at which s   is directed   Since the cross claimants  use of the name  Medical Entrance  is essentially descriptive  they bore a heavy onus to show that the name had gained a secondary meaning referring specifically to the goods and services of their business   The evidence established that neither of the cross claimants had traded under the name  Medical Entrance  alone  The evidence showed that Dallas Gibson  from   and RMC  from September   gave various names to their business and business products  including    UMAT Superprep Courses    Dallas Tertiary Prep Skills    Dallas Medical Entrance    Dallas Super Prep  according to Dallas Gibson  prior to     Tertiary Prep Skills  according to Dallas  this was an  early  usage    Icarus College  from around March   and    Dallas SuperKeenEye    There was little other evidence relating to the reputation of the cross claimants in the use of the name  Medical Entrance  see also     below citedBritish Telecommunications PLC v One In A Million Ltd     IPR   Since the cross claimants used the words  Medical Entrance  descriptively and did not  in any event  trade under these words alone  I reject the proposition that the words  Medical Entrance  had become relevantly associated with them by the end of    When the cross respondents began their business in early   the cross

whether the words lower the defamed in the estimation of right thinking people generally  In Sim v Stretch     All ER   at   Lord Atkin stated the well accepted test in the following passage  The question  then  is whether the words in their ordinary signification are capable of being defamatory  Judges and textbook writers alike have found difficulty in defining with precision the word  defamatory   The conventional phrase exposing the plaintiff to hatred  ridicule and contempt is probably too narrow  The question is complicated by having to consider the person or class of persons whose reaction to the publication is the test of the wrongful character of the words used  I do not intend to ask your Lordships to lay down a formal definition  but after collating the opinions of many authorities I propose in the present case the test  would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right thinking members of society generally  In considering whether words are defamatory  the context in which the words are used must be considered  The whole publication must be considered  The circumstances of the publication  the words used and the context may all have an effect on the imputation conveyed to the reader  Balkin and Davis stated at p   Whether statements which have a clearly disparaging meaning are to be found defamatory depends very much on the context in which they are made  and the audience to whom they are made   The words are taken to have their ordinary and natural meaning  which is that meaning that is reasonably understood by the ordinary reasonable reader using his or her knowledge and experience of human affairs   A person need not be referred to by name to be defamed  It is sufficient if some people  proved to have knowledge of extrinsic circumstances  might reasonably believe that the statement referred to him or her  see Balkin and Davis at      They added at   Identification of the plaintiff as the person referred to may
