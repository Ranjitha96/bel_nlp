Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAndrews v John Fairfax   Sons Limited     NSWLR   One of the relevant considerations on a stay application of this kind is whether the proposed appeal is genuine and based on reasonably arguable grounds  see Andrews v John Fairfax   Sons Limited     NSWLR   at      I could form no judgment on this point in the absence of a notice of appeal and submissions from counsel  No doubt other potentially relevant considerations could arise from Mr Siminton s consideration of the terms of the orders   For these reasons I adjourned the further hearing of this stay application until   November          I certify that the preceding fifteen   numbered

Authority v Siminton  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   October   I delivered judgment in this proceeding  see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA    I found that Mr Siminton was a person who had carried on and was proposing to carry on the business of banking in Australia and that such conduct constituted or would constitute a contravention of s   of the Banking Act    Cth   the Act    I also found that Mr Siminton had engaged in conduct which contravened s   of the Act   I foreshadowed making injunctive orders to restrain Mr Siminton from engaging in further contraventions of the Act and orders appointing a receiver to identify the persons who had made deposits in the  bank  established by Mr Siminton  to get in the funds which were the subject of an order  made by Gray J on   January   and to provide for an orderly and equitable distribution of those funds to depositors  I listed the matter for mention on   November    On that day I made the foreshadowed orders referred toSiminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  By notice of motion dated   November   Mr Siminton moved the Court for orders that        of the moneys subject to the orders made by Gray J on   January   be released to him for the purpose of the payment of his legal expenses including the costs of a proposed appeal    The execution of the judgment  insofar as it appointed and empowered a receiver be stayed pending the hearing and determination of a proposed appeal  and    The order made by the Full Court on   July   that Mr Siminton pay a   fine within   days or such further time and by such instalments as the District Registrar might allow be stayed pending the hearing and determination of the proposed appeal  see Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR     I refused the applications for orders that   be released to Mr Siminton and that there be a stay of the Full Court s order  I adjourned the application for a stay of execution of the orders relating to the appointment of a receiver to   November    I indicated that I would publish my reasons for these decisions at a later date  These are those reasons   This proceeding was commenced on   December    Since that time Mr Siminton has accumulated unpaid legal fees totalling almost    He sought release of that amount in order to pay his solicitor and counsel their outstanding fees and to provide funds to support the prosecution of an appeal from my judgment and orders in the principal proceeding  Counsel also submitted that  unless the funds were released  Mr Siminton would be denied natural justice because he might have to prosecute the proposed appeal without legal assistance  Counsel asserted that Mr Siminton had the right to use the funds in the manner proposed   Even if I had the power to grant the stay I would not be disposed  in the exercise of my discretion  to do so  Mr Siminton has been in default of the Full Court s orders since   October    No explanation for the delay in making the application has been proffered  More importantly  it is difficult to conceive of what purpose would be served by granting a stay pending the hearing and determination of the foreshadowed appeal from my judgment  Even if a Full Court were to hold that Mr Siminton had not contravened any of the provisions of the Act such a finding would not impinge in anyway on the efficacy of the Full Court s order that Mr Siminton pay a   fine or the legal consequences of his failure to do so  Mr Siminton appears to continue to labour under the misconception that the contempt for which the fine was imposed can  in some way  be purged or excused by findings that the orders of Sundberg J which Mr Siminton was found to have breached  should not have been made because Mr Siminton had not  in fact  contravened the Act   This misconception was disabused by the Full Court over a year ago  see Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC         FCR   at      It may be that the stay is sought on the assumption that  if he is successful in persuading the Full Court that he has not contravened the Act   the money will immediately become available to him to use as he wishes  including paying the fine  Such an assumption would be misplaced  Deposits were made on terms which required that they would be invested so as to yield interest at promised rates  They were not invested so that they could be used by Mr Siminton for his own purposes  Mr Siminton s fiduciary obligations to depositors may well prevent him from drawing on depositor s funds to pay the fine  Any stay would  therefore  be of doubtful utility   For these reasons the application for a stay of the Full Court s order was refused   Although  in the judgment which I handed down on   October   I had foreshadowed making orders in relation to the appointment and duties of a receiver  the orders were not made until   November    Mr Siminton s notice of motion was filed on   November    The application for a stay of my orders was therefore made in anticipation of those orders being made but at a time when Mr Siminton was unaware of the terms of those orders  He had not  therefore  had the opportunity of framing a notice of appeal  even in draft form citedAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Full Court s order read      Paragraph   of the orders of Merkel J made on   April   is set aside and in lieu thereof it is ordered           a  A fine in the sum of   be imposed on the appellant in respect of the contempt        b  The fine be paid to the District Registrar within   days or such further time and by such instalments as the District Registrar may allow     c  In the event that there is default in payment of the fine or of any instalment  the District Registrar shall apply to a judge of the Court for direction concerning enforcement      On   September   the day on which the sixty day period prescribed by Order  b  expired  Mr Siminton applied for an extension of time within which to make payment of the    By order dated   September   the District Registrar extended the time for payment to   pm on   October    On that day Mr Siminton s solicitors wrote to the District Registrar seeking a further extension of one month for Mr Siminton to pay the fine  No reason for seeking the extension was given  The application was refused  The fine has not since been paid  On   November   I found that Mr Siminton had committed a contempt of the Full Court s order by failing to make the   payment  or that part of it which he had the capacity to pay  in a timely manner  see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA     I harbour grave doubts as to whether I have the power  should I be minded to exercise it  to stay the operation of the Full Court s order  The Full Court imposed the fine and provided the mechanism by which Mr Siminton could be relieved of the obligation to pay it in whole or in part within the   days which the Court allowed  The Full Court did not confer on a single judge of the Court the power to vary its orders or delay their implementation
