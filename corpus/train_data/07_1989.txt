TPD benefit  on the grounds that the applicant s total and permanent disability was caused by a condition related to his pre existing schizophrenia  was fair and reasonable in its operation to the applicant in the circumstances    in relation to the medical evidence before it  the Tribunal noted the considerable variation in the clinical history provided by the applicant to the various medical experts  and the competing medical opinions relevant to the applicant s case    the Tribunal ultimately concluded that it was satisfied that the Trustee s decision to decline payment of the TPD benefit to the applicant on the grounds that  on the balance of probabilities his medical condition  be it PTSD or an anxiety disorder  was related to the pre existing  long standing paranoid schizophrenia  was fair and reasonable given the conflicting psychiatric opinions  After reviewing all the available medical evidence  the Tribunal also expressed the opinion that the applicant s PTSD or anxiety disorder was sufficiently related to his schizophrenia such as to render the decision of the Trustee fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances    contrary to the submission of the applicant  the Tribunal did not misdirect itself as to the fundamental issue it was obliged to consider  namely whether the decision of the second respondent was

is on the applicant to demonstrate that there has been an error of law  The Tribunal does not commit an error of law because it finds facts wrongly or upon a doubtful basis or because it adopts some

the Tribunal s Record of Decision  and the Statements of Facts  Issues and Contentions of the parties  They may be summarised as follows    in   the applicant was diagnosed with schizophrenia and commenced ongoing treatment    in September   the applicant commenced employment with the Department of Primary Industries in Queensland as a field assistant in the Department s Fire Ant Eradication Program    on   September   the applicant joined the QSuper Accumulation Account  the Fund   The Fund automatically provided him with   units of death and Total and Permanent Disablement  TPD  insurance cover    in December   the applicant applied to the Fund to increase his insurance cover to   units of death and TPD cover  This was approved effective   December     so far as relevant  cl     of the QSuper Trust Deed s Insurance Terms provides as follows       No insurance benefit will be paid for a claim unless        b   i  the member has been an insured member for fewer than   continuous years  and   ii  the member lodged a personal medical statement at or about the date on which the member became an insured member  and   iii  the board is of the opinion that the total and permanent disablement     was not related to a condition that was disclosed on the personal medical statement or which in the opinion of the board should reasonably have been disclosed on the personal medical statement  or     c   i  the member has been an insured member for fewer than   continuous years  and   ii  the member did not lodge a personal medical statement at or about the date on which the member became an insured member  and   iii  it is established to the satisfaction of the board that the total and permanent disablement     was not related to a condition that ought reasonably to have been disclosed had a personal medical statement been submitted at or about the date on which the member became an insured member       there is some lack of clarity as to whether the applicant had disclosed his schizophrenia to the Fund prior to joining  The applicant claims he did so orally over the telephone and in a personal medical statement which was posted to QSuper  however it appears that this medical statement was not received  In any event this is not a relevant issue in this case as no insurance benefit is payable for TPD relating to a pre existing medical condition irrespective whether it was disclosed    on   January   while inspecting a property for fire ants  the applicant injured his right foot after running away from two dogs he thought were chasing him    the applicant ceased work on   July   after anticipation of a repeat experience left him anxious and stressed to such a degree that he was unable to cope with his work    the applicant applied for a TPD benefit on   February     a delegate of the Trustee of the Fund determined that the TPD was because of his pre existing schizophrenia and declined to pay the benefit in accordance with its rules relating to pre existing illnesses    by letter dated   May   the applicant was informed of the Trustee s decision    the applicant sought to appeal this decision on   June   and then subsequently withdrew his appeal on   July    However  by letter dated   May   he renewed his appeal and provided various reports in support of the appeal    on   June   the applicant was retired on ill health grounds    on   August   the Trustee reviewed its decision at the applicant s request  and advised the applicant that the previous decision of the delegate of the Trustee was affirmed    the applicant appealed the Trustee s decision to the Tribunal on   November   pursuant to s   of the Act   on the basis that the decision of the Trustee was unfair or unreasonable    the Tribunal affirmed the Trustee s decision in its decision of   October     the amount in dispute is the insured TPD benefit of     The Tribunal identified its role as to determine whether the decision of the Trustee was fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances  The Tribunal noted that the issue was not whether the Tribunal would have made the same decision  The Tribunal considered that the issue before it was whether the decision of the Trustee that the condition rendering the applicant totally and permanently disabled was related to a pre existing condition  as that term appeared in subcll     and     in the Fund s insurance terms  operated fairly and reasonably in relation to the applicant in these circumstances   In its review determination and reasons the Tribunal considered in summary    the Trust Deed and Insurance Terms    the medical reports of one psychologist  three psychiatrists  two general practitioners  two orthopaedic surgeons  one occupational health physician and a podiatrist and    the submissions of the parties  I note that the applicant was given leave to be legally represented at the hearing before the Tribunal   The Tribunal found     Based on the Tribunal s analysis of the medical reports  the Tribunal is satisfied that the Trustee s decision to decline payment of the TPD benefit to the Complainant on the grounds that  on the balance of probabilities  his medical condition  be it PTSD or an anxiety disorder  was related to the pre existing  long standing paranoid schizophrenia was fair and reasonable  given the conflicting psychiatric opinions     In the opinion of the Tribunal after reviewing all of the available medical evidence  the Complainant s PTSD or anxiety disorder is sufficiently related

there was evidence before both the Trustee and the Tribunal  in particular the opinions of Dr Reddan and Dr Olsen  that the cause of the applicant s total and permanent disability was his schizophrenia  and that the applicant did not suffer from PTSD  reports of Dr Reddan and first report of Dr Butler   It appears that the Tribunal  unlike the Trustee  accepted that the applicant suffered a medical condition in the nature of either PTSD or anxiety disorder  Nonetheless there was clear evidence in the report of Dr de Leacy   which was not before the Trustee  but to which the Tribunal could have regard in light of principles emerging from cases including Sykley   that the applicant s pre existing schizophrenia may have made him more susceptible to experiencing PTSD or an anxiety disorder  It is clearly in respect of the view the Tribunal took of the susceptibility of the applicant to either PTSD or anxiety disorder resulting from his schizophrenia that the Tribunal was referring to the  sufficient relationship  between those disorders and the applicant s schizophrenia  which latter condition was the basis of the Tribunal s finding  It was open to the Tribunal on the evidence to make that finding of fact  Interestingly  while the applicant claims as a ground of appeal that the Tribunal failed to give any or adequate weight to the views of Dr de Leacy   which weight was an issue of fact for the Tribunal in any event   on the contrary  it appears that the Tribunal gave considerable weight to the views of Dr de Leacy regarding the susceptibility of persons  including the applicant  suffering schizophrenia to PTSD or anxiety disorders   Second  in relation to the question of law concerning the improper exercise by the Tribunal of its powers under s  a  of the Act   it is clear that the role the Tribunal assumed for itself  and the question it posed for itself  were correct  The Tribunal recognised that  irrespective whether the Tribunal would have made the decision the Trustee made  its role was to consider whether the decision of the Trustee to refuse payment of the TPD benefit because of the applicant s pre existing illness was fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances  s     Further  and contrary to the submissions raised in the applicant s first ground of appeal   in my view the Tribunal did not err in finding that the Trustee s decision was fair and reasonable  notwithstanding that the Trustee did not have the opportunity to have regard to the opinion of Dr Eric De Leacy in his report dated   October    In relation to this point  I note in passing that clearly there was no dearth of psychological or psychiatric material before the Trustee  including several reports favourable to the applicant  However the key issue here is that the Trustee did not have the opportunity to have regard to the opinion of Dr de Leacy  The obvious answer to this point is that the reason for this is

clear that  as observed by the Tribunal itself  and as demonstrated by my summary of the evidence before the Tribunal  there was a dissent of opinion amongst the reporting psychologist and psychiatrists  In such a case  the weighting of the evidence by the Tribunal  including the preference given to the views of the relevant medical practitioners  is an issue of fact  and any errors in
