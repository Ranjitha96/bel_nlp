the definition does not extend to discrimination against all persons  male or female  simply on the ground of marital status  and is confined to discrimination against women  is confirmed by an example of the construction given by the international community  as to the admissibility of such material see Queensland v The Commonwealth   above  at    The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on   July   issued  in the course of its third periodic reports of States Parties to the Convention  the report of the United Kingdom Government  An annexure is a document entitled  Commentary on UK Reservations and Declarations  Statement entered by the United Kingdom on   April    At page   under the heading  Article   there is quoted an earlier reservation of the UK which was in these terms    With reference to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act   and other applicable legislation  the United Kingdom s acceptance of Article   is subject to the reservation that the phrase  irrespective of their marital status  shall not be taken to render discriminatory any difference of treatment accorded to single persons as against married persons  so long as there is equality of treatment as between married men and married women and as between single men and single women       It is then said      This statement clarifies the UK s understanding of this Article  The UK Government still believes that it is an accurate statement of the Article s meaning  However  the Government accepts that there is no need for this still to be explicitly stated  On this basis the UK Government wishes to withdraw the statement    Article   provides  emphasis added    States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms  agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and  to this end  undertake     a  To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure  through law and other appropriate means  the practical realisation of this principle     b  To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures  including sanctions where appropriate  prohibiting all discrimination against women     c  To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination     d  To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation     e  To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person  organisation or enterprise     f  To take all appropriate measures  including legislation  to modify or abolish existing laws  regulations  customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women     g  To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women     Read together with the Preamble and the definition of   discrimination against women   the obligations undertaken in Article   are clearly confined to acting  and refraining from acting  in relation to disadvantage suffered by women as compared with men   Article   requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures  including legislation  in all fields  in particular in the political  social  economic and cultural fields  to ensure the full development and advancement of women for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms   on a basis of equality with men   citedRichardson v Forestry Commission   HCA         CLR   at    http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s    The question is not whether Parliament has made a legislative judgment that a treaty obligation exists  in which case it is enough that   the legislative judgment could reasonably be made     Richardson v Forestry Commission   HCA         CLR   at      Rather  as Ms Mortimer SC for the Registrar submitted  Parliament has made the legislative judgment  It is expressed in ss   and   and s    The Court must construe the language of those provisions  There must be an examination of the Convention to ascertain to what Australia has undertaken to give effect by way of legislation   At the outset the Preamble notes that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person   and in the equal rights of men and women    It also notes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination  that all human beings are born free and equal  and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration    without discrimination of any kind  including distinction based on sex     The Preamble then notes that States Parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights have the obligation to ensure   the equal right of men and women   to enjoy all economic  social  cultural  civil and political rights distinguishedToben v Jones   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Mr Lenehan on behalf of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner  Cth  who was given leave to appear as amicus curiae   supported the applicant s arguments  He also advanced an alternative argument  He submitted that even if marital status discrimination is not covered by Article   of the Convention  the application of s   of the Sex Discrimination Act to marital status discrimination is within the limits of s  xxix  of the Constitution  the external affairs power  and thus s   of the Act  He argued that the proscription of marital status discrimination against women will prevent the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about women and can therefore be seen as a means of   nipping in the bud  conduct which may grow into or foster   discrimination against women   within the meaning of Article    He referred to Article     above  and cited the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Toben v Jones   FCAFC         FCR     In Toben the appellant had been found by a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have engaged in racial vilification contrary to s  C of the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   He contended that provision was invalid because the source of the s  xxix  external affairs power relied on  the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination   was concerned with the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred whereas s  C was intended only to proscribe acts which could be characterised as expressions of racial hatred  In other words  as I understand the argument  the Act did not give effect to the relevant Convention because it did not go far enough  it did not fully implement the Convention   Carr J  with whom Kiefel J agreed  at   accepted that the Act did not fully implement Article   of the Convention because provisions in the Bill which created criminal offences in respect of racial hatred had been rejected by Parliament  However  his Honour at   said that it was clearly consistent with the provisions of the Convention that a State Party   should legislate to  nip in the bud  the doing of offensive  insulting  humiliating or intimidating public acts which are done because of race  colour or national or ethnic origin before such acts can grow into incitement or promotion of racial hatred or discrimination      it is for the legislature to choose the means by which it carries into or gives effect to a treaty      As already mentioned  the present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s    In any event  for the reasons given above  the Convention with which this case is concerned addresses discrimination against women  in the sense defined in Article   including discrimination which treats women less favourably than men who have the same marital status  But s   which applies to discrimination against men or women  married or unmarried  on the ground of marital status  is not  so to speak  a step along the way to some greater goal concerned with discrimination against women only  In so far as s   is concerned with stereotypes  it is the stereotype that might arise from a person being married  or unmarried  irrespective of sex   In Toben the nature of the discrimination  racial  was the subject of both the Convention and Act the point was that the prohibition in the latter only extended to less severe forms of discriminatory conduct than the former  In the present case  discrimination on the ground of marital status per se is not some less severe form of discrimination against women  The  nip in the bud  analysis does not apply   Section   speaks of  giv ing  effect to the Convention    A major element  albeit not the only one  of the Convention is the obligation undertaken by States Parties to legislate in a number of areas to proscribe discrimination against women   Section   being legislation  and not some other form of governmental activity  such as  for example  public education or governmental employment practices  is part of Australia s discharge of its obligation to legislate as required by the Convention  It is therefore to be construed as prohibiting discrimination against women treating them less favourably than men because they are married  The action of the Registrar in the present case had nothing to do with the applicant s being a woman  Had the applicant been a man  the result of the application would have been the same   Issue  i  must be resolved in the negative  It is not strictly necessary therefore to consider the second issue  but since the matter was fully argued I shall proceed to do so   Ms McLeod submitted that the Registrar contravened s   by refusing to consider the application   on its merits    The Registrar should have gone beyond a   blanket refusal    The decision involved an  analysis of the factual content  the supporting material  the weighing of relevant discretionary factors and so on    When it was pointed that this argument did not fit the agreed question  Ms McLeod sought the amendment which appears in   above distinguishedIW v City of Perth     HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Both arguments seem to me to introduce an unnecessary degree of subtlety into a simple process  The arguments apparently proceeded from a perceived need to accord with what some members of the High Court said in IW v City of Perth   HCA         CLR    But that case dealt with a town planning decision  an administrative decision of a very different nature    Service  involves an  act of helpful activity  or  the supplying of any     activities     required or demanded   Macquarie Dictionary  or  the action of serving  helping  or benefiting  conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another   Shorter Oxford Dictionary   Altering the Birth Register was an activity  The applicant requested the Registrar to perform that activity  The carrying out of that activity would have conferred a benefit on the applicant  The Registrar  because of the terms of the BDM Act  declined the request to carry out that activity  This was the refusal of a service   An activity carried out by a government official can none the less be one which confers a benefit on an individual  Much of governmental activity today involves the conferring of benefits on individuals  The BDM Act itself recognises this  For example the Registrar may enter into an arrangement for the provision of  additional services   s   and the Governor in Council may make regulation prescribing fees with respect to searches etc and  other services provided by the Registrar   s  a iv
