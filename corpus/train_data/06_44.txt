Construction Services  WA  Pty Ltd v The Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union of Workers   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  At the conclusion of the hearing on   May   I granted an interim injunction until     pm on   May   essentially  in the terms sought by the applicant  I also ordered that by     pm on   May   the applicant apply for the matter to be listed before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission  AIRC  that the respondent file and serve any affidavits in opposition to the extension of the injunction by Friday    May   and that the matter be adjourned for further hearing to     am on   May    I also ordered that the costs of the application for an interim injunction should be costs in the cause  My reasons are set out in Broad Construction Services  WA  Pty Ltd v The Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union of Workers   FCA     The hearing listed to take place on   May   did not proceed because prior to the hearing on that day the respondent advised the applicant that the notice of intended industrial action which had precipitated the application for the interim injunction had been withdrawn  and the foreshadowed industrial action notice was cancelled   Thereafter  neither party took any further steps to progress the substantive application  and on   June   the applicant filed a notice of motion for leave to discontinue with an order that the respondent pay its costs citedRe McJannet  Ex parte The Australian Workers  Union of Employees Queensland  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for the applicant relied specifically upon the following observation by the High Court in Re McJannet  Ex parte The Australian Workers  Union of Employees  Queensland  No     HCA         CLR   at    McJannet       The test for determining whether a proceeding is in a matter arising under the Act for the purposes of s   is whether the right or the duty that is sought to be enforced owes its existence to a provision of the Act      The applicant submitted that in this case  the right which it sought to enforce by bringing the application was a right  not under the Act   but a right under the TP Act in respect of a threatened breach of s  D of that Act   The applicant submitted further that it did not matter that in order to succeed in vindicating its claim for relief under the TP Act that it would need to overcome a defence founded upon a statutory immunity to be found in s  MT and s  ML of the Act   The applicant argued that in determining whether s   of the Act had application  the inquiry was limited to whether the right sought to be vindicated by the applicant arose under the Act   The applicant submitted that  if a defence raises issues arising under the Workplace Relations Act that is not a matter arising under the Act for the purposes of s     In my view  the observations of the High Court in the McJannet case which were relied upon by the applicant and which refer only to the source of the claim which is made and not the source of any defence to such claim  were not intended to derogate the pre existing law which is articulated in the observations in each of the LNC and the Felton cases referred to above  The observations that the High Court made in the McJannet case which are relied upon by the applicant  are to be read subject to the context in which those observations were made  In McJannet   the prosecutors sought in the High Court a writ of prohibition against the judges of the Federal Court  The proceeding before the High Court was one where the prosecutor asserted that there was an absence of jurisdiction in the Federal Court to consider the proceeding which was before the Federal Court  The High Court was not therefore required to consider the characterisation of the  matter  other than by reference to the characterisation of the claim by way of a writ of prohibition  which had been made in the High Court  There was in the proceeding before the High Court no attempt to enforce a duty arising under the Act   and  therefore  there was no need for the High Court to address the question of whether a claim arising under the Industrial Relations Act    Cth   as the Act was then named  or a defence of immunity under that Act   would be included within the scope of  a matter arising under the Act   citedL N C  Industries Limited v B M W   Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondent submitted the scope of  the matter  in question was to be identified by reference to the scope of the  justiciable controversy  to be determined in this application  The applicant argued that the determination of the justiciable controversy required the determination of both the applicant s claim and its defence  namely  that the impugned conduct was  protected action  under the Act and afforded the respondent immunity from the suit brought by the applicant under the TP Act in respect of an alleged breach of s  D of that Act   The respondent argued that this was a sufficient basis upon which the Court could conclude that the respondent was a party to a proceeding in a matter arising under the Act for the purposes of s   of the Act   In support of this submission  the respondent relied upon the following observations of the High Court in the case of L N C  Industries Limited v B M W   Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   at    L N C        It is true to say that a matter does not arise under a law made by the Parliament merely because the interpretation of the law is involved  Felton v Mulligan     CLR   at pp             On the other hand  a matter may arise under a law of the Parliament although the interpretation or validity of the law is not involved  R  v  Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Barrett     HCA       CLR   at p     The conclusion reached by Latham C J  in that case  and stated in a passage that has often been cited with approval is   that a matter may properly be said to arise under a federal law if the right or duty in question in the matter owes its existence to federal law or depends upon federal law for its enforcement  whether or not the determination of the controversy involves the interpretation  or validity  of the law   Equally  there is a matter arising under a federal law if the source of a defence which asserts that the defendant is immune from the liability or obligation alleged against him is a law of the Commonwealth  Felton v Mulligan     HCA       CLR     at p     citedAustralian Securities Commission v Aust Home Investments Limited     FCR   The applicant also relied upon the decision of Hill J in Australian Securities Commission v Aust Home Investments Limited     FCR    Aust Home Investments    in support of its submission that the Court could have regard to the question of whether the respondent had acted unreasonably in relation to the threatened industrial action  and whether the applicant had acted reasonably in commencing the substantive application and seeking the interim injunction  In support of his submission that the respondent had acted unreasonably prior to the commencement of the applications  counsel for the applicant referred to the fact that in my reasons for granting the interim injunction  at   I had referred to inferences available on the evidence as it then stood  that in relation to at least one employer  the respondent did not genuinely try and negotiate for a collective agreement  before threatening industrial action  Counsel also referred to the fact that the respondent had not filed affidavits opposing the injunctions  Further  it was submitted that in the circumstances the applicant had no choice but to issue the application   Counsel for the respondent submitted that this was a case where the Court should follow the general rule and not speculate on what would have happened had the matter gone to trial  Counsel for the respondent disputed that the respondent had acted unreasonably and submitted that any trial of the issues raised in the application would have required the Court to make credibility findings and findings as to the bona fides of officers of the respondent  Further  counsel also identified several legal arguments which were available to be raised at the trial in support of the respondent s case  Counsel referred to the following observations by Hill J in the Aust Home Investments at      It will rarely  if ever  be appropriate  where there has been no trial on the merits  for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or  as it might be put  to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial  Stratford   This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue   Counsel for the respondent also disputed that the applicant had no choice but to commence the application because it could have proceeded in the AIRC  Counsel further submitted that the respondent and its members had decided to cancel the proposed industrial action after the parties had attended a conciliation conference convened in accordance with my order that the parties refer this matter to the AIRC citedHomestyle Pty Ltd v The Western Australian Builders Labourers  Painters and Plasterers Union of Workers   WASC  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  html  Counsel for the applicant also referred to the cases of Homestyle Pty Ltd v The Western Australian Builders Labourers  Painters and Plasterers Union of Workers   WASC    Homestyle  and Metropolitan Properties Pty Limited v Caltex Petroleum Pty Limited   WASC    Metropolitan Properties  as instances where a court had awarded a discontinuing plaintiff costs in respect of an interlocutory injunction where the requirement for the injunction has fallen away due to no fault on the part of the plaintiff   Counsel for the respondent also submitted that the Homestyle and Metropolitan Properties cases  were distinguishable in that in each of those cases  there had been a contested hearing in relation to the interlocutory injunctions and costs had been reserved in respect of each of those injunctions whereas in this case  there had been no contested interlocutory hearing and the costs of the injunction application were  costs in the cause  citedMetropolitan Properties Pty Limited v Caltex

application were  costs in the cause  citedJ T Stratford   Son Ltd v Lindley  No       WLR   Counsel for the respondent said that there were several similarities between this case and the case of J T Stratford   Son Ltd v Lindley  No       WLR   where an interlocutory injunction had been obtained restraining the defendants who were trade union officials from enforcing an embargo on the plaintiff s barges as part of an industrial dispute  As in this case  the  costs order  made in respect of the interlocutory injunction was that  costs be in the cause   Thereafter  the substantive action was not pursued and the action never came to trial  Eventually the defendants brought a summons to dismiss the action for want of prosecution and the plaintiff countered with a summons for leave to discontinue on the basis that the defendants pay the costs of the action including the costs of the interlocutory injunction  The Court of Appeal rejected the plaintiff s arguments that it should have the costs because they would very probably have won the action had it been tried on the merits  The Court of Appeal however upheld the decision that leave to discontinue should be given on the basis that there be no order for costs citedFencott v Mueller   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is accepted that the word  matter  in s   of the Act is to be construed by

applied in deciding whether a matter is one  arising under  a law of the Commonwealth for the purposes of s  ii  of the Constitution of the Commonwealth  see  for example  BGC Contracting Pty Ltd v

observations of the High Court in the case of L N C  Industries Limited v B M W   Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   at    L N C        It is true to say that a matter does not arise under a law

Commonwealth  Felton v Mulligan     HCA       CLR     at p      In Felton v Mulligan   HCA         CLR    Felton  Walsh J said at      A comparison between the terms of s   i   and those of s  ii   of the Constitution indicates that a distinction is to be drawn between a matter  arising under  a law of the Parliament and a matter which involves the interpretation of such a law  The fact that the interpretation of a law is involved does not necessarily mean that there is a matter arising under the law  But  in my opinion  there is a matter arising under the law if the source of the right claimed by the plaintiff or applicant or the source of a defence which asserts that the defendant or respondent is immune from the liability or obligation alleged against him is a law of the Parliament  I think that that view of what constitutes a matter arising under a law of the Parliament is in conformity with the statements made in R  v  Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration  Ex parte Barrett   HCA         CLR   by Latham C J  and by McTiernan J      CLR  at p    There Latham C J  said   If a right claimed is conferred by or under a federal statute  the claim arises under the statute      CLR  at p    Likewise  in my opinion  if the answer made to a claim is that the defendant is free from the obligation asserted against him and that this freedom is conferred by an Act of the Parliament  the defence arises under that Act and the result is that there is before the Court a  matter  which arises under that Act    In my view  the determination of the justiciable controversy  which includes the applicant s claim that the impugned conduct comprised a threatened breach of s  D of the TP Act   would also require determination of the respondent s defence that the impugned conduct was protected action within the meaning of the Act   Both the claim and the defence are in my view part of the same matter  Applying the observations of the High Court in the Felton and LNC cases referred to above  the proceeding is to be regarded as being in a matter arising under the Act because the source of the defence which asserts that the respondent is immune from liability or obligation  is founded on s  ML and s  MT of the Act    In my view  the observations of the High Court in the McJannet case which were relied upon by the applicant and which refer only to the source of the claim which is made and not the source of any defence to such claim  were not intended to derogate the pre existing law which is articulated in the observations in each of the LNC and the Felton cases referred to above  The observations that the High Court made in the McJannet case which are relied upon by the applicant  are to be read subject to the context in which those observations were made  In McJannet   the prosecutors sought in the High Court a writ of prohibition against the judges of the Federal Court  The proceeding before the High Court was one where
