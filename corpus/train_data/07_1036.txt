 CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBut even were FKP and FGUP to file evidence capable of establishing a prima facie case in relation to their claims for final relief  Spirits submits that their application in relation to the Existing Applications and the Further Applications would nevertheless fail  An interlocutory injunction is granted to preserve the status quo pending the determination at trial of the rights of the parties to final relief  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    The interlocutory relief sought is in respect of trade mark applications which are not the subject of the cross claim or any present application for relief by FKP and FGUP  Spirits submits that there is insufficient connection between the orders sought and the preservation of the status quo in relation to the subject matter of the cross claim to support the present application  even if the Court had before it evidence of a prima facie case  But even assuming to the contrary against Spirits  Spirits submits that there would nevertheless be insufficient grounds for the making of the proposed orders  The orders sought are not proper orders with respect to the conduct of these proceedings  but relate to trade mark applications filed by Spirits in good faith and in the ordinary course of its business  Spirits submits that they are not orders that the Court will make lightly  and in the absence of compelling reasons  the Court should not  in Spirits  submission  intervene to impose conditions and obligations upon Spirits in the ordinary conduct of its business with respect to its trade marks  especially trade marks that not presently in issue in the proceedings  For the reasons outlined below  Spirits submits that even if the present application was to be dealt with as falling outside the class of an ordinary application for interlocutory relief  there is insufficient basis for the making of the proposed orders  including on  case management grounds  appliedAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFKP and FGUP submit that the proposed orders are not in the nature of substantive interlocutory relief on the cross claim  such as rectification of the Register  the orders are procedural rather than substantive  In these circumstances  there is no cause for any rigid application of the principles relating to the grant of interlocutory injunctions discussed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         ALR   at         and Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    In particular  there is no need for FKP and FGUP to demonstrate a prima facie case or a serious question to be tried on the cross claim as a condition of the grant of the relief set out in the draft short minutes of order  Proposed orders   and   do no more than facilitate the recordal by the Registrar of particulars of claims which are in fact made by FKP and FGUP  and which  for the reasons given above  will have a direct bearing on the fate of the Existing and Further Applications  According to Spirits  it is essential  when considering any application for interlocutory injunctive relief  to examine the nature of the rights asserted  the probability of ultimate success in enforcing them and the practical consequences that would flow from the grant of the interlocutory relief    Australian Broadcasting Corp v O Neill at      Spirits rhetorically asks  What is the right asserted here  Presumably it is not a right to force Spirits  at the end of a final hearing on the application of Part   of the Act  to submit involuntarily to the recordal of the alleged  interest   Nor is it a right asserted in the present proceedings  as the Existing Applications and the Further Applications are not the subject matter of the cross claim and FKP and FGUP presently claim no relief with respect to those applications  In truth  FKP and FGUP do not identify perhaps unsurprisingly  given that they are of the view  wrongly in Spirits  submission  that their present application is merely for  case management purposes  this essential first ingredient of an application for mandatory interlocutory relief  Given their terms  the orders sought here by FKP and FGUP cannot be regarded as being purely procedural in nature or justified simply by principles of case management  Accordingly  Spirits submits that the ordinary principles relevant to the grant of interlocutory relief must apply to the grant of relief presently sought by FKP and FGUP  These principles are well settled  To succeed in their application  FKP and FGUP bear the onus of establishing to the satisfaction of the Court that       a  The applicant for relief has a prima facie case in relation to its application for final relief  and   b  the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interlocutory relief that is sought  and   c  damages would not be an adequate remedy   See Australian Broadcasting Corp v O Neill   Spirits submits that it is now well established that an applicant for interlocutory relief must  as a threshold issue  prove that it has a  prima facie case  for final relief  The test is sometimes expressed as  in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is  there is a probability that at the trial of the action the applicant will be held to be entitled to the final relief claimed  Australian Broadcasting Corp v O Neill   restoring  if restoration were needed  Beecham Group v Bristol

cth HCA  htmlIn the cross claim  FKP and FGUP assert rights in relation to a number of registered trade marks which include or comprise one or more of the words STOLI  STOLICHNAYA and MOSKOVSKAYA  and seek relief to give effect to those rights  The Existing Applications all relate to trade marks which include or comprise one or more of the same words  as would any Further Applications  and are in respect of the same or similar goods  In these circumstances  FKP and FGUP say that the Existing and Further Applications are  or would be  derivative of the prior registrations which are the subject of the cross claim  According to FKP and FGUP the use of a trade mark the subject of an Existing or Further Application would infringe one or more of the prior registrations on the basis that the respective trade marks are substantially identical or deceptively similar  see s   of the Act  the words STOLI  STOLICHNAYA and MOSKOVSKAYA are plainly central  distinctive elements of each mark  for those marks which incorporate label devices  the device elements are also similar in many cases  Moreover  the use of additional words or elements  such as a person s name  in conjunction with a registered trade mark does not avoid infringement of the trade mark  provided that it is being used for a trade mark purpose  see Mark Foys Ltd v Davies Coop   Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    According to FKP and FGUP  this would necessarily be so in the case of the trade marks the subject of the Existing and Further Applications  Put another way  the determination of the claims made by FKP and FGUP in the cross claim will have a direct bearing on the validity or acceptability for registration of the Existing and Further Applications  given the similarity of the marks and the fact that the latter fall later in the  queue   The claims articulated in respect of the former therefore disclose an interest in respect of the latter appliedOD Transport Pty Ltd v Western Australian
