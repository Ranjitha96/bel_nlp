 CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondent relied upon the notion that Division   was a code and that care should be exercised in having recourse to the pre existing law when construing it  Reference was made in this respect to Brennan v R   HCA         CLR   at    In this respect  however  the terms of s       of the ITAA   are to be recalled  in particular since Division   can be seen to have a precursor  redrafted in different style  in s  G of the ITAA     On the assumption that the applicants are correct as to the meaning of s        and in particular as to the meaning of the phrase  part of the tax loss  the respondent submits  and reasoned in his disallowance of the objection  that KSL as the income company does not meet the condition in s       It was common ground that the loss company  KYC  satisfied all conditions in subdivision   A  In particular the matters set out in s        and through it  Subdivision   A  The satisfaction of Subdivision   A arose from the fact that the continuity of business test in s      was not failed  even though the continuity of ownership test in s      was failed citedCIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club

au cases cth FCAFC  html  The respondent submitted that it was  doubtful  whether Division   should be characterised as relieving legislation   rather than providing a statutory regime for the transfer of losses within a corporate group where certain conditions are satisfied   Looking at its history and provenance  it is tolerably clear that the aim of Division   is to provide a benefit to

  more work to do than it bore  In particular  this criticism was made of   and   of the applicants  submissions   The applicants submitted that all these submissions of the respondent rest on the primary or first issue whether Division   provides in its terms for transfer of part of a loss which is incurred in part of a year  If it is  all the arguments about s     collapse in on themselves   I think there is force in this last submission  Ultimately  there is one issue  Does Division   contemplate as part of its operation the transfer between companies in a group to which the Division applies part of a tax loss for a year which is referable to part of that year citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v McMahon     FCR   The appeal is to be decided upon the facts comprising the arrangement on which the ruling was made  Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McMahon     FCR    The relevant facts  taken from the ruling are as follows     KYC was incorporated during September   and is a public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange  ASX       The principal activities of KYC and its subsidiaries are          Research  development and sales of devices and systems to allow secure electronic payments and transactions at the point of sale      Service solutions  including installation  maintenance  help desk support  logistics and asset management services for point of sale terminals and automatic teller machines      Research  development and sales of smartcard technology  including licensing of operating systems and applications for smartcards  and     Marketing and sales of secure transaction network solutions          For a number of income years prior to the   tax year  KYC lodged tax returns on the basis of a substituted accounting period  SAP  being an early balancing SAP ending on   December  During the   year  KYC reverted to a   June year end due to a change in ownership of the company      Transition to the   June year end was effected via an   month return covering the period   January   to   June    This represented KYC s   year of income      KSL was incorporated in Australia on   August   with all shares in KSL directly owned by KYC  KSL was incorporated by KYC as a special purpose entity to acquire a particular business from Telstra Corporation Ltd  Telstra  as part of the arrangements referred to below      On   October   Telstra  through its wholly owned subsidiary Telstra cb fs Limited  agreed to subscribe for   ordinary fully paid shares in the capital of KYC  These shares were not issued to Telstra until   December    These shares represented approximately   of the total capital of KYC at the time of issue      The business was transferred from Telstra to KSL pursuant to an agreement between Telstra  KSL and KYC dated   October    The business was not transferred from Telstra to KSL until   December   immediately after the issue of KSL shares to Telstra on the same date      The only activity of KSL prior to this date was to enter into contracts for the acquisition of the business  On the basis that KSL did not trade from the time of incorporation until   December   being the time of transfer of the business from Telstra  the business of KSL commenced on that date      During the   month period ended   June   KYC incurred a tax loss of    After utilising losses in that income year  there were tax losses available to be carried forward of        During the year ended   June   KSL derived taxable income of        On   June   a Share Sale Agreement was entered into whereby the shares in KSL are to be acquired by Telstra      KYC previously sought an exercise of the discretion of the Commissioner pursuant to section    d  to extend the time for making a valid loss transfer agreement      The Commissioner exercised his discretion pursuant to section    d  and notified KYC in a letter dated   June        A loss transfer agreement was entered into to transfer   in tax losses from KYC to KSL in order to reduce the taxable income of KSL to nil  The attempted loss transfer was ineffective as it sought to transfer the whole of the losses incurred by KYC for the period   January   to   June    The transfer was ineffective because the issue of   ordinary fully paid shares in the capital of KYC to Telstra on   December   was an abnormal trading event and resulted in a change of ownership as the shares represented approximately   of the total capital of KYC at the time of issue   The terms of the two questions to which the respondent was directed were expressed slightly differently in two places in the ruling  At the beginning of the ruling under the heading  WHAT THIS RULING IS ABOUT  the following appeared       Can KYC pursuant to Division   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    ITAA   transfer to KSL an amount of its tax loss for the year ended   June   being that part of the loss incurred by KYC during the period   December   to   June   so that KSL may deduct the amount of loss transferred in accordance with section     of the ITAA   in the year of income ended   June          Can KYC and KSL have an extension of time within which to effect a written agreement for transfer of the amount of the loss of one month from receipt of the ruling       The reference to  section     was an error  It should have been  section      At the end of the section of the ruling entitled  THE SUBJECT OF THE RULING  which contained the facts the following appeared     The Commissioner is now asked to rule         That KYC may transfer an amount of its tax loss incurred during part of the income year from   December   to   June   so as to avoid the date of the change of ownership  and            That KYC and KSL may make a written agreement for transfer of the amount of the tax loss within one month of receipt of the ruling referred to at     Two assumptions were made in the ruling as follows      The taxpayer will apply for a Commissioner s discretion for additional time to enter into a valid loss transfer agreement pursuant to section    d  of the ITAA    and     The Commissioner will grant that additional time to make the loss transfer  citedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumnia Ltd     ALR   Thus  I agree with the thrust of the applicants  submission in this regard that provisions such as Division   should not be narrowly construed and should be interpreted to promote the purpose or object underlying the Division which can be seen as the purpose and object of s  G of the ITAA    That does not mean  however  that provisions are given

   But that is to be seen as effected by the statutory language employed  and no further referred toHarts Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   In support of this use of s  G c  and   the respondent referred to a passage in the reasons of Drummond J in Harts Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   at   in which his Honour said     Section  G c  requires agreement that there is to be a transfer of this right to an allowable deduction under s    in respect of so much of the whole or part of  the loss the subject of the right to that deduction  What can be transferred under s  G is company A s right to deduct that dollar amount  to the extent of the whole of it or a part only of it  An agreement to transfer the loss company s right to a deduction under s   in respect of the whole of its loss deductible under that section must necessarily refer to a loss of a particular dollar amount that is then  ie  at the date of the agreement  identifiable  even if that dollar amount is not itself recorded in the agreement  An agreement to transfer the loss company s right to a deduction under s   in respect of part only of that loss must identify the part of the then identifiable dollar amount of the entire loss that is the subject of the agreement  prima facie  that could be done by recording in the agreement either the dollar amount of that part of the
