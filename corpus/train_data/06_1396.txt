Rajcinoski v Secretary  Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredApthorpe v Repatriation Commission     ALR  Putting aside the question of whether the advice given to the appellant was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous so as to be capable of giving rise to an estoppel  see Minister for Immigration and

Polat    and Formosa v Department of Social Security     FCR   at   per Davies and Gummow JJ     Kurtovic was not a case where a party asserted that the public authority was estopped from asserting that a particular action  of which the other party sought performance  would be ultra vires as exceeding the powers given by or pursuant to a law of the Parliament  However  Gummow J considered the applicability of the doctrine of estoppel in such a case  and stated  at       Any doctrine of estoppel in that context would threaten to undermine the doctrine of ultra vires by enabling public authorities to extend their powers both de facto and de jure by making representations beyond power  which they would then be estopped from denying      The inapplicability of the doctrine of estoppel to this case ensures the performance of a statutory duty  see Kurtovic at     per Gummow J  In my view  the authorities clearly provide that the doctrine of estoppel cannot be called on to aid the appellant in this case  Any suggested exceptions or qualifications to the general rejection of estoppel in public law  see Kurtovic at   per Gummow J  have no application to the present case  Further  this is not a case dealing with the exercise of a statutory discretion that is capable of being exercised in favour of the appellant and certainly not at an operational level  It is true that cl   of

Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe appellant contended that the findings of the Tribunal in these paragraphs were wrong  and that upon the basis of the alleged incorrect advice given by Centrelink  the appellant returned to Australia  I do not find any error  of law or otherwise  in those two paragraphs  Having regard to the sequence of events described  namely  the appellant s receipt of the letter and the subsequent telephone conversation and the nature of the telephone inquiry  it seems to me that the conclusions reached by the Tribunal were correct  It may well be that the appellant misunderstood the terms of the information  and upon the basis of the communication did act in returning to Australia before   July    Later on in its reasons  the Tribunal accepted that had the appellant realised that if he came back to Australia and was not absent on   July   there would be a limitation of his disability support pension  he would not have returned to Australia on   June    However  this does not mean the advice was incorrect  just that it may have been misunderstood  and upon that basis  it was acted upon  In any event  paragraphs   and   represent findings of fact of the Tribunal and are not reviewable by this Court  see s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   Even if the findings of fact were erroneous  it would not constitute an error of law  see Waterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan J  The appellant contends that the respondent is now estopped from not exercising the discretion found in cl   in his favour  If I am wrong and the advice given to the appellant was incorrect  the respondent is not estopped from refusing to determine that the appellant s maximum portability period for disability support pension is for an unlimited period  where the Act now limits the portability period for disability support pension to   weeks
