Application of the general principles to this proceedingconsideredBoston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn respect of applications for summary judgment under s  A of the Act  the onus to demonstrate that the proceedings do not have reasonable prospects of success rests with the party seeking summary judgment  In Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited   FCA         ALR   at   and   Rares J  quoting from Latham CJ in Hocking v Bell   HCA         CLR   at     likened the standard under s  A of the Act to the common law test for determining whether a jury properly instructed could reach a verdict for a plaintiff     T here must be a real issue of fact to be decided  And if the evidence is all one way  so that only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable  there is no function left for the jury to perform  so that the court may properly take the matter into its own hands as being a matter of law  and direct a verdict to be entered in accordance with the only evidence which is really presented in the case         In a case to which s  A applies  where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle  and possibly where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind  it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial  A Full Court of this Court considered the application of s  A in Jefferson Ford Pty Limited v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited   FCAFC         FCR    Finkelstein  Rares and Gordon JJ   Finkelstein J stated that s  A of the Act is to be given a  substantial operation  which requires the  judge to conduct what might loosely be described as a preliminary trial  and to look closely to a party s  assertion that there is a real question of law or fact to be decided   at    About factual issues Finkelstein J  at   stated that the task of prediction was fraught with all kinds of difficulties including the Court  in many cases  not having before it all the material evidence  and if credit is involved the impossibility of predicting how that issue would be resolved  Even if the dispute is only a question of law  that issue may be difficult to resolve  or to predict its resolution  in the absence of detailed argument such as only occurs at a trial  Then Finkelstein J stated  at   that the task of the judge is  to decide whether the opposing party has evidence of sufficient quality and weight to be able to succeed at trial  and on questions of law the task of the judge is to determine whether the question of law is  sufficiently strong to warrant a trial   at    Rares J favoured the test he stated in Boston Commercial and noted that that the correctness of that test did not need to be examined because  neither party challenged that test   at    Gordon J identified a number of principles which  inform  the application of s  A of the Act  Among these are    that s  A is less stringent than the General Steel Industries standard    that each case must be determined separately    where there is a real issue of fact it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success    in determining whether a real issue of fact exists the Court must draw all available reasonable inferences in favour of the non moving party  at      Gordon J at   stated that the assessment that a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success will necessarily require       Identification of the cause of action pleaded     identification of the pleaded facts said to give rise to that cause of action    a review of the evidence  if any  tendered in support of the claim for judgment       identification of the defence pleaded    identification of any facts pleaded which are said to give rise to the defence  and      a review of the evidence  if any  tendered in defence of the claim  In SMS s submission it has  discharged the onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s  A envisages  per Rares J in Boston Commercial at    Even accepting Mr Neil Windsor and Dr Windsor s version of the discussions on   and   January    paras     and   of Ex  B  the   page affidavit  and paras     and   of Ex  A  the   page affidavit  as completely accurate  there is no reasonable interpretation of the communications between Mr Neil Windsor and SMS which is consistent with any conclusion other than that any contract for the provision of locum services by Dr Windsor was entered into between InterNEOn and SMS  Dr Windsor pointed to the evidence at para   of the   page affidavit that is part of Ex  B in support of the case propounded in the amended statement of claim on the formation of the agreement  specifically    That Mr Neil Windsor  on Dr Windsor s behalf  met with Mr Muldoon of SMS on   January     that at the commencement of the meeting the following exchange took place   Mr Muldoon said  So you have come to negotiate with me  have you     Mr Windsor said  I guess I have         that Mr Windsor and Mr Muldoon on   January   negotiated Dr Windsor s terms of engagement with SMS and reached agreement on those terms    that at another point during the meeting the following exchange took place   Mr Windsor said   How often do you pay the locums     Mr Muldoon said   Monthly on the second Wednesday of each month  I prepare a tax invoice for the locums  I need an ABN Number  you know  to take care of this GST crap      Mr Windsor said   Does it have to be a personal ABN or can it be a company one     Mr Muldoon said   I don t care  It s up to the locums to take care of their tax anyway they want      Mr Windsor said   It might take a while to get an ABN  What are you going to do about payment     Mr Muldoon said   I will keep the money until you give me an ABN  I m not going to deduct   of the pay like the tax department want us to do  It was submitted on behalf of Dr Windsor that it is inappropriate in a summary judgment application to determine the question of law whether post contractual conduct or communications can be used to identify the parties to the contract for the provision of medical services entered into by SMS  Further  that there is evidence in support of the case pleaded in the amended statement of claim that the agreement was entered into by Dr Windsor  through the agency of her husband  Mr Neil Windsor  and Mr Muldoon of SMS on   January   and there is no evidence by SMS as to the negotiations on   January    It was submitted that the Court should find that SMS has not satisfied the onus of demonstrating that Dr Windsor has no reasonable prospects of prosecuting the proceedings within s  A  of the Act  In conclusion  it was submitted on behalf of Dr Windsor that  whether the Court applies the standard adopted by Rares J in Boston Commercial   the principles identified by Gordon J in Jefferson Ford or  the tasks of the judge in considering an application under s  A of the Act identified by Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford   the Court should find that SMS has not satisfied the onus

motion it was submitted on behalf of Dr Windsor that I impermissibly had regard to the evidence and that if I had confined myself to the terms of the pleading as I should have done in respect of a strike out motion in reliance on O   r   the   notice of motion would have been dismissed  I was referred to what was recently said by Finkelstein J in Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited   FCA         ALR   at       The fundamental thing to understand about the strike out rule  which the language of O   r   itself makes clear  is that the rule is concerned only with the adequacy of the pleading  or to be more precise  the allegations and the causes of action asserted therein  as a matter of law  The rule does not permit or allow consideration of facts or evidence outside the pleadings  Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners   HCA         CLR   at   and     ALR   at     see also General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   at     HCA       ALR   at     General Steel    Indeed  as counsel for ANZ  Mr Archibald QC  correctly noted in his submissions  the court must  for purposes of deciding the strike out motion and deciding whether a pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action  assume the truth of the allegations in the statement of claim and draw all inferences in favour of the non moving party because the question is whether those allegations  even if proved  cannot succeed as a matter of law  General Steel CLR at   ALR at    The submission is clearly correct  For the reasons more fully explored at   below  it is not possible to regard the   notice of motion as anything more than a strike out motion  It certainly did not seek dismissal of the proceeding as an abuse of process or summary judgment in reliance on s  A of the Act  As indicated at   below  if it had been necessary  I would have taken my error in this respect into account in the exercise of my discretion as to whether the justice of the matter required that the finding as to the contracting parties made on the   notice of motion be reconsidered  On   December   Dr Windsor filed an amended statement of claim pursuant to O   r   of the Rules  In the amended statement of claim  Dr Windsor has reformulated her claim for damages for breach of contract and has pleaded that she entered into an agreement with SMS to provide medical services on behalf of SMS on or about   January    para    Section  A of the Act and O   r   of the Rules have different legislative concerns  In Imobilari   Finkelstein J  at     observed that s  A of the Act is concerned with the ability to make a claim  and a court must look at the evidence to see whether a cause of action is disclosed  whereas O   r   of the Rules  on the other hand  is concerned with the adequacy of pleadings as a matter of law and not with facts or evidence outside the pleadings  The amended statement of claim in compliance with O   r  a  of the Rules pleads the following statement of material facts upon which Dr Windsor relies    That Dr Windsor and SMS entered into an agreement for the provision of medical services by Dr Windsor  para     that the agreement comprised certain express and implied terms  paras   and     that the terms of the agreement were varied  para     that the agreement  as varied  was breached by SMS  para   and    that the breaches caused Dr Windsor to terminate the agreement  para   and    that Dr Windsor has suffered loss  para    The amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action for breach of contract by Dr Windsor against SMS  There are no grounds upon which the pleaded amended statement of claim constitutes an abuse of process  In these circumstances  it was submitted that the Court should find that SMS has not satisfied the onus of demonstrating that the amended statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action or is otherwise an abuse of process within O   r   of the Rules and  accordingly  refuse to strike out the amended statement of claim consideredJefferson Ford Pty Limited v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases

there were four reasons why it was fair and just to reconsider the matter rather than be persuaded that SMS had established the amended statement of claim was an abuse of process  These were put as follows    Dr Windsor was self represented on the hearing of the   notice of motion     I applied impermissible criteria in deciding the   notice of motion clearly a strike out application rather than confining myself to the pleadings  had I done the latter  I would have dismissed the   notice of motion  I have already accepted this submission at   and   above     On the hearing of the   notice of motion  the Court s attention was not drawn to the undecided question of law about whether post contractual conduct and communications could be used to identify parties to the contract  see Dennis

fall within that category     The fact that on the hearing of the   notice of motion my attention was not drawn to admissions that were relied upon on the hearing of the current motion and  even if I did have regard to them on the earlier occasion  there is no indication on the face of the reasons for judgment that I interacted with them consideredSea Culture International Pty Limited v Scoles   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe power to stay or dismiss a proceeding under O   r   of the Rules for an abuse of process is not limited to those cases in which proceedings are commenced or maintained where there is a res judicata or issue estoppel in respect of them  French J  as he then was  put it this way in Sea Culture International Pty Limited v Scoles   FCA         FCR   at     An attempt to litigate in court a dispute or issue which has been resolved in earlier litigation in this or another court or tribunal may also  according to the circumstances  constitute an abuse of process even if not attracting the doctrines of res judicata or issue estoppel  Nevertheless  the power to stay or dismiss must be  very sparingly exercised and only in exceptional cases   see Sea Culture International Pty Limited v Scoles at   and  upon an examination of the relevant circumstances of the particular case before the Court   see Spalla v St George

submitted on behalf of SMS that the amended statement of claim was a transparent attempt to re litigate issues which have already been determined against Dr Windsor      proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if  notwithstanding that the circumstances of the case do not give rise to an estoppel  their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings    Walton v Gardiner     CLR   per Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ at    Reference was also
