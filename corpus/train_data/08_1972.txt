Australian   International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited  ACN         FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedElectrolux Home Products Pty Limited v The Australian Workers  Union   HCA       CLR   On   September   the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in Electrolux Home Products Pty Limited v The Australian Workers  Union   HCA       CLR    The High Court held that certain provisions in an agreement negotiated between a corporation and a union did not pertain to the relationship between the corporation as employer and all persons employed in a single business or part of a single business of the employer  within the meaning of s  LI of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the WR Act   as the WR Act then stood   As a result  it was held that the agreement could not have been certified validly pursuant to what was then s  LT of the WR Act   The two sets of claims in this proceeding both have some relationship with the judgment in Electrolux    The first claim is for breach of contract  The applicant  Australian and International Pilots Association  AIPA  claims that it entered into a binding contract with the respondent  Qantas Airways Limited  Qantas  in the course of negotiating a new certified agreement  Certain provisions  which had been part of the certified agreement between AIPA and Qantas at the time of the judgment in Electrolux   had not been included in the new certified agreement because it was thought that their presence might jeopardise the certification of that agreement  It was contended that those provisions had been placed in a separate agreement  There is a substantial issue as to whether any concluded agreement about those provisions ever came into existence  AIPA contended that  although there was no express agreement as to the duration  in terms of starting and finishing  of the obligations under the contract  the gap was filled by an implied term  If there was a concluded agreement  there is an issue as to whether it is enforceable  or is an agreement not intended to create legal relations  but binding in honour only  If there was a binding contract  there is no real dispute that Qantas was in breach of it  There are issues  however  as to what  if any  remedies should be granted  Such issues include whether AIPA suffered any loss it can claim as damages for breach of contract  what was the quantum of its loss if it did suffer such loss  and whether some form of order by way of specific performance can  or should  be made   The second claim is that  in the last days of the operation of the certified agreement that was in force at the time of Electrolux   Qantas failed to comply with its obligations under that agreement  Claims are made for penalties for contraventions of various terms of that certified agreement and for consequential orders in relation to those penalties  The terms concerned are among the provisions that were identified as possibly falling outside s  LI of the WR Act   Not surprisingly  Qantas relies on the unenforceability of those terms of the certified agreement as a result of Electrolux   Qantas also contests the proposition that it failed to comply with its obligations as expressed in those terms   It should be noted that the legislative provisions to which I refer in these reasons for judgment are those that were found in the WR Act as it stood at the times of events relevant to this proceeding  Subsequent major amendments to the WR Act have changed the numbering and wording of numerous provisions   Division   of Pt VIB of the WR Act contained the following relevant provisions   LH What this Division covers This Division sets out requirements that must be satisfied for applications to be made to the Commission to certify certain agreements between employers who are constitutional corporations or the Commonwealth and   a  organisations of employees  or  b  employees   LI Nature of agreement   For an application to be made to the Commission under this Division  there must be an agreement  in writing  about matters pertaining to the relationship between   a  an employer who is a constitutional corporation or the Commonwealth  and  b  all persons who  at any time when the agreement is in operation  are employed in a single business  or a part of a single business  of the employer and whose employment is subject to the agreement    The agreement must be made in accordance with section  LJ   LK or  LL   LJ Agreement with organisations of employees   The employer may make the agreement with one or more organisations of employees where  when the agreement is made  each organisation   a  has at least one member employed in the single business or part whose employment will be subject to the agreement  and  b  is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the member in relation to work that will be subject to the agreement    The agreement must be approved by a valid majority of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement    The employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that   a  at least   days before any approval is given  all the persons either have  or have ready access to  the agreement  in writing  and  b  before any approval is given  the terms of the agreement are explained to all the persons       LM Making the application for certification   The application for the Commission to certify the agreement must state that it is made under this Division    The application must be made no later than   days after   a  if it is made in accordance with section  LJ  the day on which it is approved as mentioned in subsection  LJ  In September   when the Electrolux judgment was delivered  AIPA and Qantas were parties to the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew  Long Haul  Certified Agreement      This was the sixth collective agreement between AIPA and Qantas since provisions relating to enterprise bargaining had been introduced into the Industrial Relations Act    Cth  which was renamed as the WR Act in    Because the agreement was the sixth in a series  it was known colloquially as  EBA  and it is convenient to refer to it by this title in these reasons for judgment  EBA  was certified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on   July    Its nominal expiry date  inserted pursuant to the requirement found in s  LT  of the WR Act   was   June   but it remained in force in September   pursuant to s  LX  because it had not yet been replaced by another certified agreement  Indeed  negotiations for the agreement that replaced EBA  the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew  Long Haul  Certified Agreement      EBA  had not yet begun   Part   of EBA  was headed  Association Business   It contained the following provisions     RELIEF FROM FLYING FOR ASSOCIATION BUSINESS The following arrangements apply to enable Association members to be reliably available to attend to Association duties and responsibilities      Association President The Association President  the President  is entitled to relief from flying under clause       and a pre allocation of flying under clauses       and            President s designates Associated with the office of the President  the President s designates are entitled to relief from flying equivalent to the credited hours allocated to the President for flying or leave  and a pre allocation of flying under clause            How relief from flying is achieved using Hours Banks       At the request of the President  or designate  and subject to demonstrable operational requirements  the Company will do one or more of the following   a  release members from Company duties             b  block days on a member s bid line  or  c  pre allocate patterns of flying onto a member s bid line       to enable Association members to attend to Association duties and responsibilities                A request may be refused by the Company where it would incur unreasonable cost  but any refusal will first be discussed with the President with a view to resolving the matter to both parties  satisfaction        The President  or designate  will endeavour to give Aircrew Operations as much notice as possible of any requirement for displacement under this Agreement          Hours Banks                 Time Bank        a  The Company will provide up to   credited hours on day one of each bid period to a  Time Bank    b  In any bid period  if fewer than   hours are utilised by Association members  the balance will be carried forward   c  A maximum of   hours may accumulate in the  Time Bank         Leave Bank  a  Pursuant to clause     a leave bank is established and maintained   b  The value of a  Leave Bank  day will be the value of the applicable bid period divisor divided by          Additional flying hours re credited to hours banks If an Association member flies additional credited hours during the bid period in which he or she has been released from Company duties for the purpose of carrying out Association duties or obligations  those additional credited hours will first be  re credited  to the respective bank  less any hours calculated at the rate of the applicable bid period divisor divided by   for each day spent on Association business  before any payment for additional credited hours is made to the member      Using the hours banks for Association business       An Association member who is required by the President  or designate  to attend to Association business   a  may access the provisions of the Time Bank   b  may access the provisions of the Leave Bank  or  c  may be removed from a pattern or patterns  in which case the member   i  will be pattern protected for the credited hours value of the pattern or patterns  less the credited hours value of any Time Bank of Leave Bank days spent on Association business   ii  will be available for offsets in accordance with clause      i   iii  May be awarded or assigned an offset against the pattern protected hours in accordance with clause      g  with any remaining pattern protected hours becoming fixed  and  iv  If not awarded or assigned an offset against the pattern protection  will have the pattern protected hours offset by an equivalent deduction from the Time Bank or Leave Bank        When a member is required to attend to Association business during a period of annual or long service leave  credited hours may be debited from the Time Bank or Leave Bank so that the infringed day s  of leave are re credited to the member        At the request of the President  days may be blocked on a member s bid line with a  nil credited hours value         Where a member is a BLH or RLH in a bid period and he or she is required to carry out Association duties  the member will receive credited hours calculated at the rate of the applicable bid period divisor  divided by   for each day that those duties are required to be undertaken and those credited hours will be deducted from the Time Bank or Leave Bank      Joint Company AIPA Business     When a member is required by the President to attend a meeting with the Company  or attend to joint Association Company business  he or she            will be pattern protected for any credited hours involved  less any hours calculated by dividing the pattern value by the number of calendar days of the pattern  for each day spent attending to such business        may be required to offset any or all of such pattern protection during the remainder of the bid period and  in good faith  will attempt to offset such hours but will not be required to be available for offsets assignments during the normal hours of availability for pattern protected crew members        may  with the approval of the President  or designate  have the hours debited from the Time Bank or Leave Bank and not be pattern protected under clause           ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT     General The provisions of this clause apply to a pilot during his or her tenure of office as President of the Association  the President   To the extent of any inconsistency between the provisions of this clause and any other provisions in this Employment Contract  the provisions in this clause will prevail      Pay The President will be paid a salary  calculated in accordance with clause     appropriate to the aircraft type on which he or she is flying      Method of payment The President will be paid in pay periods       and   of each bid period an amount calculated on the basis of one  th of the prescribed pay and the appropriate allowance provided in clause          Scheduling        The President is entitled to relief from flying equal to the bid period divisor for his or her category         Notwithstanding clause       the President is entitled to a pre allocation of not less than   credited hours of known flying for each bid period  after consultation with the Company to select flying before it is made available before bidding  under clause               Any flying allocated to the President for which he or she is not available will be re allocated at the Company s discretion either in accordance with the provisions of clause    in which case the quota provisions of clause       will not apply  or in accordance with the provisions of clause             Open time will be allocated in accordance with the provisions of clause      Allocating open time flying  except that the Company may displace the President from any allocated pattern         The President may trade patterns with a pattern line holder or with a supervisory crew member in accordance with clause       or with open time in accordance with the provisions of clauses     and             The Company may require the President to fly or exceed his or her allocation of credited hours         The President may consult with the Company about the scheduling of designated duty free days  For the purpose of clause      Duty free time at a crew member s base  the President will be deemed a pattern line holder      Annual leave The President s annual leave will be planned and taken as mutually arranged except that the Company may assign leave when his or her annual leave is in excess of the standard prescribed in clause          Changeover of President        When the Association elects a new President  the provisions of this clause    with the exception of scheduling  will apply to the new President on and from the date of his appointment as President and will cease to apply to the outgoing President on and from that date         Any scheduling issues arising from the change over of Presidents will be discussed among the Company  the outgoing President and the new President with a view to making arrangements that are acceptable to all three parties   Some other provisions of EBA  were relevant to the operation of the provisions in Pt    There are numerous references to cl   a very long and complex clause relating to scheduling and hours of work  the details of which it is unnecessary to set out for present purposes  Clause     to which there is a reference in cl      a  provides  Notwithstanding clause     for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a leave bank  the quantum of annual leave prescribed in that clause may be reduced by one   day in each   year period and will be transferred to a leave bank in accordance with rules and procedures agreed in writing between the Company and the Association   In September   the implications of the Electrolux judgment were obvious  In the first place  existing certified agreements might turn out to be wholly invalid because they contained provisions about matters that did not pertain to the relationship between employers and their relevant employees  non pertaining provisions  and the Commission had therefore lacked power to certify them  The second implication was that  if future agreements were to be negotiated  care would have to be taken to avoid including non pertaining provisions  which would lead to the Commission refusing to certify the agreement altogether   At least the second of these implications was not lost on AIPA  It was preparing to enter into negotiations with Qantas for EBA   On   September   the day on which the first meeting of those negotiations was due to be held  Alana Starke  General Counsel of AIPA  wrote a letter to Sue Bussell  Group General Manager Industrial Relations of Qantas  with a copy to Captain Chris Manning  Head of Flight Operations and Chief Pilot  in the following terms  I refer to our telephone discussion on   September    Please confirm that any provisions in Certified Agreements  Safety Net Awards or other industrial agreements between the Company and AIPA which may be affected by the recent High Court s decision in Electrolux impacting upon any decisions by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission  will be transferred  without negotiation  into side agreements between us   It should be noted that  although written at the outset of negotiations in respect of EBA  this letter did not refer only to those negotiations  It was expressed to cover three classes of documents  certified agreements  safety net awards  or other industrial agreements  At the time  in addition to EBA  which related to long haul flying  AIPA and Qantas were parties to a certified agreement that related to short haul flying  which was due to reach its nominal expiry date in September    The evidence suggests that there may have been other documents caught by the description in the letter of   September    One was an award dealing with the integration of two separate awards relating to domestic and international flying respectively  which had been made to accompany the merger of Australian Airlines and Qantas in the mid  s  Another suggestion was an agreement relating to the seniority of pilots as between Qantas and its subsidiary that operated an airline called Jetstar   Negotiations for EBA  opened with a meeting on   September    The negotiators on behalf of AIPA were Alana Starke  Captain Bryan Welch  Andrew Marshall and Ely Nejadiran  whose surname changed during the course of negotiations to Jensen   Ms Starke was employed by AIPA with the title General Counsel  Under her contract of employment  her responsibilities were such that she was effectively AIPA s Chief Executive  Captain Welch was an elected Vice President of AIPA  who was given principal responsibility for the negotiations for EBA   Qantas was represented by Julian Hailes  Manager  Industrial Relations  Vanessa Webber  Peter Broschofsky  Captain Peter Wilson  Darren Ziegenfusz and Mark Wagner  or Wagener   Initially  Captain Manning as Qantas s Chief Pilot  and Captain Robin Holt as President of AIPA  each addressed the meeting  These addresses were regarded as opening the negotiations formally  and setting their tone  What then happened in the meeting is the subject of varying accounts given in evidence by Captain Welch  Ms Starke and Mr Hailes  and found in notes taken at the time by Ms Nejadiran Jensen  Mr Hailes and Ms Webber  It is clear that there was some discussion about Electrolux   Ms Starke appears to have raised the issue  although Captain Welch s recollection is that he raised it first  Ms Starke also appears to have referred to her telephone conversation with  and letter to  Ms Bussell  although Ms Starke did not recall having made any such reference  The meeting was certainly aware of a proposal to remove any non pertaining provisions before the terms of EBA  were finalised  and to put those provisions into a separate document  The Qantas management team did not reject this idea  In his evidence  Mr Hailes said that he had not considered the issue previously  It also appears that  at the meeting on   September   Qantas tabled its log of claims  a document setting out the changes it sought to make to the terms of EBA  so that EBA  as modified  could become EBA    A further meeting occurred on the following day    September   at which the same persons  other than Captain Manning and Captain Holt  attended  At this meeting  the AIPA log of claims was tabled  setting out the changes AIPA sought to have reflected in the new agreement  This document consisted of a cover sheet  three pages containing proposed clauses and a page headed  ANCILLARY MATTERS TO BE RESOLVED   There were seven items listed  Number seven was in the following terms  Administrative matter  Confirmation that provisions in industrial agreements between QAL and AIPA which may be affected by Electrolux decision of the High Court  impacting upon AIRC decisions  will be transferred  without negotiation  into side documents between the parties   Towards the end of the meeting  there was a brief discussion about this item  Again  the accounts of Captain Welch  Ms Starke and Mr Hailes differ about what was said  as do the records found in the notes of Ms Nejadiran Jensen  Mr Hailes and Ms Webber  Speaking broadly  the evidence led on behalf of AIPA is to the effect that agreement was secured to the transfer of non pertaining provisions to side agreements  Ms Nejadiran s note and Captain Welch s recollection  perhaps prompted by the note  is of Mr Hailes saying  That should be okay   Mr Hailes and Ms Webber do not support such a firm agreement  I infer that  at that time  there was at least a recognition by both parties that it was in their interests to facilitate the removal of provisions that might jeopardise the certification of EBA  and that transferring such provisions to some other form  not involving submission for certification  would be an option  In addition  Captain Welch was keen to make the point that any provisions transferred should not be altered  He did not want either party taking advantage of the post  Electrolux environment by seeking to renegotiate what had been agreed for EBA  but could not be transferred to EBA   Captain Welch expressed this view  Mr Hailes understood that AIPA did not want changes made to any transferred provisions  He wrote in his notes  AIPA wouldn t see change    At a minimum  after the meetings of   and   September   Qantas understood that AIPA wished to have removed from EBA  any provisions that might put at risk the certification of EBA  by being found to be non pertaining provisions  Qantas also understood that AIPA wished to have these provisions expressed  without change  in some other instrument  Qantas did not reject this proposition  Indeed  it is clear that Qantas was quite prepared to entertain such an idea   On   December   the Workplace Relations Amendment  Agreement Validation  Act    Cth  commenced to operate  Its effect was to validate all provisions of existing certified agreements that were not non pertaining provisions  Its operation was retrospective  Accordingly  from the point of view of AIPA and Qantas  EBA  continued in operation except to the extent of any non pertaining provisions that it contained  The first of the considerations referred to in   above was therefore no longer a consideration  Any invalidity would only extend to non pertaining provisions in EBA    Negotiation of the terms of EBA  continued over some   months following the meeting of   September    Little or no mention was made during that time of the Electrolux issue  Mr Hailes did give evidence that  at some time during that period  he received a phone call from Ms Starke  apparently unprompted by any specific incident  in which Ms Starke raised the question of the kind of document into which possibly non pertaining provisions would be transferred  She mentioned the possibility of a deed  and Mr Hailes rejected that  Ms Starke was not asked about any such conversation  It is not clear whether it took place during the period of negotiation of the terms of EBA    On   August   a document entitled   EBA  Terms of Settlement   was signed by Mr Hailes on behalf of Qantas and Captain Holt on behalf of AIPA  The document reflects the fact that EBA  was regarded as the basis for negotiations  and records terms that the parties had agreed on by way of changes to what was in EBA   Clause   contained provisions relating to superannuation  in which AIPA acknowledged that certain specified provisions would not form part of  or be included in  the new certified agreement  but that a designated letter of agreement would be voted on as part of the new agreement  Clause   was headed   Other Matters   and was in the following terms  Administrative Issue  Non pertaining matters The parties agree to review provisions in existing industrial agreements between Qantas and AIPA to identify whether  pursuant to the Electrolux decision of the High Court of Australia  there are any non pertaining provisions in those agreements  It is agreed that any provisions identified under this review as being non pertaining will be transferred into side agreements between the parties   On   September   the election of a new Committee of Management of AIPA was finalised  Captain Ian Woods was elected to succeed Captain Holt as President  The change of regime involved a change of attitude to some issues affecting members of AIPA  Captain Woods had been a member of the AIPA Committee of Management  On   July   when the Committee of Management had resolved to accept the EBA  Terms of Settlement  subsequently signed on   August   and to recommend acceptance by the members of AIPA  Captain Woods had spoken and voted against this proposal  He and the new officers also had views that there should be changes to the way in which AIPA was administered  which would involve more of the administration work being done by elected officers  rather than by employed personnel   The parties were agreeing to transfer the non pertaining provisions into a document separate from EBA  on the assumption that  in the light of Electrolux   they were provisions that would not be acceptable to the Commission and would therefore prevent the certification of EBA   It is true that there was no absolute recognition that the non pertaining provisions fell outside the description in s  LI  namely matters pertaining to the relationship between an employer and the relevant employees  As appears from my examination of the implications of Electrolux in     below  certainty about whether a particular provision did or did not fall within s  LI  would have been extremely difficult to achieve  Nevertheless  it is clear that the parties  and particularly AIPA  contemplated that cll   and   and the related provisions  as they appeared in EBA  might very well be unenforceable as a matter of law  If this had not been the case  there would have been no suggestion from either party that those provisions should be removed from EBA   On this basis  it is legitimate to ask  as the mythical officious bystander might have asked  whether it was obvious that the starting points of the obligations would be the commencement of the operation of EBA   If it be accepted that the parties were transferring the non pertaining provisions into a separate document in order to ensure their continued operation as enforceable provisions  there would be every reason why such an agreement should operate as soon as it was reached  and not await the certification of EBA   The circumstance that Qantas had continued to apply the Association Business Provisions in EBA  does not diminish the force of this proposition  Objectively  it appears more likely that the parties would want any agreement to have been binding forthwith  rather than from a later date   As to whether the parties intended to create a legally binding agreement  or an agreement binding in honour only  there are factors pointing in both directions  The refusal of Qantas to enter into a deed  accepted by AIPA  and the choice of  memorandum of understanding  as the title of the document  again accepted by AIPA  suggests that there was no intention to create legal relations  The title is not conclusive  however  The course of negotiations  particularly the detailed attention given by both parties to the precise wording of the document  tends to suggest that they were looking towards the letter  rather than merely the spirit  of an agreement  and therefore towards enforceability  Again  this is not conclusive  Nor is the history of the provisions that were being transferred from EBA  into the memorandum of understanding  When they were first negotiated as part of EBA  and carried into EBA  the non pertaining provisions were assumed to be enforceable  Following Electrolux   the parties were of one mind that the non pertaining provisions were  at least potentially  unenforceable at law  This potential unenforceability and its possible effect in jeopardising the certification of EBA  constituted the motivation for placing the non pertaining provisions in another document  In these circumstances  it is difficult to say that the history of the provisions gives a clue either way as to whether the parties were agreed that the provisions should be legally enforceable or binding in honour  What seems to me to be the decisive factor in favour of legal enforceability is the agreement about the clause relating to the sharing of legal liability  Once it was realised that Qantas s compliance with the non pertaining provisions  in a document outside EBA  could place Qantas in a difficult position in the event of conflict between its obligations under EBA  and its obligations under any separate agreement  the parties had a choice  They could have chosen expressly to make the memorandum of understanding binding in honour only  and liable to give way in the event that any actual conflict appeared  Alternatively  they could have done what they did  which was to assume that such conflict would occur and to make provision for the sharing of any liability flowing from it  This agreement suggests to the objective observer that both parties regarded the obligations under the transferred non pertaining provisions as legally binding  so that provision needed to be made for the actuality of conflict between those provisions and the provisions of EBA   For this reason  if it had been necessary to do so  I should have had little difficulty in finding that the agreement between AIPA and Qantas  to be expressed in the memorandum of understanding  was legally binding   The question of damage flowing from Qantas s non observants of the agreement is more difficult  It is necessary to detail some further facts  The claim consists of two elements  One is the salary of Peter Somerville  who was engaged as the General Manager of AIPA from   April    The second is a payment made by AIPA to Captain Woods  designed to compensate him for the failure of Qantas to pay his salary at the rate designated for the President by cl     of EBA    At the same time as Captain Woods became President of AIPA  on   November   Captain McNeil became Secretary  Captain John Dowe Assistant Secretary and Captain Andrew Percival Treasurer  The new regime was determined to reform the manner in which AIPA was administered  At that time  Ms Starke was employed as Legal Counsel and Industrial Relations Manager  Attached to her written contract of employment  dated   May   was a schedule of duties  setting out the following duties and responsibilities        Advise the President and COM generally on industrial issues     Negotiate industrial and employment matters affecting technical aircrew   employed by Qantas Airways Limited and provide relevant documentation     Assess  prioritise and coordinate all industrial relations matters as they arise   and develop     Advise the President  Executive and COM on corporate governance and   organisational compliance issues  including reporting and accountability   issues  professional indemnity insurance     Coordinate and prepare documents and returns required under the relevant   legislation for the Association and AIFEA     Generally advise the Association s members on industrial employment law   issues     Represent technical aircrew in grievances   disciplinary matters     Represent the Association and provide advocacy in relevant jurisdictions    including the AIRC  IRC  NSW  and the Federal Court of Australia      Supervise and appraise industrial relations staff     Supervise and appraise administrative support staff     Manage all human resource issues     Assess need for outsourcing matters for professional opinions assistance     Assess and monitor ongoing educational and professional needs of industrial   relations staff and administrative support staff  including attendances at seminars workshops professional functions     Monitor office expenditure     Assess and monitor subscriptions to professional publications  The provisions that were agreed in Electrolux obliged the employer to deduct from wages to be paid to persons who might become employed by the employer in the future  and to pay to the Union  a fee  described as a  bargaining agent s fee   The provisions thus had three significant characteristics  First  they obliged the employer to deduct money from wages that would otherwise be paid to an employee  and to pay the money deducted to a party other than the employee  Second  the intended recipient of the money was the union that was party to the agreement with the employer  Third  the provisions bound the employer in relation to persons whom it might choose to employ in the future  and who chose not to belong to a relevant union   In Electrolux   the High Court affirmed the line of authority consisting of R v Portus  Ex parte ANZ Banking Group Ltd   HCA         CLR   and Re Alcan Australia Ltd  Ex parte Federation of Industrial  Manufacturing and Engineering Employees   HCA         CLR    Each of those cases involved claims made by unions which  if acceded to by employers  would have obliged the employers to deduct from wages earned by their employees amounts by way of union dues  and to pay those amounts to the relevant union  In each case  it was held that such claims did not pertain to the relationship between employers and employees in their capacity as such  In Alcan   the High Court was invited to overturn Portus   but declined to do so  The claims in question in Portus and Alcan had both the first and second characteristics of the provisions in question in Electrolux    In Electrolux at     Gleeson CJ appears to have identified the first of those characteristics as the reason for holding that the provisions in question in that case did not pertain to the relationship between an employer and its employees  The approach of McHugh J at   was to analyse the employer s obligation more closely  and to identify a number of factors that his Honour saw as taking the payments outside the relationship of employer and employees  His Honour said that the debt due by a future new employee to the union  about which the employer was obliged to inform the new employee  was not shown to be a debt relating to the employment relationship  In his Honour s view  the provision related to the relationship between the union and non members to be employed at the employer s workplace  His Honour took the view that strengthening the position of unions at the workplace   without more  did not make the provision a matter pertaining to the requisite relationship  Finally  his Honour said that  because the fee was not deducted pursuant to any agreement or authorisation from the employee  there was no nexus between the obligation imposed on the employer and the requisite relationship  At   Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ approved the statement of Merkel J at first instance  which identified a number of features of the provisions in question in Electrolux   The employer was to act as the union s agent in entering into a contract with new employees requiring the employees to employ the union as bargaining agent  The relationship between employer and employee was one of agency  requiring the employer to contract with its employees on behalf of the relevant union  as its agent  The agency was for the benefit of the union  rather than for the benefit of the employee upon whom the liability was to be imposed involuntarily  The provision could be characterised as a claim for payment for the union s services in securing the new employee s terms and conditions of employment  although the new employee would only have commenced employment after the date of the agreement  Kirby J dissented  At   Callinan J also preferred the approach of Merkel J to that of the Full Court  At   his Honour referred specifically to the first characteristic  with the added element of the involuntariness of the payment to the union on the part of an employee who was not a union member  His Honour described the relevant relationship between the employer and the non unionist employee as an involuntary contract for the payment of an exaction sought to be made by a third party on the employee   Clauses   and   and the related provisions of EBA  are of a very different character from the provisions that were the subject of Electrolux   They involve none of the three significant characteristics of the provisions the subject of Electrolux   There is no obligation on Qantas to deduct money from wages or salary that would otherwise be paid to any of its employees  or to pay any amount so deducted to any party other than Qantas  AIPA is not the

provisions bear no resemblance to those that were the subject of Portus or Alcan   Any debts created by cll   and   and the related provisions of EBA  are debts due from Qantas to its own existing employees  and relate to the relationship between Qantas and its own employees  The provisions do more than simply strengthen the position of AIPA  although they are certainly intended to accomplish that  They accomplish it by regulating the hours of work of Qantas s employees and the amounts of money to be paid to those employees  No question of deduction of any money from anything that would otherwise be paid to an employee arises  No agency relationship between AIPA and Qantas could possibly be created  There is no question of payment by any non member to AIPA   Clauses   and   and the

paid while they attended various kinds of union meetings  including board of management meetings  discussions between management and the union  and training and education courses organised by the

 August   or at the latest by the time of the Explanatory Note  dated   September   there existed a binding agreement between AIPA and Qantas concerning non pertaining provisions  The agreement was said to fall within the first class referred to in Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at   or into the  fourth class  said to be identified by McLelland J in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at     In Masters v Cameron at   the High Court said  Where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract  the case may belong to any of three classes  It may be one in which the parties have reached finality in arranging all the terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance of those terms  but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect  Or  secondly  it may be a case in which the parties have completely agreed upon all the terms of their bargain and intend no departure from or addition to that which their agreed terms express or imply  but nevertheless have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document  Or  thirdly  the case may be one in which the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all  unless and until they execute a formal contract   At     the High Court went on to point out that  in each of the first two cases  there is a binding contract  but not in the third   There must be some doubt as to whether a case described in these terms falls within a fourth class  additional to those described in Masters v Cameron   Assuming the existence of a binding agreement  it is always open to the parties to that agreement to vary it by adding additional terms  Viewed in that light  the so called fourth class appears not to differ from the first or second classes referred to in Masters v Cameron   Although the New South Wales Court of Appeal upheld McLelland J s judgment  there is no reference in the judgment of McHugh JA  with whom Kirby P and Glass JA agreed  to Masters v Cameron   or to a  fourth class   In G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at     McHugh JA said  If the parties agreed on additional terms  they would be added to the formal contract  If they did not  the formal contract would give effect only to the agreed terms and conditions of the correspondence  The case  therefore  is one where the parties were bound by the informal agreement but expected to make a further contract which by consent might contain additional terms  Sinclair  Scott   Co Ltd v Naughton   In the present case  there is no indication that either AIPA or Qantas gave expression to the possibility that there would be any need for them to agree to extra terms  The question in the present case is whether the case falls within the first or third category in Masters v Cameron   The attempt to rely on a fourth class seems to have been prompted by the fact that  following the signing of the Explanatory Memorandum  AIPA and Qantas did negotiate upon and apparently agree to an additional term  relating to the sharing between them of any liability that might arise from the transfer of terms that were formally in EBA  into a document other than EBA    The contention that the terms of settlement amounted to a final agreement between the parties is difficult to sustain  It was not until after the terms of settlement had been signed and the parties had engaged in the task of converting them into detailed documents that attention was given by either party to identifying the non pertaining provisions that ought to be removed  to ensure the certification of EBA   There had been a concern on the part of some people within AIPA that cll   and   of EBA  and the other provisions relating to those clauses would probably fall into that category  but there is no evidence that any negotiation took place about the content of any alternative document until after the terms of settlement had been signed   By   September   when the Explanatory Memorandum was signed  the provisions that would be transferred into another document had been identified  and were listed in the Explanatory Memorandum itself  Indeed  cl     of that document uses the past perfect tense  so as to convey to the reader that the memorandum of understanding is already in existence  Little  if any  weight can be attached to this fact in determining whether there was a final agreement  Clause     is inconsistent with cl     of the Explanatory Memorandum  which records merely that the parties  have agreed to transfer  the non pertaining provisions into  a  memorandum of understanding  The statement in cl     that  in relation to the additional provisions there listed  this had already been done  was incorrect as a matter of fact discussedBaulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd     NSWLR   AIPA s case was that  by the time of the

class  identified by McLelland J in the Baulkham Hills case at   is there described using the words of Knox CJ  Rich and Dixon JJ in Sinclair  Scott   Co Ltd v Naughton   HCA         CLR   at   one in

html  It is common ground between AIPA and Qantas that  as at the date of the Explanatory Memorandum  there had been no express agreement as to the starting date for the relevant side agreement  or as to its finishing date  It is also common ground that some provision fixing the duration of any agreement about those matters was an essential term  without which there could not be a binding agreement  The case for AIPA is that the absence of this essential term is cured by the implication of a term to the effect that the side agreement would be of the same duration as EBA  ie that it would start to operate when EBA  was certified and would continue in operation until EBA  was replaced by a further certified agreement  or otherwise ceased to be binding  This term was said to satisfy the requirements for a term to be implied into a contract  laid down in B P  Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings   HCA         CLR   at     it must be reasonable and equitable    it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract  so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it    it must be so obvious that  it goes without saying    it must be capable of clear expression    it must not contradict any express term of the contract   Before considering whether the suggested implied term meets these criteria  it is necessary to deal with one argument  That argument is based on the proposition found in the judgment of Kaye J  with whom Marks and Teague JJ agreed  in Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Frost Holdings Pty Ltd   VR   at   that  the law does not permit a court to imply a term into a bargain between parties for the purposes of making their bargain an enforceable contract   If this proposition is to be taken at face value  it is hard to see how most of the cases in which it has been held that there are implied terms in contracts could have been so decided  There have been numerous cases in which courts have held that implied terms that the performance of agreed obligations take place within a reasonable time  or that a party may bring about the termination of agreed obligations by giving reasonable notice  are available to ensure the binding nature of those agreed obligations  In the words of the Privy Council in the B P  case  such implied terms are  necessary to give business efficacy  to the contracts of which they are found to be part  The danger of taking the proposition expressed by Kaye J at face value is obvious  Such a proposition could lead to arguments akin to those about whether the chicken came before the egg  or the egg before the chicken  Was there already an agreement  so that it can be supplemented by an implied term to give it efficacy  or was there no binding agreement because there was no express agreement about the subject matter of the implied term  In my view  Kaye J intended to mean no more than that the parties must have agreed to be bound by the obligations they have expressed in their negotiations  before the question whether a term can be implied to give that agreement efficacy can be addressed  It is on that basis that I approach the present case   Before examining the relevant communications between the parties subsequent to   September   it is worthwhile to apply the criteria in the B P  case to the implied term advanced by AIPA on the pleadings  In this respect  it is clear that the alleged implied term cannot survive being tested against the third criterion  that the term must be so obvious that  it goes without saying    Similarly  the question of a date of termination of the obligations did not necessarily have a relationship with the duration of EBA   In this respect  the parties could have chosen a termination date  or mechanism  from a range of possibilities  For instance  it might have been agreed that the side agreement should continue to operate until such time as one or other party terminated it by giving some agreed period of notice  A specific termination date might have been chosen  with or without the possibility of termination by notice  The existence of such a range of reasonable possibilities is fatal to the satisfaction of the third criterion in the B P  case  It must be remembered that the criteria in the B P  case must be satisfied by a particular term  It is not open to the Court to choose from a range of possible implied terms  for the purpose of making an agreement into a final one  The particular term advanced must be so obvious that it is unnecessary to express it  because both parties will recognise that it is present in their agreement  The implied term pleaded in the present case clearly does not satisfy that requirement   The negotiations between the parties subsequent to   September   confirm that  as at that date  the implied term pleaded was not at all obvious  In her first draft of the memorandum of understanding  Ms Starke chose a different term altogether  Her proposal was that the agreement would come into effect on certification of EBA  and continue to operate forever  unless varied  replaced  rescinded or terminated by agreement between the parties  Qantas responded with a proposal that the side agreement expire on the nominal expiry date of EBA   Only then did Ms Starke  on behalf of AIPA  propose something like what is now said to be the obvious term  in an attempt to ensure that the side agreement should continue in force if EBA  endured beyond its expiry date  in accordance with s  LX of the WR Act   In her submissions to the Commission on   November   when she was seeking to have the application for certification of EBA  adjourned  Ms Starke did not contend that there was a binding agreement containing an implied term that the memorandum of understanding would have the same duration as EBA   She contended that there was no completed agreement  It may be true that her perception of the situation was not conclusive of the non existence of a binding agreement  It is equally true that the term that AIPA now contends was so obvious as to go without saying was not obvious to Ms Starke  who had the principal responsibility for finalising the memorandum of understanding on behalf of AIPA   At a very late stage in the trial of the proceeding  in submissions in reply  counsel for AIPA applied to amend the statement of claim  so as to allege in the alternative an implied term to the effect that the agreement containing the non pertaining provisions would come into operation immediately and would continue until either party terminated it on reasonable notice  I reserved the question whether leave to amend at that stage ought to be granted  As I have said  the objective observer of the terms expressed in the Explanatory Memorandum of   September   would have been more likely to have formed the view that the terms agreed on would come into effect immediately  and would continue until terminated by reasonable notice  Such a term is more obvious than the one originally pleaded in this case  The question remains  however  whether it is so obvious that it goes without saying  Given the existence of a range of possible provisions as to duration  it is impossible in my view to select any one as being the obvious provision  so that any expression of a term as to duration was unnecessary   The subsequent negotiations of the parties about the wording of a duration clause are inconsistent with any proposition that they must be taken to have accepted that any particular term relating to duration was so obvious that its content did not require expression for the agreement to be binding  The reality is that the parties did not regard themselves as having reached a concluded agreement about the non pertaining matters at   September    What remained to be done was not a mere drafting exercise  but the negotiation of the terms of the agreement proposed  The correspondence between the parties about the content of the duration agreement is clear evidence of this  So also is the negotiation that took place about the sharing of any liability that might arise from the implementation of the proposed agreement  It is a reasonable inference that it was not until some time after   September   and probably when they were exchanging drafts in November   that the parties began to realise that there were potential legal difficulties confronting the proposal to transfer the non pertaining provisions into another document  The principal difficulty was obvious  At the time when they were agreed  and were included in EBA  and EBA  on the assumption that the provisions were valid  there was no difficulty about the effect that they had in relation to the obligations of Qantas under EBA  and EBA   Once the provisions were removed  however  and the terms that they had qualified were left unqualified in EBA  those terms would become enforceable under the WR Act in their unqualified form  It would have been possible for an inspector  or an employee whose employment was subject to EBA  to institute a proceeding pursuant to s   of the WR Act  as it then stood  seeking to recover a penalty in respect of any breach of any term of EBA  brought about by an attempt to modify the operation of the terms of EBA  by applying any of the non pertaining provisions  It seems that this realisation gave rise to Qantas s proposal in relation to the sharing of liability  Far from refusing to countenance this proposal  on the basis that there was already a concluded agreement  AIPA proposed a modification of the clause that would provide equivalent protection to AIPA in the event of any liability  The course of these negotiations is evidence that the parties were still in negotiation about what would be the terms of any memorandum of understanding that might be entered into in consequence of what was said in cll     and     of the Explanatory Memorandum discussedAustralian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Frost Holdings Pty Ltd   VR   Before considering whether the suggested implied term meets these criteria  it is necessary to deal with one argument  That argument is based on the proposition found in the judgment of Kaye J  with whom Marks and Teague JJ agreed  in Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Frost Holdings Pty Ltd   VR

NSWLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  with whom Hope JA and Mahoney JA agreed  In my view  what took place between AIPA and Qantas after   September   is relevant in determining whether there remained matters

by reference to the multiple capacities of employees can lead into a morass of fine distinction  So maternity leave  leave to perform jury service and leave to train in the military reserve may all be said to attach to people in their capacities as parent  citizen  military reservist respectively  In my opinion  the provisions of such clauses pertain to the employment relationship   I respectfully adopt the approach of French J  Provisions requiring an employer to permit an employee to engage in activities that are not part of the normal employment duties of that person  during times when that person would normally be expected to be engaged in duties on behalf of the employer  clearly pertain to the relationship of employer and employee  Provisions that require the employer to continue to pay the employee  even when the employee is engaged in those activities  also pertain to the relationship of employer and employee  Clause   of EBA  deals with the times when the President of AIPA  an employee of Qantas  and the designates of the President of AIPA  also employees of Qantas  are to be relieved from what would otherwise be their obligations to perform duties for Qantas  Those provisions deal with a form of leave  It is true that AIPA is intended to benefit from the leave taken by those employees  because the purpose of taking that leave is for those persons to attend to the business of AIPA  The fact that this is the intended purpose of the leave detracts not at all from the fact that the provisions are provisions relating to leave  and are therefore at the heart of the employment relationship  Clause   of EBA  relates partly to the calculation of the salary to be paid to one of Qantas s employees  who happens also to be the President of AIPA  and partly to the determination of the times during which that person will be required to perform duties on behalf of Qantas  Again  such provisions are at the heart of the employment relationship  and the fact that AIPA is a beneficiary of their application does not change the character of the provisions   It follows that cll   and   and the related provisions of EBA  fell within s  LI  of the WR Act   EBA  was properly certified  and AIPA and Qantas were bound by it  including by those provisions  In the event that Qantas is found to have been in breach of any of the terms of those provisions  Qantas is liable to penalties pursuant to s   of the WR Act   It is therefore necessary to turn to the question whether there were such breaches in the period leading up to   November   when EBA  was certified and EBA  ceased to apply   In the first place  Qantas was clearly in breach of cl     coupled with cl       of EBA  in failing to pay Captain Woods at the rate of salary calculated in accordance with cl     in respect of the period from   November until   November    With one exception  the evidence is to the effect that Qantas had adopted a practice of continuing to apply all provisions of EBA   including those that had been identified and agreed upon as possibly non pertaining provisions  for as long as EBA  remained in force  The exception is the evidence of what Ms Bussell said to Captain Woods on   November  when he complained to her that EBA  was not being applied  after he had spoken with Captain Manning  Captain Kearns and Mr Hailes  Ms Bussell indicated that the non pertaining provisions would not have force until the memorandum of understanding was signed  Even if there was a practice of applying EBA  in its entirety  it is clear that it was not applied in one respect  The payment of additional salary to Captain Woods was never processed  as it would have been if Qantas had followed its usual practice of paying a newly elected President in arrears from the date of taking office  On the basis that cl   is an enforceable provision  Qantas offered no argument against the conclusion that it was in breach in this respect  Qantas and AIPA have agreed that the amount of the underpayment is      There will be an order that Qantas pay that sum to Captain Woods
