SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRe RUDDOCK  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte applicant S    HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The purpose of a provision such as s   was explained by Gummow and Heydon JJ  with whose reasons Gleeson CJ agreed  in Re RUDDOCK  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte applicant S    HCA         ALR    Ruddock  at   as follows        The purpose of a provision such as s   is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate  Further      administrative decision making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures  There  the court has to decide where  on the balance of probabilities  the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial   The relevant criterion for the grant of a protection visa to which s  a ii  refers is to be found in s   of the Act  which relevantly  for present purposes  provides as follows    A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is         a  a non citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  or                      b  a non citizen in Australia who is the spouse     of a non citizen who                       i  is mentioned in paragraph  a  and    ii  holds a protection visa          The Refugees Convention means the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on   July   and the Refugees Protocol means the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on   January    Hereafter I will refer to the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol as  the Convention    As has been said many times  proceedings in the Tribunal are not adversarial  but rather  inquisitorial  The Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of the case being advanced by an applicant  The Tribunal member conducting the relevant inquiry is not an adversarial cross examiner  but an inquisitor obliged to be fair  see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Ruddock at      The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which an applicant chooses not to embark on  It is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she may wish to advance before the Tribunal and for the Tribunal to decide whether the relevant claim has been made out  see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Ruddock at     consideredMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Plainly  satisfaction under s   is not to be addressed by deciding where the truth lies on the balance of probabilities  Whilst cases such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR    Rajalingham  refer to the  civil standard of proof  being not irrelevant to the process of fact finding by the Refugee Review Tribunal and cases such as Kalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA       FCR    Kalala  refer to the Tribunal being obliged to consider matters on  a standard less than the balance of probabilities   see at   I doubt the utility of addressing matters on which the Tribunal has to be  satisfied  by a standard which is related to the standard of proof required in adversarial civil litigation   Reference was made to Sackville J s leading judgment in Rajalingam where  what if I am wrong  terminology had been used  In SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   Bennett J referred to Sackville J s distillation of principle in Rajalingam as follows  at   and     In Rajalingam Sackville J  with whom North J agreed  discussed the various observations concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to consider  in its assessment of well founded fear      whether there is  real doubt  that findings of fact as to past events were correct  At   Sackville J distilled those observations into the principle that there are circumstances in which the Tribunal must take into account the possibility that alleged past events occurred  even though it finds that those events probably did not occur  If the Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim of an appellant but is unable to make the claim with confidence  it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that the claim may possibly be true                Where the Tribunal is unsure as to whether events occurred  as understood from its reasons  it is obliged to consider the possibility that its finding of fact might not have been correct  The Tribunal then considers the chance of an applicant s persecution in the future on a standard less than the balance of probabilities     In Kalala conclusions reached by the Tribunal as to whether certain events did nor did not take place were attended by significant doubt  At     North and Madgwick JJ stated  in Kalala  that      There may be a real and substantial basis for thinking that past events  having a character relevant for the applicant s future  may have occurred notwithstanding either that the truth of the matter cannot be established or that it is actually unlikely that those events did occur  The same is true of imputing a relevant character to past events which themselves are either not in doubt or as to which it has been recognised that there is at least a real and substantial basis for concluding that they may have occurred          If there is  in the sense mentioned  an unacceptable risk that the events occurred or had such character  they are to be taken into account in assessing whether there is a real chance of Convention related harm to the applicant  If there is a real chance that some event occurred or bore a certain character  that circumstance may powerfully affect the assessment of whether fear of future harm befalling an applicant  if returned to his or her country of nationality  is well founded

Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In NAGV and NAGW of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR    NAGV  the High Court considered s   of the Act in the form in which it existed prior to the passage of the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act    Cth   Relevantly  for present purposes  Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ said at           a perusal of the Convention shows that  Art   apart  there is a range of requirements imposed upon Contracting States with respect to refugees some of which can fairly be characterised as  protection obligations   Free access to courts of law  Art   temporary admission to refugee seamen  Art   and the measure of religious freedom provided by Art   are examples        Section   does not use the term  refugee   But the  protection obligations under  the Convention  of which it does speak are best understood as a general expression of the precept to which the Convention gives effect  The Convention provides for Contracting States to offer  surrogate protection  in the place of that of the country of nationality of which  in terms of Art  A  the applicant is unwilling to avail himself  That directs attention to Art   and to the definition of the term  refugee     Such a construction of s   is consistent with the legislative history of the Act  This indicates that the terms in which s   is expressed were adopted to do no more than present a criterion that the applicant for the protection visa had the status of a refugee because that person answered the definition of  refugee  spelt out in Art   of the Convention    Footnotes omitted  Article   of the Convention  to which reference was made in NAGV   provides         No Contracting State shall expel or return  refouler  a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion   The question of who answers the description of a  refugee  is relevantly determined by Article  of the Convention which relevantly provides       A  For the purposes of the present Convention  the term  refugee  shall apply to any person who                          owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country  or who  not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence     is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to return to it   After the applications for protection visas in NAGV were lodged  new subsections     were inserted into s   of the Act by the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  which new subsections commenced on   December    These subsections were included as part of   Part   Amendments to prevent forum shopping   Another provision inserted into the Act as part of Part   was s  M which formed part of a new  Subdivision AK Non citizens with access to protection from third countries   That section provided       M This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that a non citizen who can avail himself or herself of protection from a third country  because of nationality or some other right to re enter and reside in the third country  should seek protection from the third country instead of applying in Australia for a protection visa  or  in some cases  any other visa  Any such non citizen who is an unlawful non citizen will be subject to removal under Division     The legislative purpose recorded in s  M is consistent with the legislative intention which is evident in s   of the Act i e  to tighten up the circumstances in which non citizens in Australia may become entitled to the grant of protection visas   Section   of the Act provides        Australia is taken not to have protection obligations to a non citizen who has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a right to enter and reside in  whether temporarily or permanently and however that right arose or is expressed  any country apart from

  HCA         CLR    Chen  at   Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ summarised the findings of the Court in Applicant A as follows    It was held in Applicant A that the  common thread  which links  persecuted   for reasons of  and  membership of a particular social group  in the Convention definition of  refugee  dictates that  a shared fear of persecution  is not  sufficient to constitute a particular social group     Footnotes omitted   In relation to membership of a particular social group  McHugh J said in Applicant A at      Courts and jurists have taken widely differing views as to what constitutes  membership of a particular social group  for the purposes of the Convention  This is not surprising  The phrase is indeterminate and lacks a detailed legislative history and debate  Not only is it impossible to define the phrase exhaustively  it is pointless to attempt to do so  Records of the Convention s preparation  which are legitimate interpretative material under Australian law  reveal that the category of  particular social group  was the last of the enumerated grounds in Art  A  to be added and that it was added with the intention to broaden the reach of the other four grounds  However  nothing in the prior history or the record of the Convention supports the conclusion that the category of  particular social group  was added to provide a safety net for all persons subject to persecution who did not fall within the other enumerated grounds      In addressing the phrase  particular social group  Dawson J said in Applicant A at        The adjoining of  social  to  group  suggests that the collection of persons must be of a social character  that is to say  the collection must be cognisable as a group in society such that its members share something which unites them and sets them apart from society at large  The word  particular  in the definition merely indicates that there must be an identifiable social group such that a group can be pointed to as a particular social group  A particular social group  therefore  is a collection of persons who share a certain characteristic or element which unites them and enables them to be set apart from society at large  That is to say  not only must such persons exhibit some common element  the element must unite them  making those who share it a cognisable group within their society  I can see no reason to confine a particular social group to small groups or to large ones  a family or a group of many millions may each be a particular social group  Nor is there anything which would suggest that the uniting particular must be voluntary       In Applicant A Gummow J expressed his agreement with the following observations of Burchett J in relation to the meaning of persecution in Ram v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at    Persecution involves the infliction of harm  but it implies something more  an element of an attitude on the part of those who persecute which leads to the infliction of harm  or an element of motivation  however twisted  for the infliction of harm  People are persecuted for something perceived about them or attributed to them by their persecutors  Not every isolated act of harm to a person is an act of persecution    see per Gummow J in Applicant A at     It then proceeded to address persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group  The Tribunal said   It was submitted that  the victim of the Maoist atrocities can be classified as a particular social group       In the light of Applicant A and Chen   as quoted above  it would seem to me that persons  albeit victims  with a shared fear of persecution could not constitute a particular social group     The Tribunal went on to say

group  Gummow J opined at   that numerous individuals with similar characteristics or aspirations did not comprise a particular social group of which they were members  Once again  his Honour expressed agreement with a passage from the judgment of Burchett J in Ram at   as follows   There must be a common unifying element binding the members together before there is a social group of that kind  When a member of a social group is being persecuted for reasons of membership of the group  he is being attacked  not for himself alone or for what he owns or has done  but by virtue of his being one of those jointly condemned in the eyes of their persecutors  so that it is a fitting use of language to say that it is  for reasons of  his membership of that group  notfollowedSZHWI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALD   In SZHWI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALD   Allsop J considered the position of an appellant who was a citizen of Nepal and within the purview of the treaty with India  His Honour considered  at   that the Tribunal had failed to address one of the elements of s   that the appellant had not taken all possible steps to avail himself of a right to enter India  He was not prepared to draw the conclusion that the failure by the Tribunal to address the relevant element could be excused because it was effectively conceded or not in issue   With great respect to his Honour  I would take the view that it was for the first appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that the criterion for a protection visa prescribed by s  a  of the Act had been satisfied and that required the first appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that he had not been excluded from eligibility for a protection visa by his failure to take all possible steps to avail himself of a right to enter and reside in  relevantly  India   No evidence was advanced by the first appellant to suggest that  say  there had been an outbreak of avian influenza in India with the consequence that there were no steps available to the first appellant to enter and reside in India  The finding of the Tribunal contained in its  Conclusions  namely  Having considered the evidence as a whole  the Tribunal is not satisfied that the first named applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention  was sufficient to support an inference that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the first appellant had taken all possible steps to avail himself of a right to enter and reside in India in circumstances where his evidence had been as recorded in the Tribunal s reasons   The applicant stated that they had no relatives there  no links  and he would have to start from scratch  He said  we can t do business there     The natural inference from this evidence is that  firstly  the first appellant took no steps and  secondly  he failed to establish that there were no possible steps available to him which he could have taken referred toV A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In relation to  b  above  Allsop J said

interpretation of s    The primary judge had said  see   FCA   at       A literal construction of the word  right  in a statute must  in my view  be that it is a legally enforceable right  The extraneous materials to which I have referred above tend to support a literal construction  So does the fact that a literal construction would advance the purposes of the Refugees Convention whereas to construe the word  right  as meaning something less than a legally enforceable right would place much greater obstacles in a refugee s path   For my part I would have taken the view that the passages from the tabling speech referred to above demonstrate a clear intention on the part of the legislature that much greater obstacles should be placed in a putative refugee s path  Be that as it may  it is important to note that in Applicant C Stone J said at     It should also be recognised that a right of entry such as I have postulated may arise other than by grant of a visa  A country s entry requirements may be met by proof of identity and citizenship of a nominated country being provided at the border  for example by production of a valid passport  without the necessity for a visa  This would explain the use in s   of the phrase   however that right arose or is expressed    In WAGH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    WAGH  Lee J adhered to the construction of  right  in s   which he had given when concurring with that part of the reasons of Stone J in Applicant C which addressed that matter  Carr J considered that Applicant C was authority for the proposition that the word  right  in s   meant a legally enforceable right  albeit one that could be revoked  at     His Honour proceeded to refer to the leading judgment of Stone J in Applicant C and then said at       In the course of her judgment her Honour said  in a passage quoted by the learned primary judge at       The combination of the amendments to s   and the doctrine of effective protection leads to  t  his position  Australia does not owe protection obligations under the Convention to             a  a person who can  as a practical matter  obtain effective protection in a third country  or    b  a person who has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a legally enforceable right to enter and reside in a third country          It is true that the court affirmed the decision of the learned primary judge in that case  I am not sure that the reference to  effective protection  can  however  be ignored  In any event  after V A the comments of Stone J should  in my view  be read so as to include  if not already comprehended by  a  a category of persons of whom it can be said that while they have not  in a strict sense  a legally enforceable right  the factual situation is that they are likely to be afforded entry to the third country and as a matter of practical reality  have effective protection there  If there is any conflict between Applicant C and V A I would follow the latter and later case    One reason why a strict construction can not be given to the word  right  so that it is to be read as  legally enforceable right  is that all countries retain as a matter of sovereignty a right to exclude persons from the country  It would be unlikely in many cases that a visa would give a legally enforceable right  although as a matter of practical reality it would be virtually certain that the person in question would be permitted entry   In its reasons for decision in the present case  the Tribunal said in the section of its decision headed  FINDINGS AND REASONS   DFAT advised on   October   that Nepalese citizens do not require a visa to enter India  and if travelling by air  it is necessary only to produce a valid national passport     The Tribunal also accepts that a Nepalese citizen can fly directly to India from Australia provided they are in possession of a valid Nepalese passport     The Tribunal finds that the applicant and his wife have valid current Nepali passports  and they could fly directly to India from Australia      The Tribunal finds that the applicant and his wife     would not be denied entry to India  and they could live there indefinitely   The Tribunal also found that India accepted the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Nepal and that the Treaty had been incorporated into the domestic law of India and  as such  could be accessed by the first appellant  In the circumstances  if it were necessary to find that the first appellant had a right of entry as explained by Stone J in Applicant C then no more was required than the matters which the Tribunal found  see in particular at   in Applicant C     The Tribunal did not err in finding  as it did  that the first appellant had a legally enforceable right to enter and reside in India pursuant to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Nepal  in the sense which Stone J described in Applicant C at     In my opinion grounds   and   fail  Accordingly  the alternative basis for affirming the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  as set out in paragraph   of the Notice of Contention  should be upheld  The appellants conceded that  if grounds   and   failed  the appeal should be dismissed   In all the circumstances  the appeal should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding ninety nine   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham    Associate Dated    June   Counsel for the

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    WAGH  Lee J adhered to the construction of  right  in s   which he had given when concurring with that part of the reasons of Stone J in Applicant C which addressed that matter  Carr J considered that Applicant C was authority for the proposition that the word  right  in s   meant a legally enforceable right  albeit one that could be revoked  at     Hill J dealt with the matter more extensively in WAGH at    His Honour said    The word  right  tends to suggest  prima facie  a legally enforceable right  However  it was held by a Full Court of this court in V A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   that  right  as used in the subsection did not mean legally enforceable right of entry and re entry to a safe third country  The ratio of that decision in the narrowest sense is that s   will operate in a case where not only is there a legal right of entry but also where  absent a legally enforceable right of entry the person is likely to be allowed entry to the third country and is likely  as a matter of practical reality to have effective protection there and not be subject to refoulement contrary to Art   of the Convention  see per Black CJ at   and per Tamberlin J at   where his Honour said that the question is whether there was  any real risk that the applicant would not be able to secure access to that country so as to attract its protection        In WAGH at   Hill J expressed the opinion that the Tribunal had committed an error by ignoring altogether the requirement of s   that an applicant have not merely a right of entry  but also a right to reside in the other country  I respectfully agree that a right of residence within the meaning of the subsection is not sufficient  However  there can be no foundation for the suggestion that one has to find a separate right of entry and a separate right of residence  The Tribunal was entitled to find as it did that the appellants had a right to enter and reside in India   The STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS of the Tribunal has been recorded on some   pages of closely typed script  For present purposes it is sufficient to note the following extracts from the country information referred to   Something interesting is happening these days in otherwise turbulent Nepal  Instead of incessant headlines about senseless killings and human right abuses on a daily basis  there is news of peace parleys and multilateral dialogue  This seemingly non violent face is a u turn for a war torn country so often described as a nation on the brink of collapse  a failing state  In what appears to be a major breakthrough in the decade long civil war  the ruling pro democratic seven party alliance  SPA  and the insurgent Maoists decided on   November   to disarm under United Nations supervision  The    regular  Maoist guerrillas will be kept in seven cantonments around Nepal and their arms will be locked up       Another report referred to in the country information included   The Maoists    year journey from the jungle to government was partly a result of compulsion and partly political wisdom  After   years of fighting  the loss of   lives and massive damage to the country s infrastructure and economy  they were still unable to capture even a district headquarters  let alone the power in the centre      disapprovedSZFKD v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Turning to  c  my attention has been drawn to the decision of Federal Magistrate Smith in SZFKD v Minister for Immigration   FMCA   in which the learned Federal Magistrate expressed the view that s   required consideration to be given to whether there was relevantly a right to enter India as well as a right to reside in India  In my opinion s   does not call for a consideration of two separate rights  The issue is simply whether there was a right to  enter and reside  in India  Apart from other considerations  if two rights were in contemplation  one would have expected the legislature to have expressed itself  later in the subsection  by referring to  however those rights arose or are expressed  rather than  as it did  by using the singular  namely  however that right arose or is expressed  referred toSZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Reference was made to Sackville J s leading judgment in Rajalingam where  what if I am wrong  terminology had been used  In SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   Bennett J referred to Sackville J s distillation of principle in Rajalingam as follows  at   and     In Rajalingam Sackville J  with whom North J agreed  discussed the various observations concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to consider  in its assessment of well founded fear      whether there is  real doubt  that findings of fact as to past events were correct  At   Sackville J distilled those observations into the principle that there are circumstances in which the Tribunal must take into account the possibility that alleged past events occurred  even though it finds that those events probably did not occur  If the Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim of an appellant but is unable to make the claim with confidence  it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that the claim may possibly be true                Where the Tribunal is unsure as to whether events occurred  as understood from its reasons  it is obliged to consider the possibility that its finding of fact might not have been correct  The Tribunal then considers the chance of an applicant s persecution in the future on a standard less than the balance of probabilities     In Kalala conclusions reached by the Tribunal as to whether certain events did nor did not take place were attended by significant doubt  At     North and Madgwick JJ stated  in Kalala  that      There may be a real and substantial basis for thinking that past events  having a character relevant for the applicant s future  may have occurred notwithstanding either that the truth of the matter cannot be established or that it is actually unlikely that those events did occur  The same is true of imputing a relevant character to past events which themselves are either not in doubt or as to which it has been recognised that there is at least a real and substantial basis for concluding that they may have occurred          If there is  in the sense mentioned  an unacceptable risk that the events occurred or had such character  they are to be taken into account in assessing whether there is a real chance of Convention related harm to the applicant  If there is a real chance that some event occurred or bore a certain character  that circumstance may powerfully affect the assessment of whether fear of future harm befalling an applicant  if returned to his or her country of nationality  is well founded
