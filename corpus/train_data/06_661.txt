Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   the Full Court  Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ  indicated at p   that the tests normally to be applied in determining whether leave for interlocutory decisions should be granted are whether the decision at first instance was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered  and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision at first instance was wrong   For the above reasons  I granted leave  being of the view that both of the tests set out in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR had application in the circumstances of the present matter                    I certify that the preceding twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The submissions by counsel for the respondents referred to the judgment of Branson J in The Airtourer Co operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd   FCA     where her Honour there indicated that s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  does not indicate any predisposition to or bias towards the granting of an order against an impecunious litigant  Counsel for the respondents later said     The discretion is completely unfettered and ought to be exercised without any predisposition      However  counsel for the respondents also submitted         The whole purpose of the Act  and  indeed  the underlying thesis behind section   of the Corporations Law  is to ensure that vexatious claims are not brought by companies having no assets  so that a person in the position of a respondent to just such a claim ought not be penalised by the fact that it can be an empty shell of a company as the applicant        At the conclusion of those submissions  the primary judge said     What I would like to do now is give the parties my preliminary thoughts on this matter  My preliminary thoughts in this matter is that this is not         And counsel for the applicants for security said       Your Honour  could I just reply on one point  please     He continued to make a submission  and the primary judge then said       What I would like to do now  as I said  is to give the parties my preliminary views of where I think this is going  My preliminary view is that perhaps this is not a preliminary view  This is a final view  Impecuniosity is no bar to litigation  There s no question about that  and that has been made clear in cases such as Spender J s decision very recently  Further  I am of the view that this is not vexatious litigation  In my opinion  there is a sound case here being argued by the applicants      I would have been somewhat inclined not to make any order in relation to security for costs at all in relation to this matter  I note  however  that the applicants the respondents to this notice of motion have made an offer of   and I would have thought that that would have been a reasonable offer in the circumstances of this case          Those observations seem to indicate two reasons why security was not ordered  First    Impecuniosity is no bar to litigation    and secondly       this is not vexatious litigation     there is a sound case here being argued by the applicants   Section   of the Corporations Act    Cth  provides        Costs     Where a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding  the court having jurisdiction in the matter may  if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his  her or its defence  require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given        The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be borne by such party to the proceeding as the court  in its discretion  directs   The condition to the exercise of the discretion to order security was met by the evidence in this case distinguishedStaff Development   Training Centre Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As far as I can see from the evidence  there was no suggestion that the ordering of security in this case would stifle the litigation  a circumstance which distinguishes it from the factual position in Staff Development   Training Centre Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     a case referred to in the course of submissions to the primary judge consideredCrystal Dawn Pty Ltd v Redruth Pty Ltd   QCA  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QCA  html  In Crystal Dawn Pty Ltd v Redruth Pty Ltd   QCA     Muir J  with whom Pincus JA and Williams J agreed  said at par      The learned primary judge s failure to give reasons will  if raised by the applicants in their notice of appeal  be a matter for consideration on the appeal but in my view  it is relevant to the question of whether there should be an extension of time within which to appeal      Muir J noted     It is well established that there is a duty on the part of judicial tribunals to give reasons for their decisions and that failure to give reasons which ought to be given amounts to appellable error         His Honour continued        In Cypressvale Pty Ltd v Retail Shop Lease Tribunal     Qd R   at   McPherson and Davies JJA observed      The extent of the duty to give reasons is affected by the function that is served by the giving of reasons  The requirement is considered an incident of the judicial process  the hallmark of which is  as McHugh JA stressed in Soulemezis     NSWLR       the quality of rationality  which is what serves to distinguish a judicial decision from an arbitrary decision  The giving of reasons is thus an aspect of judicial accountability  which was identified by his Honour in Soulemezis as the second of the three purposes served by the judicial duty of giving of reasons  The first  his Honour said  is that  it enables the parties to see the extent to which their arguments have been understood and accepted  as well as the basis of the judge s decision   The third is that judicial reasoning provides a precedent for the decision of future cases  See  to similar effect  what was said by Mahoney JA in the same case  Soulemezis  at   referred to with approval in Sun Alliance Insurance Ltd v Massoud   VR     in the Full Court of Victoria         The obligation to give reasons may be affected by the way in which proceedings are conducted  For example  the primary judge may indicate that it is not proposed that reasons be given and there may be a tacit acceptance of this by counsel for the parties  For a discussion of qualifications to the general duty to give reasons see the observations of Mahoney P in Kiama Constructions v Davey     NSWLR   at    In this case there is no suggestion that there was anything in the way in which the matter was conducted which would lead to the conclusion that the normal principles or expectations in respect of the giving of reasons would not apply  Without wishing to limit the general obligation to give reasons  even on interlocutory matters  I note that the decision under consideration had the potential to prevent the applicants from pursuing the action and was thus one in respect of which reasons should have been given        In my view it is undesirable that there be a judicial determination adverse to a litigant which significantly affects the litigant s rights without reasons being provided for that determination  For that reasons alone I would grant the extension of time        I do not consider the failure on the part of the applicants  counsel at first instance to request reasons to be a matter which negates the concern I have just expressed  The bearing of the absence of reasons on the outcome of the appeal will be a matter for the Court which hears the appeal  consideredFrigo v Culhaci   unreported  New South Wales Court of Appeal    July   In Frigo v Culhaci   an unreported judgment of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales   Mason P  Sheller JA and Sheppard AJA  of   July   set aside the grant of a Mareva injunction by a District Court judge  in part because of the failure to give adequate reasons  The Court said       The orders made below must be set aside for a number of reasons        Absence of Reasons     It is the practice of the Supreme Court for reasons to be given  albeit sometimes in short form  after the hearing of a contested motion for an interlocutory injunction  S c  of the District Court requires no less  More importantly  the general duty to give reasons  and its rationale as including proper exercise of rights of appeal  is well established  see Soulemezis v Dudley  Holdings  Pty Ltd     NSWLR   Beale v Government Insurance Office  NSW      MVR    consideredMorris v Hanley   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  In Morris v Hanley   NSWCA     Heydon JA  with whom Foster and Rolfe AJJA agreed  said  at par         The duty of judges is to give reasons for the directions and orders they make must be lower where interlocutory orders affecting matters of practice and procedure are involved than they are where orders are made after a trial  That must be so if for no other reason than that litigation would clog up to the point of stagnation if full reasons had to be given for the tens or hundreds of interlocutory orders which many primary judges make in a week in busy trial courts  However  though applications for security for costs are matters of practice and procedure  they can have a significant impact on the substantive rights of plaintiffs  because if the order is made  the plaintiff may not be able to provide security for costs where one of the grounds for the application is that plaintiff s lack of funds  If so  that will prevent the plaintiff being able to have a judicial examination of the complaints made on the merits  Accordingly it would not be right to hold that there is no duty  or only a very exiguous duty  on a primary judge to give reasons for making an order as to security for costs        The primary judge in giving his reasons for the orders under appeal in many respects went well beyond what was called for by the duty to give reasons  The reasons for judgment he provided  particularly given that they were ex tempore  set out in considerable detail his approach  However  there is force in the argument of the plaintiff that insufficient reasons were given in relation to the question of the defendants  delay               Sometimes what might otherwise be said to be a deficiency in the reasons of a primary judge can be compensated for by a clear explanation in the course of argument by the primary judge for the outcome  However  that cure cannot be resorted to here  This Court does not have before it any transcript of the oral argument before the primary judge  and it has before it no affidavit indicating anything he may have said in the course of argument which would explain how he took the defendants  delay into account        In those circumstances there is an error of principle in the primary judge s approach   It seems to me that what was held to be  in that case  a failure to give adequate reasons must be the  high water mark  of a judge s obligation to give reasons for interlocutory orders  I think there is room for the view that there was a desired result on the appeal searching for a reason to make it   In my opinion  it is cases like Morris v Hanley   NSWCA   that support the view of trial judges that appellate judges can be likened to those who come down out of the hills after the battle is over and shoot the wounded   Nevertheless it is clear that  even on interlocutory orders  there is a duty to give adequate reasons  which do not display error   It is sufficient in respect of other aspects of the application for leave to indicate that in my opinion it is arguable that the conclusion of the primary judge in dismissing the application for security was tainted by misapplication of principle  and an improper interpretation of s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  and s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   In particular  it is arguable that principles dealing with the impecuniosity of a plaintiff who is a natural person  have no application in relation to corporations falling within s
