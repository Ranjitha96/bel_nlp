 FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In support of this submission  Dynamic Supplies referred to the recent decision in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd   FCAFC    In that case  the Full Court at   accepted the proposition that injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether their conduct falls within the scope of the injunction  This is because failure to comply with the terms of a court order may give rise to contempt proceedings in which determination of questions of construction of the terms of the injunction is not appropriate since ambiguity or uncertainty may be a defence in such proceedings  see ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v

where the Court adopted the principle that injunctive relief should be based upon the specific case alleged and proved against the defendant  and indicate in clear terms the conduct enjoined so that he or she knows what is expected to be done   As noted by Lockhart J in ICI Australia   FCR at   it is imperative that restraining orders are precisely formulated because contempt proceedings with serious consequences can flow from a failure to comply with such orders  In the light of this  and having regard to my earlier reasons in this matter  I consider that the words   under or by reference to   proposed by Brother are too extensive in their reach because they are capable of including conduct beyond that in respect of which specific findings have been made   I therefore consider that the orders proposed by Brother are appropriate  with the exception of proposed order   for which Dynamic Supplies  proposed order   should be substituted   In relation to the question of costs of this application relating to the form of orders  I note there have clearly been constructive discussions between the parties in relation to the form of the proposed orders  I therefore consider there should be no order as to costs citedMacLean v Shell Chemical  Australia  Pty Ltd     FCR   In support of this submission  Dynamic Supplies referred to the recent decision in Australian Competition and
