may of course confer standing in express terms   they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial  Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke  it is  perhaps  preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute  rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking  in accordance with Boyce s Case  for the existence of special damage   cf Gibbs J at   The respondent made written submissions to the following effect   a  the applicant is doing nothing other than attempting to enforce the public law as enacted by the provisions of the DD Act and the Disability Standards   b  there is no right subsisting for the benefit of the applicant or its members personally that is sought to be asserted through this litigation   c  the application by the applicant is one to assert the effect of the public law of the Commonwealth and the applicant therefore faces the difficulty in relation to standing as the application is a bare attempt to assert a

Human Rights   Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA         FCR    c  contravention of a standard may be cause for complaint under s   DD Act    d  section  P  HREOC Act defines who may lodge a complaint under the HREOC Act  The section contemplates a complaint by an  aggrieved person  on the basis of  alleged unlawful discrimination   e  the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act make it plain that they confer private rights with respect to  unlawful discrimination  as defined in s   HREOC Act   f  the proceedings in the Court involve a determination of the allegations of unlawful discrimination as set out in the complaint  and are circumscribed by the complaint which was terminated by the President   g  the applicant s complaint concerns ss   and   DD Act   and the terms of the complaint and the proceedings before the Court raise the issue of a contravention of the Disability Standards   h  the HREOC Act operates to allow complaints to be made about non compliance with the Disability Standards  Section  P  HREOC Act creates a private right to make a complaint based on s    i  the material clearly identifies a dispute between the applicant and the respondent  namely the failure on the part of the respondent to comply with the Disability Standards   j  Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   is not relevant in this matter because the High Court found that the provisions of the relevant legislation in that case did not create private rights   k  the approach taken by the High Court in Truth About Motorways   HCA       CLR   confirms that the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act permit the applicant to proceed in this Court   In this case  the respondent has drawn an analogy between the applicant s claim and the difficulties faced by the Foundation in Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   which was found by the High Court to have no special interest or private right to sustain proceedings  In my view however the relevant legislation in Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   was very different to that in this case  A key difference was summarised by Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   where his Honour observed that  with reference to the relevant legislation and legislative instruments in that case       the subject matter of the  Environmental  Procedures is such as to suggest that the appellant has no standing to enforce compliance with them  They are not a code of procedure  such as is familiar in town planning legislation  designed to ensure that those who are likely to be affected by the grant of some permit or the rezoning of some land are given a right to object and to have their objection heard and determined    at    emphasis added   cf Gibbs J at

Conservation Foundation   the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation   Eleventh  there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts  Traditionally  courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation  either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right   Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement  No       Qd R   or because the association is not a  person aggrieved  for the purposes of the relevant legislation   Right To Life   FCR   Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR at    In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a  person aggrieved    North Coast   ALR   Tasmanian Conservation Trust   ALR   National Trust of Australia   VR   Manuka   ACTSC      Consideration and findings  It is clear in this case that the complainant does have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings  I accept that the purpose of the applicant is to ensure that all members of the Hervey Bay community have access to all premises and facilities in the region  However merely incorporating an association and giving voice to such objects is not sufficient to create standing  or to establish that the association is a  person aggrieved  Australian Conservation Foundation   CLR at   Right to Life   FCR at       Before me  Mr Fleming on behalf of the respondent submitted that the applicant represented a general body of people  which might include people without a disability but with a genuine concern as to disability  and that this does not give the applicant a greater interest in the matter than anyone else  Mr Fleming cites Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   in support of this submission  There is a distinction between the case before me and such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Right to Life   FCR   Speleological Society     Qd R   and Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR   namely that in each of those cases it was clear that the members of the association had no more interest in the proceedings   be they concerning the establishment of a resort in Central Queensland  abortion drugs  bat rookeries or rabbit calicivirus disease   than ordinary members of the public  In this case  it appears that the applicant was incorporated to represent people who have an interest in  inter alia   accessing public transport in the Hervey Bay region  and it further appears that it does represent some people who live in the Hervey Bay region and some people who are disabled and who may be aggrieved by non compliance with the Disability Standards in that region  Potentially  for example  those members who are both disabled and live in the Hervey Bay region have an interest in these proceedings more than ordinary members of the public   Third  in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Right to Life   FCR   Speleological Society     Qd R   and Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR     I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka   ACTSC   where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions   However in this critical respect Manuka   ACTSC   is immediately distinguishable from the case before me  The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region  or both  It is quite possible   indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent   that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region   Further  although of somewhat debatable significance  note comments of Lockhart J in Right to Life   FCR at   unlike in the North Coast   ALR   Tasmanian Conservation Trust   ALR   and National Trust of Australia  Vic    VR   there is no evidence before me that the applicant in this case is considered to be a peak body representing the interests of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland  or that the applicant has been recognised by government as a body representing the concerns of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland or had participated in official government decision making processes  Further  while I note from correspondence attached to the affidavit of Mr Robin Andrew King sworn   November   that the respondent has acknowledged the applicant s interest in bus shelter infrastructure in the region and sought the input of the applicant and its members  annexure RK   and that the Disability Standards require  inter alia   that a provider must consult with  passengers with disabilities who use their service  or with organisations representing people with disabilities  about any proposal for equivalent access   cl     Disability Standards  it is difficult to characterise the conduct of the respondent as being anything more than a willingness to consult an organisation which was willing to provide information  In this sense  a comparison may be drawn with the consultation with the Foundation in Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR    Accordingly  I do not find comparisons with North Coast   ALR   Tasmanian Conservation Trust   ALR   or the National Trust of Australia  Vic    VR   cases of assistance in these proceedings citedBateman s Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd

Fourth  the respondent s submissions concerning this issue have substantially equated  person aggrieved  for the purposes of s  P HREOC Act with principles articulated in Boyce     Ch   and the possession by a complainant of a special interest so as to enforce the public rights created by statute  Clearly  there is a different jurisprudential approach entailed by identifying whether rights created by statute are public rights permitting enforcement by an individual in circumstances only where the individual has a special interest  compared with considering legislation authorising a person aggrieved to enforce statutory rights created by the legislation  Nonetheless  it is certainly the case that Courts have explained the words  person aggrieved  in terms of special interest in the public law sense  So  for example  in Ricegrowers Co operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman     FLR   at   Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words  a person who is aggrieved       are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision  In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public   see Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs     FLR   per Ellicott J   cf United States Tobacco Company v Minister for Consumer Affairs     FCR   at   Ogle v Strickland   citedBritannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David   AC   The respondent submits further that as s   DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful   public rights are created  However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is  unlawful  does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation  There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law  and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty  it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded  note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips     KB   Groves v Lord Wimborne     QB

construction of the statute itself citedBropho v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In contrast  in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act  including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s   provide a scheme which allows  a person aggrieved  by alleged unlawful discrimination   including  as I have already noted  conduct deemed unlawful by s   DD Act   to lodge a complaint with HREOC  s  P HREOC Act  and in the event that the complaint is terminated  a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court  s  PO HREOC Act   Significantly  the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination  including payment of damages by the respondent  employment or re employment an applicant  an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case  s  PO  HREOC Act   Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct  and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct  personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct  To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East  ex parte Nguyen   CLR at   repeated in Western Australia v Ward   HCA         CLR   at     The elaborate and special scheme   was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention     might obtain a remedy  and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia s treaty obligations  bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the  legislation  was to operate    That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments  and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes  does not in any way minimise their relevance  As observed  in my view correctly  by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia   FCA   at       and     they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists  citedCampbell v University of New South Wales     IR   The respondent submits further that as s   DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful   public rights are created  However the fact

Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement  No       Qd R   Eleventh  there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation

in the litigation  either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right   Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Central Queensland

Trust   ALR   National Trust of Australia   VR   Manuka   ACTSC      Consideration and findings  Before me  Mr Fleming on behalf of the respondent submitted that the applicant represented a general body of people  which might include people without a disability but with a genuine concern as to disability  and that this does not give the applicant a greater interest in the matter than anyone else  Mr Fleming cites Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   in support of this submission  There is a distinction between the case before me and such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Right to Life   FCR   Speleological Society     Qd R   and Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR   namely that in each of those cases it was clear that the members of the association had no more interest in the proceedings   be they concerning the establishment of a resort in Central Queensland  abortion drugs  bat rookeries or rabbit calicivirus disease   than ordinary members of the public  In this case  it appears that the applicant was incorporated to represent people who have an interest in  inter alia   accessing public transport in the Hervey Bay region  and it further appears that it does represent some people who live in the Hervey Bay region and some people who are disabled and who may be aggrieved by non compliance with the Disability Standards in that region  Potentially  for example  those members who are both disabled and live in the Hervey Bay region have an interest in these proceedings more than ordinary members of the public   Third  in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Right to Life   FCR   Speleological Society     Qd R   and Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR     I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka   ACTSC   where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions   However in this critical respect Manuka   ACTSC   is immediately distinguishable from the case before me  The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region  or both  It is quite possible   indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent   that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region   However in this case the application currently before me specifically sought orders as to the standing of the applicant  Further  the applicant has not disputed the appropriateness of a determination of whether it is aggrieved in the context of the substantive proceedings  Indeed  the parties had the opportunity to put their cases on affidavit  and opportunity over the course of a hearing over one day to make their submissions  To adopt the language of de Jersey J in Speleological Society     Qd R at   there appears to be    no particular deficiency in the manner of the presentation of the evidence going to standing    There is  in short  no reason for thinking that given more time the  applicant  would mount a case on standing significantly different   citedCooper v Human Rights   Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant submitted in summary   a  the issue of standing to commence an action under the HREOC Act or the DD

that the provisions of the relevant legislation in that case did not create private rights   k  the approach taken by the High Court in Truth About Motorways   HCA       CLR   confirms that the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act permit the applicant to proceed in this Court citedDajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot   VR   Further  it is clear that legislation may create personal

in express terms   they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial  Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke  it is  perhaps  preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute  rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking  in accordance with Boyce s Case  for the existence of special damage   cf Gibbs J at  citedDavis v Commonwealth   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The traditional approach to standing in matters involving the enforcement of statutes was that while interference with private rights could be asserted by individuals  public rights could only be asserted by the Attorney General representing the public  either in the name of the Attorney or at the relation of some complainant  Boyce v Paddington Borough Council     Ch   Gouriet v Attorney General   UKHL       AC   Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   Davis v Commonwealth

Conservation Foundation   CLR at       Depending on the nature of the relief which he seeks  a plaintiff will in general have a locus standi when he can show actual or apprehended injury or damage to his property or proprietary rights  to his business or economic interests   and perhaps to his social or political interests  Beyond making this general observation  I consider that there is nothing to be gained from discussing in the abstract the broad range of interests which may serve to support a locus standi for  as I said in Robinson v Western Australian Museum   HCA         CLR   at      The cases are infinitely various and so much depends in a given case on the nature of the relief which is sought  for what is a sufficient interest in one case may be less than sufficient in another    Defining private rights for this purpose is a distinct challenge  note Heydon JD  Injunctions and Declarations  in Stein LA  ed  Locus Standi  Law Book Company    at      Traditionally they have

   The distinction between rights which are  private rights  enabling commencement of proceedings by way  for example  of declaratory and injunctive relief  and  public rights  the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney General  has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from

Jewry v Scully     FCR   Before me at the hearing  Mr Fleming QC made oral submissions as to whether the applicant  being an incorporated body  could be a person aggrieved by the complaints that have been made  In summary  Mr Fleming QC submitted   a  cases where unincorporated associations have been accorded standing  for example Executive Council of Australian Jewry v Scully     FCR   have no application in this case because the applicant is an incorporated entity   b  although the applicant is an association of people who have a genuine concern and interest in disability  this does not give them a greater interest in the matter than anyone else  and therefore does not make them  aggrieved   c  no specific act of discrimination is pleaded  and therefore there can be no person  aggrieved   For a person to be aggrieved the person must be prejudicially affected by an act   d  the applicant  an incorporated body  cannot be a person aggrieved in this context because a corporation cannot be aggrieved by conduct with respect to bus stops unless the corporation was affected  for example  by a wrong to one of its employees  and that is not the case here   Tenth  to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name  in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably

whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are  persons aggrieved  by the allegedly unlawful act  If they are  the complaint is competent in law  though not in name  as it was made by them   at   As the cases have shown  it is possible that a body corporate can be the subject of racial discrimination where the association is the subject of discrimination by reason of the race  colour or national or ethnic origin of any associate of that corporation  Scully   FCR   and Koowarta   HCA       CLR    Similar principles potentially apply in relation to a body corporate which claims discrimination as a result of conduct in breach of the DD Act   So  for example  if an incorporated association representing disabled people was refused a lease of accommodation because of the objects of the association and the attributes of its members  it is arguable that the association itself would be a  person aggrieved  by that conduct  However as Mr Fleming submitted  it is more difficult to establish that the applicant  an incorporated association  is a person aggrieved within the meaning of the HREOC Act and the DD Act where the applicant is complaining about a breach of disability standards associated with accessing public transport   I note that the applicant in its written submissions contended that the majority of its members are people with disabilities who are resident in the Maryborough and Hervey Bay areas of Queensland  and that those members have the requisite interest associated with the actions of the respondent in the provision of goods and services within the Hervey Bay areas  The applicant cited Scully in support of this submission   However to my mind the reference to Scully   FCR   and the relevance of the possible interests of the members of the applicant  can be answered as follows   First  in my view Scully   FCR   is of minimal assistance to the applicant  There is a clear and obvious distinction between unincorporated associations  as was the applicant in Scully   FCR   and incorporated associations such as the applicant  Whilst it is true that incorporated associations are community based organisations and in many respects  as I have already noted  are not comparable with commercial companies operating for profit making purposes  nonetheless it would be improper to ignore the status attributed to such associations by the Associations Incorporation Act    Qld   The applicant is body corporate which needs to establish that it is a person aggrieved in its own right  Unlike the applicant in Scully   FCR   it is not an unincorporated association which may derive a special interest or status of  person aggrieved  from its members citedFarley   Lewers Ltd v AG   NSWR   The respondent made written

voices a particular concern and regards the actions of another as injurious to the object of that concern  Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation   CLR at   Gibbs CJ in Onus v Alcoa of Australia   CLR at     The nature of the complainant s interest was expressed slightly differently by Gibbs CJ in Koowarta   CLR at   where his Honour said    The words  person aggrieved  have appeared in many statutes  English and Australian  and their meaning has been discussed in many cases  In the end of course the meaning of the words must depend on the context of the particular statute  It has often been said that the words connote a person with a legal grievance  see In Re Sidebotham     ChD   at   Buxton v Minister of Housing and Local Government     QB   at    The cases under the Trade Marks Acts to which we were referred are consistent with that view  they suggest that a person is  aggrieved  by an act which operates in restraint of what would otherwise have been his legal rights  Powell v Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Co   AC   at     Attorney General  NSW  v Brewery Employee s Union of NSW   HCA         CLR   at       Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v GF Heublein and Bro Inc   HCA         CLR   at       I n determining the meaning of the expression  person aggrieved  in s   of the Act it is necessary to have regard to the remedies which such a person may obtain under s    These include damages in respect of loss suffered by the person aggrieved by the relevant act and loss of dignity by  humiliation to  or injury to the feelings of  a person aggrieved by the relevant act  If the refusal of consent proves to have been unlawful  Mr Koowarta may be able to obtain damages of that kind  In all these circumstances it seems to me that he is a  person aggrieved  and entitled to maintain the proceedings   Fifth  traditionally the term  person aggrieved  should not be interpreted narrowly  N Jie   AC at     Koowarta   CLR at   Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs     FLR   at   Ogle v Strickland     FCR    especially Fisher J at     and Lockhart J at      Further  as Gibbs CJ said in Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd   CLR at   in relation to whether a person has a  special interest  sufficient to sustain litigation    The rule is obviously a flexible one since  as was pointed out in   Australian Conservation Foundation   the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation   Seventh  to the extent that the respondent submits that  as a general proposition  a body corporate cannot be an aggrieved person in the context of this scheme  I do not accept that submission  As noted by Mason J in Koowarta   CLR at   in considering the issue of standing under the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   in its then form    By virtue of s  a  of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  a reference in a statute to a  Person  includes a reference to a body corporate  unless a contrary intention appears  It is submitted that because  generally speaking  human rights are accorded to individuals  not to corporations   person  should be confined to individuals  But  the object of the Convention being to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and the purpose of s   being to prohibit acts involving racial discrimination  there is a strong reason for giving the word its statutory sense so that the section applies to discrimination against a corporation by reason of the race  colour or national or ethnic origin of any associate of that corporation   As the cases have shown  it is possible that a body corporate can be the subject of racial discrimination where the association is the subject of discrimination by reason of the race  colour or national or ethnic origin of any associate of that corporation  Scully   FCR   and Koowarta   HCA       CLR    Similar principles potentially apply in relation to a body corporate which claims discrimination as a result of conduct in breach of the DD Act   So  for example  if an incorporated association representing disabled people was refused a lease of accommodation because of the objects of the association and the attributes of its members  it is arguable that the association itself would be a  person aggrieved  by that conduct  However as Mr Fleming submitted  it is more difficult to establish that the applicant  an incorporated association  is a person aggrieved within the meaning of the HREOC Act and the DD Act where the applicant is complaining about a breach of disability standards associated with accessing public transport citedMallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondent submits further that as s   DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful   public rights are created  However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is  unlawful  does not of itself mean

Australia   VR   Manuka   ACTSC      Consideration and findings  Third  in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation   HCA       CLR   Right to Life   FCR   Speleological Society     Qd R   and Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR     I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka   ACTSC   where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions   However in this critical respect Manuka   ACTSC   is immediately distinguishable from the case before me  The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region  or both  It is quite possible   indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent   that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region   The decision in Manuka   ACTSC   may be further contrasted with  for example  Onesteel Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Whyalla Red Dust Action Group Inc   SASC   where Debelle J held that an association of   residents in the Whyalla area concerned with environmental issues involving the steel works operated by Onesteel   SASC   was nonetheless not a  person interested  for the purposes of the relevant legislation because    It is unable to point to any physical injury or harm  It has no property which is affected by the subject matter of the application  It has no interests of its own which might be affected other than indirectly through those of its members who might be affected  The evidence does not disclose how many of its members are affected  All that is known is that some of its members live  work or own property affected by dust from OneSteel s plant  One possible corollary is that some of its members may not be affected at all   at

substantially equated  person aggrieved  for the purposes of s  P HREOC Act with principles articulated in Boyce     Ch   and the possession by a complainant of a special interest so as to enforce the public rights created by statute  Clearly  there is a different jurisprudential approach entailed by identifying whether rights created by statute are public rights permitting enforcement by an individual in circumstances only where the individual has a special interest  compared with considering legislation authorising a person aggrieved to enforce statutory rights created by the legislation  Nonetheless  it is certainly the case that Courts have explained the words  person aggrieved  in terms of special interest in the public law sense  So  for example  in Ricegrowers Co operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman     FLR   at   Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words  a person who is aggrieved       are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision  In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public

unlawful   public rights are created  However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is  unlawful  does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation  There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law  and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty  it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded  note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips     KB   Groves v Lord Wimborne     QB   especially at

complaint was lodged by or on behalf of a  person aggrieved  by the alleged unlawful discrimination   c  in accepting the complaint under s  P  HREOC is not making a determination which is binding on this Court as to whether the complainant is a  person aggrieved  for the purposes of s  P  As Brennan J observed in Re Adams and the Tax Agents  Board     ALR   at    It is the court s judgment and not the administrative body s opinion which defines the extent of   its statutory authority   d  it is not the case that whether a complainant is a  person aggrieved  can only be addressed by judicial review of the decision of HREOC to accept the complaint  This is inconsistent with Parliament s intention to create a process for handling discrimination complaints which would be efficient and

 As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation   CLR at   referring to s   Trade Practices Act    Cth    statutes may of course confer standing in express terms   they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial  Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke  it is  perhaps  preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute  rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking  in accordance with Boyce s Case  for the existence of special damage   cf Gibbs J at   In contrast  in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act  including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s   provide a scheme which allows  a person aggrieved  by alleged unlawful discrimination   including  as I have already noted  conduct deemed unlawful by s   DD Act   to lodge a complaint with HREOC  s  P HREOC Act  and in the event that the complaint is terminated  a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court  s  PO HREOC Act   Significantly  the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination  including payment of damages by the respondent  employment or re employment an applicant  an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case  s  PO  HREOC Act   Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct  and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct  personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct  To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East  ex parte Nguyen   CLR at   repeated in Western Australia v Ward   HCA         CLR   at     The elaborate and special scheme   was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention     might obtain a remedy  and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia s treaty obligations  bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the  legislation  was to operate    That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments  and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes  does not in any way minimise their relevance  As observed  in my view correctly  by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia   FCA   at       and     they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists   Sixth  in interpreting  person aggrieved  in this context  it is appropriate to accord a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the relevant legislation rather than a construction that would not promote that purpose or object  s  AA  Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   In light of the scheme created by the interaction of the HREOC Act and the DD Act for the purpose of permitting aggrieved persons to make complaints in relation to unlawful discrimination  it is prima facie appropriate to extend a consideration of the term beyond the purpose of the HREOC Act to include the purpose of the DD Act   This is particularly so given that the unlawful discrimination alleged derives from ss   and   DD Act   I have already noted observations of the High Court in Re East  ex parte Nguyen   HCA       CLR   as to the intentions of Parliament in relation to the scheme to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention might obtain a remedy  I also note the objects of the DD Act as stated in s   of the Act    The objects of this Act are         a  to eliminate  as far as possible  discrimination against persons on the ground of disability in the areas of         i  work  accommodation  education  access to premises  clubs and sport  and    ii  the provision of goods  facilities  services and land  and    iii  existing laws  and    iv  the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs  and        b  to ensure  as far as practicable  that persons with disabilities have the same rights to equality before the law as the rest of the community  and    c  to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the principle that persons with disabilities have the same fundamental rights as the rest of the community citedRicegrowers Co operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman     FLR   Fourth  the respondent s submissions concerning this issue have substantially equated  person aggrieved  for the purposes of s  P HREOC Act with principles articulated in Boyce     Ch   and the possession by a complainant of a special interest so as to enforce the public rights created by statute  Clearly  there is a different jurisprudential approach entailed by identifying whether rights created by statute are public rights permitting enforcement by an individual in circumstances only where the individual has a special interest  compared with considering legislation authorising a person aggrieved to enforce statutory rights created by the legislation  Nonetheless  it is certainly the case that Courts have explained the words  person aggrieved  in terms of special interest in the public law sense  So  for example  in Ricegrowers Co operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman     FLR   at   Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words  a person who is aggrieved       are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision  In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public   see Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs     FLR   per Ellicott J   cf United States Tobacco

incorporating a body and providing it with relevant objects does not provide it with standing it otherwise would not have had  This point was made clear in Right to Life Association  NSW  Inc v Secretary  Department of Human Services and Health     FCR   particularly by Lockhart J at    The Court in that case approved similar comments of Lindgren J at first instance where his Honour said    The applicant submitted that what distinguished it from ordinary members of the public was that it was organised  and since   incorporated  with objects directly related to the subject matter of the decision sought to be challenged  But to accord the status of a  person aggrieved  for no more reason than this would be to elevate form above substance  It would allow individuals who were opposed to a decision  albeit sincerely and for unselfish motives  to acquire standing to challenge it by the procedure of devising an appropriate form of constitution  and if necessary procuring corporate form  It would  for example  distinguish between the unsuccessful Mr Cameron in Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission noted above and an incorporated association of individuals organised under a constitution with objects of seeking a more equitable allocation of scholarships to Fijians  In my opinion  the issue of standing is not to be foreclosed by such a formal distinction    Right

FLR   at   Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words  a person who is aggrieved       are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision  In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public   see Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs     FLR   per Ellicott J   cf United States Tobacco Company v Minister for Consumer Affairs     FCR   at   Ogle v Strickland   citedUniversity of Newcastle v Chopra   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondent submits further that as s   DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful   public rights are created  However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is  unlawful  does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation  There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law  and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty  it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded  note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips     KB   Groves v Lord Wimborne     QB   especially at     Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David   AC   Knox CJ  Isaacs  Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Potter v Ferguson     NSWLR   at   Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra   HCA         ALR   at   Campbell v University of New South Wales     IR   at     Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation     ALR   at    GS  v News Ltd   Aust Torts Reports     at    In all cases  notwithstanding the existence of other remedies  such as penalties  whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself citedVictorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Tenth  to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name  in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably irrelevant  So in Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   Starke J  without needing to decide the point  observed that an infringement of the rights of members of an incorporated body does of itself mean that the rights of the incorporated body are infringed  or that the incorporated body has standing to maintain an action  cf Lockhart J in Right to Life   FCR at   and Nicholson J in Defence Coalition against RCD Inc v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy     FCR    This may be distinguished from the position concerning unincorporated associations  A useful illustration of this point in this context is Scully   FCR   where an unincorporated association commenced proceedings under the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth   in its then form  Wilcox J said    I agree with Commissioner Nettlefold that  as Executive Council for Australian Jewry is not a  person  in the eyes of the law  it is incapable of being a  person aggrieved  within the meaning of s   of the Racial Discrimination Act   Therefore it is not itself a competent complainant  However  this does not mean its complaint is a nullity  It is necessary to go behind the name and consider whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are  persons aggrieved  by the allegedly unlawful act  If they are  the complaint is competent in law  though not in name  as it was made by them   at   Second  there is substantial body of authority  to which I have already referred  that the interests of members of a body corporate do not equate with the interests of the body corporate  Victorian Chamber of Manufactures   HCA       CLR   Right to Life   FCR   Defence Coalition against RCD   FCR   citedWestern Australia v Ward   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In contrast  in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act  including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s   provide a scheme which allows  a person aggrieved  by alleged unlawful discrimination   including  as I have already noted  conduct deemed unlawful by s   DD Act   to lodge a complaint with HREOC  s  P HREOC Act  and in the event that the complaint is terminated  a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court  s  PO HREOC Act   Significantly  the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination  including payment of damages by the respondent  employment or re employment an applicant  an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case  s  PO  HREOC Act   Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct  and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct  personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct  To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East  ex parte Nguyen   CLR at   repeated in Western Australia v Ward   HCA         CLR   at     The elaborate and special scheme   was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention     might obtain a remedy  and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia s treaty obligations  bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the  legislation  was to operate    That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments  and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes  does not in any way minimise their relevance  As observed  in my view correctly  by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia   FCA   at       and     they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists  citedWool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Further  it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law  Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee   HCA         CLR   per Knox CJ at     Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders   VR   at   SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd   VR   at   Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot   VR   at   Australian Conservation Foundation   CLR at       Re East  ex parte Nguyen   HCA         CLR    As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation   CLR at   referring to s   Trade Practices Act    Cth    statutes may of course confer standing in express terms   they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial  Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke  it is  perhaps  preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute  rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking  in accordance with Boyce s Case  for the existence of special damage   cf Gibbs J at
