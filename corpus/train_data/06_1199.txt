austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn these proceedings I found the applicant has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent was guilty on four charges of contempt in my judgment in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA    Today I have heard evidence from the respondent both on affidavit and in the witness box relating to the circumstances in which the contempts occurred and his current attitude in relation to the subject matter of those charges  The applicant accepts that the respondent is now complying with the orders made by Wilcox J on   December   and as I understand he has complied since at least I gave judgment on   May    Although the applicant has filed an affidavit of Ms Than on   May   which refers to a Mr Dennis Henry Monamy  owning some property  the respondent is Dennis Alfred Monamy and no suggestion was made when the respondent was being cross examined that he was the owner of any property  In his evidence the respondent has deposed to commencing work in around   as a contractor with the applicant installing floor coverings on a regular basis  That relationship ended in around   when he was unable to agree on further terms with the applicant  He said he began trading under the business name Simply Natural Floorcoverings in around   and created a web site for that purpose  During the middle of   the applicant and the respondent began a series of communications that ultimately led to the litigation and mediation in this court resulting in the orders made by Wilcox J on   December    The question then arises as to what fine I ought impose on each of the counts that I have found proved and for which I have convicted the respondent  Charge   involved the use of the business name Simply Natural Floorcoverings with  floorcoverings  as one word on the web site for a period that commenced at least on   January   and continued at least to   March   as I found in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA   at   and    I am of opinion that that was conduct which was quite clearly against both the spirit of the heads of agreement and the terms of the consent orders  While I cannot take account of the heads of agreement in imposing penalty  I am entitled to have regard to the fact that the respondent had urged that the orders were ones that he did not believe he needed to obey within any particular time  The fact is that by   March   he had applied to and succeeded in changing his business name to separate the word  floorcoverings  into two separate words  It was plain  in my opinion  that that should have been done a long time before  at least no later than when he was served with a properly endorsed set of orders on   January    I do not think that this contempt has been satisfactorily explained  It is appropriate that the court  in addition to requiring a payment of costs  should impose a penalty by way of a fine  In all the circumstances  I will impose a fine of   for that breach  Charge   involved the use of the HTML meta tag which I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA   at         That conduct was engaged in between at least   March   as I found   FCA   at   and at least no later than   April   which is the date Ms Than refers to in par   of her affidavit of   May   as the date on which the disclaimer was noted by her to appear  The period to which I have regard in imposing the fine in respect of charge   should  I think  reflect most prominently the use of the meta tag in the period between   March   and the date of my finding of guilt on   April   which is a period of almost six weeks  In my opinion  this breach was quite flagrant  as I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No    FCA    It was a deliberate attempt to evade the very clear order requiring an active communication by the respondent of the dissociation of his business from the applicant s  The use of the meta tag was calculated to avoid giving effect at all to the order  It was an attempt to disguise the very thing the order required be revealed  namely  the dissociation of the businesses  I do not accept any explanation that the respondent has sought to give of that behaviour  In the witness box today he asserted that he had put the meta tag there knowing  as he said  that it would not be visible to the ordinary viewer of the webpage but that it might be seen in some web browsers  The reason he gave for putting the disclaimer in a meta tag  was that he thought that that was above the fold referred to in the order  For the reasons that I gave in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA     the use of the words  above the fold  makes no difference to the proper construction of the orders or the flagrancy of the evasion which the use of the meta tag involved  In my opinion  that behaviour was quite contumacious and deliberate  as well as being  clever  in both senses of that word  I think I should mark the court s disapprobation of that conduct by imposing a fine of    In reaching the view which I have expressed  at this stage tentatively  as to the appropriate fines to be imposed I have had regard to the nature and circumstances of each offence as I have outlined already  I have also had regard to the matters referred to  although I may not necessarily be required to do so  in s  A of the Crimes Act    Cth  in relation to sentence  In particular  each of the offences is related to the others and forms part of an ongoing course of conduct which ultimately came to an end with the recognition that the respondent has now given that his conduct was wrong and in breach of the orders referred toNatural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy
