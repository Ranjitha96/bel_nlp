Marijancevic v Mann   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   after referring to ss   and   and to the judgment of Dixon J in R v Hickman  Ex parte Fox and Clinton   HCA         CLR   at   Deane and Gaudron JJ said     That approach should  in our view  be applied to the construction of s   of the Act  The result of its application is that s  s protection from invalidity is applicable only if the purported  assessment   i  is  a bona fide attempt  by the Commissioner or other authorised officer to exercise powers conferred by the Act    ii   relates to the subject matter  of the Act and  iii   is reasonably capable of reference to  those powers  If a purported  assessment  does not satisfy those three requirements  the protection of s   will be unavailable and the purported  assessment  will be invalid  citedBriglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   In Briglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   at   Kenny J said     It follows  from Richard Walter  that uncertainty on the Deputy Commissioner s part as to the facts relevant to the exercise of his power of assessment does not evidence an absence of bona fides in the Hickman sense          If  however  the Deputy Commissioner formed the view that there was no substantial possibility that an amount was part of the assessable income of a taxpayer  then the Commissioner could not bona fide assess that taxpayer as liable to tax in respect of that income   The foregoing description of the audit process shows that once apprised by the Police of the applicant s arrest with   cash in his possession  the Commissioner proceeded in a methodical way to collect information about the applicant s financial affairs in order to determine whether any amounts should be included in his taxable income  As it turned out  two items were wrongly included in that income in the   year  As I have said  the applicant successfully objected to that inclusion  But the fact that the Commissioner later accepted that he had erred in including these amounts does not establish that the assessment that contained them was not a bona fide attempt to assess the applicant s income  The applicant has not persuaded me that the Commissioner knew there was no substantial possibility that the amount he assessed was part of his assessable income  See the passage from Briglia set out at    It may well be that the Commissioner was uncertain as to whether all the amounts he in fact included were truly income of the applicant  but that uncertainty does not show the absence of a bona fide attempt  as is pointed out in Futuris Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   at     Other cases that have found a lack of a bona fide attempt are in marked contrast to the present  In Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   the Full Court said     Not only did the Commissioner not make any genuine attempt to ascertain the sale value of particular goods under each of the relevant Assessment Acts  but he also determined a sale value and purported to create a liability for sales tax upon facts which he knew were wrong          An assessment on facts known by the Commissioner to be untrue is of its nature unfair and oppressive      In the present case the Commissioner did not act upon any facts which he knew to be wrong  It is true that he did not know all the facts but  doing the best he could on the facts he did know  he made assessments  That they did not wholly survive review by the Tribunal does not establish the lack of a bona fide attempt  Madden at   and Briglia at   distinguishedFuturis Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   The foregoing description

is also distinguishable  There the Commissioner knew  at the time he issued the assessment  that the taxpayer s taxable income could be no greater than   million  yet he issued it for a taxable income of   million citedUysal v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ATR  consideredMadden v Madden     FCR   That the Commissioner s use of the garnishee process to prevent the return of the money to the applicant does not demonstrate the absence of a bona fide attempt is supported by the Full Court s decision in Madden v Madden     FCR    In that case the taxpayer was arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply heroin  Thereupon the Commissioner assessed him to income tax on the sale value of the heroin  The sale value had been notified to the Commissioner by the police  The taxpayer s application to have the assessment set aside on the ground that it was not made bona fide was dismissed  Foster J  with whom Sheppard J agreed  said at      The only significant question  in my view  is whether it could be argued that he made no assessment at all  in that he acted in bad faith and for the ulterior purpose of using his powers under s   of the Tax Act to require payment to him of the amount of money held by the police      I interpolate that s   is the predecessor of s      Foster J continued     The material adduced shows that the Commissioner was minded to take possession of this money in circumstances of urgency in that  if swift action were not taken  the money would pass from the possession of the police and would  in all probability  become irrecoverable  It may be said  then  that evidence has been adduced showing that the Commissioner was motivated  in raising the assessment  by a desire to take possession of the money          As I see it  the appellant s contention amounts really to this  He alleges that the assessment was invalid because it was issued by the Commissioner in abuse of his power to assess under s   in that it was not a bona fide attempt to assess the amount upon which tax should be levied but was a mere device to enable the issue of the s   notice          In the first place  I am unable to attribute any significance to the fact that the assessment was issued in conjunction with and motivated by a desire to take advantage of s    There is sufficient indication of urgency in the situation to warrant the steps that were taken  In my opinion  the s   connection is a purely neutral fact in the determination of whether the assessment itself was invalid   Other cases that have found a lack of a bona fide attempt are in marked contrast to the present  In Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   the Full Court said     Not only did the Commissioner not make any genuine attempt to

FCR   His Honour went on at   to say that the Commissioner had available to him positive information as to the value of the heroin dealing undertaken by the taxpayer in the relevant income year  It was a substantial sum  and was adequate to provide a foundation for a default assessment in the circumstance in which the assessment needed to be issued  He concluded that conformably with the principles in R v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  WA  Ex parte Briggs     FCR   the Commissioner was entitled to use the figure provided as a basis for the assessment  It  could well be erroneous  but it was nevertheless bona fide    I do not attribute any significance to the sending of the garnishee notice to the applicant s former address  I do not accept the applicant s contention that the person who sent the copy notice to the wrong address did so in order that the applicant would not know it had been served on the Police  Mr Saunders  who knew of the changed address  was on leave at the crucial time  and the officer who acted in his absence was probably unaware of the change citedJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant
