Maxwell Smith v S   E Hall Pty Limited  in the matterof Maxwell Smith   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toMaxwell Smith v S   E Hall  in the matter of Maxwell Smith   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   September   a Registrar of the Federal Court made sequestration orders against Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith  The debt which gave rise to the orders was the certificate of assessment of the costs order made by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on   December    However  on   July   Moore J annulled the bankruptcies of Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith under s  B of the Act   see Maxwell Smith v S   E Hall  in the matter of Maxwell Smith   FCA    His Honour was satisfied that the sequestration orders ought not to have been made  on the basis of an  unwitting  denial of procedural fairness before the Registrar  see     Moore J observed at   that the annulment application was not made upon the basis that Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith were solvent when the orders were made  Nevertheless  his Honour recorded an acknowledgment of counsel for the Trustee that  probably  Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith were solvent when the sequestration orders were made  His Honour also noted that counsel for S   E Hall did not dispute this proposition   Moore J went on to say that there was insufficient evidence before him to make a positive finding that Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith were solvent  But he said that they may well be solvent  and may well have been when the sequestration orders were made  see at    He took this into account in the exercise of his discretion to make the annulment order   In evidence before me is a letter dated   August   from solicitors for S   E Hall to the solicitors then acting for Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith setting out an offer to settle various disputes between the parties  The letter was written  without prejudice   However  counsel for S   E Hall objected to the document only upon the grounds of relevance and hearsay  He did not object to it on the ground that it was not to be adduced under s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   I admitted the letter  along with a number of other exhibits to Mrs Maxwell Smith s Affidavit filed on   June   into evidence but not as proof of the facts   The letter contained the following statement       We note that apparently your clients have instructed their counsel that they have no financial capacity to meet any verdict  This is clearly nonsense  As you are doubtless aware  your clients own an unencumbered property in Tura Beach NSW valued at conservatively      They also own a   interest in the property at Jindabyne   The asserted claim for   for damages caused by the creditor s  misuse  of the Act since September   is apparently a claim in respect of the sequestration order made on   September   which was subsequently annulled by Moore J   What was required in order to establish that the claim had substance was some evidence to suggest that the   bankruptcy was obtained for a purpose or object beyond that which was offered by the legal process  The observations of Moore J on the annulment of the bankruptcy do not support such a claim  Nor is there any evidence which would give rise to that suggestion   The same may be said of the second claim which is asserted  namely the administration costs of the  unlawful  bankruptcy arising from the sequestration order of September     There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the third claim  namely the  unlawful  execution of the garnishee order has any substance   Second  the observations made by Moore J in July   make it plain that S   E Hall was aware at that time of the probability that Mrs Maxwell Smith was solvent   Third  the letter from S   E Hall s solicitors states in unequivocal terms that Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith owned assets the value of which greatly exceeded their debts  In my view it is clear from this letter that S   E Hall was aware of Mrs Maxwell Smith s ability to meet her liabilities in August     It seems to me that what was required of S   E Hall was some evidence to dispel the natural inference arising from lengthy delay and knowledge of solvency  that the bankruptcy notice was issued for a purpose collateral to that of pursuit of insolvency proceedings  Instead  there was no evidence from S   E Hall explaining the delay or demonstrating that Mrs Maxwell Smith s financial position had deteriorated since   citedRe Brink  Ex parte Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited     FLR   This question is to be

state of satisfaction required by s  g  and s   involves a weighing of the considerations as to the legal and factual merits of the claim relied upon by the debtor and the justice of permitting the bankruptcy proceedings to go ahead or requiring those proceedings to await the determination of the claim  Guss v Johnstone     ALR   at   citedRe Glew  Glew v Harrowell of Hunt and Hunt Lawyers     ALR   The debtor must satisfy the Court by evidence that there is sufficient substance to the claim to make it one which the debtor ought  in justice  be permitted to have heard and determined rather than be forced to comply with the bankruptcy notice by payment  or to commit an act of bankruptcy  see Re Glew  Glew v Harrowell of Hunt and Hunt Lawyers     ALR   at   see also the summary of authorities set out by Lindgren J at       Each of the cross claims asserted by Mr and Mrs Maxwell Smith arises out of facts which post date the High Court s costs order  It would therefore seem that  as a matter of law  the claims could not have been set up in the proceeding in which the judgment was obtained   Nevertheless  I am not satisfied that any of the cross claims has any legal or factual merit  The claims do not therefore have sufficient substance to warrant their determination rather than to force compliance with the bankruptcy notice  if I am otherwise satisfied of the validity of the notice   It is true that the debtor need not adduce admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case at a final hearing  but the Court must be satisfied by evidence that the claim has a reasonable prospect of success  Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Limited   HCA         CLR   at   see also Re Glew at   citedEbert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Limited   HCA         CLR  http

if a creditor genuinely intends to pursue the matter if there is default in complying with the notice and there is no evidence of collateral purpose or undue pressure  Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors   FCA   at       In my view  it is to be inferred from the factual matrix set out above that S   E Hall s purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on Mrs Maxwell Smith to pay the debt rather than to genuinely invoke the Court s bankruptcy jurisdiction  This inference arises from the following citedEllis v Wallsend District Hospital     NSWLR   In those circumstances

to see whether there is in truth a debt due to the petitioning creditor  Corney v Brien   HCA         CLR   at     However  here there was nothing put before me to enliven the exercise of the discretion to go behind the debt  Indeed  it is plain that there is no reason to go behind the judgment   The judgment debt arose from the costs order of the High Court  Mrs Maxwell Smith appeared  in person with her husband  to seek special leave  She was named as a party to the special leave application  That is sufficient to meet any suggestion that her failure to sign the building contract avoids liability for the costs order
