Manager Appointed      FCR  A prima facie case is made out if  on the material before the court  inferences are open which  if translated into findings of fact  would support the relief claimed  per French J  as his Honour then was  in State of Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd  In liq   Receiver and Manager Appointed      FCR   at   referred toMerpro Montassa Limited v Conoco Speciality Products Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe matter stipulated in respect of which the court is to be satisfied does not call for the kind of scrutiny that would occur in a submission of  no case to answer  following the closure of an applicant s case at trial  A court may  when confronted with an application for leave  draw inferences more readily in favour of an applicant  bearing in mind  amongst other things  that the applicant will not have had the advantage of discovery  subpoenas and other procedural aids to the making out of a prima facie case at trial  per Heerey J in Merpro Montassa Limited v Conoco Speciality Products Inc   FCA         FCR   at   referred toWSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn relation to satisfying the court that an applicant has a prima facie case for the relief claimed by it  such a preliminary question should not call for a substantial inquiry  The kind of evidence adduced on a preliminary inquiry of this kind should be in proportion to the nature of such an interlocutory issue  The purpose of the inquiry is to determine by way of a mini rather than a mega trial whether the applicant has a prima facie case  per Beaumont J in WSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR   at    Whatever is required to satisfy the court that there is a prima facie case  that satisfaction should leave open the possibility that the respondent could move to strike out the statement of claim or invoke s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   Federal Court Act  which makes provision for orders for  amongst other things  summary dismissal or provisions of the Rules which provide for the summary disposition of proceedings  To do otherwise may be setting too high a threshold for service out of the jurisdiction citedCell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones  UK  Ltd     FCR  Except in extreme cases  Order   rule  c  will not require a prima facie case in respect of each cause of action pleaded or contended for  If a prima facie case for a particular form of relief is made out on one cause of action  it is immaterial that a prima facie case for the same relief on another cause of action may not be made out  per Lindgren J in Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones  UK  Ltd     FCR    Cell Tech  at   see also per Carr J in Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd     FCR    Bray  at     and per Branson J at      In Cell Tech a joint venture business had failed  Cell Tech s application was accompanied by a statement of claim seeking damages  Three causes of action were relevantly pleaded  two of which were against Nokia  As against Nokia  Cell Tech pleaded that it breached implied terms and conditions as to fitness for purpose and merchantable quality in respect of goods which it sold to Cell Tech  The other cause of action pleaded against Nokia was that it breached the terms and conditions of a Licence Agreement between Cell Tech and Nokia   Lindgren J observed that there was a significant overlap between the facts on which the two causes of action were based  His Honour proceeded on the basis that          if a prima facie case against Nokia for damages based on either cause of action is established it becomes unnecessary     to decide whether a prima facie case for the same relief based upon the other cause of action  was  also made out            at page        Lindgren J held that Nokia s claim for relief under Order   rule  a   b   c  and  d  should be dismissed    Conclusions Contrary to Fujitsu Limited s submission  Lindgren J did not hold that a court could not be satisfied in respect of the matter covered by Order   rule  c  of the Federal Court Rules unless the applicant satisfied the court that it had a prima facie case for  the relief claimed by it  in the sense of each and every element of the relief claimed  Apart from other considerations such a construction would be absurd  How  one might task  could a prima facie case for relief which is at the discretion of the court under s   of the Trade Practices Act or under s  A of the Federal Court Act or for costs  be the subject of the requisite satisfaction referred toBray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd     FCR  Except in extreme cases  Order   rule  c  will not require a prima facie case in respect of each cause of action pleaded or contended for  If a prima facie case for a particular form of relief is made out on one cause of action  it is immaterial that a prima facie case for the same relief on another cause of action may not be made out  per Lindgren J in Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones  UK  Ltd     FCR    Cell Tech  at   see also per Carr J in Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd     FCR    Bray  at     and per Branson J at      Ho v Akai Pty Limited  in liquidation    FCAFC         ACLC    Ho  was an appeal from a judgment of Gyles J given under Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules   The only issue before Gyles J was whether Akai Holdings and its liquidator had established a prima facie case for the relief sought in the proceeding against Mr Ho which satisfied Order   rule  c  or its predecessor  Questions arose as to whether Mr Ho had a liability as a  shadow director  and also whether he had a liability as an  officer  of Akai Australia  Gyles J concluded that there was no sufficient basis for raising an arguable case that Mr Ho was a shadow director  but that there was an arguable case that he was an  officer  of Akai Australia  Because of the construction given to Order   rule  c  or its predecessor in Bray   the finding that there was a prima facie case that Ho was an officer of Akai had the consequence that he could be proceeded against on both the  officer  and  shadow director  bases  Gyles J having held that a prima facie case had been made out  for the relief sought   In Ho Finn  Weinberg and Rares JJ granted leave to appeal from the judgment of Gyles J but proceeded to dismiss each appeal  At   their Honours observed  by way of obiter dicta  that           A ccording to Bray   it is not the similarity in elements of the cause of action that is brought into question for O   r  c  purposes  Rather it is similarity in the relief sought  Finn  Weinberg and Rares JJ considered that the difference between the two types of claim for relief in insolvent trading cases did not reflect in substance merely a choice as to two different measures of compensation  They observed that the two species of relief served different purposes  had different statutorily prescribed measures and were required to be specified individually in an application  including an application served out of the jurisdiction  In those circumstances their Honours opined that relief sought under s  H of the Corporations Act    Cth  was not the same as that sought under s  J  or for that matter s  M   In addition  they described s  H as a general provision but s  J  or s  M  as a specific provision creating a remedy in a particular situation  They observed that the ordinary principle of statutory construction was that in cases in which ss  J or  M provided a remedy  s  H   being a general provision  would not apply  In the circumstances  Finn  Weinberg and Rares JJ doubted the correctness of Gyles J s conclusion that the principle in Bray s case would save the shadow director claim against Mr Ho from being struck out  The observations so made were qualified by their Honours saying at        However  because of the different conclusion we have reached in that claim to that of Gyles J  the views we have expressed above on the application of Bray have no actual consequence  In my opinion Ho is not authority for the proposition that satisfaction under Order   rule   cannot be reached unless an applicant has a prima facie case for each and every item of relief claimed in the proceeding  If  at an interlocutory stage  a prima facie case is made out for trade practices relief  it matters not whether that relief is ordered under s   or   of the Trade Practices Act or s   or s   of the Fair Trading Act   They provide choices in respect of the same conduct  In relation to claims for relief under s   of the Trade Practices Act and or s   of the Fair Trading Act no greater specificity is required than is contained in the applicant s prayer for relief numbered   in its Amended Application  The present case is not one where discrete relief is applicable for a particular contravention of one provision of the relevant legislation and different relief is applicable where there is a contravention of a different provision in the same legislation  The first respondent s further submission that the applicant s claims for relief under the Trade Practices Act and or the Fair Trading Act  NSW  ought not to be permitted  since the entirety of the wrongful conduct on its behalf  assuming it to be wrongful  occurred outside Australia  should be rejected  The concession made by Fujitsu Limited that the brochure published and printed in English in the United States of America was made available for distribution in Australia by it and that it was involved in the use in Australia of that promotional material  coupled with Fujitsu Limited s provision to making available of copies of the brochure in English printed by it in Japan  to Fujitsu Australia Limited  which disclosed that Fujitsu Australia Limited was Fujitsu Limited s  local representative  is quite inconsistent with the first respondent s submission consideredHo v Akai Pty Limited  in liquidation    FCAFC         ACLC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlHo v Akai Pty Limited  in

Pty Ltd v Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlContrary to the first respondent s submissions  Hunter Grain Pty Ltd v Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd   FCA         ALR    Hunter Grain  does not support the first respondent s position  Hunter Grain was a decision of Sheppard J in a matter in which the Court had jurisdiction under the Admiralty Act    Cth   There were two defendants  the second being a company identified by the abbreviation  Malaysian  and the first was Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd  Hyundai   The second defendant owned the ship known as the  Bunga Kenanga  and the first defendant was the charterer of that ship  The ship was also the subject of a voyage charter made between the first defendant and PS International Ltd of Indiana in the United States of America  The case concerned the shipment of   tonnes of soyabean meal in bulk from Portland  Oregon  in the United States  to Brisbane  When the soyabean meal was loaded on to the ship it became contaminated by the introduction of a substantial quantity of soda ash  sodium carbonate  into the hold  The problem arose because there was a residue of soda ash in the loading equipment used to load the ship   The shipper  PS International Ltd  was the vendor of the soyabean meal    A clean bill of lading was signed by a person designated at  Authorised Rep of Carrier or Master   Under the heading  Consignee  were typed the words  To Shippers Order   The plaintiff  Hunter Grain Pty Limited  was the party to be notified of the arrival of the ship  The bill of lading was endorsed to the plaintiff  Accordingly  it had transferred to it and vested in it all rights of action in respect of the goods as if the contract contained in the bill of lading had been made with it  Sheppard J held that the trade practices cause of action must fail because relevantly  the conduct of the first defendant and its agent concluded when the  Authorised Rep of Carrier or Master  signed the bill of lading on behalf of the first defendant and sent it to the vendor  PS International Limited s forwarding agents in the United States   The conduct said to be misleading or deceptive of which the plaintiff complained  so far as it concerned each of the defendants  was undertaken entirely in the United States  PS International Ltd was not a defendant  Whilst it was open to the Court to impute to Hyundai knowledge that the bill of lading would be used by the shipper to obtain payment for the cargo and Hyundai s employees and agents knew that it was important that the bill contain a clean receipt  otherwise the bank would not pay under the letter of credit  Sheppard J held that the relevant wrongful act in relation to the bill of lading was committed by PS International Ltd when it proffered the bill of lading to the plaintiff and its bank  which events did occur in Australia  The present case is not one where the entirety of Fujitsu Limited s wrongful conduct  assuming it to be wrongful  occurred in Japan or other places in the world outside Australia  It was in Australia that Fujitsu Limited made its brochures  whether printed in the United States of America or Japan  available for proliferation amongst potential purchasers of Fujitsu MPG  hard disk drives  The final submission of the first respondent was to the effect that conduct engaged in by Mr Rixon in providing brochures about Fujitsu MPG  hard disk drives and the making of representations in relation to them could not be said to be conduct engaged in on behalf of Fujitsu Limited  Even if this were correct  it would not assist the first respondent given that it made the brochures about Fujitsu MPG  hard disk drives available in Australia to Fujitsu Australia Limited for proliferation amongst potential purchasers of its MPG  hard disk drives referred toNMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn any event  I would respectfully adopt the view expressed by Lindgren J in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   which accorded with the view taken by Kiefel J in Lisciandro v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA       ATPR     at      Lindgren J s view was that an act is done  on behalf of  a corporation for the purpose of s   of the Trade Practices Act if  relevantly  the actor engaged in the conduct intending to do so  for  the corporation  In this case it could be said that Mr Rixon handed over brochures provided by Fujitsu Limited to the applicant  for  Fujitsu Limited  whose brochures they were  even though he was himself an employee of Fujitsu Australia Limited  Why else  one might ask  would Fujitsu Limited have made the brochures available in Australia if not to assist in promotion of the sale of its MPG  hard disk drives   It would seem to me that  on an interlocutory basis  it could be said that Mr Rixon s conduct was conduct engaged in with  at least  the implied consent of the director  servant or agent of Fujitsu Limited responsible for the promotion of the sale of Fujitsu MPG  hard disk drives in Australia  sufficient to constitute Mr
