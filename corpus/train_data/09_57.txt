Cricket Association Inc   Ors   FCA         ATPR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe general principle as to costs was expressed by Toohey J in Hughes v West Australian Cricket

litigating that portion upon which he has failed  Forster v Farquhar     QB     A successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other party s costs of them  In this sense   issue  does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or of law  Cretazzo v

Council   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlObservations by McHugh J in Oshlack v Richmond River Council   HCA         CLR   at       are directly relevant  By far the most important factor which courts have viewed as guiding the exercise of the costs discretion is the result of the litigation  A successful litigant is generally entitled to an award of costs  As Devlin J said in Smeaton Hanscomb   Co Ltd v Sassoon I Setty  Son   Co  No       WLR   at       All ER   at   when setting aside an arbitrator s costs award     the arbitrator is not directing his mind to one of the most  if not the most  important of the elements which ought to affect his discretion  namely the result of the case  Prima facie  a successful party is entitled to his costs  To deprive him of his costs or to require him to pay a part of the costs of the other side is an exceptional measure       The combined force of the sentiments recognised above by Mason CJ  regarding the need for consistency in order to avoid injustice  and by Devlin J  regarding the most significant factor affecting the costs discretion  provides the jurisprudential basis for the important principle commonly referred to as the  usual order as to costs       The usual order as to costs   The expression the  usual order as to costs  embodies the important principle that  subject to certain limited exceptions  a successful party in litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour  The principle is grounded in reasons of fairness and policy and operates whether the successful party is the plaintiff or the defendant  Costs are not awarded to punish an unsuccessful party  The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify the successful party   Latoudis   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  at     per Toohey J  at     per McHugh J  Cachia v Hanes   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson and McHugh JJ   If the litigation had not been brought  or defended  by the unsuccessful party the successful party would not have incurred the expense which it did  As between the parties  fairness dictates that the unsuccessful party typically bears the liability for the costs of the unsuccessful litigation   As a matter of policy  one beneficial by product of this compensatory purpose may well be to instil in a party contemplating commencing  or defending  litigation a sober realisation of the potential financial expense involved  Large scale disregard of the principle of the usual order as to costs would inevitably lead to an increase in litigation with an increased  and often unnecessary  burden on the scarce resources of the publicly funded system of justice   The traditional exceptions to the usual order as to costs focus on the conduct of the successful party which disentitles it to the beneficial exercise of the discretion  In Anglo Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd     All ER   at   Devlin J formulated the relevant principle as follows   No doubt  the ordinary rule is that  where a plaintiff has been successful  he ought not to be deprived of his costs  or  at any rate  made to pay the costs of the other side  unless he has been guilty of some sort of misconduct        Misconduct  in this context means misconduct relating to the litigation   King   Co v Gillard   Co     Ch   Donald Campbell   Co Ltd v Pollak   AC   at   or the circumstances leading up to the litigation   Bostock v Ramsey Urban District Council     QB    Thus  the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation   Jones v McKie     WLR       All ER     Bostock     QB   at       unnecessarily protracts the proceedings   Forbes v Samuel     KB     succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court   Armstrong v Boulton   VR   at   prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable   Hobbs v Marlowe   AC     or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute   Jenkins v Hope     Ch      Apart from anomalous examples in the equity jurisdiction  These anomalies typically feature a trust fund or property which will readily satisfy benevolent costs orders  Such examples were recognised by O   of the   Rules which  after stating that costs shall be in the discretion of the Court  declared that  nothing herein contained shall deprive a trustee  mortgagee  or other person of any right to costs out of a particular estate or fund to which he would be entitled according to the rules hitherto acted upon in Courts of Equity  there are very few  if any  exceptions to the usual order as to costs outside the area of disentitling conduct consideredRuddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR  The applicant refers to the observations of the Full Court in Ruddock v Vadarlis  No       FCR   at     where the Full Court recognised that the ordinary rule is that the successful party gets its costs  but    Where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim  the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed  The applicant contends in the present matter that        having regard to the time spent and the issues on which the Respondent failed  it is submitted that an award in its favour of   of its party party costs in the proceeding gives adequate recognition of the fact that it succeeded in the overall case  but failed in most of the arguments that it advanced  In my judgment  the usual order as to costs should be made in this case  The fact that the respondents succeeded on one only of the many grounds of invalidity they asserted is not in my view  in the circumstances of this case   misconduct  such as to require a departure from the ordinary rule  Nor is the respondents  unsuccessful claim of non infringement  As a matter of fact  the respondents  challenge based on lack of novelty was at the forefront of its defence  and  in my assessment  was the central issue joined on the question of validity  Pursuant to s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  on the whole of the material in these proceedings  I order that the applicant pay the respondents costs of and incidental to the proceedings  to be taxed if not agreed
