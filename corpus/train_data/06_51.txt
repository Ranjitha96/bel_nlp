Soufflet Beheer v AWB Ltd  ACN         FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedPepsi Seven Up Bottlers Perth Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   Considering this evidence  I am not satisfied that  Vessel s Final Accounts  or  Final Accounts  are used exclusively  or even customarily  as terms of art  In light of this  I find that the expert evidence provides no special guidance to constructing the documents at issue in this case  see  e g   Pepsi Seven Up Bottlers Perth Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at     per Hill J  Accordingly  I sustain the applicant s objection to Mr Swales s evidence and will exclude all of the expert testimony concerning the meaning of  Vessel s Final Accounts  or  Final Accounts    The applicant contends that the exchange of   August   gave rise to a binding contract to compromise  for an amount of USD    being Soufflet USA s claim for losses arising out of the delay in berthing and loading of the Panamax Star  In the applicant s submission  AWB s fax of that day is an offer and Soufflet N goce s immediate reply is an acceptance citedPacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas     Pacific Carriers     HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant contends that Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas     Pacific Carriers     HCA       CLR   articulates the approach the Court should take in this case  In Pacific Carriers   letters of indemnity were provided by the seller of a cargo of lentils to facilitate the delivery of the cargo without the production of a bill of lading  The letters were executed by both the seller and its bank  The High Court held that  considering all the surrounding circumstances  a  reasonable reader in the position of  the buyer  would have understood the document as a bank endorsed absent bills of lading indemnity  and would have understood that the bank was undertaking liability as an indemnifying party to support the liability undertaken by  the seller  Pacific Carriers at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ   In reaching this conclusion  the High Court emphasised that what is important is not the subjective intention of the author of a commercial document such as a letter of indemnity  Rather   construction     is to be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of  the buyer  would have understood them to mean  Pacific Carriers at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ  This will require consideration of the surrounding circumstances of the transaction known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction  as well as the text of the relevant documents   The applicant submitted that  when the text of AWB s fax of   August   is considered in light of the surrounding circumstances  a reasonable reader would understand it to be an offer to compromise all the claims made by Soufflet USA  Moreover  under Pacific Carriers   the subjective intent of the author of the fax  Mr Welmillage  is irrelevant to its meaning and legal effect   The applicant claims that a number of factors support its view  These allegedly include   a  In letters dated   and   March   Soufflet N goce expressly informed AWB that Soufflet USA intended to hold AWB liable for costs incurred as result of the delay in loading the vessel    b  Further notice of Soufflet USA claims was provided on   March   when Soufflet USA deducted its delay related costs from its first payment to AWB    c  Soufflet USA then acquiesced to AWB s request that delay related claims be treated as a  separate issue     d  Thereafter  consistent with the course proposed by AWB  Soufflet USA submitted its claim for delay on   June    The covering letter clearly referred to both the costs caused by delay and the freight balance  In particular  the applicant contended   The evident purpose and object of the   June   letter was to seek to finalise matters between AWB and Soufflet USA with respect to the charter of the Panamax Star      e  AWB said nothing  before the letter of   June   and  indeed  prior to   September   to indicate that it would dispute Soufflet USA s entitlement to recover from AWB the losses caused by the delay     f  As AWB s response letter of   August   addresses itself to the  Soufflet USA claim  a reasonable reader would assume that AWB was addressing the claim for USD    in respect of the delay  and the freight balance    g  AWB s letter then states  and  AWB  would only disagree with the load port despatch calculation  indicating that AWB disputed only the load port despatch calculation    h  AWB s letter concludes with the request to Soufflet USA to  go through and confirm your concurrance  sic  for us to proceed with the balance settlements of this Vessel account  indicating to the reasonable reader that an agreement will be reached if Soufflet USA concurs with AWB s load port despatch calculation   The applicant also claimed that there are important omissions from AWB s letter of   August    In particular  the applicant noted that the letter does not say that AWB was only responding to part of the claim made in the   June   letter  Similarly  it did not say that AWB disputed the claim for delay related costs and did not foreshadow any future correspondence from AWB regarding that matter citedMcDermott v Black   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As already indicated  AWB argued that the applicant s submissions suffered from a fundamental flaw  This flaw is that its fax of   August   presents no consideration that could underlie an offer of accord and satisfaction  AWB cited McDermott v Black   HCA         CLR   at     per Dixon J  with whom Rich and McTiernan JJ agreed  for a classic statement of the law concerning accord and satisfaction    The essence of accord and satisfaction is the acceptance by the plaintiff of something in place of his cause of action  What he takes is a matter depending on his own consent or agreement  It may be a promise or contract or it may be the act or thing promised  But  whatever it is  until it is provided and accepted the cause of action remains alive and unimpaired  The accord is the agreement or consent to accept the satisfaction  Until the satisfaction is given the accord remains executory and cannot bar the claim  The distinction between an accord executory and an accord and satisfaction remains as valid and as important as ever  An accord executory neither extinguishes the old cause of action nor affords a new one      An executory promise or series of promises given in consideration of the abandonment of the claim may be accepted in substitution or satisfaction of the existing liability  Or  on the other hand  promises may be given by the party liable that he will satisfy the claim by doing an act  making over a thing or paying an ascertained sum of money and the other party may agree to accept  not the promise  but the act  thing or money in satisfaction of his claim  If the agreement is to accept the promise in satisfaction  the discharge of the liability is immediate  if the performance  then there is no discharge unless and until the promise is performed     Applying these principles  for there to have been an immediate accord and satisfaction  AWB must have offered a promise in place of Soufflet USA s cause of action  In AWB s submission  its fax cannot be construed as an offer of a promise because it merely discusses calculations under a pre existing contract   During argument  AWB elucidated this point with the following example  Suppose a barrister agrees to charge   per hour  Subsequently  the barrister sends her instructing solicitor a   account stating that she worked for   hours  The solicitor might reply  I calculate that   hours should be    At that point  suppose the barrister says  I accept your offer of    In AWB s submission  no contract would have been formed  The solicitor s communication was simply an inquiry about what was properly owed under the contract  If the solicitor were to later discover that the barrister had not worked   hours as claimed  but   he could hardly be bound by an earlier  offer  to pay     In summary  the solicitor was not offering to accept the barrister s claim in exchange for a   reduction in the account  rather the solicitor was trying to establish what his true obligation was under the pre existing contract  Similarly  in AWB s submission  AWB was not offering to accept Soufflet USA s damages claim in exchange for a reduction in the freight balance  Rather  AWB was simply disagreeing with Soufflet N goce s calculation of the freight balance  There was no offer of compromise regarding the freight balance because AWB was only offering to pay what it claimed was the correct amount  AWB submitted that these considerations undermine any claim that AWB was requesting a reduction in the freight balance as consideration for it accepting the damages claim citedOsborn v McDermott   VSCA         VR  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  html  Before analysing the key documents  it will be helpful to review the distinction between accord and satisfaction and accord executory  Phillips JA  with whom Winneke P and Charles JA agreed  provides an excellent outline of the relevant principles in Osborn v McDermott   VSCA         VR     Osborn    As Phillips JA explains  the fundamental distinction between accord executory and accord and satisfaction is that  the former does not operate to discharge existing rights and duties unless and until the accord is performed  whereas the latter operates as a discharge immediately the accord  or agreement  is achieved  Osborn at      Accord and satisfaction is the compromise of an existing cause of action in return for a promise while accord executory requires that something be done before the cause of action is compromised   Somewhere between accord and satisfaction and accord executory  is the accord and conditional satisfaction  which exists where the compromise amounts to an existing and enforceable agreement between the parties for performance according to its tenor but which does not operate to discharge any existing cause of action unless and until there has been performance  Osborn at    Accord and conditional satisfaction would be reached if a creditor agreed to forebear from suit for   days and to discharge the cause of action if the debtor paid a compromise amount within that time  see Bartlett v Mouncey
