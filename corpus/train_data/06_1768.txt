cth federal ct  html  The ticket gave a right of admission to a Big Day Out   festival  subject to the conditions of entry  Obviously  new condition   forms part of the conditions of entry  because it is directed to the right to enter of a holder of a cancelled ticket  The wording of new condition   is capable of being construed  as Hill and Finkelstein JJ said of a similar condition in Hospitality

delimitation of the licence granted by the ticket so that a failure to comply with it extinguishes the licence     Hill and Finkelstein JJ found that contract there involved a promise in the form of a condition of the contract by the original purchaser not to resell the ticket at a premium   Hospitality   FCR at         The language of new condition   is quite different to that of the condition considered by the Full Court  I am of opinion that it is a delimitation of the licence  This is because it provides  in imperative language  that the ticket will be cancelled if the proscribed event occurs  The contractual intention is that the licence which presentation of the ticket at the door or place of entry into the Big Day Out   festival would be given ordinarily will not be available if

the unlimited scope of its power to refuse entry under condition of entry   were correct  then the arrangement entered into between Creative and a  purchaser  could not  in law  amount to a contract because there was no consideration at all  eBay said that this would show that Creative was free to perform or not without having any liability or obligation if it refused entry for no reason whatsoever  referring to MacRobertson   HCA       CLR    eBay argued that  on this premise  there was no contract unless and until the ticket was presented for entry to the venue and Creative acted on the presentation to admit the presenter to the event  At that point a contract was entered into on the analysis above for the admission into the venue and for the governing of the relationship between the relevant ticket holder and Creative while the event was in progress  It is unnecessary to determine the correctness of these contentions  I am of opinion that the existence of the numerous potential contractual relationships between Creative and its purchasers overlaid with the uncertainty as to the application and operation of new or old condition   in the circumstances I have described demonstrates that by seeking to claim that new condition   is enforceable  Creative has engaged in conduct which is  or is likely to be misleading and deceptive conduct towards members of the public  Moreover  for the reasons I have given new condition   conveys a representation that falsely asserts that tickets resold for profit will invariably be cancelled   I am of opinion that eBay

at   per Barwick CJ and Taylor J  see too at   per Windeyer J   In Fay   CLR at   Brennan J  with whom Gaudron J agreed on this contractual issue at   CLR at   considered arrangements which had been made for passengers to pay the fare in Australia for a cruise in Grecian waters  They received an exchange order in Australia that would be handed over in Greece for the actual ticket  The exchange order was expressed in contractual language and reserved to the carrier the right to cancel any cruise  Brennan J considered that the contract was made when the fare was paid and that nothing in the wording of the ticket could affect the terms of the antecedent contract   CLR at    As he said  if no contract came into existence until the ticket was issued and accepted in Greece  there would be no consideration to support the carrier s right asserted in the exchange order to refuse to refund the passage money if the passenger cancelled  Brennan J referred to the consequence of forfeiture of the fare as a reason to find that   CLR at      The better analysis of the transaction is that the defendant was bound to issue a ticket in exchange for the exchange order in performance of a contract of carriage already made  but the defendant was given no right to introduce new conditions of carriage by printing them on the ticket  The payment of the fare may rightly be regarded as the price of an option to acquire a ticket  but the option was not to acquire a mere piece of paper  It was an option to acquire a voucher or certificate of entitlement to be carried on terms already agreed    not on terms which the parties had yet to agree on      It was too late after the original contract was made to add conditions which were not incorporated in it   And Wilson and Toohey JJ  with whom Deane J agreed on this issue at   CLR at   said   CLR at      If a contract of carriage was not concluded before the respondent left Australia then it must follow that  notwithstanding that the entire passage money had been paid and that a particular cabin on a particular vessel had been allocated to him for a specified cruise and that although nothing remained for him to do except to present himself in Athens with the exchange order  the appellant came under no obligation to carry him until he did so  Such a construction of the circumstances flies in the face of common sense and cannot be accepted  When he left Australia the respondent had a contractual right to receive from the appellant on presentation of the exchange order in Athens a passage ticket which enabled him to board the vessel and occupy the specified cabin for the duration of the cruise subject only to such conditions as are found to form part of the contract   Here  new condition   imposed  if it were contractual and enforceable  substantial limitations on the ability of an original purchaser or a holder of a ticket in dealing with it  Many online purchasers were given no notice of this  indeed all online purchasers of the Sydney and Gold Coast concerts knew nothing of it  and those purchasing from the Big Day Out website were informed only of old condition   but later received tickets with the new one  It is necessary to look at each of the   methods of sale to appreciate their potentially differing legal consequences   When the purchaser received the ticket  the terms themselves precluded any opportunity to seek a refund  see condition of sale   because he or she was informed that tickets would not be exchanged or replaced  nor money refunded  after purchase   That is  the very transaction which had been confirmed by the series of webpages and the confirmation email generated by a Ticketmaster online transaction  could not be undone if the conditions of sale were part of the transaction  Creative s argument is similar to that rejected by Wilson  Toohey  Brennan and Gaudron JJ in Fay   CLR at        I reject it   Because these conditions were not brought to the attention of the purchaser and were not available to the purchaser  perhaps for more than six weeks after the transaction was effected and the purchaser paid the price  I am of opinion that it is quite unrealistic to regard this ordinary consumer transaction as one in which the purchaser would have been free to return the ticket thereafter and receive a refund  The ordinary reasonable member of the public would be confronted with a representation on the reverse side of the ticket that the contract denied him or her the ability to return the ticket or get a refund on ascertaining that the conditions were unsatisfactory   I am of opinion that condition of sale   is calculated to convey to a person who bought online from Ticketmaster that the transaction was completed online at the time of the webpage transactions  It follows that it did not contain any terms on the ticket  The vague and general reference in Ticketmaster s purchaser policy to terms being on tickets  cannot substitute for the necessity to draw specifically to someone s attention unusual or significant terms affecting the proposed relationship  if it is sought to claim that the contract contains those terms  This is the more so when a term like new condition   is not otherwise available to a purchaser and their attention is not directed to it clearly or  as in this case  at all   Creative argued that the purchaser could somehow return the ticket if  when it was ultimately received  it contained terms that were not to the purchaser s satisfaction  I am of opinion that this is unrealistic  Creative for its own commercial purposes offered facilities to the public for instantaneous online ticket sales including through the Ticketmaster web facility  If Creative wanted to impose a condition of contract in the Ticketmaster online sales such as is in the old or new condition   it had to bring notice of such a condition to the attention of the purchaser online at the time of the purchase   Fay   CLR at         Creative intends to sell over   tickets at   each  thereby generating revenue in the order of about   million  It is not unreasonable to expect it to get its contractual documents  including those online  right if it wants to rely on terms that have strict and perhaps drastic consequences for freedom of contract of purchasers from it   I am of opinion that a reasonable person considering the steps to purchase from Ticketmaster online would have considered them to amount to a contract between the purchaser and Creative  through the agency of Ticketmaster on the terms and conditions that were then and there available online  There was no incorporation by reference of provisions on the ticket   When a purchaser approached a Ticketmaster over the counter office  the employee would begin entering details on a computer behind the counter  A purchaser would have to supply his or her name  work phone number  work address or some other phone number and address for the employee to continue  There were some conditions posted on a notice on the back wall of Ticketmaster offices behind the counter which may have been too small to read  Another notice entitled  Conditions  was available for perusal  That notice stated that Ticketmaster was an agent of the seller and that all complaints were the seller s responsibility  It said that tickets were subject to the seller s conditions of sale  a copy of which is available at the time of collection of the ticket   Here  this must be a reference to the actual provisions printed on the back of the ticket  because it is common ground that Ticketmaster had no other material available at its direct booking offices which set out terms of the contract which Creative proposed to enter with an intending over the counter purchaser citedQuinn Villages Pty Ltd v Mulherin   QCA  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QCA  html  In Quinn Villages Pty Ltd v Mulherin   QCA   at   Cullinane J  with whom McMurdo P and Holmes JA agreed  said that a court would give effect to a clause bringing a contract to an end in the eventualities for which it provides if the language was sufficiently explicit  Nonetheless  he noted that there was a plain disposition to treat such a clause as rendering the contract voidable not void  see also Havenbar Pty Ltd v Butterfield   HCA         CLR   at   per Menzies  Stephen and Jacobs JJ  Here  new condition   is designed to bring about automatic termination because of the breach by the purchaser  Such a breach is not rationally capable of being taken advantage of by the purchaser so as to call for the implication that the innocent party may elect to avoid the contract  because he or she has paid the money  obtained a ticket which is sought to be passed on  and then ceases to have any real interest in the subject matter  Rather  the clause is directed to preventing the purchaser in engaging in that very activity  There is no benefit to the vendor  Creative  in giving it an election in such circumstances as to whether to treat the contract as at an end  The wording of this new condition   suggests that it should operate to avoid tickets automatically  It was not suggested by Creative in argument how the application of the principle that a party is not entitled to rely upon his or her own default  should enliven the construction of new condition   that it be voidable rather than void citedRAIA Insurance Brokers Ltd v FAI General Insurance Ltd     FCR   Creative asserted that the ordinary reasonable person would read new condition   as simply meaning that it would be applied if the purchaser who sought to sell on eBay or otherwise was caught  It may be that  as a matter of practicality  that is how the condition operates  But the threat which new condition   conveys on an ordinary reasonable reading by a member of the public is that the person who sells a ticket having obtained it from Creative  whether by direct purchase or donation or otherwise  will be discovered  RAIA Insurance Brokers Ltd v FAI General Insurance Ltd     FCR   at     per Beaumont and Spender JJ  The implication conveyed by new condition   is quite clear  It is that Creative has the means of detecting a sale  will discover it  and will cancel the relevant ticket  Moreover  that is just what Ms McBeath and Mr Lees did with Ms Row s ticket  without the slightest enquiry as to whether she fell within what Creative s senior counsel later submitted was the proper construction of this condition  I am satisfied that the way in which Creative  through Ms McBeath and Mr Lees  interpreted new condition   is the natural and ordinary meaning of that condition which an ordinary reasonable member of the public would understand  Moreover  it was the construction on which Creative has acted   Here  Creative has purported to use new condition   in a way it says ordinary reasonable members of the public would not understand it to operate  I reject Creative s argument  It is seeking to have its cake and eat it too  By its conduct in choosing the wording and distributing new condition   on the tickets for the Big Day Out   Creative has conveyed  in substance  a representation that Creative is legally entitled to and will detect and cancel any ticket for any Big Day Out   festival which is resold by anyone for profit  And the effect of that conduct is also to convey a representation that the holder of any ticket which is resold for profit will be refused entry to the Big Day Out   festival for which it was issued   Creative accepted  by its  if we catch you  argument  that it could not detect all resales at a profit  Indeed  Ms McBeath s evidence was that Creative could not cancel tickets which had been sold on eBay unless it could identify the ticket number  She said that was      because we can t trace every ticket   It follows that Creative did not have reasonable grounds  to make the representation that every ticket resold for profit would be cancelled citedSuttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Old condition   operated to confer upon Creative an election to avoid a ticket  if it were resold or transferred for profit or commercial gain  The ticket remained valid unless and until Creative acted by making its election  Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Moreover  old condition   indicated that the holder  may be refused entry or rejected  again suggesting that Creative had first to exercise its election before that consequence would be asserted by it   In contrast  new condition   is worded to operate upon the happening of an event  namely a resale for profit  On the occurrence of the event the ticket  will be cancelled and the holder will be refused entry   Creative says that the same contractual principles of construction apply and that the cancellation of the ticket  despite the imperative wording  is not a contractually automatic consequence of the occurrence of the event of resale for profit  That is because the purchaser is not entitled to rely upon his or her own default in adhering to the contractual requirements  but the innocent party  Creative  is entitled to elect whether to keep the contract alive and  if this is the true construction of the contract  it says that there is nothing misleading or deceptive about its use of words in new condition   to convey that meaning   In Suttor   CLR at   Latham CJ  Williams and Fullagar JJ said that where the event in question was one which could not occur without default on the part of one party to the contract  the position was clear     The provision is then construed as making the contract not void but voidable  only the party who is not in default can avoid it  and he may please himself whether he does so or not      The context of the principle which their Honours were discussing was one in which the party in default would be advantaged if termination occurred automatically  The principle to be applied in such a case is that a party should not be entitled to rely upon his or her own default in respect of the occurrence which the contract provides will bring about its end   In the present situation the intention of the parties is that new condition   is to benefit only Creative  The purchaser gains nothing from a termination arising from his or her being in default  Thus the purchaser has no relevant motivation to be in default under new condition   so as to render the ticket void  This is quite different from the situation in  say  a conveyancing contract which provides for the contract to be avoided on happening of an event which one or other party or both can bring about  In such a case the implication of a term which denies to the party in default the facility of engineering the end of his or her contractual obligation is necessary  The innocent party should not be put into the position that the party in default can escape from his or her obligation by breaching  rather than adhering to  the contract   The purchaser of a ticket to Big Day Out   has no relevant obligation the breach of which will benefit him or her in a way that it would be to his or her advantage for an automatic cancellation of the ticket to occur  Quite the contrary  the purchaser wishes no such thing to occur by his or her default  The natural and ordinary meaning of new condition   suggests that the evident purpose of it is to prevent the purchaser selling the ticket for profit on pain of it being cancelled if he or she did  In that context  the purchaser could not rely on his or her own default in making such a sale so as to escape from an obligation under the contract and thereby render that which he or she seeks to resell valueless   In Gange v Sullivan   HCA         CLR   at   Taylor  Menzies and Owen JJ noted that the first step to deciding the question of construction in the case like the present was to understand the condition and its significance to the parties  They continued      Suttor v  Gundowda Pty  Ltd      HCA       CLR   together with other cases  was relied upon to support the conclusion that non fulfilment of

Shoe Lane Parking Ltd     QB   In Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd     QB   at  D  Lord Denning MR gave his well known example of the need for a prominent prompt such as a red hand pointing to an exemption clause  which would draw a purchaser s attention to it  If the Ticketmaster online contract was entered into in writing on the webpages  it is impossible to incorporate the terms on the ticket by reference because the purchasers are told that the ticket would be sent to them some time later  Thus  in the case of the many thousands of people who purchased tickets through Ticketmaster online on   October   for the Sydney concert  the tickets would only be sent to them over six weeks later in circumstances where there was no suggestion on Ticketmaster s webpages that there would be any contractual restriction on the capacity of a purchaser to sell the ticket   After   November   following complaints brought by eBay in these proceedings  Creative sought to have all its selling agents at retail premises other than Ticketmaster  display a notice which  among other things  set out either on A  or A  pages the conditions of sale which were on the back of the ticket  There  new condition   was printed in red type  mindful of what Lord Denning MR had said in Thornton     QB at  D  This device was effective for tickets purchased after   November   as a matter of contractual analysis  to bring to a purchaser s attention the existence of the limitation in the condition of sale which was sought to be imposed as a contractual term  There is no evidence as to how many people since   November   bought tickets over the counter at retailers in circumstances where the notice will have been effective to make the seven conditions of sale actual conditions of the contract of purchase of the ticket   It is  however  still a feature of Creative s argument  that new condition   bound only the actual purchaser  not the person or persons who may have had tickets bought for them by that purchaser  unless the purchaser could be characterised as an agent of the others for the purchaser   The four different principal methods of sale involved the creation of a number of different types of contract  with different incidents at different times  In the example just given of an over the counter sale by a retailer  a sale on   November may have brought about a different contract to one which was made on   November  Nonetheless  the ticket that is purchased in either transaction will look exactly the same to third parties into whose hands it may come

displayed on the Online Fulfilment website  eBay argues the contract was  in effect  signed electronically by the purchaser through his or her clicking on the relevant buttons agreeing to the terms and conditions  making payment and receiving the webpage and email confirmations of the order  On this analysis the contract was signed and completed after the payment and nominated purchaser details were accepted  The terms of the signed contract were those set out in the webpages detailing the terms and conditions in accordance with Toll  FGCT  Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited   HCA         CLR     eBay argues that  objectively  a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have concluded that terms and conditions upon which the ticket was sold to the purchaser were those repeated five times throughout the process on the different webpages  These incorporated old condition    The ticket that was delivered in consequence of a transaction occurring online before   November   however  contained new condition   which eBay says can have no contractual force or effect because it had been added without agreement after the contract was made  Thus  eBay says  in addition to the other inaccuracies it claims  the ticket in such cases is misleading because of its different terms and it conveys a false representation that new condition   is a part of the contract   Creative contends that new condition   is merely a statement in different language to the same force and effect of old condition   and has no difference in substance   The Ticketmaster online purchase was a contract in writing signed by the parties  By clicking on the relevant buttons and  by the computer bringing up all terms needed to purchase a ticket  on behalf of Ticketmaster as agent for Creative  the whole transaction was in writing  signed and agreed by the parties  A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have regarded the transaction completed on Ticketmasters

It is common ground that an assignee or donee of a ticket who became a holder otherwise than through a resale for profit by the original purchaser  is not bound by new condition   and that such a holder is free to resell for profit  There is an ambiguity in the words  re sold for profit   An original purchaser could resell and realise a profit without having been motivated to make a profit  The choice for construction of the expression is between the subjective motivation of the seller as opposed to the objective fact of a resale at a price greater than     The cost may vary depending on the nature of the transaction including any applicable booking fee or postage costs  In these reasons I will refer to   as an illustration of the approximate cost to purchase a ticket   The second sentence of new condition   prohibits two methods of sale  but must be read with the first sentence  The commercial purpose of new condition   is to prevent  scalping  that is the purpose which reasonable persons in the position of Creative and original purchasers would have had in mind at the time of sale   Zhu v Treasurer of NSW   HCA         CLR   at         It is necessary to construe new condition   so as to avoid it making commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience   Zhu   CLR at      If the subjective intention of a vendor on eBay were relevant  new condition   would not operate automatically  There would be no readily ascertainable way of enforcing it without enquiry by Creative as to the subjective motivations of an original purchaser who resold  Accordingly  I am of opinion that the proper construction of  re sold for profit  is that it operates on the objective fact of the price realised on resale being greater than     When a purchaser wished to buy a ticket to Big Day Out from Ticketmaster online  he or she would go to a Ticketmaster webpage with a subheading  Hot Tickets  on which the words  Big Day Out   appeared  Each webpage had a clause stating that by continuing past it the user agreed to abide by Ticketmaster s terms of use which included its purchase policy  At the top of that page it was stated that the tickets would be mailed in late November    By clicking on  Big Day Out   the purchaser was then taken to a Ticketmaster webpage headed  Big Day Out   with the venues and dates marketed by Ticketmaster on it  being Sydney  Melbourne and Perth   This page was mainly a publicity or general information page  The purchaser then clicked on the  Buy Tickets  button and an events search results page opened showing the three venues being marketed  Each had a button for  Find Tickets   By clicking on the button for the relevant event  a new webpage opened containing event information and indicating that the box office was open   The purchaser was told that if they were already a Ticketmaster member and had their billing information pre registered they could log in on the log in button  If not  they were then directed to complete the information needed to become such a member  It was a condition of establishing such a membership that the user of Ticketmaster s website accepted the terms of use on the website as governing the relationship  That provided that the purchase policy would govern the order or purchase of any tickets through the site  The purchaser had to agree by using the site to abide by the terms of that policy  The purchase policy contained the following terms and conditions     This Purchase Policy is subject to  and incorporates by this reference  the Terms of Use  Each ticket that you purchase is a licence to attend a particular event and is subject to the additional terms set forth on that ticket            Unlawful Resale of Tickets Commercial Purposes     Unlawful resale of tickets  or attempt  is grounds for seizure and cancellation without compensation  A ticket shall not be used for advertising  promotions  contests  or sweepstakes unless formal written authorisation is given by the Event Provider  provided that even if such consent is obtained  use of Ticketmaster s trademarks and other intellectual properties are subject to Ticketmaster s consent   Again  whatever be the precise contractual analysis of the position  the very terms of the conditions of sale are calculated to convey to an ordinary reasonable person reading them that they cannot get out of the conditions  Ironically  it is Creative that has argued that the purchaser can eschew the conditions it wrote and imposed on the ticket telling the purchaser that they could not get a refund  This unattractive argument has no commercial morality about it  These are consumer transactions  mainly effected with young people who are not experienced in the commercial world  Creative used its own drafting of contractual terms and the representations they convey as to the efficacy of those contractual terms to assert that the purchaser cannot get a refund  It then had senior counsel argue that  applying classical contractual analysis  the purchaser could ignore its own ticket wording because the customer in fact had a right to a refund  The argument is less than meritorious  Creative s argument makes the very words condition of sale   commercial nonsense   Zhu   CLR at      I reject the argument   Before   November   if a person went to a retailer  other than Ticketmaster  seeking to buy tickets over the counter  there was no material at the retailer s premises to indicate what conditions were sought to be imposed on the ticket other than those contained on the back of the ticket itself  I am of opinion that a similar analysis to that which applies to Ticketmaster s over the counter sales applies here
