McCann v Pendant Software Pty Limited  ACN      with Corrigendum dated   August     FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedACCC v Collings Construction  Unreported  NSWSC    July  appliedChandler v Alberta Association of Architects     SCR   There is yet another basis upon which an administrative decision maker might still deal with a matter that appears to have been finalised  In Chandler v Alberta Association of Architects     SCR   Sopinka J  who delivered the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada  said  at    If the Tribunal has failed to dispose of an issue which is fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the tribunal is empowered by its enabling statute to dispose  it ought to be allowed to complete its statutory task   In my view the Panel is entitled to proceed with Mr Hoff s application  Contrary to the Panel s stated view  the undertaking proffered by Pendant does not in fact dispose of all the matters raised by the application  I mean by this that the undertaking  which has the limited effect I have given it  did not create a situation where there could be competitive bidding for the shares in Tower  and this may be the only appropriate remedy if Mr Hoff can make out some of his complaints   In any event  it is clear that the Panel has made an important mistake in the effect of the undertaking  It is not necessary to determine whether the mistake is one of fact  the meaning of words in the undertaking  or one of law  how the undertaking is to be applied to the known facts   It is enough for me to hold  as I do  that the mistake is of such importance that it warrants the Tribunal pressing ahead with the application citedComptroller General of Customs v Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd     ALR   It is not  however  only in the case of jurisdictional error that an administrative decision maker can correct error  For example in the Comptroller General of Customs v Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd     ALR   Beaumont J said  at   that  where it appears to a decision maker that his or her decision has preceded upon a wrong factual basis  it is appropriate  proper and necessary that the decision maker withdraw his or her decision  appliedKabourakis v Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria   VSC  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSC  html  Similar statements appear in the judgment of Gillard J in Kabourakis v Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria   VSC    There the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria  a statutory body  conducted an informal hearing into the professional conduct of a doctor and made a finding about that conduct but  by mistake  had overlooked some evidence  There was no express provision in the relevant statute allowing the board to set aside its finding  Nevertheless  Gillard J said at   that  if a decision made by a statutory body  which was clearly made in error or as a result of some obvious mistake  it is an offence to common sense to suggest that the only avenue open to correct the error is to appeal  state a case  or seek judicial review   He went on to say that an administrative decision maker should be entitled  to correct an obvious error by revisiting the process   Gillard J accepted that if the statute under which the administrative decision maker was acting prevented the decision from being re opened then of course it could not be appliedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj   HCA         CLR   it was held that if an administrative decision maker commits a jurisdictional error in reaching his decision  the decision is liable to be set aside but  whether set aside or not  the decision maker can correct the error in a later decision  So  if the Panel committed a jurisdictional error in arriving at its decision that the undertaking proffered by Pendant rendered it inappropriate to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances  it could still deal with the application  It would  of course  be necessary  if it went ahead  for the Panel to release Pendant from the earlier undertaking   There is a passage in the speech of Lord Reid in Ridge v Baldwin   UKHL       AC     which is to a like effect  Lord Reid said   I do not doubt that if an officer or body realises it has acted hastily and reconsiders the whole matter afresh  after affording to the person affected a proper opportunity to present his case  then its later decision will be valid   In Bhardwaj Gleeson CJ referred  at   to this passage with apparent approval but noted that the general proposition stated by Lord Reid  must yield to the legislation under which a decision maker is acting   To a like effect are the comments of Gummow J in Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic     FCR          See also Steward v Director of Public Prosecutions     WLR

undertaking is of doubtful meaning and it is possible to give the undertaking a meaning that will avoid unintended consequences or consequences that are unreasonable  that meaning should be adopted  If that results in a construction that it is not necessarily grammatically accurate  so be it  But this approach will not permit a meaning to be given to an undertaking which is different from its clear meaning  In this connection it was not suggested that I should apply by analogy the approach developed for the construction of statutes under which it is permissible to modify the literal meaning of words in order to avoid absurd or unreasonable results  see for example  Saraswati v The Queen   HCA         CLR         Turning now to the undertaking itself  relevantly  Pendant s undertaking in the case of a  Superior bid   a defined expression  is to increase its offer so that it is  at least equal to that offered under the Superior bid   cl D c  or  if the Superior bid is not made by a member of Tower  to give a notice under r     offering to sell the Equity Partners  parcel  to shareholders at a price per share not higher than the price offered in the Superior bid  and if they are not taken up by shareholders to accept the Superior bid  cl D d   The question in each case is how does one determine the price of the Superior bid  It is common ground that Quadrant s off market bid is a Superior bid  It is a Superior bid because the offer made under the bid was for a cash price of more than     per share  the offer was sent to shareholders on   July   and the offer became free of all conditions before   July    That is  all the conditions specified in cl D a  and  b  were satisfied citedSteward v Director of Public Prosecutions     WLR   There is a passage

Boland     FCR   Third  in deciding what is meant by the words of an undertaking it is permissible to have regard to the reasons given by the Panel for requiring the undertaking and what the Panel perceived to be its effect  This is the position in the case of orders made by a court  as to which see Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd v Boland     FCR   and it should be the same in relation to an undertaking given under s  A   especially if the undertaking was required by the Panel  Put another way  the meaning of an undertaking is to be determined having regard to its stated purpose
