appellant  Mr Slaveski  appeals from a judgment of Burchardt FM of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia published on   May    In the judgment below  his Honour dismissed Mr Slaveski s application to set aside a bankruptcy notice served on him on behalf of the respondent company  see Slaveski v Rotstein   FMCA    On   April   the Magistrates  Court of Victoria made a costs order in favour of the respondent against Mr Slaveski in the sum of      On   May   the respondent served a bankruptcy notice on Mr Slaveski in respect of the costs order  On   May   Mr Slaveski applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for the bankruptcy notice to be set aside  On that day Registrar Luxton extended the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice  Several further extensions of time were granted throughout    On   November   Registrar Luxton dismissed Mr Slaveski s application to set aside the bankruptcy notice  On that day  Mr Slaveski countered with an application to set aside that dismissal  It was the rejection of that application which has led to the current appeal referred toSlaveski v Rotstein and Associates Pty Ltd   VSC  The costs judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court of Victoria on   April   see Slaveski v Rotstein and Associates Pty Ltd   VSC     Rotstein and Associates    The Court below observed that Mr Slaveski had on foot a proceeding against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia  the CBA  in which Mr Slaveski claims   million in damages  the CBA proceeding   His Honour also referred to a claim by Mr Slaveski  against Mr Rotstein  in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal  the VCAT claim   Mr Rotstein is the sole director of the respondent  The VCAT claim is for   for stress  including mental stress  caused allegedly by Mr Rotstein in the course of acting for Mr Slaveski  Mr Slaveski s desire  his Honour observed  was to adjourn the proceeding concerning the bankruptcy notice until after the conclusion of the CBA proceeding and VCAT claim  but in particular the CBA proceeding  His Honour referred to three matters put by Mr Slaveski to support his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice  They were  the VCAT claim for    referred to as a  counterclaim  the application by Mr Slaveski for an instalment order in respect of the judgment sum of     and the judgment for     was obtained by conspiracy   His Honour treated the last matter as an allegation of fraud  The Court below referred to s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  in the context of compliance with the bankruptcy notice not being required if there exists a cross demand equal to or in excess of the judgment debt which could not have been raised in the proceeding which led to the debt  His Honour considered that the VCAT claim did not raise a tenable cross claim against the respondent  It now appears that  subsequent to the judgment below  the matters raised in the VCAT claim were the subject of a counterclaim filed by the appellant in the Magistrates  Court of Victoria proceeding on   August    Next  his Honour said that the application by Mr Slaveski to pay the judgment debt of     by instalments constituted an acknowledgement of that debt  In addition  Burchardt FM observed that a desire to pay by instalments does not constitute a cross demand  On the issue of the judgment debt being fraudulently obtained  his Honour referred to the judgment of Smith J in Rotstein and Associates   where the Supreme Court held the costs order was reasonably open and that no error was made in its making  Federal Magistrate Burchardt considered the CBA proceeding to be extraneous to the proceeding to set aside the bankruptcy notice  His Honour said that no valid ground had been established to set aside the bankruptcy notice either by reference to ss  g  or   of the Act  The Federal Magistrate dealt at     in his reasons for judgment with what he called the  bias issue   His Honour referred to his disclosure to Mr Slaveski that he owned a small tranche of shares in the CBA  His Honour understood Mr Slaveski not to object to him hearing the application but said that  had the objection been pressed  he would not have disqualified himself  The transcript of the hearing before his Honour is not before the Court on this appeal  His Honour maintains that no application was made for him to disqualify himself  In any event  his Honour said he would refuse to do so if one were made  That approach was correct only for the reason that any issue concerning the CBA was irrelevant to whether there was any valid basis to set aside the bankruptcy notice  The CBA is not the respondent to this appeal or an entity which is concerned in the costs order which has given rise to the bankruptcy notice  Even if the Federal Magistrate had more than a small tranche of shares in the CBA  he would not have disqualified himself for a valid reason had he stood down from hearing the application  Mr Slaveski raises other issues in his notice of appeal which are said to relate to a denial of natural justice and bias in the Court below  None of them relate to any issue of relevance or any aspect of the judgment below which reveals any appeallable error  In his notice of appeal and written submissions in support of his appeal  Mr Slaveski asserted that his Honour did not take into account the VCAT claim  That is not so  as can be seen from     of these reasons  However  was his Honour correct in determining that the VCAT claim did not raise a tenable cross claim against the respondent  The claim in VCAT for   was issued on   April    Mr Slaveski has not demonstrated that the matters he sought to raise in VCAT against Mr Rotstein  could not have  been  set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained  see s  g  of the Act  The costs order which led to the bankruptcy notice was made in a proceeding in the Magistrates  Court of Victoria for unpaid legal fees  The VCAT claim concerned the relationship between Mr Slaveski as client and the respondent as solicitor  No explanation has been given for the failure by Mr Slaveski to bring a cross claim in the Magistrates  Court of Victoria proceeding  prior to   August    Consequently s  g  of the Act does not operate to assist Mr Slaveski to set aside the bankruptcy notice  In any event  Burchardt FM considered the VCAT claim to be untenable  His reasons for coming to that view are set out at   of his judgment where he recites the basis for the claim being that Mr Rotstein  caused  Mr Slaveski  to suffer a lot of stress  including mental stress   Finally  and again incorrectly  Mr Slaveski alleges that his Honour did not take into consideration his allegations of conspiracy  These allegations were outlined at   of his Honour s reasons  No issue was taken on appeal with their conclusive disposal by Smith J in the Supreme Court of Victoria  As Mr Slaveski has not demonstrated that he has a cross claim  set off or cross demand against the respondent company and has no other valid basis upon which to apply to set aside the bankruptcy notice  the Court below was correct to dismiss his application to have it set aside  Accordingly  the appeal is dismissed  Mr Slaveski is to pay the respondent s costs of the appeal  I certify that the preceding twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

a claim that may have been set up as a cross claim  the claim must be a genuine or bona fide claim  with a fair chance of success  see Re Glew  Glew v Harrowell of Hunt   Hunt Lawyers   FCA         ALR       FCA   at     per Lindgren J  It was open to his Honour below to make that assessment about the merits of the VCAT claim  Mr Slaveski also alleges  wrongly  that the Federal Magistrate did not take into account Mr Slaveksi s application to pay the judgment debt in instalments  However  as his Honour observed  that application is an acknowledgement of the debt
