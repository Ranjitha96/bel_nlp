reproduction  is not otherwise defined  However  as Diplock LJ observed in Francis Day   Hunter Ltd v Bron     Ch   at   it plainly involves two elements  First  there must be sufficient objective similarity between the infringing work and the copyright work  or a substantial part thereof  for the former to be properly described  not necessarily as identical with  but as a reproduction or adaptation of the latter  Second  the copyright work must be the source from which the infringing work is derived   In SW Hart   Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems   HCA         CLR     Gibbs CJ said  at      The notion of reproduction  for the purposes of copyright law  involves two elements   resemblance to  and actual use of  the copyright work  or  to adopt the words which appear in the

LJ explored the idea of  subconscious  copying  His Lordship said  at        I confess that I have found the notion of subconscious copying one of some difficulty  for at first sight it would seem to amount to a contradiction in terms  the word  copying  in its ordinary usage connoting what is essentially a conscious process     The conclusion at which I arrive on this part of the case is that subconscious copying is a possibility which  if it occurs  may amount to an infringement of copyright  But in order to establish liability on this ground  it must be shown that the composer of the

In SW Hart   Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems   HCA         CLR     Gibbs CJ said  at      The notion of reproduction  for the purposes of copyright law  involves two elements   resemblance to

question whether he has copied a substantial part depends much more on the quality than on the quantity of what he has taken    Their Honours referred to the well known passage from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in SW Hart   Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems  cited earlier in these reasons for judgment  and then continued       Causal connection  and  objective similarity  are not referred to in the Act  and are but the components of the Act s concept of  reproduction  Eagle at    Causal connection is sometimes inferred from access to the copyright work in suit and sufficient objective similarity between it and the work said to infringe  But the two elements are conceptually distinct  a young child may try to copy a drawing  yet fail  for lack of skill  to reproduce it  a skilful copier may attempt to copy a work on the basis of his or her recollection of it  yet fail for imperfection of memory  a chain of communications from the observer of a work to the ultimate author of an intended copy of it may be so defective that  again  the intended copy fails to reproduce the original  But even a perfect copy  if truly accidental and independent  is also not a  reproduction  because the necessary causal link between the two works is missing  cf Ladbroke at   per Lord Reid  Eagle at            Tamawood concedes that there can be an infringement although the author did not directly copy from  or even know of   the copyright work  The primary judge cited  in this connection  LED at   but that case did not go so far as Tamawood  s concession does  In LED   a director of the alleged infringer gave instructions to its drafters for modifications to be made to bring plans into line with the copyright plans of the applicant  The comparable situation in the circumstances of the present case would be that Mr Mizikovsky filled Ms Gould s role  that is to say  that he  as an officer of Tamawood  and knowing of the Chirnside plan and intending to take from it   gave the unsuspecting Mr Middleton instructions for modifications to the Adrian  which  in fact  when implemented  would bring it into line with the Chirnside  On his Honour s findings  that is not this case        The primary judge expressed  at   surprise at a statement in Eagle  at   that  where subjective copying occurs there can be expected to be found an infringement  unless it transpires that the product is so dissimilar to the copyright work that the copyright work can no longer be seen in the work produced   Referring to an expectation  that statement allows for exceptions  Also it must be read in context  As stated earlier in the judgment  at   Eagle was better regarded as a case of reproduction of the whole of the copyright work  so it was strictly not necessary to undertake the  substantial part  inquiry  Eagle was a case of subjective copying of the shapes and arrangement of  and interrelationship between rooms  and of traffic flow  throughout the house  The statement which surprised his Honour is akin to that of Lord Bingham in Designers Guild Ltd v Russell William  Textiles  Ltd   FSR     Designers Guild    that           w hile the finding of copying did not in theory conclude the issue of substantiality  on the facts here  Designers Guild was also a case of overall similarity  it was almost bound to do so    at             It was acknowledged several times elsewhere in the judgment in Eagle  at     and   for example  that subjective copying alone is not enough  and that where a part is taken it must be a substantial part of the copyright work   Peterson J s aphorism   what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting  a statement made in University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd     Ch   at   in relation to the subsistence of copyright  was in fact invoked in the context of infringement and  substantial part  in Ladbroke by Lord Reid at   and by Lord Pearce at     but the House of Lords may be taken to have cautioned against this practice in Designers Guild     In the absence of any direct evidence of copying  or access by the respondent to the applicant s work  the causal link can be inferred  The greater the degree of objective similarity  the more likely it will be that that inference will be drawn  SW Hart   Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems  at   Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group

that the composer of the offending work was in fact familiar with the work alleged to have been copied  citedLED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd     IPR   Copying in relation to building plans is not confined to tracing and can be established even where there are significant differences between the finished products  In LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd     IPR     there were differences in room sizes  window placings  wall alignments  and cupboards between the plans of the applicant and respondent  Nonetheless  these differences were minor and there was found to be reproduction of a substantial part of the applicant s plans   Davies J found that the respondent did not ask its draftsmen to copy the applicant s plans  The respondent gave instructions to change the respondent s existing plans  both by way of sketches and orally  which  when implemented  would bring those plans into line with the applicant s plans  This was said to constitute deliberate copying  though achieved by the giving of instructions for change rather than the direct tracing of one plan from another  There was thus a causal connection between the two sets of plans   In support of its argument  Inform noted Davies J s comments in LED Builders v Eagle Homes   in which he said  at      What stands out is that the overall positioning  orientation  and designs of the rooms  of the entry and of the garage are practically identical  So also is the general relationship between the house and its environs  Note that in each case  the garage is in the same position in LED s and Eagle s comparable drawings  notwithstanding that the garage in drawings A  and A  is situated differently from the garage in drawings B  and B    Inform contended that the authorities were careful to point out that the conceptual limits of project home copyright should not be overstated  Eagle Homes v Austec Homes   LED v Eagle Homes and Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch  Tamawood v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes   It noted that copyright protection had been given to the combination and arrangement of rooms and spaces in a design and the  flow  or movement and other aspects arising from that arrangement and associated design choices  eg Eagle Homes v Austec Homes  citedTamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR   An important case for present purposes is Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR    It also concerned copyright in project home designs  The trial judge found that copyright had been infringed  On appeal  Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in a joint judgment observed in relation to copyright and project homes generally        The application of the law of copyright to project home plans gives rise to special difficulty  All modern homes have certain features in common  In the case of project homes competing for the same number of dollars  there are pressures towards sameness  Of course  the size  number of rooms and facilities will vary according to the price range  Commonly  however  those in the same price range will be found     a  to be designed to fit blocks of approximately similar shape and dimensions     b  to provide for vehicular access and accommodation  and    c  to include features demanded by the market in question  such as  a certain number of bedrooms  a laundry  a kitchen  a family or rumpus room  an ensuite and a walk in wardrobe  WIR  in association with the main bedroom  built in wardrobes in the other bedrooms  at least one bathroom in proximity to the other bedrooms  and certain facilities in the kitchen such as a sink  bench  dishwasher  stove  hot plate and microwave oven        The idea form distinction  often elusive  is particularly so in the case of project homes  Yet the originality threshold for copyright protection is low  It is no longer challenged that copyright subsisted in the Chirnside Works and Buildings  as well as in the Baltimore Works and Buildings        Although copyright subsists in the whole of a plan or house  this does not mean that each individual part of it  considered in isolation  satisfies the originality test for the subsistence of copyright  that is to say  that it originated with the author  Some parts may be original only in the sense that they are part of a whole which did originate with the author  So  Lord Pearce was able to say that to copy an unoriginal part of a copyright whole is not an infringement  cf Ladbroke  Football  Ltd v William Hill  Football  Ltd     WLR    Ladbroke  per Lord Pearce at          The taking of an idea  as distinct from its expression  from a copyright work will also not constitute an infringement  since there is no copyright in ideas  cf Kenrick   Co v Lawrence   Co     QBD      Kenrick     Common examples concern objects in the real world or ideas based on objects in the real world  A person who draws or photographs an object does not  through the copyright in the drawing or photograph  become entitled to prevent others from drawing or photographing the same object  even though there may be a striking similarity between the two drawings or between the two photographs  The drawing of plans for project homes involves a mixture of the use of familiar ideas based on objects in the real world  many other project homes and the plans for them  on the one hand  and labour  skill and judgment  in combining and arranging the various parts  on the other hand  It may be possible to say of each individual part  considered in isolation  that it merely expresses a common idea  yet there will be copyright in the whole plan if the combination and arrangement originated with the author  In protecting that origination  copyright protects the author s labour  skill and judgment        It is reasonable to expect that the more simple  commonplace  familiar and straightforward the subject matter of a copyright work  the closer the similarity that will be required if infringement is to be found  cf Kenrick at     What is clear from Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch  and Tamawood v Henley Arch in particular   as well as the other cases cited  is that in order to prove infringement of copyright there must be proof of copying  As indicated  copying can be deliberate or subconscious although  as the Full Court observed in Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch at   in cases involving works such as architectural plans  it would be surprising to find many cases of subconscious copying  If a person independently creates a work that is substantially similar or even identical to another in which copyright subsists  the copyright holder has no recourse  Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   per Lindgren J   Determining whether  a substantial part of the work  has been reproduced is a question of fact and degree  As indicated  greater weight must be given to the quality of what is reproduced than to its quantity  SW Hart   Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems  The protected element may arise out of a combination of elements  any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright  An allegation of substantial reproduction will be made out if what has been taken is an essential or material part of the applicant s work  Autodesk Inc v Dyason  No     HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ at   Tamawood v Henley Arch at   and Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall     IPR   at   per Lockhart  Spender and Ryan JJ    Inform submitted that this objective similarity was a matter of impression for the Court to undertake as a lay observer  That there were differences between the relevant Inform and Boutique plans was to be expected and was in no way determinative  In relation to what it termed the  legacy features  which could be seen as carrying over from the Villa Grand to the Villa View  Inform noted that the question was addressed in Tamawood v Henley Arch  In that case  Wilcox and Lindgren JJ concluded that such features should be  subtracted  from the assessment of what had been reproduced  However  Moore J  in his dissenting judgment  reached the conclusion that they should not   Notwithstanding this  Inform said that a number of key features not present in the Villa Grand could be seen to have been introduced into the Villa View  which reproduced  with remarkable fidelity  features from the Seasons  They were    the relocation and orientation of the staircase    the redesign of the hallway space and spine on the ground floor    the cleaner line between hall and dining space at front of the house with no columns and reduced articulation of the separation between that room and the hallway    the placement of the study at the front of the house    the shift forward of the garage    the  straighter  alignment of the front of the house with the garage    the arrangement of the downstairs laundry and toilet  wet areas  around the stair  which have the same  footprint  on the two plans  although the disposition of the laundry and toilet within the footprint is varied    the arrangement upstairs of the bathrooms and toilet around the stairway    the rearrangement of the children s bedrooms in a cluster at the rear without separation by a bathroom    the introduction of the island bedhead wardrobe in the master bedroom  and    the spatial arrangement and disposition of en suite bathroom  robe and master bedroom   Even subtracting the  legacy features  from the Villa Grand that were present in the Villa View design  and allowing for the slight differences in dimension and arrangement of some of the spaces  Inform argued that there remained a striking similarity between the Villa View and Inform s Seasons and Urban plans   As noted above  copyright subsists in the work as a whole  It will be infringed if a  substantial part  of the work is reproduced  though no separate copyright is conferred on that part  As was noted in Tamawood v Henley Arch  the critical question will be whether the part or parts taken represented a substantial part of the labour  skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work  original   Plainly  this involves questions of degree   As indicated above  Inform relied on the evidence of Mr Meyer and Mr Wines to submit that a number of features  which were material  essential or important parts of the Urban and Seasons designs  are found in the Villa View  Of these features  the most significant is the arrangement of a centralized staircase in proximity to a  core  of wet areas with living area and bedrooms then arranged around that core  Inform submitted that this aspect of the design of the Seasons and Urban was of key qualitative significance   Despite Mr Rivette s suggestions in cross examination that the central staircase  and arrangement of wet areas around it  were unremarkable features in commercial design  Inform contended that Boutique had not been able to offer any evidence of these features forming part of the  common stock  in project housing before the Urban and Seasons   Inform noted how the central stair in the Urban and Seasons could have been pushed further forwards or backwards in the buildings or rotated to face the front or rear  Its placement where it was represented a concrete choice by Mr Meyer from which other choices  such as the subsequent arrangement of surrounding rooms  flowed  Similarly  Inform contended  the arrangement of the wet areas around the stairs had no functional or cost benefits but was simply a choice made from many which were available  This was also true of the separation and arrangement of the downstairs meals and living rooms and the upstairs rooms around the core  Inform said that  despite Boutique s attempts to portray these aspects of the design of the Inform homes as being the result of the requirements of building on narrow blocks and satisfying building codes  this was not the case   In addition it drew attention to the comments of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood v Henley Arch  in which their Honours said  at        It would be tedious to attempt to identify the most important features of the Chirnside which were taken  In our opinion  cumulatively  they constituted a substantial part of the Chirnside  As between the Chirnside and the Adrian  the parts of the Chirnside that were taken were  distinctively  Chirnside  We regard        the absence of protrusions from bedroom   and bedroom   and of diagonal walls and hampers between the dining and living areas      the glassed conservatory style meals area between the rumpus room and the kitchen      the lack of diagonal walls and hamper between the rumpus and family rooms      the glass walls of the rumpus room  and     the absence of a door and built in wardrobe of bedroom  study     as essential and material non functional parts of the Chirnside  regarded as an artistic work  that were copied  We prefer  however  to say that all of the items which we have concluded were taken from the Chirnside  when regarded cumulatively  amount to a substantial part of the Chirnside   In reply  Boutique submitted that even if I found that there had been copying  it would still not have infringed Inform s copyright  It submitted that any such copying  assuming it had occurred  was not done in relation to a  substantial part  of Inform s work   Boutique submitted that in considering whether a  substantial part  of Inform s work had been reproduced  I should bear in mind the observations of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood v Henley Arch at      Placing a kitchen in reasonable proximity to a dining room  and bedrooms in reasonable proximity to each other and to a bathroom is suggested by broad functional considerations  Those proximities would not be a substantial part of a plan or house regarded as an artistic work  Moreover  they would be ideas  But broad functional requirements can be satisfied in more ways than one  Some features of the project home plan may be dictated by aesthetics and decorative concerns  for example  In these ways  the labour  skill and judgment of the author are called upon  The dividing line between that which is dictated by broad functional requirements and that which is not  is  however  often unclear   Boutique submitted that in order to determine whether the relevant causal connection was established  the Court had to identify that part of Inform s work that was the subject of copying  whether consciously or subconsciously  In that regard  Inform s case was that the essential features of its Urban and Seasons designs that were reproduced were those set out by its counsel in his opening  namely    a long narrow rectangular plan forming a  spine  to the building    a centrally positioned free standing staircase    minimized hallway space downstairs and upstairs    creation of a central services  core  around the stairwell ie placement of the kitchen adjacent to the stairwell but not abutting a permitter wall    placement of other  service  areas such as laundry powder room and en suite bathroom around the stairwell    placement of living and bedrooms around the core in zones    master bedroom at front of house  forward of stairs  upstairs  with an island style bedhead robe    rumpus room and children s rooms upstairs at rear    arrangement of the children s rooms    arrangement of bathrooms upstairs    open informal living spaces on ground floor with visual floor to rear of house    a meals area extending into the yard creating a courtyard effect with garage    a garage arranged to side of the house    fa ade elevation arrangements designed to break down the visual and spatial massing of the building  and    a relatively low pitch roofline   Boutique submitted that many of these features were either mere ideas or common to all project homes  It will be recalled that in Tamawood v Henley Arch  the Court observed  at   that the application of the law of copyright to project home plans gave rise to special difficulty  All modern homes had certain features in common and  in the case of project homes competing for the  same number of dollars  there were pressures towards sameness  See also Eagle Homes v Austec Homes at   per Lindgren J   In Henley Arch Pty Ltd v Clarendon Homes  Aust  Pty Ltd     IPR     Merkel J  at   went so far as to suggest that the degree of the protection under copyright of an architectural plan might be limited by reason of the proportion of features common to all plans   For functional reasons  kitchens are normally located in reasonable proximity to dining areas  For similar reasons  in a two level home  bedrooms are usually positioned upstairs in reasonable proximity to each other  In Tamawood v Henley Arch  the Court observed  at   that proximities such as these would not be a substantial part of any plan or house regarded as an artistic work  Moreover  they would be ideas and not the expression of ideas   Boutique argued that the design of project homes was invariably dictated by features such as the size and shape of the block of land available  the requirements of Rescode  the planning scheme provisions applying to residential developments in Victoria  local government requirements  and cost considerations   Inform conceded that many of the features identified by Boutique as common to project homes were present in the Villa Grand   plan  to which Inform took no exception  Indeed  a number of those features were present in the earlier Mawson Lakes home as well  Boutique submitted that these pre existing elements had to be excluded from any analysis of what may have been derived from Inform s work  In Tamawood v Henley Arch  Wilcox and Lindgren JJ said at      Obviously  it is important in considering the similarities between the Gould and Chirnside plans  to discount the pre existing similarities between the Chirnside and the Adrian  the Gould was  based  on the Adrian  not the Chirnside   Boutique argued that when one excluded these common and pre existing features  all that was left was the central core of the Urban and Seasons  that being the staircase and its position in the house with the wet services area around it  In that regard  even Mr Wines conceded that a central staircase was hardly novel  Moreover  a staircase that folds back on itself has been around for centuries  Mr Meyer acknowledged that such a staircase was quite standard and that the structure of a staircase that wrapped around a blade wall or balustrade was not uncommon in   when he designed the Core house  He agreed that the staircase in the Villa View differed from that used in the Urban and Seasons in that it did not appear to wrap around a blade wall  but rather a balustrade   Mr Wines accepted that commercial and high rise properties often had wet service areas surrounding the vertical core  He accepted that this concept had been adopted by both Inform and Boutique and that it made good sense as an economy measure  He agreed that the wet areas were configured above each other in the Villa Grand and that this same approach had been taken in the design of the Villa View  Mr Meyer accepted that other architects or designers might have been using a central staircase with serviced wet areas surrounding it at the time that he designed the Core house in

those questions  Ancher  Mortlock  Murray   Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at   and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes at     Boutique submitted that many of these features

objective similarity to justify a finding of reproduction of a substantial part  to consider whether there had been actual and deliberate copying  In Eagle Homes v Austec Homes  Lindgren J pointed out the importance in that case of the primary judge s finding that there had been subjective copying  His Honour said  at      To insist that a copyright owner can satisfy the sufficient objective similarity of reproduction only by establishing such a close similarity is a hurdle too high to be placed before a copyright owner who is found to have proved subjective copying  The way of the copier  including the copier of a plan of a project home  should not be made easy   Boutique submitted that it was in the light of findings of deliberate copying that both Eagle Homes v Austec Homes and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes  affirmed on appeal  Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd   FCAFC   should be viewed  In a case involving at its highest an allegation of

spaces of the house  were at least as substantial to the overall design as was the al fresco quadrant in Barrett Property v Carlisle Homes   In that case  the Court held that an al fresco quadrant  which comprised a combination of rumpus  family  kitchen and meals areas around an open courtyard enclosed on three sides  all under a single roof  was a substantial part of the design   Inform said that Courts had been ready  sometimes implicitly  to find particular design features  and the layout and interrelationship of rooms in plans  as constituting a substantial part  Moreover  they had regularly stopped short of finding it necessary to list or define the elements as constituting a substantial part  which was consistent with the role that subjective impression had to play in the

at   Tamawood v Henley Arch at   and Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall     IPR   at   per Lockhart  Spender and Ryan JJ  citedAncher  Mortlock  Murray   Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd     NSWLR   A  substantial part  can be constituted by the arrangement of rooms in a design  as well as by matters such as traffic flow throughout a house  Eagle Homes v Austec Homes   Although questions of  substantiality  and  reproduction  are ultimately for the Court to determine  it is permissible and of assistance to have regard to expert opinion to resolve those questions  Ancher  Mortlock  Murray   Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at   and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes at     Boutique referred to Ancher  Mortlock  Murray   Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd where Street J said  at      An architect may legitimately inspect an original plan or house and then  having absorbed the architectural concept and appreciated the architectural style represented therein  return to his own drawing board and apply that concept and style to an original plan prepared by him and in due course to a house built to such plan  There is a dividing line separating such a legitimate process from an inspection followed by a later copying of a substantial part of the physical object inspection  even though the copying be from memory  the latter exercise does infringe  In many instances it will be difficult to state categorically whether the dividing line has been crossed  Cases will not always be black or white where the alleged coping is from memory  The borderline area is clouded by a band of grey within which opinions and conclusions may differ  Within this grey band conflicting answers could without error be given to the questions is that plan or house only a copy of the concept or style of the original and hence legitimate  or is it a copy of the author s manifestation of that concept or style and hence an infringement  Despite the significant body of evidence led in this case  and the copious citation of authority  the real dispute between the parties turns largely upon a simple question of fact  Has Inform established by reliance upon inference that those involved in the design and construction of the Villa View copied central elements of the Urban or Seasons  Inform s case turns primarily upon subconscious rather than deliberate copying  It does not invite me to find that any of Mr Di Natale  Mr de Weerd  Mr O Dwyer or Mr Lazarovski has given untruthful evidence as such  Rather  it submits that it is simply inconceivable that two such similar designs as the Seasons and Villa View could have been independently arrived at  It says that someone associated with the design of the Villa View must have seen and digested the essential features of either or both of the Urban or Seasons  each of which achieved considerable publicity at about the time the Villa View was being planned  The seeds of the Inform designs must have been planted in the minds of those who conceived the Villa View and influenced the design of that home  Inform says that any other conclusion would strain the bounds of credulity   Weighed against that view is the emphatic evidence given by Mr Di Natale  Mr de Weerd  and Mr Lazarovski in particular  denying any knowledge of the Urban or Seasons at the time in question  Their evidence is supported by a detailed documentary trail  which shows the evolution of the different Boutique homes from the one at Mawson Lakes to the various Villa Grand versions  including the Contemporary Villa Grand  and ultimately the Villa View  That evidence  which included transparencies of the plans of each of these homes  was said to controvert Mr Wine s opinion to the extent that he did not resile from it in any event under cross examination   It was Oscar Wilde who said in The Importance of Being Earnest      To lose one parent     may be regarded as a misfortune  to lose both looks like carelessness  citedLadbroke  Football  Ltd v William Hill  Football Ltd     All ER   It noted that in Ladbroke  Football  Ltd v William Hill  Football      WLR     Lord Pearce said  at        Whether a part is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than its quantity  The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be protected  For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will  when robbed of that collocation  not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement  It is this  I think  which is meant by one or two judicial observations that  there is no copyright  in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright   citedHenley Arch Pty Ltd v Clarendon Homes  Aust  Pty Ltd     IPR   Boutique submitted that many of these features were either mere ideas or common to all project homes  It will be recalled that in Tamawood v Henley Arch  the Court observed  at   that the application of the law of copyright to project home plans gave rise to special difficulty  All modern homes had certain features in common and  in the case of project homes competing for the  same number of dollars  there were pressures towards sameness  See also Eagle Homes v Austec Homes at   per Lindgren J   In Henley Arch Pty Ltd v Clarendon Homes  Aust  Pty Ltd     IPR     Merkel J  at   went so far as to suggest that the degree of the protection under copyright of an architectural plan might be limited by reason of the proportion of features common to all plans citedMetricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Boutique submitted that it was in the light of findings of deliberate copying that both Eagle Homes v Austec Homes and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes  affirmed on appeal  Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd   FCAFC   should be viewed  In a case involving at its highest an allegation of subconscious reproduction  a close objective similarity in the detail of the two plans should be required before there could be any finding that a substantial part had been taken citedAutodesk Inc v Dyason   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As previously discussed  copyright protects the form in which ideas are expressed but not the ideas themselves  Autodesk Inc v Dyason   HCA         CLR   at   per Dawson J  It does not prevent the development and expansion of ideas or the furtherance of architectural concepts  Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch at    To constitute an infringement  the act must constitute an unauthorised use of the form of the work and not merely its idea or theme or method   Inform s submissions on this point were not detailed  It noted that in cases involving architectural designs  broad design concepts were not subject to protection but their form  as found in a given design  was if they were neither mere copies nor entirely generic concepts  Inform conceded that with project homes  the idea expression dichotomy could be harder to distinguish because of the degree to which function dictated form and the fact that such homes were often composed of stock elements common to the genre  However  Inform submitted that such concerns had limited application in this case because the Urban and Seasons designs were not  run of the mill variants  of standard project home lines
