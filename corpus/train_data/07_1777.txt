Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Ranu Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedYorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  All the individual respondents were knowingly concerned in such contraventions and thus are liable by virtue of s  B  They were aware of the essential facts which constituted the contraventions indeed it was the individuals themselves who engaged in the relevant conduct  That they were not aware that the conduct was unlawful is relevant to the fixing of penalty but does not avoid liability  Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR     The original   Agreement and its amendments and successive agreements were conceived by the orthodontists with extensive and ongoing legal advice  There seems to have been a widespread misunderstanding amongst the lawyers involved  and possibly many other lawyers  that professions were not subject to the Trade Practices Act   The assumption of legality was reinforced when Dr Gupta  prior to becoming a signatory to the Agreement in   furnished the then existing contracts to a separate solicitor for perusal and that solicitor similarly failed to raise any competition law issues  The same occurred when Dr Stankevicius joined the arrangements   While of course ignorance of the law is not an excuse  the Commission  properly in my view  accepts that the failure of lawyers in separate firms to properly advise their clients is a matter that goes some way towards explaining and mitigating the conduct of the orthodontists
