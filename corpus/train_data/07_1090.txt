 http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appellant refers to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Miah   HCA         CLR   especially Gaudron J at   wherein her Honour said    Although relief by way of prohibition under s  v  of the Constitution is discretionary  the guiding principle is that  t hose exercising executive and administrative powers are as much subject to the law as those who are or may be affected by the exercise of those powers    Reliance is also placed by the appellant upon authorities which relate to delay see  SZHRF v Minister for Immigration   FMCA   at   and the observations of McHugh J in Re Commonwealth  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR   at   and of Stone J in Applicant S  of   v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   distinguishedLee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Whilst the appellant relied upon the decisions of the Full Court in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   and SZFOH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC     neither have application to the present proceedings since each of those cases concern service with regard to an  authorised recipient    For reasons referred to above  there was no appointment of such person in the present proceedings citedMakhu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  His Honour also noted that the original Application for Review was made before s  G of the Act became operational and that the nomination of the migration agent in the application for review could not have been made in the context of an  authorised recipient  as provided by s  G of the Act  However  the parties proceeded on the basis that when s  G did become operational  it rendered the appellant s migration agent the authorised recipient for the purpose of the section  His Honour followed the decision of Mansfield J in Makhu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   to deem that the appellant had received the invitation  notwithstanding that under s  G of the Act the invitation   must   be sent to the appellant s authorised recipient   Although finding that the Tribunal acted correctly in respect of service of the notice  Nicholls FM found that the Tribunal did not comply with the relevant statutory requirements in respect of the period of notice  His Honour found that there was jurisdictional error in the procedures of the Tribunal  His Honour noted that s  A  in conjunction with Regulation    D b  of the Migration Regulations    Cth   the Regulations  stipulated that the prescribed period for giving notice of an invitation to a hearing starts when the appellant receives notice of the invitation and ends at the expiration of   days after the day on which notice is received  His Honour also noted that s  A  of the Act provided a method by which the Tribunal gives a document to a person is to date the document and dispatch it by prepaid post within   working days to the last address for service  or last residential or business address provided by the appellant  His Honour also noted that section  C a  of the Act relevantly provides that a person is taken to have received a document from the Tribunal   working days after the date of the document   In applying the legislation to the facts his Honour found that the date of the invitation to the hearing was   January   and that the invitation was sent by prepaid post to the migration agent and the appellant at his residential address on   February   thus within the requisite   working days  His Honour found that the migration agent would be deemed to have received the letter of invitation on Monday   February    Pursuant to Regulation    D b  the period of notice required in relation to an invitation to attend a hearing in the case would have ended   days later on Monday   February    The hearing was set for   February   and thus the period of notice was deficient by   days  His Honour accordingly found that the Tribunal did not satisfy the requirements of the prescribed period of notice both for the letter sent to the migration agent and the letter sent to the appellant pursuant to s  A  of the Act referred toProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant claims that  since s  B was not in force at the time there had been common law unfairness by the Tribunal  However  the Tribunal satisfied the statutory requirements in respect of the issue and service of the invitation under s  A of the Act  Further  receipt is deemed to have been effected by the provisions of s  C  Since the statutory procedure was adopted  there is no basis for a finding of a denial of procedural fairness  see Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at     As stated previously  Nicholls FM observed that no evidence had been led by the appellant to show that the appellant s advisor had not received a copy of the invitation  There is however evidence that the Tribunal contacted the adviser by telephone and was informed that the appellant was unlikely to attend but that efforts would be made to contact him  Nothing further was heard and no application was made to the Tribunal to adjourn the hearing  It follows that this ground of appeal must be dismissed   Although Nicholls FM found that there had been a breach of the statutory requirements concerning the provision of notice in the s  A invitation  he declined to remit the matter to the Tribunal in the exercise of his discretion  His discretion was so exercised after a detailed investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the appellant s application distinguishedRe

  v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   followedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Nicholls FM  referring to the High Court s decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   observed that the grant of relief of the nature sought by the appellant  writs under s  v  of the Constitution   is discretionary and may be refused if the conduct of a party is inconsistent with the grant of such relief for reasons of  inter alia  unwarrantable delay  acquiescence or waiver or unclean hands on the part of the party seeking relief   Nicholls FM was satisfied that the appellant would have known of the Tribunal s decision to affirm the Minister s refusal of his application for a protection visa by mid November    Nicholls FM found that since the appellant s application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court was not made until May   there was an unwarrantable delay by the appellant in pursuing his appeal  Nicholls FM considered that the appellant s conduct in pursuing the s  B Application rather than seeking review of the Tribunal s decision of   February   showed that the appellant lacked the sense of grievance or urgency that the appellant had subsequently asserted  Nicholls FM was also of the view that the appellant demonstrated  unclean hands  due to inconsistencies in the appellant s evidence and submissions  Accordingly his Honour refused to exercise his discretion to grant the relief sought by the appellant and dismissed the application   By Notice of Appeal dated   May   the appellant raises the following grounds of review  the Federal Magistrate erred by not finding that the Tribunal failed to accord the appellant procedural fairness in that the Tribunal failed to follow the procedures required by s  A  and s  G  of the Act  the Federal Magistrate erred in not remitting the matter to the Tribunal even though a breach of procedural fairness existed  and the Tribunal failed to accord the appellant procedural fairness in its failure to give the appellant an opportunity to comment upon the country information reports which were taken into account by the Tribunal   The appellant submits that since s  A of the Act had commenced operation by the time the invitation to the Tribunal s hearing was sent  it was necessary for the Tribunal to send the letter to the  authorised recipient  as required by s  G  The Tribunal failed to do so and accordingly service of the invitation was defective   It is essential to consider the legislative regime which applied at the time of the appellant s original Application for Review  The original Application for Review was received by the Tribunal on   November   under cover of a facsimile sheet provided by the appellant s adviser  Kamlesh Singh  The address on the fax coversheet was nominated as   Blue Hills Avenue  Mount Waverley  Victoria appliedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   The Court has considered the statements of principle referred to in the above decisions but does not consider that they address the issue which Nicholls FM had before him  The appellant had chosen deliberately to pursue alternate means of obtaining a visa rather than to challenge the decision which had been made by the Tribunal  Nicholls FM exercised his discretion in determining whether to grant the relief sought by the appellant for the established breach  see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   at   and      His Honour was entitled to find  on the evidence before him  that the appellant had engaged in conduct inconsistent with his recently stated grievance  had acquiesced in the Tribunal s decision and came to the Court with  unclean hands  referred toSZDOG v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  As the proceedings were commenced prior to the enactment of s  B of the Act  Nicholls FM also had regard to the question whether the requirements of common law procedural fairness were met by the Tribunal in relation to the hearing invitation  His Honour had regard to the decisions of Smith FM in SZDOG v Minister for Immigration   FMCA   and SZEMB v Minister for Immigration   FMCA    In these decisions the discretion of the Tribunal to proceed to determination of the application under s  A  of the Act was vitiated because the Tribunal failed to address considerations relevant to the exercise of that discretion  However his Honour distinguished such decisions on their facts  In SZDOG   the Tribunal had drawn a mistaken positive conclusion that the appellant had shown a deliberate lack of interest in his application  In SZEMB the Tribunal proceeded to make a final decision on the mistaken belief that the agent had been notified with sufficient time for him to make significant efforts to contact his client  No such considerations applied in the present circumstances referred toSZEMB v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  As the proceedings were
