Commission v Plymin  No     VSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VICSC  html  It is generally  but not necessarily  the case that an inquiry into the insolvency or otherwise of a company at material times is assisted by considering various indicia of insolvency  In Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Plymin  No     VSC         ACSR     Mandie J at   referred to a number of indicia of insolvency  It is convenient to list them  I propose to consider those which are particularly relevant to the present circumstances  The indicia referred to by Mandie J were       continuing losses    liquidity ratios below one    overdue Commonwealth and State taxes    poor relationship with bank  including inability to borrow further funds    no access to alternative finance    inability to raise further capital    suppliers placing company on cash on delivery or otherwise demanding special payments before resuming supply    creditors unpaid outside trading terms    issuing of post dated cheques    dishonoured cheques    special arrangements with selected creditors    solicitors  demands  summonses and the like    payments to creditors of rounded amounts not reconcilable to specific invoices  and    inability to produce timely and accurate financial information to indicate trading performance and financial position  and to make reliable forecasts    In any particular case  one or more of those factors  or other factors  may have particular significance and one or more of them may not exist  The absence of one or more of those factors does not  of itself  establish solvency referred toBox Valley Pty Ltd v Kidd   NSWCA         ACLC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  In considering whether Damilock was able to pay its debts as and when they became due and payable  it is appropriate to have regard to its debts in the immediate future as well as its current debts  So much is clear from the use of the words  as they become due  in s  A of the Act  see Lewis v Doran at   and Box Valley Pty Ltd v Kidd   NSWCA         ACLC   at         and     referred toSandell v Porter     CLR   The cash flow test of insolvency focuses on the liquidity of a business  A balance sheet test of solvency  addressing the excess of assets over liabilities  may include assets which are not readily realisable so as to permit the payment of all debts as and when they fall due  On the other hand  insolvency means more than a mere temporary lack of liquidity but  as counsel for the liquidators put it  involves  an endemic inability to pay debts as and when they become payable  see eg Sandell v Porter   HCA         CLR     Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd  in liq  v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     NSWLR   at   referred toSouthern

Taxation     NSWLR   at    Nor do I think the creditor s emphasis on the  commercial realities  of the relationship between the company and its creditors is misplaced  What the arrangement was between Damilock and its creditors is a question of fact  see eg Iso Lilodw Aliphumeleli Pty Ltd  in liq  v Commissioner of Taxation     ACSR     Re New World Alliance Pty Ltd  receivers and managers appointed    Sycotex Pty Ltd v Baseler  No       FCR     and Taylor v Carroll     ACSR   discussedRees v Bank of New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for the liquidators contended that Damilock s inventory or stock in trade was not an asset available to be realised  other than in the ordinary course of business  to meet its current debts  So much is self evident  It does not follow that the inventory or stock in trade of what is in essence a retail trading company should not be taken into account at all in determining the solvency or otherwise of a retail trading entity  Much will depend upon the nature of the stock  the ability to realise its value  its turnaround time and the like  As Barwick CJ said in Rees v Bank of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at   It is quite true that a trader  to remain solvent  does not need to have ready cash by him to cover his commitments as they fall for payment  and that in determining whether he can pay his debts as they become due regard must be had to his realizable assets  The extent to which their existence will prevent a conclusion of insolvency will depend on a number of surrounding circumstances  one of which must be the nature of the assets and in the case of a trader  the nature of his business   The treatment of inventory or stock in trade was a matter upon which the experts took a somewhat different view   Those observations are also pertinent to the creditor s claims that Mr Lewis did not have sufficient regard to the fact that Damilock is in essence a retail trading company  so that its stock should have been given much more prominence in assessing its ability to pay its debts as and when they fell due  I accept that  depending on the evidence  trading stock may be relevant to assessing insolvency  Hence  I also accept the contention for the creditor that the decision in Rees v Bank of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   is to be understood in its particular circumstances  However  I consider the present circumstances are not dissimilar to those which were considered in Rees    Clearly  by reason of its expansion interstate  Damilock had incurred very significant capital expense  and it had increased its trading stock  It had been unsuccessful in negotiating increased overdraft facilities with the ANZ to fund that expenditure  It did not have other sources of capital or deferred advances from its directors or  as I have found  externally  It appears to have funded those expenses by extending the period in which it paid its trade suppliers  It was keeping within its overdraft limits  but was not paying its trade suppliers in a timely manner  The evidence was that December and January in each year were its best trading period  That is reflected in Damilock s budget  The outcome of its trading in December   and January   is known  It achieved sales much less than it had budgeted in each month  There was  on its own budgeted projections  no reason to anticipate a windfall sales level in February or March    Hindsight indicates that its budgeted sales in those months were also not achieved  Hence  in my view  there is no foundation to conclude that Damilock s trading stock beyond its actual sales in December   and in January   could have been realised in the reasonably foreseeable future to be available to meet its liabilities as and when they fell due  The short answer is that if the trading stock had that quality  it should and probably would have been realised to do so  The trading stock at cost held at   December   excluding distribution costs  was in the order of    m and by   January   stock at cost was still of the order of    m  The creditor says that at a gross profit margin of   there were at December   potential maximum sales of up to about    m  A similar sum would be sold in November    But the fact is that such sales were not made  and they were not made over the best trading period for the year  In my judgment  the commercial realities indicate that Damilock s trading stock  beyond that actually realised in December   and in the latter months of   and then in January   was not in fact readily realisable to meet its ongoing liabilities as and when they fell due   The creditor pointed out that Damilock always paid its trade creditors out of sales  rather than cash reserves  because it never had sufficient cash reserves for that purpose  That fortifies my understanding that its expansion in the latter months of   was also largely to be financed out of sales  and that the increasing delay in paying its trade creditors illustrates that  If the sales levels were not achievable at a rate and at times sufficient to do so and when its debts fell due and became payable  then the point would be reached that Damilock was insolvent  in the absence of other resources being or becoming available   Its trade creditors had increased from    m to    m between June and December    There was every reason why Damilock should  therefore  have made such sales as it could in December   and in January    There is also reason to conclude  as I did  that it did make such sales as it could over that period  The sales were not sufficient  as at December   to meet its liabilities as and when they fell due  Nor were they in January   referred toLewis v Doran   NSWSC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Another matter relevant to insolvency is the prospect of funds likely to be available from a third party  such as from a capital injection or a subordinated loan  The Court will generally be sceptical of a mere assertion of a third party s willingness to provide such support  Such asserted willingness should be cogently demonstrated as a matter of commercial reality  even if the evidence falls short of establishing a legal obligation to advance funds  see the discussion in Lewis v Doran   NSWSC         ALR   per Palmer J at      That topic  too  was a matter upon which there was some difference between the parties  but for reasons which are discussed below  I do not think it is significant in this instance because there is so little evidence of any real prospect of any third party capital funding becoming available  In the end result  senior counsel for the creditor did not place much weight on the prospect of an externally sourced capital injection of funds to show whether Damilock was insolvent prior to about   February     As I indicated  Mr Lewis  conclusion was that Damilock was insolvent from at least early December   and certainly by   December   and remained insolvent until   June    He expressed that view because  in the whole of that period  Damilock had a deficiency in its cash flow needed to pay its debts which had become due and payable  based upon hypothetical bank balance assessments which he had prepared  He recognised that conclusion was based upon an assumption that Damilock s creditors were paid on   day terms  On that basis  he concluded that Damilock would have required an increase in its overdraft facility in excess of  m  increasing perhaps to  m plus by   June   to meet its debts as and when they fell due during that period  He did alternative calculations based upon creditor payment terms of   and   days  They did not alter his conclusion  albeit that the increased overdraft facility required would have been considerably less  He also concluded on his balance sheet analysis that Damilock had a material deficiency in its working capital of   as at   December   increasing to   at   June   and that those figures were conservative as they did not take account of non current employee entitlements such as long service leave  and depreciation   Mr Keith s view was that Damilock was not insolvent prior to   February   and became insolvent some time between that date and   March    He identified the reasons for his conclusion  differing from that of Mr Lewis  as being     Damilock was in ongoing discussions with potential equity investors at least in the period up to   February      Damilock had achieved a large net profit of   in January   so as to have given Damilock s directors reason to expect that  at that time  its profitability and cash flow was improving significantly     Damilock had engaged Korda Mentha   highly regarded reconstruction and insolvency experts  and     a report prepared by Korda Mentha as at   February   did not state or express the opinion that Damilock was then insolvent  but indicated that Korda Mentha were in discussions with Damilock s directors so that Damilock was pursuing strategies to preserve the integrity of the continuing business referred toIso Lilodw  Aliphumeleli Pty Ltd  in liq  v Commissioner of Taxation     ACSR   In considering the evidence on those issues  it is appropriate to have regard both to the contractual terms for payment of debts to suppliers  generally according
