Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         ALR     the Court was concerned with a claim under s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The applicant had difficulty in particularising the applicant s case and was ordered to pay the respondent s costs thrown away in relation to applications to amend its pleading  The applicant also sought to strike out the respondent s defence   His Honour referred to the dicta of Kiefel J in All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation   FCA       ALR   and said at    I t is not the fact of delay which is relevant but its effect upon the proceeding and the position in which the other party is then placed  Here  the respondents have been put to significant expense which  as the costs orders indicate  has been expense which they are entitled to recover from the applicants   In this case it is right  as the respondents contend  that the applicant has taken nearly four years to articulate its statement of claim in its final form  if the fourth further amended statement of claim is its final form  for reasons which are not entirely apparent  A significant problem for the applicant in its pleading has been the applicant s inability to express its claim tightly  From time to time  the looseness of expression by the applicant in its pleading has caused the applicant significant embarrassment   However  the thrust of the applicant s case against the respondents has not significantly changed and the respondents have been on notice since the proceeding was commenced of that claim   The respondents filed their first defence in response to the applicant s statement of claim on   October    It filed a further defence on   January    The respondents have not been called upon to amend its pleadings whilst the applicant has sought to put its pleading in order  In those circumstances  the respondents have not been put to the considerable costs associated with having to re plead the matter from time to time   The respondents  costs have been occasioned by needing to have considered the various proposed amendments and the hearings of the applications to amend the statement of claim  They will recover those costs in due course whatever the result of the principal proceeding consideredMurran Investments Pty Ltd v Aromatic Beauty Products Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Murran Investments Pty Ltd v Aromatic Beauty Products Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR     Mansfield J considered an application under this rule  In the proceeding before him  three separate versions of the statement of claim had been struck out and other proposed statements of claim withdrawn  Considerable time had elapsed before a satisfactory version of the statement of claim had been settled upon citedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Limited  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There is no evidence that the respondents will suffer any serious disadvantage by not recovering their costs until the principal proceeding is determined  On the other hand  if the order were to be made  both parties would be put to the added expense of considering bills of costs in relation to the separate orders for costs to which reference has already been made  The applicant would need to find funds to pay those costs in advance of the hearing of the principal proceeding  It is desirable that the principal proceeding go forward as soon as possible because the principal proceeding raises important issues which need to be determined  Furthermore  this is not a proceeding where final judgment is  far away  and thus the eventuality of payment is remote  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Limited  No     FCA   at   per Gordon J and the cases cited therein   On balance  I do not think that this matter calls for an order under O   r    I think  on balance  the parties would be better served by proceeding with the action rather than being delayed or distracted by the taxation of costs of interlocutory proceedings   There will be no order under O   r
