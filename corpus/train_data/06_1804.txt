expression  transaction  is defined in s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  to include the disposition of property  payments made and obligations incurred  The case law indicates that the term  transaction  is a word of wide connotations  A transaction in its totality may include a series of events in a course of dealings initiated by a debtor intended to extinguish the debt  Re Emanuel  No    Pty Ltd  in liq    Macks   Anor v Blacklaw   Shadforth Pty Ltd     ALR   at    The events can occur at different points of time and need not occur simultaneously  The Court must consider the transaction in its entirety so that it can determine the ultimate effect of the transaction followedV R  Dye   Co v Peninsula Hotels Pty Ltd  in liq    VSCA         VR  http www austlii edu au au

austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  html  In order for there to be an unfair preference  the statutory language requires that a creditor must receive more from the company in respect of an unsecured debt than that creditor would receive from the company in relation to that debt if the transaction were set aside and the creditor made to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company  The  winding up  as referred to in the statute is the actual winding up  and not a hypothetical winding up or series of windings up as at the date of each payment  see Walsh v Natra Pty Limited   VSCA         VR     In this case  the unsecured debt owed by LSE to Corporate Finance under the Second Deed was discharged in full as a result of the challenged payments  whereas unsecured debts to other creditors were not reduced   The affidavit of Mr Tolcher of   August   shows that Capital would have received substantially less if it had proved in the winding up of LSE as unsecured creditor  He states that the Capital companies will have received as a result of the transactions a net value of     whereas if they had proved in the winding up they would have received either     million or a lesser amount  It is not necessary  having regard to the language of the section  to direct attention to the effect on other creditors  see Walsh at   and Sheldrake v Paltoglou   QCA   at
