MZXAF v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedM  and M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   May   the appellant applied to the High Court of Australia  seeking relief under s  v  of the Constitution in relation to the Tribunal s decision  The High Court remitted that proceeding to this Court  On   December   Heerey J dismissed that application  His Honour s reasons are published as M  and M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA    Those reasons make it clear that his Honour did not give judgment on the merits  but rather dismissed the application on an interlocutory basis  because the appellant had failed to lodge it within the time limits fixed by the High Court Rules  and his Honour refused to extend the times so fixed   The appellant appealed from the judgment of Heerey J  On   May   a Full Court of this Court refused to extend the time for filing an application for leave to appeal  refused leave to appeal  and dismissed the appellant s purported appeal as incompetent  Although there appear to be no published reasons of the Full Court  it is plain that the Full Court regarded the judgment of Heerey J as an interlocutory judgment  from which leave to appeal was necessary referred toMZWGV v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  On   May   the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the Tribunal s decision  On   April   the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed that proceeding  The reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on that occasion have been published as MZWGV v Minister for Immigration   FMCA    They indicate that the learned federal magistrate dismissed the application on the basis that his Honour considered that the appellant was estopped by the previous judgments of North J and Heerey J  and the judgment of the Full Court of this Court  from applying again at all to have the Tribunal decision set aside  His Honour also took the view that the Federal Magistrates Court should not be seen to be reviewing decisions made by Federal Court judges  On   April   as well as dismissing the appellant s application with costs  the federal magistrate also ordered that there be no further applications brought by the appellant with respect to the Tribunal s decision except by leave of the Federal Magistrates Court   It does seem to me that  if the appellant could have made a case that he had a ground on which he could have sought to set aside the Tribunal s decision  which was a ground not available to him under the provisions of Pt   of the Migration Act   as they stood at the time of his application to this Court that was dealt with by North J  then he might still have been able to make an application to set aside the decision of the Tribunal at the time when he made his first application to the Federal Magistrates Court  and even at the time when he made his second  In my view  in the first of the federal magistrate s judgments  his Honour was wrong to regard the entire matter as being one of estoppel against the appellant from bringing any application on any ground in respect of the Tribunal s decision  For the reasons I have set out in Applicants M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     it seems to me that it would have been open to the appellant to raise a ground that he could not have raised under the provisions of Pt   of the Migration Act as they stood at the time of his first application to the Court  because whatever grounds he raised before the High Court had not been the subject of judgment on the merits  and no estoppel was therefore raised in respect of them  It is true that there might be issues of Anshun estoppel  but these would have to be matters of argument referred toMZXAF v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Notwithstanding that order  on   May   the appellant applied again to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the Tribunal decision  On   June   the same federal magistrate again dismissed that application with costs  The federal magistrate s reasons for judgment are published as MZXAF v Minister for Immigration   FMCA    After referring to the order made on   April   his Honour said at          The applicant s only basis for bringing the further application is that he says he now has some witnesses  This would not have been an arguable ground for review  even on his first application      Where an applicant is the subject of an order not to bring further applications without the leave of the court the appropriate step to take before bringing a further application for review is to apply for leave  A leave application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the facts and circumstances relied upon to show that leave should be granted  A copy of the proposed application should be annexed to the affidavit        The reasons make clear that  because of the fact that the appellant had not sought the leave of the Court before bringing his application  his Honour saw fit to dismiss the application   On   June   the appellant filed in this Court what is  in form  a notice of appeal from the judgment of the federal magistrate given on   June    The grounds of appeal specified in the notice of appeal read as follows           I disagree with the decision of the Federal Magistrates   sic   because there was an error in this decision  Details I will provide as soon as I   received   sic   the judgement   sic               There was procedural error in the court s decision  The original date   of this hearing is on  nd of June    But it was advanced to  nd of June    This hearing was heard by telephone  The Judge failed to consider my case inaccordance   sic   with the law of the country  I believe that this was abreach   sic   of natural Justice  Further  I believe this was the abreach   sic   of the human rights   also the procedure of the court           I believe that the court only listening the   sic   Minister of Immigration     their Lawyers but not the applicant  This I believe an error of the court procedure   also Bias and unfair   I dealt with the matter by way of directions hearing on   August    Among the directions that I gave was a direction that  on or before   August   the appellant file and serve any application for leave to appeal  any application to enlarge the time for applying for leave to appeal  and any affidavit or other document on which the appellant seeks to rely on the hearing of the appeal or any application for leave to appeal or for enlargement of time consideredApplicants M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It does seem to me that  if the appellant could have made a case that he had a ground on which he could have sought to set aside the Tribunal s decision  which was a ground not available to him under the provisions of Pt   of the Migration Act   as they stood at the time of his application to this Court that was dealt with by North J  then he might still have been able to make an application to set aside the decision of the Tribunal at the time when he made his first application to the Federal Magistrates Court  and even at the time when he made his second  In my view  in the first of the federal magistrate s judgments  his Honour was wrong to regard the entire matter as being one of estoppel against the appellant from bringing any application on any ground in respect of the Tribunal s decision  For the reasons I have set out in Applicants M  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     it seems to me that it would have been open to the appellant to raise a ground that he could not have raised under the provisions of Pt   of the Migration Act as they stood at the time of his first application to the Court  because whatever grounds he raised before the High Court had not been the subject of judgment on the merits  and no estoppel was therefore raised in respect of them  It is true that there might be issues of Anshun estoppel  but these would have to be matters of argument   I sought to ascertain from the appellant  in the course of argument  whether there was any substance in his allegation that the Tribunal had failed to provide him with copies of documents on which it relied  and had failed to give him an opportunity to comment on them  The affidavit with which his law clerk friend helped him did not identify those documents  Nor was the appellant able to identify to me any document used by the Tribunal  which affected the decision adversely to the appellant  and on which he was not given an opportunity to comment  I point out that  even if there were documents  such as the sources of information used by the Tribunal to ascertain the position in the Punjab  and in India generally  at the time of its decision  it would have been sufficient for the purposes of the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness for the Tribunal to have given the appellant an opportunity to comment on the substance of the information contained in those documents  It would be necessary to examine the transcript of the Tribunal s hearing to see whether this had in fact been done  All that can be said is that  if the appellant had been able to raise a case of denial of natural justice  or procedural fairness  that is not a ground on which he could have applied to this Court in   when Pt   of the Migration Act contained provisions specifically barring this Court from examining Tribunal decisions on the basis of natural justice  It was not a ground on which there has been any final judgment of any court  and therefore  on the reasoning set out in the passage in Applicants M  of     to which I have referred  it is a ground that would have been available to the appellant  It cannot be said that the appellant would succeed on it  because much more would need to be done   So far as the argument today is concerned  the appellant has not indicated that he would have been able to make out a case with respect to any documents  As I have said  he has not been able to identify documents that affected the decision adversely to him  or about which he was given no opportunity to comment  The only view I can take  therefore  is that  as a matter of substance  the appellant has no ground available to him on which he could seek to set aside the Tribunal s decision  This is a powerful reason in itself for refusing him leave to appeal   As to the appellant s complaints about the federal magistrate s judgment  there is not much to be said  He complains that the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court was originally set for   June   but was brought forward to   June  He does not indicate how this disadvantaged him  In answer to questions from me this morning  he indicated that he did not complain to the federal magistrate about the change of date  and did not allege that he was disadvantaged in the presentation of his case in the hearing before the federal magistrate  which apparently was conducted by telephone
