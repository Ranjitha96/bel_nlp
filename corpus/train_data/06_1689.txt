Rodda v Repatriation Commission   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedProject Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant pointed to the decision of the majority of the High Court in Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   wherein their Honours  approving the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in Tasker v Fullwood     NSWLR   at  G  held that  at          An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect  Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition  The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute  its subject matter and objects  and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition              In our opinion  the Court of Appeal of New South Wales was correct in Tasker v Fullwood in criticising the continued use of the  elusive distinction between directory and mandatory requirements  and the division of directory acts into those which have substantially complied with a statutory command and those which have not  They are classifications that have outlived their usefulness because they deflect attention from the real issue which is whether an act done in breach of the legislative provision is invalid  The classification of a statutory provision as mandatory or directory records a result which has been reached on other grounds  The classification is the end of the inquiry  not the beginning  That being so  a court  determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision  may easily focus on the wrong factors if it asks itself whether compliance with the provision is mandatory or directory and  if directory  whether there has been substantial compliance with the provision  A better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid      In determining the question of purpose  regard must be had to  the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute     Footnotes omitted   Specifically  the applicant drew attention to the statement in Project Blue Sky to the effect that although an act done in breach of a statutory provision is unlawful and  Failure to comply with a directory provision  may in particular cases be punishable    the act may nevertheless be valid  at    In this regard  reliance was placed on the decision of the Full Court in Formosa v Secretary  Department of Social Security     FCR   wherein the Court considered  at   that there was much force in the view that the distinction between  mandatory  and  directory  requirements had its meaning and utility primarily upon consideration of the consequences of a breach  The applicant also relied on Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   in which Finkelstein J held that   what must be determined is the consequence of a failure to comply with such an instruction      It is also important  no doubt  to consider the consequences of a failure to adhere strictly to the requirements of the Act   The legislature  it was submitted  had not addressed the consequences of non compliance with the requirement for written authorisation of s  AC representative  The Act does not expressly provide whether such non compliance leads to the validity or invalidity of a response otherwise authorised   The applicant submitted that several factors indicate that actual but informal authorisation ought not invalidate the response given  the scope and object of the whole statute  the language of the relevant provisions  the nature of the preconditions and their place in the legislative scheme  the consequences if the response was invalid  and finally  the consequences if the response was valid   As to the scope and object of the whole statute  the applicant rightly characterised the Act as  beneficial legislation  to be interpreted liberally  and in a manner that facilitates the provision of benefits to eligible veterans   The Commission argued that the legislation demanded full compliance with the requirement of written authorisation to the exclusion of all other possible alternatives   I mperative language  of the kind considered in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   is used in ss  AA   AC  and  AC   The Explanatory Memorandum showed that the legislature had deliberately chosen the most definitive possible means of ensuring that a veteran s representative is authorised  Because Project Blue Sky  at   mandates that the Court has a duty to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have  any attempt to read down the requirement for an authorisation in writing would defeat the intention of s  AC  Reliance was also placed on the statement by the High Court in Project Blue Sky  at   that   Ordinarily  that meaning  the legal meaning  will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision    In this respect  the Commission submitted that it would be impossible to think that Parliament intended to create a provision that said merely   You must to this  but then abandon that requirement in situations where a person had been misadvised to the contrary  Parliament was not likely to have used mandatory language such as  must  if it intended to undercut or relax that imperative in certain sets of circumstances   The Commission submitted that the requirement for writing serves both the interests of applicants and the Board  The exercise of providing a written authority was intended to bring home to the applicant the significance of his her situation  and protect him her from the activities of unauthorised persons  The corollary of this is that a written authority also enables the Board to be confident that a representative who submits a written statement on behalf of an applicant has been duly authorised  It is clear from the Explanatory Memorandum that it is the Principal Member who must be satisfied that a representative is duly authorised because the Principal Member is placed under a statutory compulsion   rather than given a discretion  to dismiss the matter in certain circumstances  It is no answer to say that at some later stage a person might send a written authority  the statutory scheme is predicated on the basis that  after a delay of at least two years  there are   days in which to comply  and at that point the Principal Member comes under a mandatory duty to act   The parties are correct to say that the case must be decided in the manner approved by the High Court in Project Blue Sky   As a matter of principle  what both counsel had to say about that case is correct  The relevant matters are summarised at   above  The difficulty is their application to the facts of this case   Neither the Tribunal s  and the respondents  interpretation  nor that of the applicant  yields a wholly satisfactory result  The result of the Tribunal s interpretation is that a veteran may lose some valuable substantial rights for merely procedural failures   The result of the applicant s interpretation is that a practical burden would be imposed on the Principal Member either to establish somehow that an applicant for review has not  orally or by conduct  authorised a purported representative  or to require the purported representative to obtain the applicant s written authorisation after the expiry of the   day period   The Registrar in this case required that of the purported representative within the   day period    Regrettably for the applicant  it seems to me legally necessary that the respondents  interpretation must be regarded as the less unsatisfactory one and  therefore  is the interpretation that must prevail  Notwithstanding that the Act was intended beneficially for veterans  there are three reasons for this   The first is that  if the applicant s submissions are accepted  the Act s specific and detailed provisions are set at nought  Those provisions allow a two year delay  provide for formal notice from the Principal Member of the Board  require specific written authorisation of a purported representative  and then mandate dismissal of the review application after   days  The Principal Member would  on the applicant s approach  be required after such   day period at least to go through the whole notification process again and perhaps do more  in an inquisitorial fashion  to establish from the applicant personally whether a purported representative was actually authorised  The express statutory scheme would be rendered pointless
