Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlquotedRogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   December   her Honour Collier J made orders that proceedings QUD  of   commenced by application filed on   April   by the applicant be dismissed and that the applicant pay the costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be taxed if not agreed   Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   FCA    Those orders were made consequent upon an application by the respondents by notice of motion that the applicant s proceedings be dismissed or alternatively that the proceedings be permanently stayed   In support of the application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal  the applicant deposes to these matters  On   December   Collier J published judgment at    pm  The parties were present by telephone  The reasons for judgment were posted to the parties and the applicant received the reasons on Monday    December    On   December   her Honour amended the reasons for judgment and the amended reasons were posted to the applicant on or about   December    The applicant says he  discovered  the new material in his post office box on   December    The applicant says that his statement of claim in the principal proceeding is   pages  her Honour s judgment is   pages  the judgment of her Honour is a  final judgment  and thus he has   days from publication of the judgment to file a notice of appeal   The applicant further says that alternatively  her Honour s judgment may be an  interlocutory judgment  in which event  he says  he has  seven days to file a notice of appeal   The applicant contends that because the judgment was first published at    pm on the relevant day  the reasons were posted to the applicant thus deferring access to the reasons  the reasons are lengthy and receipt of the reasons on   December   on the cusp of the Christmas New Year holiday period made it impossible for the applicant to prepare a notice of appeal and supporting documents within either   days or   days from the date of publication of the judgment  a discretion ought to be exercised to extend time to enable the applicant to formulate a notice of appeal precisely identifying the proposed grounds of appeal   The applicant concludes these contentions by deposing to these matters         In the interests of fairness  having regard to the length of the judgment and the holiday period at this time of year I have applied for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal                 I seek an order that time be extended to   January                   An extension of time to   January   will obviate the need for arguments as to whether I am entitled to   days or   days to appeal from the orders of her Honour                 It is ordinarily necessary to attach a proposed Notice of Appeal for an application for an extension of time  In this case  I am applying before the expiration of the appeal period so that I can seek advice  prepare and then file a final version of my Notice of Appeal  There is no proposed Notice of Appeal available because it does not yet exist   At paragraphs   and   of his affidavit  the applicant deposes to perjury charges having been laid against the third and fourth respondents  Mr Paul Hare and Mr Russell Percival and that aspects of those matters relate to material facts pleaded by the applicant in his statement of claim and relied upon for relief in the principal proceedings  The applicant further says that he will need to gain access to some material in the possession of the Queensland Police Service as part of his appeal preparation and that having regard to the complexity of the issues  the applicant seeks an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal   The applicant is unrepresented   Accordingly  in formulating these reasons  I principally address the applicant in setting out the principles governing the determination of the application although  of course  the reasons are addressed to all parties   By s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the Act  the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from judgments of the court constituted by a single judge  By s  A  an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment that is an interlocutory judgment unless the court or a judge gives leave to appeal  Section   of the Act sets out the manner of exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the court  Section   provides that applications for leave to appeal to the court or for an extension of time within which to institute an appeal to the court may be heard and determined by a single judge or by a Full Court   Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules provides that an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment may be made by notice of motion  relevantly in this case  within seven days after the date on which the interlocutory judgment was pronounced or within such further time as the court or a judge may allow   Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules provides for the timeframe within which a notice of appeal must be filed and served  compliance with both of which constitutes properly instituting an appeal   Accordingly  a notice of appeal is to be filed and served  for present purposes  within   days after     a  the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced   or     b  the date when leave to appeal was granted    Alternatively  the notice of appeal is to be filed and served within such further time as the court allows  upon application made by notice of motion filed within the period of   days mentioned previously  Notwithstanding the time periods contemplated by Order   rule     Order   rule   provides that the court or a judge for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal  An application made under Order   rule   is to be in accordance with Form  A which contemplates that an applicant will seek not just leave to appeal but an extension of time to file and serve the notice of appeal  Such an application is to be supported by an affidavit which is to set out the relevant facts informing the exercise of the discretion conferred upon the court and  most particularly  the proposed grounds of appeal should leave be given   Because Mr Rogers has failed to formulate a proposed notice of appeal and exhibit the document to his affidavit or depose in the body of the affidavit to the proposed grounds of appeal  it is impossible to identify from the papers the contended arguable error on the part of her Honour  Mr Rogers did not seek an adjournment of the application and sought to have the application determined on the return date supported by oral submissions as to the contended arguable error and thus the proposed grounds of appeal   The essential contentions of the respondents before Collier J  who were then the applicants on the motion  were these  Firstly  that Mr Rogers has no standing to maintain the claims to be drawn from the statement of claim because none of those claims falls within the exemption contained in s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  as a claim properly characterised as any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt  the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt  Secondly  that to the extent Mr Rogers relies upon conduct in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TPA  as the source of the legal right giving rise to a claim for damages or compensation for personal injury or a wrong done to Mr Rogers  serious doubt surrounds whether s   can properly ground such a claim  Thirdly  the statement of claim formulated by Mr Rogers comprehensively fails to plead material facts demonstrating conduct on the part of the respondents within the scope of s   of the TPA giving rise to particularised personal injury in Mr Rogers in any particularised quantum notwithstanding a general claim for damages of   million  Mr Rogers also relied upon contraventions of s   and s  AA of the TPA as the source of an exempted right for the purposes of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act    Her Honour comprehensively addressed each of the claims formulated by Mr Rogers within the statement of claim which contains an introduction to all of the respondents  a description of a sequence of property transactions affecting Mr Rogers and in respect of which one or more of the respondents were participants    specific claims or  counts  said to be within the scope of s  g    a  special pleading  identifying facts said to be particularly relevant to the grant of relief pursuant to s  D  of the TPA  a claim for   million for  personal injury  harm or wrongs  and   contentions at paragraph   of the statement of claim said to demonstrate  special aggravating circumstances    Having examined all of these matters  her Honour concluded that the statement of claim wholly fails to plead material facts demonstrating relevant conduct on the part of the respondents  the attraction and enlivening of ss      AA and   of the TPA  a contravention of any of those sections or other tortious conduct on the part of the respondents  damage or injury arising out of the contended contravening conduct  the scope and character of the personal injury or wrong alleged to fall within the exemption and proper particulars of the quantum of the damage   At paragraph   of the reasons  her Honour said this     It is clear that the applicant has undertaken the task of preparing the statement of claim with personal diligence  However  it is difficult to sort through what is essentially a written tirade by the applicant accompanied by extensive repetition and a large volume of irrelevant information  to find anything of substance or relevance which the court can properly consider   Accordingly  the applicant filed and served a statement of claim on   June    An amended statement of claim was filed on   June    In the context of the application by the respondents before Collier J  the respondents consented to an adjournment of their application in order to allow Mr Rogers an opportunity to re plead the amended statement of claim  The application was then adjourned until   August   and Mr Rogers was given leave to file and serve a further amended statement of claim by   July    Mr Rogers filed a further amended statement of claim on   July   and a further further amended statement of claim on   July   although the further further amended statement of claim of   July   apparently was not served on the respondents until the resumption of the application before Collier J   Having regard to this chronology  her Honour concluded that this is a case where the applicant so misconceives the cause of action open to him and in respect of which relief is sought that the action ought to be brought to an end  Accordingly  her Honour refused leave to deliver a further further further amended statement of claim   Although I would not ordinarily canvass these authorities in any detail in an application of the kind brought by Mr Rogers  I have elected to do so having regard to Mr Rogers s capacity as self represented and because I have  with respect  taken a different view about this aspect of the matter to that of her Honour Collier J  In any event  it seems to me that there is at least sufficient doubt in relation to the standing question   However  the decisive matter is the inadequacy of the applicant s statement of claim by reason of the matters set out at   to    I am not satisfied that there is any arguable error on the part of Collier J in concluding that the entirety of the statement of claim should be struck out  The statement of claim fails to adequately plead any claim for damages which might be severable in the manner previously described  I am not satisfied that there is  to use the language of Mr Rogers  a demonstrated  precious gem  of a claim in the various factual allegations assembled in the statement of claim   The statement of claim is  embarrassing  in the technical sense in which lawyers use that term in connection with a pleading not merely because of inadequacy in the lay crafting of the document but more importantly because the statement of claim comprehensively fails to address any claim that might be open to Mr Rogers as a matter of law or plead or set up the material facts going to each element of such a claim  The ultimate order was not that the statement of claim be struck out but rather that because the statement of claim wholly failed in the manner described that leave to re plead ought not to be given and  as a result  the proceeding ought to be dismissed with costs  Mr Rogers took objection to the description by her Honour of the pleading as essentially  a written tirade by the applicant accompanied by extensive repetition and a large volume of irrelevant information    Although Mr Rogers contended in oral submissions that her Honour s observation reflected a pre judgment of issues  Mr Rogers accepted that her Honour s observation was a description of a failure on the part of Mr Rogers to plead disciplined sequential material facts establishing conduct  a contravention  a wrong  loss or injury contemplated by s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act arising out of the relevant conduct  and a particularisation of the damages said to have been suffered   It should also be remembered that an order dismissing the statement of claim coupled with an order for leave to re plead and a compensatory order for costs in favour of the respondents  applicants before Collier J  is no compensation as the applicant in the proceeding is an undischarged bankrupt citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes   Associates Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Her Honour concluded that the statement of claim failed to disclose any reasonable cause of action and rather than plead material facts  the pleading contained confusing and irrelevant material  adopted ambiguous terms and simply asserted conclusions and opinions  Moreover  her Honour concluded that the defective parts of the pleading are so inextricably intertwined with offending material  an oppressive burden is necessarily cast upon the respondents in identifying the causes of action to which they must respond  Because of these difficulties  her Honour took the view that the statement of claim ought to be struck out in its entirety and in so finding  her Honour relied upon Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes   Associates Pty Ltd   FCA   per Lander J and Trade Practices Commission v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Limited     FCR   per Lockhart J citedTrade Practices Commission v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Limited     FCR   Her Honour concluded that the statement of claim failed to disclose any reasonable cause of action and rather than plead material facts

www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Her Honour then considered the question of whether leave ought to be given to deliver a further amended statement of claim  In considering that matter  her Honour had regard to the previous attempts on the part of Mr Rogers to formulate a claim properly falling within the scope of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act   The particular matters of relevance were these  Mr Rogers previously sought various orders against the present respondents including interlocutory relief restraining the respondents from exercising a power of sale and relief in respect of a number of loan agreements  deeds of settlement  mortgages and other instruments relating to various properties   Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     particularly note paragraphs   to   of the reasons   In that decision  the court determined that the majority of the claims made by Mr Rogers for final relief involved claims relating to the legal or beneficial interests of Mr Rogers in property which vested in his trustee in bankruptcy and accordingly  the applicant had no standing to institute proceedings for relief in respect of those matters   FCA   at    However  Mr Rogers also contended that he sought to assert a claim for final relief arising out of conduct on the part of the respondents which  properly formulated  fell within the exemption contemplated by s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act   Although the majority of the claims made by Mr Rogers were dismissed  the court made it clear   Rogers v Asset Loan Co   that the task confronting Mr Rogers was to formulate a statement of claim which in terms of its material facts  properly identified a claim to recover damages or compensation for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt arising out of conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the TPA upon which Mr Rogers relies   Having regard to the matters discussed at     I am satisfied that there is no prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceeding if it were allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way and thus there is a high degree of certainty of the ultimate outcome  That degree of certainty is informed not just by deficiencies in the pleading but by reason of the weight to be given to all of the factors discussed at      In addition to the chronology identified at   of these reasons  the applicant has agitated these same matters previously and the history of those steps is identified at   and   in the Reasons for Judgment in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     which also deals with the legal standing of Mr Rogers to maintain the collection of claims set out in his application in the present proceeding  see      Accordingly  it seems to me that there is no arguable error on the part of her Honour in concluding that the statement of claim must fail in its entirety and that the appropriate order pursuant to Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules is that the action be dismissed generally citedMunnings v Australian Government Solicitor   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In so concluding  her Honour relied upon the observations of Mason CJ and Brennan and Toohey JJ in Munnings v Australian Government Solicitor   HCA         ALR   at     Her Honour then turned to the dispositive orders that ought to be made  Her Honour relied upon s  A of the Act and Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules and concluded that the application of the applicant filed on   April   ought to be dismissed in accordance with either s  A of the Act or  alternatively  on the footing that the requirements of Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules were satisfied  Her Honour made an order that the application be dismissed and ordered the applicant to pay the respondents  costs of the proceeding  In relying upon s  A of the Act  her Honour  gave judgment   s  A  for the respondents  In concluding that Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules was satisfied  her Honour concluded that the proceeding ought to be dismissed generally on the footing  having regard to other conclusions  that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed by the statement of claim and that the applicant so misconceived the cause of action available to him that the proceeding is an abuse of the process of the court   Mr Rogers says the arguable error on the part of her Honour is this  The respondents conceded in argument that a contravention of the TPA may give rise to a claim for personal injury  Her Honour observed at paragraph   of the judgment that   It is arguable that the applicant was coerced   Having regard to those two matters  her Honour was in error it is said  in concluding that the statement of claim does not disclose any connection or nexus between conduct on the part of the respondents and a claim for personal injury on the part of the applicant  This error is described by Mr Rogers as the  main ground of my application for a notice of appeal   Mr Rogers says that it is quite clear from his pleading that allegations of coercion on the part of the respondents towards Mr Rogers occurred  that such conduct occurred only by reason of the provision of services by relevant respondents to Mr Rogers and that coercive conduct in contravention of s   gave rise to the present claim for damages or compensation for personal injury or the wrong done to him  Mr Rogers says that the coercion is clear or at least clearly arguable  it occurred in the context of a contravention of s   of the Act  and  the contravening conduct gave rise to the injury   Mr Rogers says that the only arguable error on the part of her Honour is in relation to the matters said to be in contravention of s   of the TPA   The second ground of appeal identified by Mr Rogers is that her Honour having found arguable coercion of the applicant  the offending parts of the statement of claim ought to have been dismissed leaving those paragraphs reliant upon s   extant  Mr Rogers says that  this little precious gem  was  good and it shouldn t have been thrown out and that s why I m here today    Further  Mr Rogers says that having struck out the statement of claim  her Honour ought not to have dismissed the application because she ought not to have found that there was no prospect of success in the proceeding having identified an arguable case of coercion   As to the concession on the part of the respondents  the respondents say that they simply recognise the proposition of law that a claim for personal injury might properly arise out of a contravention of a provision of the TPA but no such claim is properly raised on the statement of claim in this case   As to the question of whether a claim for personal injury based upon a contravention of s   of the TPA might give rise to a claim within s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act   her Honour said this at       Section   of the Trade Practices Act specifically applies to conduct in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer  and therefore is founded in an existing  or possible  contractual relationship between the corporation and the consumer  In the event that the consumer becomes bankrupt  it follows that any legal action arising from the contractual relationship between the consumer and the corporation vests in the trustee in bankruptcy       emphasis added  Justice Collier pronounced judgment on   December    The method of pronouncement adopted was to publish the dispositive orders made by her Honour that day and to post the reasons for judgment to the parties  The date of  pronouncement  of a judgment must necessarily be informed by the method selected by the judge to effect communication of the dispositive orders and particularly the reasons for judgment to the parties  Mr Rogers contends that notwithstanding the pronouncement of the dispositive orders on   December   at    pm by means of a telephone conference  the reasons were not received until   December   and then by reason of the changes  the final reasons were received on   December    It seems to me that if the judgment of her Honour is an interlocutory judgment  an application for leave to appeal ought to have been made within seven days of   December   or  alternatively  within   days of   December     The application by Mr Rogers was filed on   December   and is thus within time  If  however  the publication of the dispositive orders by means of a telephone conference and the selection of a method of communication of the reasons to the parties by post constitutes a  pronouncement  of the judgment on   December   the applicant is out of time by one day  However  having regard to the chronology of events  I am satisfied that the applicant has sufficiently explained any failure to file an application for leave to appeal from the orders of her Honour within the time required by the rules on the assumption that the operative date of pronouncement is   December     The more fundamental question is whether the applicant has established an arguable error on the part of her Honour citedTampion v Anderson     ALR   The respondents contend that her Honour s judgment is an interlocutory judgment and although her Honour s order finally disposes of the particular proceedings  an order staying an action on the ground that it is frivolous  vexatious or an abuse of process or an order striking out an action on the ground that the proceeding does not disclose a cause of action  has always been treated as an interlocutory judgment  Such an order does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties   Tampion v Anderson     ALR   Hall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR   Little v Victoria     VR   Wickstead v Browne     NSWLR   and Platypus Leasing Inc   Ors v Commissioner of Taxation   NSWCA        The rationale for such an approach seems to be that no final disposition of rights occurs because there has been no adjudication of the controversy of fact nor a dispositive application of the law to the facts as found  A question might arise as to whether the order has  the practical effect  of determining the claim of an applicant to a remedial order   Johnston v Cameron   FCAFC         FCR    One difficulty  however  is the respondents also contend that should the applicant commence fresh proceedings  assuming  as appears to be the case  the limitation period has not expired  Mr Rogers would be met with a contention of res judicata   If that contention is good  it seems to me that the order must necessarily be a final order consistent with the observations of Gibbs  Mason   Murphy JJ in Port of Melbourne Authority v Ashun Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at

Melbourne Authority v Ashun Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     As to the standing to maintain a claim arising out of conduct in contravention of s   of the TPA  it seems to me that a contravention of s     properly pleaded  may give rise to rights  claims and entitlements vested in the trustee of Mr Rogers and also a claim in Mr Rogers where the damages are to be estimated by immediate reference to any pain felt by the bankrupt and without regard to his rights in property  The mere fact that a contravention of s   necessarily involves a transaction of supply or possible supply of services to a consumer does not have the effect of vesting all claims arising out of the contravention in the trustee  In that regard  I would  with respect  disagree with the conclusion reached by her Honour at   of her Honour s reasons for judgment citedLittle v Victoria     VR   The respondents contend that her Honour s judgment is an interlocutory judgment and although her Honour s order

adjudication of the controversy of fact nor a dispositive application of the law to the facts as found  A question might arise as to whether the order has  the practical effect  of determining the claim of an applicant to a remedial order   Johnston v Cameron   FCAFC         FCR    One difficulty  however  is the respondents also contend that should the applicant commence fresh proceedings  assuming  as appears to be the case  the limitation period has not expired  Mr Rogers would be met with a contention of res judicata   If that contention is good  it seems to me that the order must necessarily be a final order consistent with the observations of Gibbs  Mason   Murphy JJ in Port of Melbourne Authority v Ashun Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   citedD cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   If the judgment is an interlocutory judgment  Mr Rogers must demonstrate that in all the circumstances the decision of her Honour is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by the Full Court and secondly  that substantial injustice would result if leave was refused supposing the decision to be wrong   D cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   Ogawa v University of Melbourne  No      FCA     Since the respondents contend that the effect of her Honour s order would be to bring about a res judicata in respect of the claims Mr Rogers has sought to agitate in his further further amended statement of claim  I propose to treat her Honour s judgment as a final judgment  In determining the question of whether further time ought be allowed to file and serve a notice of appeal for the purposes of Order   rule  b    I propose to determine whether the applicant has demonstrated an arguable error on the part of her Honour and  if so  whether substantial injustice would arise should an extension of time be refused  In that sense  I propose to essentially apply the test identified in D cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc  supra    In applying this test  I have had regard to not only the judgment of her Honour but also the further further amended statement of claim filed on   July    The matters to be considered are set out hereafter   The applicant contends that the respondents engaged in conduct in contravention of s   of the TPA   The applicant thus contends that the corporate respondents by their officers  servants or agents engaged in physical force and undue harassment or coercion in connection with the supply of services to the applicant as a consumer of the relevant services  or  that such conduct occurred in connection with the payment for such services   The applicant contends that the third and fourth respondents were the authors of the conduct  with others  and were persons  involved in the contravention  for the purposes of the TPA citedOgawa v University of Melbourne  No      FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  If the judgment is an interlocutory judgment  Mr Rogers must demonstrate that in all the circumstances the decision of her Honour is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by the Full Court and secondly  that substantial injustice would result if leave was refused supposing the decision to be wrong   D cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   Ogawa v University of Melbourne  No      FCA   citedJess v Scott and Others     FCR   If her Honour s order is a final order  the court must be satisfied that special reasons have been made out in order to grant leave to file and serve a notice of appeal out of time  The expression  special reasons  describes a flexible discretionary power conferred upon the court in those cases where some distinguishing or differentiating feature about the case justifies departure from the orthodoxy of filing and serving a notice of appeal within the time expressly limited by the rules  The flexibility of the discretion conditioned by the interests of justice is not constrained in its amplitude by any narrow approach to the expression   Jess v Scott and Others     FCR   at   per Lockhart  Sheppard and Burchett JJ   Nevertheless  an applicant seeking leave must demonstrate some feature about the case which persuasively warrants departure from the orthodox position  see also Jess v Scott per The Court at     In this case  however  Mr Rogers has sought to bring an application within Order   rule  b   In other words  Mr Rogers has made an application within   days of pronouncement of the judgment by which Mr Rogers seeks further time or an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal  Order   rule  b  does not in terms require an applicant to demonstrate  special reasons  in seeking an allowance of further time by the court  The reference in Order   rule   to  notwithstanding anything in the preceding sub rule  is intended to make clear that the scope of the discretion is not in any way limited by the terms of Order   rule    It seems to me that an application made within   days of the date of pronouncement of judgment by which an applicant seeks further time for the filing and serving of a notice of appeal is not to be subsumed within a requirement to establish special reasons as if an application had been made beyond the   day period at the outset   Nevertheless  there must be some demonstrated circumstances upon which the court might act in allowing further time  The particular circumstance advanced by Mr Rogers is that during the period between pronouncement of the judgment and the hearing of this application in February   Mr Rogers has not been in a position to prepare a notice of appeal and therefore he proceeded on the footing that an application ought to be made within   days seeking an extension of time within which to prepare  file and serve a notice of appeal  At the date of filing the application   December   Mr Rogers anticipated that he would be in a position by   January   to have obtained advice and formulated  filed and served a notice of appeal   Because the application was listed for determination in February   Mr Rogers has not taken steps to prepare a notice of appeal by   January   or at all  Rather  Mr Rogers seeks to identify by oral submissions grounds going to an arguable error on the part of her Honour  secure an allowance for such further time as the court determines and then file and serve a notice of appeal within such time as might be allowed   I propose to determine the application on the following basis citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia     FCR   The statement of claim fails to plead facts which establish the service supplied or to be supplied by the corporate respondents for the purposes of s   of the TPA  the conduct on the part of the relevant respondents  in connection with  that supply or possible supply relied upon by the applicant  the price of the relevant services  or any facts that establish supply or possible supply to the applicant as a consumer for the purposes of s  B b  of the TPA  see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia     FCR       per Hill J   Moreover  if the services relied upon by Mr Rogers for the purposes of s   of the TPA are financial services as the pleading seems to suggest  s  AF  provides that Part V of the Act within which s   falls  does not apply to the supply  or possible supply  of services that are financial services    The relevant statutory instrument regulating financial services is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth   In addition  the statement of claim does not assert a claim for damages pursuant to s   of the TPA in reliance upon a contravention of s   and the reference to s  D  relates to a contravention of a provision of Part IVA and not Part V   The applicant fails to plead facts that demonstrate a claim to recover damages or compensation for personal injury  stress  anxiety or wrong done to Mr Rogers arising out of the contravening conduct  Rather  the claim asserts harassment and coercion as a fact  The true character of the claim and its relationship with s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act is not pleaded and nor is any particularisation given of the estimated quantum of the claim  that is    million  In truth  Mr Rogers seeks to recover the lost value of the rights and entitlements he says he ought to have enjoyed by reason of the fulfilment of the promises of the relevant respondents in respect of each of the various property transactions pleaded in the statement of claim  Any such claim is vested in the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers   A contravention of s   of the TPA is the only cause of action relied upon by the applicant as the foundation  right of the bankrupt  for the purposes of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act  citedCox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The question seems to be whether any part of the damages arising out of the contravention are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind  body or character and without reference to his rights of property  In Cox v Journeaux  No      HCA         CLR   at   Sir Owen Dixon in formulating the accepted test had regard to the test formulated in similar terms by Earle J in Beckham v Drake     HLC   at   although Earle J adopted a qualification on the estimation of the damages by use of the phrase  and without immediate reference to his rights of property  whereas Dixon J qualified the estimation of the damages by reference to the phrase  and without reference to his rights of property     In Mannigel v Hewlett Phelps BC    the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales considered a claim by two bankrupt appellants against their solicitors for damages for physical and mental stress said to arise out of the negligence of the solicitor s conduct in connection with a property transaction  The claimants admitted that the damages although to be estimated by reference to physical and mental stress and anxiety were  a consequence of  the economic loss they suffered arising out of the conduct of the transaction  The Full Court in reliance upon Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales   Ors     ALR   concluded that because the claims were consequential upon alleged breaches of duty owed by the solicitors in relation to the purchase of the land  the claims for distress and injury to the physical and mental health of the claimants were not claims  without reference to their rights of property  as contemplated by Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux  No     supra    Damages for anxiety or stress may  however  be consequential but severable in the sense of being capable of estimation without regard in the estimation   to the bankrupt s rights of property  The claim by Major Wilson considered by Dixon J was emblematic of a consequential but severable claim which was capable of agitation by the bankrupt  If the damages are capable of estimation in such a way and are capable of being understood as severable from any claim on behalf of the trustee  it seems to me that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia applying Cox v Journeaux  No    contemplates that such a claim resides with the bankrupt even though it may be properly described as a consequential claim citedBeckham v Drake     HLC   The question seems to be whether any part of the damages

had regard to the decision of the House in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd   AC   in which a bankrupt claimant  Major Wilson  was held entitled to maintain a claim for damages for defamation  personal injury to his credit and reputation  by reason of the bank s negligent management of Major Wilson s financial affairs whilst he was out of England engaged in war service during the course of
