HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In dealing with a situation where there was an award underpinning an individual contract of employment Brennan CJ  Dawson and Toohey JJ said in Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited   HCA         CLR   at      In a system of industrial regulation where some  but not all  of the incidents of an employment relationship are determined by award  it is plainly unnecessary that the contract of employment should provide for those matters already covered by the award  The contract may provide additional benefits  but cannot derogate from the terms and conditions imposed by the award and      the award operates with statutory force to secure those terms and conditions  Neither from the point of view of the employer nor the employee is there any need to convert those statutory rights and obligations to contractual rights and obligations        footnote omitted  In his reasons for judgment Carr J said at          As the High Court of Australia explained in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     an award imposes certain statutory terms and conditions which do not necessarily displace underlying common law contractual relations  If they conflict  the award or certified agreement may modify the contractual provisions  but otherwise they continue to co exist  Byrne involved an award  but there does not seem to be any relevant distinction  for present purposes  between an award and a certified agreement       In the case of the   Agreement it displaced a pre reform certified agreement and provided what I have referred to as an  underpinning  for the individual contracts of employment of Karellas  employees   The applicant s concerns in relation to the approval of the   Agreement arise from two

On the second page it has been signed by a Peter Smith as  Operations Manager   The second document is three pages in length  It is also on the letterhead of Karellas and addressed to  Dear Employee   It also bears the signature of Mr Smith as  Operations Manager   It is undated     Copies of the two documents are attached to these reasons for judgment as appendices  A  and  B  respectively

Industries  Operations  Proprietary Limited v Wardley   HCA         CLR   at            It will be seldom     that an award will lend itself to the  covering the field  test of inconsistency on the subject of the contract of employment  Few  if any  awards reflect an intention to express completely  exhaustively or exclusively the law governing that contract between the parties  It will generally be a case of specific provisions which will  of course  have the effect of rendering inoperative any provisions of subordinate law  whether common law or statutory  touching that employment with which they are inconsistent  In Reg  v Industrial Court of South Australia  Ex parte General Motors Holden s Pty  Ltd  Walters and Wells JJ   in a passage with which I respectfully agree  discuss the relationship of an award to the common law and to statute law and refer with approval to the following passage from Webb   Industrial Relations and the Contract of Employment     p             The significance of the common law can be recognised if contracts of employment are seen to be stratified  First there is a foundation strata being the common law  Superimposed on this are State Acts  regulations and State industrial determinations  in places such State law cuts through and replaces the common law foundational strata  Above this again are Commonwealth Acts  regulations and awards of the Arbitration Commission  Federal law cuts through State law in places  sometimes at the point where State law has already cut through common law  sometimes direct into common law           Their

Connor   FCA         FCR    At   Black CJ and French J said     The broad brush complaint that common law contractual rights were displaced by the certified agreement faced another threshold issue  For while the agreement bound Dr Quickenden by force of law  it did not thereby terminate his contract of employment  It created rights and obligations which were statutory in character and could operate in addition to the rights and obligations under his contract and  where inconsistent  no doubt displace them  There is nothing in the agreement however which expressly sets aside or displaces the terms of existing or common law rights generally  The agreement itself is not  on the face of it  and is not expressed to be  exhaustive of the rights and duties of those bound by it  If anything it focuses upon the rights of employees  rather than their obligations  referred toBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The relevant standard of

cth HCA  html  The applicant submitted that it may be inferred from the making of false or misleading statements in the four page document and or the three page document that the making of the statements caused persons to whom the statements were made to approve the   Agreement  In support of this submission reliance was placed upon certain statements of principle enunciated by Wilson J in Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at    Gould v Vaggelas was a case of fraud where Gould Holdings Pty Limited purchased the South Molle tourist resort from a number of companies associated with Vaggelas  Mr and Mrs Gould sought damages for deceit in respect of representations made to Mrs Gould that the business was very profitable  the Vaggelases having submitted false figures as to occupancy rates and financial returns  Wilson J summarised the relevant principles applicable to such a case as follows at          Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent  if the representee does not rely upon it he has no case                 If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation                 The inference may be rebutted  for example  by showing that the representee  before he entered into the contract  either was possessed of actual knowledge of the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether he knew the true facts or not he did not rely on the representation                 The representation need not be the sole inducement  It is sufficient so long as it plays some part even if only a minor part in contributing to the formation of the contract   His Honour proceeded to say at          Where a plaintiff shows that a defendant has made false statements to him intending thereby to induce him to enter into a contract and those statements are of such a nature as would be likely to provide such inducement and the plaintiff did in fact enter into that contract and thereby suffered damage and nothing more appears  common sense would demand the conclusion that the false representations played at least some part in inducing the plaintiff to enter into the contract   However  his Honour emphasised that the onus of proof rested on the plaintiff  At     he said         When all the facts are in  the fact finding tribunal must determine whether or not it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the misrepresentations in question contributed to the plaintiff s entry into the contract  The onus to show that they did is a condition precedent to relief and rests at all times on the plaintiff   In my opinion  absent any evidence that the making of any false or misleading statement to another person or persons caused that other person or persons to vote to approve the   Agreement  a  fair inference of fact  that the making of the false or misleading statement or statements relied upon caused the person or persons to approve the   Agreement would not be available  It is quite possible that  the causal link between the making of a false or misleading statement to another person or persons and the approval of  in this case  the   Agreement by a majority of those persons who cast a valid vote deciding that they wanted to approve same  is missing because the employees of Karellas who cast valid votes indicating that they wanted to approve the agreement  did not even read the documents containing the false or misleading statements upon which the applicant has relied  let alone pay any regard to them   It follows that the applicant s case for contravention of s   must fail   Given the contravention of s   which has been found the Court has power under s  a  to declare the   Agreement void  as the applicant would wish the Court to do  provided that a proper case for such an order was made out under s   of the Act   By virtue of s   of the Act it is clear that an order declaring the   Agreement  void  would only take effect from the date of the order or a later date specified in the order   In my opinion  an order declaring that the   Agreement was void would not breathe new life into the   Agreement as a pre reform certified agreement  By virtue of clause   of Schedule   to the Act  when taken with clause   the   Agreement ceased to be in operation when the   Agreement was lodged with the Employment Advocate and once it ceased operating  it could not be revived  To use the words of clause   it could  never operate again in relation to  Karellas  employees  This may seem a curious outcome  Nevertheless  s   of the Act made it clear that the   Agreement came into operation on the day that it was lodged with the Employment Advocate and that it did so notwithstanding that  relevantly  the requirements of s  a  had not been met in relation to it   Had s  a  empowered the Court to make an order declaring the   Agreement to be void ab initio  it certainly would have been a curious outcome to have the   Agreement permanently displaced  But that is not what the legislature had in mind  Plainly  when one has regard to the terms of s   of the Act it is apparent that what the legislature intended was that from the date of the relevant order declaring the agreement void or a later date specified in that order  the relevant workplace agreement would cease to have any force and effect citedThe State of Victoria v Sutton   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In relation to the use of the word  void  Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ said in The State of Victoria v Sutton   HCA         CLR    Victoria v Sutton  at      Windeyer J said of the term  void  that it  has never been an easy word  and pointed out that it did not necessarily mean that the void act had no legal effect at all  In particular  where     a disposition between two parties is described as  void  at the will of a third  the preferred construction is to read  void  as  voidable         footnote omitted  In Victoria v Sutton   Kirby J expounded upon the meaning of the word  void  at   as follows         The word  void  is inherently ambiguous       It sometimes means that the act in question has not  and never has had  any legal effect  void ab initio   But sometimes it means that the act becomes void as against the world or against those who cannot enforce or take advantage of it subsequently  void ex post facto    Void  is in some contexts treated as synonymous with  voidable  or voidable at the election of the party for whose benefit a legal rule makes the transaction void  The task of a court  in differentiating between the available meanings of the word  is to ascertain the objective of the lawmaker in the particular circumstances  It is to discover the meaning to be attributed to the word which is natural to its context  Many past cases demonstrate that the use of the word  void  presents a problem of statutory construction  There is no settled meaning    footnotes omitted  In the foregoing circumstances the question arises as to whether the Court should exercise its discretion to declare the   Agreement void  By virtue of s   of the Act the Court may exercise its discretion favourably to the applicant only to the extent that the Court considers appropriate to remedy the following     a  all or part of any loss or damage resulting from the contravention by Karellas of s   of the Act   b  prevention or reduction of all or part of that loss or damage   The key words in s   are  resulting from  the contravention citedBrooks v Burns Philp Trustee Co  Ltd    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The reference to the observations of Windeyer J were to his Honour s judgment in Brooks v Burns Philp Trustee Co  Ltd    HCA         CLR   at     where his Honour said       Void   Invalid   Unenforceable      I have in this judgment used the words  invalid   unenforceable  or  ineffectual  as  in similar cases  other judges have done  Other words and phrases can be used  For example  in the judgment under appeal the appellant s covenant is called  illegal and void   A similar promise was called by Asquith L J   void and unenforceable  Gaisberg v  Storr      The words used do not matter if the actual legal result they are used to express be not in doubt or debate  But it has always seemed to me likely to lead to error      to adopt first one of the familiar legal adjectives    illegal   void   unenforceable   ineffectual   nugatory    and then having given an act a label  to deduce from that its results in law  That is to invert the order of inquiry  and by so doing to beg the question  and allow linguistics to determine legal rights  That need not happen if words be used  as Hobbes said that by wise men they should be  only as counters to reckon with  but reckoning becomes difficult if the values of counters are not constant  There may be no difficulty for adherents to Humpty Dumpty s principle as expounded by him to Alice  But his latitude and his command of his words as his servants are not generally allowed to lawyers  They are called upon to interpret other men s words      The word  void  has never been an easy word  as is pointed out in the second Australian edition of Cheshire and Fifoot s Law of Contract   p     It is commonly said that when it describes a juristic act it means that it was always devoid of legal consequences  But this in itself is ambiguous  as witness the difference  which I have emphasized by italics  between the first edition of Sir George Paton s Text Book of Jurisprudence   and the second edition    In the first it was said  at p    that  if the defects  of a juristic act  are such that the act has no legal effect at all   then the act is said to be void   The relevant passage in the latter edition  at p    states   more accurately perhaps  and influenced probably by Professor Cohn s remarks in Law Quarterly Review  vol      at pp                A defect may make a juristic act either void or voidable  If the defect is such that the act is devoid of the legal results contemplated then the act is said to be void  A void act is sometimes said to be a nullity in law  but this is not strictly so  as an act void in its primary intent may nevertheless have an effect in another way    footnote omitted referred toDemagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky     FCR   The applicant relied upon the judgment of the Full Court in Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky     FCR    Demagogue  to support the proposition that  loss or damage  did not have to be loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded  That may well be correct but Demagogue may be distinguished on the basis that it concerned misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Trade Practices Act   in the form of non disclosure by a vendor of unusual features relating to access to land located at Noosa Heads in the State of Queensland  which the purchasers  who sought relief under s   and or  A  of the Trade Practices Act   acquired by entering into a contract which they would never have entered into had they been aware of the true position with regard to access to the site  The trial judge had clearly found a causal link between the misleading and deceptive conduct and the purchasers  entry into the contract  see per Black CJ at   and per Gummow J at     Each of Black CJ  Gummow J and Cooper J found that the expression  loss or damage  where used in s   of the Trade Practices Act   and which corresponded in many respects with s   of the Act in the present case  could include being saddled with an agreement which had been induced by misleading or deceptive conduct  At   Black CJ said         I consider it to be clear that the loss or damage contemplated by s  A  is not limited to loss or damage in the s    monetary damages  sense but was intended to include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract unconscionably induced            In my view  the loss or damage for the purposes of both ss   and  A  will include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract induced by misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s    Proof of loss or damage of the sort that would be an  amount of     loss or damage  for the purpose of s   is not a prerequisite for the grant of relief under either subsection   Gummow J  in his leading judgment  said at        The phrase  loss or damage  appears in s   and in various subsections of s   particularly subss   and  A   In my view  on this appeal nothing turns upon the circumstance that in a given case subs   may be attracted only by reason of the making of an application under s   to recover the amount of the loss or damage suffered by conduct in contravention in  sic  a provision of Pt IV or V      Section   is concerned with the recovery of  the amount of the loss or damage  suffered by conduct in contravention of the Act  Section   requires that the court consider that its order will compensate  in whole or in part  for the loss or damage or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage  Section  A  requires that the orders concerned will compensate in whole or in part for the loss or damage suffered  or likely to be suffered  or will  prevent or reduce the loss or damage suffered  or likely to be suffered           Thus  whilst s   is concerned with the recovery of an amount representing the loss or damage  s   is concerned with compensation  whether in whole or in part  for loss or damage and with the reduction of loss or damage  and with the prevention of loss or damage which is likely to be suffered  In the phrase  likely to be suffered  the word  likely  speaks of a  real chance or possibility  Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd     FCR   at        One significant distinction between ss   and   is the quia timet operation of s    On the appeal to the High Court in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at    Mason CJ  Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ said             The Act draws a clear distinction in Pt VI between loss or damage which may be recovered under s   and the likelihood of loss or damage which may be prevented  or  if not prevented  reduced by one of the remedies under s             Deane J said  at   that the statute in s   expressly distinguishes between the actual suffering of loss or damage and the likelihood  or contingency  that loss or damage will be suffered in the future  This emphasises that the phrase  the loss or damage  at least in s   may be concerned with more than pecuniary recovery as understood in the law of damages in tort  tort law postulates the commission  already accomplished  of a wrong  Leeds Industrial Co operative Society Ltd v Slack   AC   at            Further  unlike the position at general law with the administration of the equitable remedy of rescission of contracts  orders under s   may be made not only against parties to the contract but also against third parties  being persons involved  within the meaning of s  B  in the contravention as a result of which the plaintiff entered into the contract  Lezam Pty Ltd v Seabridge Australia Pty Ltd     at   Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio     at        The respondents complain that they entered into a contract as the result of reliance upon conduct which contravened s    Why should they not be described as having suffered loss or damage  within the meaning of s   by that very reliance and entry into legal relations from which they otherwise would have abstained  If that contract be declared void ab initio as provided for in s  a  will that not reduce this loss or damage  Cooper J also proceeded in Demagogue to expound upon the meaning of the phrase  loss or damage   At   Gummow J expressed his agreement with what Cooper J said in that regard  Cooper J s observations were recorded at     as follows     Section   provides both the source of the court s power to provide a remedy and the remedy itself  It is therefore important to distinguish clearly between the need to establish the factual circumstances necessary to enliven the power of the court to grant relief and the circumstances which are relevant to the nature of the relief which it is appropriate to grant      The circumstance in s   which empowers the court to grant relief is a finding that a party  has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct of another person   That is a question of fact      The words  loss or damage  where they appear in s   are to be construed by the application of the ordinary canons of statutory construction  This requires giving the words their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear      The ordinary meaning of loss is  detriment or disadvantage resulting from deprivation or change of conditions    Shorter Oxford English Dictionary  rd ed  Revised    at     Damage  is defined as    Loss or detriment caused by hurt or injury affecting estate  condition or circumstances  Arch     Injury  harm     Shorter Oxford English Dictionary at        There are two matters within the context of s   which colour the meaning of the phrase in the section  The first is that the loss or damage has been or is likely to be caused by conduct in contravention of the Act  The second is that any order made is to compensate for the loss or damage  However  the compensation is not limited to the payment of a money sum or damages as an examination of s   discloses  Nor is there anything in s   which would limit the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered to pecuniary loss or damage  In particular  s  a   declaring a contract or collateral agreement to be void  and s  ba   refusing to enforce any or all provisions of a contract  take as their point of focus the denial of the benefit of a contract to a person whose proscribed conduct has caused loss or damage to the other party  Such an order has the consequential effect of releasing the innocent party from the obligations imposed by the contract  In the context of providing compensation it is the obligations imposed by such a contract which is the loss or damage which the order seeks to redress      In my opinion  loss or damage  in s   means no more than the disadvantage which is suffered by a person as the result of the act or default of another   Halsbury s Laws of England  th ed  Vol   par   in the circumstances provided for in the section      The phrase  loss or damage  in s   does not involve any concept of quantum or assessment of damages  see Barneys Blu Crete Pty Ltd v Australian Workers  Union     FLR   at   where Northrop J expressed a similar view as to the use of the same phrase in s  D a  of the Act  This is to be contrasted with the context of the phrase in s   where it is  the amount of the loss or damage  which is recoverable by action  For the purpose of s   it is the quantum or assessment of the loss or damage suffered in monetary terms which must be demonstrated  The rules as to the assessment of damages or the measure of damages in an action for deceit are relevant to the question of loss or damage under s    However those rules are not relevant to the meaning of the phrase in s        The distinction between  loss or damage  and  the amount of the loss or damage  is reflected in the terms of section  K of the Act  The section provides           In this Act              a  a reference to loss or damage  other than a reference to the amount of any loss or damage  includes a reference to injury  and      b  a reference to the amount of any loss or damage includes a reference to damages in respect of an injury             There are practical reasons why this should be so  The prima facie rule that the measure of damage in deceit is the difference between the value of the property and the price paid is inappropriate where the contract is not completed  Myers v Transpacific Pastoral Co Pty Ltd   ATPR   at    Where the contract remains unrescinded the costs associated with the conveyance of the property are costs arising out of the contract and of performing the obligations imposed thereby  Until the contract is rescinded such costs and expenses do not take on the character of costs and expenses thrown away and as such recoverable loss and damage under the general law  The court is not restricted in granting a remedy under s   by the limitations under the general law of a party s right to rescind for breach of contract or misrepresentation   Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd     ALR   at      Likewise the limitations under the general law as to the assessment of damages and the measure of damage ought not be imported into a definition of  loss or damage  in s   to limit the category of actionable loss or damage      To adopt a definition of  loss or damage  for the purpose of s   which includes the disadvantage of incurring contractual obligations that would not have been incurred but for the conduct complained of does not mean that the granting of a proper discretionary remedy necessarily leads to the setting aside of such a contract or to a refusal to enforce it according to its terms  That result will always depend upon the particular circumstances which exist when the occasion calls for an exercise of the powers under s   of the Act       The problem for the applicant and Ms Stringer in particular  in the present case  is that there is simply no evidence of any loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded  if otherwise appropriate and available  in her favour or in favour of any of Karellas  other employees  Nor is there any evidence that the approval  making and or coming into operation of the   Agreement resulted from the contravention by Karellas of s   of the Act   Section   of the Act confines the Court s power to declare a workplace agreement void to those cases where the relevant loss or damage to be remedied  prevented or reduced is loss or damage  resulting from  the relevant contravention  In order to establish a causal link between the contravention of s   of the Act and Karellas employees becoming saddled with the   Agreement in this case  evidence would be required from employees of Karellas who voted to approve the agreement indicating that had it not been for one or other of the misrepresentations contained in the four page document or the three page document put around by Karellas  they would not have voted as they did   In the absence of any evidence on the issue  the Court may not make an order declaring the   Agreement void  It is unnecessary  in the circumstances  to address the proper exercise of the Court s discretion to grant relief under s  a  of the Act were it otherwise able to do so   In the foregoing circumstances  there should be a declaration that the employee collective agreement styled  Karellas Investments Pty Ltd Employee Collective Agreement   was not approved in accordance with s   of the Act  Otherwise  the Amended Application filed in Court on   May   should be dismissed   Given the terms of s   of the Act  there should be no order as to costs     Appendix A                         Appendix B                       I certify that the preceding one hundred and nineteen   numbered paragraphs together with
