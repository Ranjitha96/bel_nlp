Bryant v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAssociated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation     KB   As to unreasonableness  Mr Bryant submitted that the Tribunal s reasoning  whereby it placed equal weight on sleep apnoea and or psychological factors as accounting for the Applicant s symptoms  was unreasonable and perverse  It was submitted that no Tribunal acting reasonably could have made that decision or  alternatively the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come that decision  and as such the decision was vitiated by what was termed   Wednesbury unreasonableness    The submission in regard to sleep apnoea and psychological factors were put by Mr Bryant in this way  Sleep apnoea was mentioned in the Statement of Facts and Contentions  but was not considered as a possible cause of headaches until Dr Lethlean s report of   November    Even then  so it was submitted  it was considered as a possible cause and not the most common cause of headaches  Further  Dr Lethlean was not an expert on sleep apnoea and no evidence was called on the subject  Psychological factors were submitted to be a non issue  Such factors  it was noted  were not included in the Statements of Facts and Contentions of the parties  were mentioned only once in the transcript and were not the subject of closing address by either counsel  Psychological factors were first raised in Dr Lethlean s report of   November    This issue was outside of Dr Lethlean s expertise   The Commission submitted  by reference to the Full Court decision in Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Betkhoshabeh   FCA         ALD     that the decision of the Tribunal  at most  falls within the scope of a decision where the facts were such that an opposite conclusion would have been open to the decision maker  and as such does not evidence an error of law  The Commission also pointed to the evidence before the Tribunal  particularly that of Dr Lethlean  which questioned the extent of the impairment resulting from the injury and submitted that it was therefore open to the Tribunal to proceed as it did  The Commission sought further to support these submissions by referring to the high threshold for a determination of   Wednesbury unreasonableness  citing Lord Green MR in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation     KB   at   and also the observation of Gummow J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR   at       that it is very difficult to show unreasonableness where the facts are such that reasonable minds could reasonably differ   The submission for Mr Bryant that this constituted   Wednesbury unreasonableness  misconceives the nature of that type of error of law  As Gummow J explained in Minister for Immigration and Multi cultural Affairs v Eshetu at     this descriptor  derived from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation   refers to that body of administrative law which is concerned with the judicial review of the abuse of discretionary powers  When standing in the Commission s place so as to decide whether Mr Bryant had an entitlement to compensation under s   of the SRC Act the Tribunal was not exercising a discretionary power  Neither does s   of the SRC Act posit an eligibility test grounded in a state of administrative satisfaction to a state of affairs  The principles attending the judicial review of a decision made under this type of statutory provision were comprehensively discussed by Gummow J in Eshetu s case  but are of no present relevance  That is not to say that no error of law is revealed  If the Tribunal reaches a conclusion critical to its determination without any material to support that conclusion that is an appealable error of

consideredBramwell v Repatriation Commission     ALR   For its part  the Commission submitted  principally by reference to Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR     that  questions of liability to pay compensation under s   of the SRC Act can involve  primary aspects  of liability such as whether there is an  injury  for the purposes of that Act  The Commission also emphasised that the Tribunal was not obliged  subject to procedural fairness considerations  to limit the conduct of its review to the case presented by the parties  citing Grant v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD   and Bramwell v Repatriation Commission     ALR   in support of this proposition followedCanute v Comcare   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In aid of this submission  Mr Bryant pointed to observations made by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare     ALD     at   to the effect that the powers and discretions conferred on the Tribunal by s   of the AAT Act are conferred for the purpose of reviewing the decision under review and are not powers able to be exercised at large  Reference was also made to observation of the Full Court of the High court in Canute v Comcare   HCA         CLR     at     taken up by Greenwood J in Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission     ALD     at   to the effect that the Approved Guide fell for application through the  prism  of the injury which the claimant had suffered resulting in permanent impairment  Reliance was also placed upon the proposition  flowing from the rejection of a submission to the contrary by Jenkinson J in Comcare v Amorebieta     FCR     at   that s   of the SRC Act was not to be construed in a way which admitted of an assessment of the degree of permanent impairment proportionate to the causal contribution of the incident giving rise to the compensation claim   In Canute v Comcare   HCA         CLR     in a joint judgement  a Full Court of the High Court emphasised by repetition   CLR at     and   that the task under s   involved the assessment of compensation   resulting from an injury    As the High Court put it  the occurrence of an  injury   both actuates and defines the ambit of Comcare s duty under s   of  the SRC Act    CLR at      The suffering of an  injury  as defined is antecedent to that assessment task which in this case fell on the Commission rather than Comcare to undertake because Mr Bryant was a member of the Defence Force   As is revealed by the portion of para   of the Tribunal s reasons emphasised in the excerpt quoted above  the Tribunal seems to have conceived its task to be to decide whether it was satisfied that the Mr Bryant suffered a degree of whole person impairment   which can be attributable to service life    With respect  Mr Bryant s entitlement  if any  to permanent impairment compensation was not just to the extent that his employment with the Commonwealth contributed to that impairment to a material degree  It was to compensation in an amount which reflected the degree of permanent impairment resulting from an injury   Canute v Comcare revealed one type of impermissible conflation of inquiry in the determination of permanent impairment compensation  the treating as relevant to the inquiry as to the degree of permanent impairment resulting from an injury something which independently satisfies the statutory definition of an  injury   This case  in my opinion  reveals another  the treating of employment contribution as relevant to the determination of the degree of permanent impairment  resulting from an injury   The contributors to an ailment may be multi factorial  If an employee s employment by the Commonwealth contributed in a material degree to the employee s ailment  than that employee has suffered a  disease  and thus an  injury  for the purposes of the SRC Act   That  injury  then provides the  prism  through which permanent impairment compensation  in respect of the injury  is determined  s   SRC Act   So far as that  injury  is concerned  and subject of course to the Tribunal s ability to revisit that antecedent question  the focus of inquiry then shifts to the degree of permanent impairment resulting from that injury as assessed by reference to the Approved Guide  In that inquiry  it is nothing to the point that there may be other contributors to the  injury  apart from employment with the Commonwealth   This type of conflation of inquiry is also evident in part of the emphasised portion of para   of the Tribunal s reasons   the headaches reported could not then be attributable to service life and therefore be compensable under Table      The reference to  compensable under Table     is also  strictly  erroneous as the source of the liability to pay permanent impairment compensation is s   of the SRC Act   not the Approved Guide  This reference though was not the subject of any complaint and seems to me to be but infelicity or casualness of expression consideredComcare v Amorebieta     FCR   In aid of this submission  Mr Bryant pointed to observations made by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare     ALD     at   to the effect that the powers and discretions conferred on the Tribunal by s   of the AAT Act are conferred for the purpose of reviewing the decision under review and are not powers able to be exercised at large  Reference was also made to observation of the Full Court of the High court in Canute v Comcare   HCA         CLR     at     taken up by Greenwood J in Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission     ALD     at   to the effect that the Approved Guide fell for application through the  prism  of the injury which the claimant had suffered resulting in

SRC Act was not to be construed in a way which admitted of an assessment of the degree of permanent impairment proportionate to the causal contribution of the incident giving rise to the compensation claim   If Mr Bryant s headaches were solely the result of an ailment other than the accepted injury   muscle tension type headaches  condition  then no compensation under s   of the Act would be payable in respect of the accepted injury  That would be because  whatever degree of permanent impairment from which Mr Bryant suffered  that impairment would not have  resulted from  that accepted injury  The task for the Tribunal was to decide for itself the degree of permanent impairment which had  resulted from  the accepted injury  Comcare v Amorebieta     FCR     at     That is not though  as its reasons evidence  how the Tribunal conceived its task  The Tribunal  wrongly  conceived that its task was to assess the impairment that had  resulted from service life   This aspect of the jurisdictional challenge made by the Appellant has merit   Further comment is also necessary in relation to the way in which the Tribunal dealt with this matter consideredComcare v Emery   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  For like reasons  albeit at the cost of an elongation of these reasons  it is necessary to set out certain passages from the Tribunal s reasons under each of these headings         The cause and relationship to service of the applicant s headaches        There are conflicting medical opinions on the cause of the applicant s headaches  either that they are derived from his service related rugby neck injury  or that they are due to tension headaches                             Neurologists Dr Beran  Exhibit   folio   and Dr Lethlean  Exhibit   folio   both diagnosed tension headaches       The Tribunal finds that the evidence for a cervical spinal cause for the applicant s headaches is inconclusive  On balance it favours the diagnosis of tension headaches made by both Neurologists       However  further to this  the Tribunal finds that the diagnosis of the nature of the headache is incidental  Both Dr Rowe  Exhibit   folio   and Dr Lethlean   ibid folio   the only doctors asked if the applicant s headaches are due to his Navy service  have determined that they are      Whether the applicant s headache condition is permanent        Both Dr Rowe  Exhibit   folio   and Dr Lethlean   ibid folio   have concluded that the applicant s headache condition is permanent  The other medical witnesses have provided no opinion        The applicant s whole person impairment from his headache condition        Again there is conflicting medical opinion on this  Dr Rowe has assessed that the applicant suffers   whole person impairment from his headache condition  whereas Dr Lethlean assessed this at         Based on the reports by the various medical specialists together with the oral evidence provided  results in our placing greater weight on the evidence of Dr Lethlean in preference to the evidence of Dr Rowe  While both these specialists have provided more recent reports  Dr Rowe conceded that his opinion is based essentially on the applicant s statements  However  of greater importance and weight was the fact that Dr Lethlean  while agreeing with Mr King Scott  Counsel for the applicant  that it is possible to regard the factual evidence as affecting the activities of daily living of the applicant  he did not resile from his opinion that the applicant has a   whole person impairment and did so on the basis of the principle that such an assessment should only be altered following a re assessment  A re assessment had not occurred between the date of his latest report on   November   where he observed some significant differences in the symptoms described by the applicant in his statement of   June   in comparison to his examination of the applicant some   months earlier on   October      o In addition  his reasoning was quite analytical  He emphasised if a clinical re assessment was to occur  that a psychiatric assessment should also be included  as he formed the view that Mr Bryant s symptoms were multi factorial  He further stated that sleep apnoea could also account for the present level of impairment and if that was found to be so  then it would not be compensable under Table      If sleep apnoea was a major cause of the applicant s headaches  then  not only would it be non compensable under Table     but it would explain the condition as being not stabilised and that there may be potential for a reduction in the level of headaches by further medical treatment  We therefore regarded Dr Lethlean s report as providing greater cogency or weight of evidence            In relation to the above conditions  it is essentially a contest as to whether or not the applicant satisfies the   whole person impairment criteria  If he does not  then the   whole person impairment criteria is more appropriate  In relation to the   criteria  the applicant has described to Dr Rowe and in his other evidence  that he has attacks which occur   times or more per year  Of importance is whether they cause  minor interference with activities of daily living  or are readily reversed by medication  In relation to the evidence provided to Dr Lethlean  the frequency of headaches seems to have reduced from   to October   when the applicant was examined by Dr Lethlean  But the activities described do not require any particular functions of daily living to be satisfied although  due weight must be given to the psychosocial aspect of the function i e  the ability to stand may be impaired because one cannot stand straight  or stand still or stand around or even stand by without some supervision or direction  Commission for the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees v Emery   FCA         ALD   at         That principle must be read in the context that all the attacks must be considered in making the assessment of frequency  not merely those of relevant severity   McKenna v Repatriation Commission     ALD    Of direct relevance is the case of Re O Rourke and Comcare  AAT     August   which was a case involving an assessment of severe headaches on the activities of daily living as required by Table      The decision in that case noted that the   level of impairment requires  minor interferences with activities of daily living   Activities of daily living refers to primary biological and psychosocial functions   Minor interference  it was said must be greater than  no  interference but less than  most  interference  The Tribunal there held that a global view or assessment is more appropriate  that on some occasions  one activity of daily living may be so affected in both biological and psychosocial terms as to constitute a minor interference with activities of daily living  whereas in another case there could be multiple activities of daily living which are affected at such a low level but which could still be described as constituting a  minor interference  with activities of daily living  It was said however   i t is highly unlikely  when taking a global approach to this assessment  that a small infraction of one  activity of daily living  could properly be described as  minor interference with activities of daily living        In assessing the evidence presented against these criteria and their interpretations as outlined above  we have also kept in mind the underlying principles which inform Table      In O Rourke s case it was found that the frequency of headaches suffered by the applicant there was approximately   per year  greater than the standard in the criteria of   or more  and that the duration of the headaches involved several hours and the severity at the upper level  However  the Tribunal there found that the level of impairment under Table     was   as the attacks did not interfere with activities of daily living as defined in the glossary of the Guide  In the present case  the applicant has to rest or stretch and sometimes even double checks his work  These responses to stimuli could be regarded as being on the one hand  part of the ordinary incidence of life which results from tiredness  stress in the workplace or other influencing factors  There is the possibility however  that those activities of daily living may be experiencing a  minor interference  as defined  However  we have concluded on the balance of probabilities that the likelihood of the latter conclusion is far outweighed by the factors raised by Dr Lethlean that sleep apnoea  for example  could equally account for the symptoms described  On that basis  the headaches reported could not then be attributable to service life and therefore be compensable under Table      That is not to detract from the acceptance of liability for the original injury or even that headaches may be related to the original injury  However  the doubt raised by Dr Lethlean that some psychological factors may be involved lends credence to the requirement for clinical re assessment including psychiatric assessment  The time lapse between Dr Lethlean s original and more recent reports  his observation of apparent inconsistencies as specified in his latest report should not be viewed lightly and his suggestion of a clinical re assessment would accord with the best evidence rule in order to make the correct or preferable decision       Having considered all of the evidence  we are satisfied that the applicant does not suffer a   whole person impairment which can be attributable to service life   in terms of s   of the Act  An amount of compensation is therefore not payable under that provision       Emphasis added  Though the term is a collective one it does not  with respect  follow that the  global approach  is thereby mandated  Indeed  in its reference to one ADL being so affected as to fall to be described as  minor interference  the Tribunal itself in O Rourke seems to counsel against the adoption of such an approach in such a case  Be that as it may  the correct way to approach assessment in respect of those parts of the Approved Guide which make reference to the collective term  activities of daily living  is that stated by Spender J in Comcare v Emery   FCA         ALD     at    The Tribunal referred to the use of  Activities of Daily Living  in other Tables of the Guide  and said that certain conclusions could be reached  The Tribunal said     The first is that to find  some supervision and direction in ADL was needed  there is no requirement that all  or most  or any one of the particular functions listed in the glossary definition have been adversely affected  Another conclusion is that the term ADL is not limited to the basic mechanics of an activity but due weight must be given to the psychosocial aspect of the function ie the ability to stand may be impaired because one cannot stand straight  or stand still or stand around on even standby without some supervision or direction   It seems to me that no criticism can be taken of the correctness of this passage  save for the ambiguity in the reference to  any one of the particular functions listed in the glossary definition   If that reference was meant to read  any particular one  was necessary to have been adversely affected  no complaint could be made   These observations were made in relation to the construction of the collective term  activities of daily living  in the context of Table     of the Approved Guide  which referred to a  need for supervision and direction in activities of daily living  They apply mutatis mutandis to the construction of that collective term in Table      Thus there is no requirement that there be  minor interference  with all  or most or any particular one of the activities listed in the definition of that collective term before a finding of  minor interference  may be made  To the extent that the  global approach  counselled in O Rourke suggests otherwise  and that seems to be how the Tribunal in the present case understood it  it is inconsistent with the decision of this Court in Emery and should not be followed by the Tribunal consideredComcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In regard to the construction and application of Table     in the Approved Guide  Mr Bryant s submission was that the Tribunal s reliance on an earlier Tribunal decision  O Rourke v Comcare   AATA     led it to apply an incorrect construction of the term  minor interference   Mr Byrant s submissions proceeded as follows  The global approach to  minor interference  in O Rourke v Comcare   is contrary to the approach the Court has taken to interpreting the Guide in Whittaker v Comcare   FCA         FCR   and Comcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR    These cases are  it was submitted  supportive of the proposition that  where there is ambiguity in a phrase  as there is with  minor interference  then the Tribunal should take the approach most favourable to the employee  If the global approach in O Rourke v Comcare has the effect of limiting or reading down the meaning of  minor interference  then it ought not be followed  If an  activity of daily living   ADL  is interrupted  temporarily suspended or ceased altogether because of a headache that amounted  it was submitted  to an interference and whether it is minor or significant depended on the frequency  duration and severity of attacks  Where headaches amount to more than a de minimus interference with ADL  it was submitted that this would then constitute a  minor interference   It was submitted that Mr Bryant s medical history  as provided to Dr Lethlean  which history was assumed to be uncontroversial  would fall within the meaning of  minor interference  so construed and hence amounted to a   impairment under Table     of the Approved Guide   On behalf of the Commission  it was submitted that the comparison between the term  difficulty  as considered in Whittaker v Comcare and Comcare v Fiedler   and the term  interference  as used in Table     of the Approved Guide was not appropriate to support a de minumus argument  In support  the Commission pointed to the observation of the Full Court in Fiedler at   that   There is no reason to think the Tribunal considered that any difficulty with digital dexterity  no matter how slight  was sufficient to come within par   of Table     consideredComcare v Tiscay     FCR   Like the other provisions of the Approved Guide  if competing constructions of Table     are open  that which favours the employee is the one to be preferred  Whittaker v Comcare   FCA         FCR   at      Full Court  citing with approval remarks earlier made by Olney J in Comcare v Tiscay     FCR   at   consideredFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Ors     ALD   In support of these submissions  Mr Bryant pointed to observations by Mason J  as he then was  in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   to the effect that a court may set aside an administrative decision that has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance  or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance  on the ground that the decision is manifestly unreasonable  It was also noted  by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Ors     ALD   and Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR     that these principles apply equally to a decision of the Tribunal consideredGrant v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  For its part  the Commission submitted  principally by reference to Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR     that  questions of liability to pay compensation under s   of the SRC Act can involve  primary aspects  of liability such as whether there is an  injury  for the purposes of that Act  The Commission also emphasised that the Tribunal was not obliged  subject to procedural fairness considerations  to limit the conduct of its review to the case presented by the parties  citing Grant v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD   and Bramwell v Repatriation Commission     ALR   in support of this proposition consideredJordan v Australian Postal Corporation     ALD   The relevant compensable  injury  from which the Tribunal accepted Mr Bryant suffered was a particular type of headache condition   muscle tension type headaches  not  headaches  generally  It may be that it is possible definitively to distinguish the symptoms of  muscle tension type headaches  from those occasioned by  for example  psychological factors or sleep apnoea  Equally  it may to some extent not be possible to draw such a distinction  To the extent that it is not  the Tribunal  like the Commission  was obliged to assess impairment by reference to the totality of impairment  resulting from  the accepted injury on the footing that it was not possible to isolate from that impairment anything which did not result either from another  injury  or from a condition which could never constitute an  injury   A like approach is taken where it is not possible to isolate the impairment flowing from an aggravation of an underlying condition from that flowing from the underlying condition itself  Jordan v Australian Postal Corporation     ALD   at      It is settled that in those circumstances a body such as the Commission or the Tribunal sitting in its place is obliged to make an assessment beneficially in favour of a claimant   In his most recent report  that of   November   Dr Lethlean opined  inter alia         My impression is that psychological factors are the principal ones interfering with the wide range of activities as now described  by Mr Bryant   I would not modify my assessment without the opportunity of re assessing Mr Bryant clinically and discussing his condition  symptoms and restrictions      Mr Bryant s Table   impairment might well be assessed at   WPI  or a higher impairment  but this should     be made with clinical reassessment      On   October   Mr Bryant reported that sleep apoena had been diagnosed  Sleep apnoea in itself can cause  or increase  headaches  concentration and tiredness difficulties  It s possible that this is relevant to his current and continuing difficulties     Emphasis added    As to sleep apnoea  the following answer was elicited in cross examination from Dr Lethlean   So it would be fair to say that your considered opinion  even to this day  is that the diagnosed condition that you have diagnosed for Mr Bryant is a muscle tension headache for which the service is responsible  at least to the extent of being a   contributing factor  Yes  consideredLees v Comcare     ALD   In aid of this submission  Mr Bryant pointed to observations made by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare     ALD     at   to the effect that the powers and discretions conferred on the Tribunal by s   of the AAT Act are conferred for the purpose of reviewing the decision under review and are not powers able to be exercised at large  Reference was also made to observation of the Full Court of the High court in Canute v Comcare   HCA         CLR     at     taken up by Greenwood J in Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission     ALD     at   to the effect that the Approved Guide fell for application through the  prism  of the injury which the claimant had suffered resulting in permanent impairment  Reliance was also placed upon the proposition  flowing from the rejection of a submission to the contrary by Jenkinson J in Comcare v Amorebieta     FCR     at   that s   of the SRC Act was not to be construed in a way which admitted of an assessment of the degree of permanent impairment proportionate to the causal contribution of the incident giving rise to the compensation claim   In Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR     after an exhaustive review of earlier authority  Conti J  with the agreement of Heerey and Dowsett JJ  reached  at           the following conclusions        In my opinion  it should be concluded  upon the correct construction of the SRC Act   and in particular of the provisions thereof upon which I have focused attention in these reasons  that the AAT is empowered to make subsequent findings of fact in relation to the circumstances the subject of decision making under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and also under ss   and   of the SRC Act   where the determination of the first instance decision maker  here of course Telstra  made under the auspices of s   of the SRC Act remains in operation in the sense that it has not been the subject of any inconsistent outcome in the context of a subsequent review by the AAT  The statutory scheme allows for progressive and evolving decision making giving effect to the provisions of ongoing review of relief or entitlements in the nature of course of workers compensation  being review which allows for adjustment or change in the light of events and circumstances which may subsequently happen  The statutory scheme hence reflects a flexible scope for adjustment by way of decisions in the nature of awards to be made subsequently to the determination of s   liability  whether that determination be made in isolation  or in the context of decision making concerning consequential relief that may be required in the light of evolving circumstances  It is therefore a scheme which allows progressively for ongoing relief  and is thus not comparable of course with the process of curial resolution of the traditional common law entitlement of an injured employee for damages as a consequence of the negligent conduct of an employer  The opening words of s    s ubject to this Part     are consistent with the flexibility inherent in the ensuing codification of the various facets of compensation envisaged     The first instance decisions of this Court in Power  Hill and Riddle  which I have reviewed  each reflect in my opinion correctly the operation of the statutory scheme  and in particular its provision for ongoing adjustment designed to accommodate changing circumstances inclusive for instance  as here involved  of changing medical diagnosis  The approach to statutory construction and operation evident in those first instance authorities is not at odds with the approach to statutory construction and operation adopted by the Full Court in Lees subsequently to Power and Hill and prior to Riddle       I would therefore conclude   contrary to the decision of the primary judge  that the AAT below was duly empowered   upon the true construction of the SRC Act and in the events which happened             i  to make findings of fact that effectively undercut the necessary findings of fact made in the initial or original decision of Telstra under s   of the SRC Act to accept liability in respect of Mr Hannaford s claim for compensation  and    ii  to do so in circumstances where the AAT was undertaking its review of whether any compensation should be payable or further payable  for instance under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and or under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and    iii  to do so in the circumstances further where Telstra s s   decision remained in force to the extent that it had not been actually reversed  and had not been the subject of any adverse review per se by the AAT              In short  it matters not  upon the true construction of the SRC Act   that there has never been any reconsideration of the determination of Telstra of   May   whereby liability under s   thereof for Mr Hannaford s claim originally made on   May   had been accepted      Emphasis added  citations for cases referred to in the passage quoted omitted  These conclusions as to the operation of the AAT Act  in the context of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Tribunal by s   of the SRC Act were reached after  materially  consideration of what had been said on the subject by an earlier Full Court in Lees v Comcare     AAR    They bind me as much as they bound the Tribunal  Given that  there is no utility in a rehearsal of earlier authority  Rather  the task is to ascertain how those conclusions operate on the facts of the present case   Here  as it was entitled to do in its administration of the SRC Act   the Commission chose to bifurcate the process of making of determinations in response to a claim made by Mr Bryant  via his solicitors  on   July   to extend the Commission s existing liability to pay compensation under the SRC Act so as to include a headache condition and to reassess his lump sum impairment compensation entitlement accordingly  Initially  on   January   the

Such an appeal lies only on a question of law  s   Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    AAT Act   A number of what are said to be questions of law are specified in the notice of appeal  as follows  THE QUESTIONS OF LAW raised on appeal are       a  Whether  in view of the finding that the accepted injury of muscle tension headaches was permanent  it was for the Applicant to call evidence to satisfy the Tribunal as to the level of impairment that there were not other causes that might influence the severity  frequency and or level of impairment of the headaches   b  Whether the decision of the Tribunal in finding that sleep apnoea and or psychological factors could equally account for his headache symptoms was so manifestly unreasonable as to amount to an error of law   c  Whether the Tribunal in taking account of psychological factors failed to consider that such factors were a sequelae of headaches and therefore compensable under Section   in light of the admissions and findings that had already made   d  Whether in reviewing the determination under Section   and   the Tribunal should have considered psychological factors or sleep apnoea as causes of the Applicant s headaches in the absence of any expert to that effect   e  Whether the Tribunal applied Table     correctly when considering what constituted minor interference with activities of daily living   f  Whether the manner of assessment of headaches under Table     in O Rourke v Comcare   AATA   was the correct test to be applied   g  Whether  in assessing the level of impairment under Table     the Tribunal must be satisfied on medical evidence of the criteria in the Table or whether the Applicant s evidence alone  if accepted  would be sufficient  Section   of the SRC Act makes provision for the payment of permanent impairment compensation  It provides        Compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment       Where an injury to an employee results in a permanent impairment  Comcare is liable to pay compensation to the employee in respect of the injury     For the purpose of determining whether an impairment is permanent  Comcare shall have regard to             a  the duration of the impairment   b  the likelihood of improvement in the employee s condition   c  whether the employee has undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment  and   d  any other relevant matters              Subject to this section  the amount of compensation payable to the employee is such amount  as is assessed by Comcare under subsection   being an amount not exceeding the maximum amount at the date of the assessment     The amount assessed by Comcare shall be an amount that is the same percentage of the maximum amount as the percentage determined by Comcare under subsection       Comcare shall determine the degree of permanent impairment of the employee resulting from an injury under the provisions of the approved Guide     The degree of permanent impairment shall be expressed as a percentage     Subject to section     if             a  the employee has a permanent impairment other than a hearing loss  and   b  Comcare determines that the degree of permanent impairment is less than             an amount of compensation is not payable to the employee under this section   The reference in s   to the  approved Guide  is a reference to the  Guide to the Assessment of the Degree of Permanent Impairment  approved pursuant to s   of the SRC Act   So far as material  that section provides        Approved Guide       Comcare may  from time to time  prepare a written document  to be called the  Guide to the Assessment of the Degree of Permanent Impairment  setting out             a  criteria by reference to which the degree of the permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury shall be determined   b  criteria by reference to which the degree of non economic loss suffered by an employee as a result of an injury or impairment shall be determined  and   c  methods by which the degree of permanent impairment and the degree of non economic loss  as determined under those criteria  shall be expressed as a percentage              Comcare may  from time to time  by instrument in writing  vary or revoke the approved Guide     A Guide prepared under subsection   and a variation or revocation under subsection   of such a Guide  must be approved by the Minister    A         Where Comcare  a licensee or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is required to assess or re assess  or review the assessment or re assessment of  the degree of permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury  or the degree of non economic loss suffered by an employee  the provisions of the approved Guide are binding on Comcare  the licensee or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  as the case may be  in the carrying out of that assessment  re assessment or review  and the assessment  re assessment or review shall be made under the relevant provisions of the approved Guide     The percentage of permanent impairment or non economic loss suffered by an employee as a result of an injury ascertained under the methods referred to in paragraph  c  may be       In preparing criteria for the purposes of paragraphs  a  and  b  or in varying those criteria  Comcare shall have regard to medical opinion concerning the nature and effect  including possible effect  of the injury and the extent  if any  to which impairment resulting from the injury  or non economic loss resulting from the injury or impairment  may reasonably be capable of being reduced or removed                 For like reasons  albeit at the cost of an elongation of these reasons  it is necessary to set out certain passages from the Tribunal s reasons under each of these headings         The cause and relationship to service of the applicant s headaches        There are conflicting medical opinions on the cause of the applicant s headaches  either that they are derived from his service related rugby neck injury  or that they are due to tension headaches                             Neurologists Dr Beran  Exhibit   folio   and Dr Lethlean  Exhibit   folio   both diagnosed tension headaches       The Tribunal finds that the evidence for a cervical spinal cause for the applicant s headaches is inconclusive  On balance it favours the diagnosis of tension headaches made by both Neurologists       However  further to this  the Tribunal finds that the diagnosis of the nature of the headache is incidental  Both Dr Rowe  Exhibit   folio   and Dr Lethlean   ibid folio   the only doctors asked if the applicant s headaches are due to his Navy service  have determined that they are      Whether the applicant s headache condition is permanent        Both Dr Rowe  Exhibit   folio   and Dr Lethlean   ibid folio   have concluded that the applicant s headache condition is permanent  The other medical witnesses have provided no opinion        The applicant s whole person impairment from his headache condition        Again there is conflicting medical opinion on this  Dr Rowe has assessed that the applicant suffers   whole person impairment from his headache condition  whereas Dr Lethlean assessed this at         Based on the reports by the various medical specialists together with the oral evidence provided  results in our placing greater weight on the evidence of Dr Lethlean in preference to the evidence of Dr Rowe  While both these specialists have provided more recent reports  Dr Rowe conceded that his opinion is based essentially on the applicant s statements  However  of greater importance and weight was the fact that Dr Lethlean  while agreeing with Mr King Scott  Counsel for the applicant  that it is possible to regard the factual evidence as affecting the activities of daily living of the applicant  he did not resile from his opinion that the applicant has a   whole person impairment and did so on the basis of the principle that such an assessment should only be altered following a re assessment  A re assessment had not occurred between the date of his latest report on   November   where he observed some significant differences in the symptoms described by the applicant in his statement of   June   in comparison to his examination of the applicant some   months earlier on   October      o In addition  his reasoning was quite analytical  He emphasised if a clinical re assessment was to occur  that a psychiatric assessment should also be included  as he formed the view that Mr Bryant s symptoms were multi factorial  He further stated that sleep apnoea could also account for the present level of impairment and if that was found to be so  then it would not be compensable under Table      If sleep apnoea was a major cause of the applicant s headaches  then  not only would it be non compensable under Table     but it would explain the condition as being not stabilised and that there may be potential for a reduction in the level of headaches by further medical treatment  We therefore regarded Dr Lethlean s report as providing greater cogency or weight of evidence            In relation to the above conditions  it is essentially a contest as to whether or not the applicant satisfies the   whole person impairment criteria  If he does not  then the   whole person impairment criteria is more appropriate  In relation to the   criteria  the applicant has described to Dr Rowe and in his other evidence  that he has attacks which occur   times or more per year  Of importance is whether they cause  minor interference with activities of daily living  or are readily reversed by medication  In relation to the evidence provided to Dr Lethlean  the frequency of headaches seems to have reduced from   to October   when the applicant was examined by Dr Lethlean  But the activities described do not require any particular functions of daily living to be satisfied although  due weight must be given to the psychosocial aspect of the function i e  the ability to stand may be impaired because one cannot stand straight  or stand still or stand around or even stand by without some supervision or direction  Commission for the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees v Emery   FCA         ALD   at         That principle must be read in the context that all the attacks must be considered in making the assessment of frequency  not merely those of relevant severity   McKenna v Repatriation Commission     ALD    Of direct relevance is the case of Re O Rourke and Comcare  AAT     August   which was a case involving an assessment of severe headaches on the activities of daily living as required by Table      The decision in that case noted that the   level of impairment requires  minor interferences with activities of daily living   Activities of daily living refers to primary biological and psychosocial functions   Minor interference  it was said must be greater than  no  interference but less than  most  interference  The Tribunal there held that a global view or assessment is more appropriate  that on some occasions  one activity of daily living may be so affected in both biological and psychosocial terms as to constitute a minor interference with activities of daily living  whereas in another case there could be multiple activities of daily living which are affected at such a low level but which could still be described as constituting a  minor interference  with activities of daily living  It was said however   i t is highly unlikely  when taking a global approach to this assessment  that a small infraction of one  activity of daily living  could properly be described as  minor interference with activities of daily living        In assessing the evidence presented against these criteria and their interpretations as outlined above  we have also kept in mind the underlying principles which inform Table      In O Rourke s case it was found that the frequency of headaches suffered by the applicant there was approximately   per year  greater than the standard in the criteria of   or more  and that the duration of the headaches involved several hours and the severity at the upper level  However  the Tribunal there found that the level of impairment under Table     was   as the attacks did not interfere with activities of daily living as defined in the glossary of the Guide  In the present case  the applicant has to rest or stretch and sometimes even double checks his work  These responses to stimuli could be regarded as being on the one hand  part of the ordinary incidence of life which results from tiredness  stress in the workplace or other influencing factors  There is the possibility however  that those activities of daily living may be experiencing a  minor interference  as defined  However  we have concluded on the balance of probabilities that the likelihood of the latter conclusion is far outweighed by the factors raised by Dr Lethlean that sleep apnoea  for example  could equally account for the symptoms described  On that basis  the headaches reported could not then be attributable to service life and therefore be compensable under Table      That is not to detract from the acceptance of liability for the original injury or even that headaches may be related to the original injury  However  the doubt raised by Dr Lethlean that some psychological factors may be involved lends credence to the requirement for clinical re assessment including psychiatric assessment  The time lapse between Dr Lethlean s original and more recent reports  his observation of apparent inconsistencies as specified in his latest report should not be viewed lightly and his suggestion of a clinical re assessment would accord with the best evidence rule in order to make the correct or preferable decision       Having considered all of the evidence  we are satisfied that the applicant does not suffer a   whole person impairment which can be attributable to service life   in terms of s   of the Act  An amount of compensation is therefore not payable under that provision       Emphasis added  In regard to the construction and application of Table     in the Approved Guide  Mr Bryant s submission was that the Tribunal s reliance on an earlier Tribunal decision  O Rourke v Comcare   AATA     led it to apply an incorrect construction of the term  minor interference   Mr Byrant s submissions proceeded as follows  The global approach to  minor interference  in O Rourke v Comcare   is contrary to the approach the Court has taken to interpreting the Guide in Whittaker v Comcare   FCA         FCR   and Comcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR    These cases are  it was submitted  supportive of the proposition that  where there is ambiguity in a phrase  as there is with  minor interference  then the Tribunal should take the approach most favourable to the employee  If the global approach in O Rourke v Comcare has the effect of limiting or reading down the meaning of  minor interference  then it ought not be followed  If an  activity of daily living   ADL  is interrupted  temporarily suspended or ceased altogether because of a headache that amounted  it was submitted  to an interference and whether it is minor or significant depended on the frequency  duration and severity of attacks  Where headaches amount to more than a de minimus interference with ADL  it was submitted that this would then constitute a  minor interference   It was submitted that Mr Bryant s medical history  as provided to Dr Lethlean  which history was assumed to be uncontroversial  would fall within the meaning of  minor interference  so construed and hence amounted to a   impairment under Table     of the Approved Guide   The Commission further submitted that  even if O Rourke v Comcare were the source of an incorrect test to apply to the term  minor interference  the Tribunal s reasons do not disclose that it applied such a narrow conception  In support of this  the Commission pointed to the Tribunal s reasons at   as showing that the Tribunal did consider whether there was a de minumus interference  The Commission submitted that  whilst the Tribunal was not satisfied on the evidence that the   impairment was met  this was not because the interference was considered too minor  The Commission finally submitted  in regard to the acceptance of Dr Lethlean s opinion over that of Dr Rowe  that this was a matter of the weight afforded to evidence and did not give rise to any errors of law   In assessing what constituted a  minor interference  with the  activities of daily living  the Tribunal sought to follow an approach adopted in an earlier tribunal case  O Rourke and Comcare     AATA     August   Deputy President Burns   In that case  in a passage which was influential on the Tribunal as constituted for the purposes of the present proceeding  the Tribunal had observed   The Tribunal s considered view is that when assessing whether the relevant attacks cause minor interference with activities of daily living  one must take a global approach  The circumstances of a given case may be such that one ADL is so affected  both biologically and psychosocially  as to fall to be described as  minor interference with activities of daily living   In another case however  where there is a low level of  say psychosocial  interference with several ADL  that could similarly fall to be described as  minor interference with activities of daily living   It is highly unlikely  when taking a global approach to this assessment  that a small infraction of one ADL could properly be described as  minor interference with activities of daily living    Regard to its definition in the Glossary in the Approved Guide discloses that  activities of daily living  is a collective term for a number of activities which an individual needs to perform to live  Its use saves the repeated specification  in those parts of the Approved Guide when reference to the same is directed  of each of the activities mentioned in the definition   Though the term is a collective one it does not  with respect  follow that the  global approach  is thereby mandated  Indeed  in its reference to one ADL being so affected as to fall to be described as  minor interference  the Tribunal itself in O Rourke seems to counsel against the adoption of such an approach in such a case  Be that as it may  the correct way to approach assessment in respect of those parts of the Approved Guide which make reference to the collective term  activities of daily living  is that stated by Spender J in Comcare v Emery   FCA         ALD     at    The Tribunal referred to the use of  Activities of Daily Living  in other Tables of the Guide  and said that certain conclusions could be reached  The Tribunal said     The first is that to find  some supervision and direction in ADL was needed  there is no requirement that all  or most  or any one of the particular functions listed in the glossary definition have been adversely affected  Another conclusion is that the term ADL is not limited to the basic mechanics of an activity but due weight must be given to the psychosocial aspect of the function ie the ability to stand may be impaired because one cannot stand straight  or stand still or stand around on even standby without some supervision or direction   It seems to me that no criticism can be taken of the correctness of this passage  save for the ambiguity in the reference to  any one of the particular functions listed in the glossary definition   If that reference was meant to read  any particular one  was necessary to have been adversely affected  no complaint could be made   These observations were made in relation to the construction of the collective term  activities of daily living  in the context of Table     of the Approved Guide  which referred to a  need for supervision and direction in activities of daily living  They apply mutatis mutandis to the construction of that collective term in Table      Thus there is no requirement that there be  minor interference  with all  or most or any particular one of the activities listed in the definition of that collective term before a finding of  minor interference  may be made  To the extent that the  global approach  counselled in O Rourke suggests otherwise  and that seems to be how the Tribunal in the present case understood it  it is inconsistent with the decision of this Court in Emery and should not be followed by the Tribunal consideredParker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission     ALD   In aid of this submission  Mr Bryant pointed to observations made by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare     ALD     at   to the effect that the powers and discretions conferred on the Tribunal by s   of the AAT Act are conferred for the purpose of reviewing the decision under review and are not powers able to be exercised at large  Reference was also made to observation of the Full Court of the High court in Canute v Comcare   HCA         CLR     at     taken up by Greenwood J in Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission     ALD     at   to the effect that the Approved Guide fell for application through the  prism  of the injury which the claimant had suffered resulting in permanent impairment  Reliance was also placed upon the proposition  flowing from the rejection of a submission to the contrary by Jenkinson J in Comcare v Amorebieta     FCR     at   that s   of the SRC Act was not to be construed in a way which admitted of an assessment of the degree of permanent impairment proportionate to the causal contribution of the incident giving rise to the compensation claim consideredPrice Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   The Commission did not dispute that Mr Bryant had by his notice of appeal engaged the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s   of the AAT Act  Though that statute terms the proceeding an  appeal  it is one in the Court s original jurisdiction  That jurisdiction is only engaged if there truly is a question of law  for that is what s   specifies the appeal is  on  TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR     Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCAFC         ALD     Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR    Having considered the questions specified in the notice  I am satisfied that the Commission was right to adopt this stance consideredRiddle v Telstra Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In support of these submissions  Mr Bryant pointed to observations by Mason J  as he then was  in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   to the effect that a court may set aside an administrative decision that has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance  or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance  on the ground that the decision is manifestly unreasonable  It was also noted  by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Ors     ALD   and Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited   FCA         FCR     that these principles apply equally to a decision of the Tribunal   In Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR     after an exhaustive review of earlier authority  Conti J  with the agreement of Heerey and Dowsett JJ  reached  at           the following conclusions        In my opinion  it should be concluded  upon the correct construction of the SRC Act   and in particular of the provisions thereof upon which I have focused attention in these reasons  that the AAT is empowered to make subsequent findings of fact in relation to the circumstances the subject of decision making under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and also under ss   and   of the SRC Act   where the determination of the first instance decision maker  here of course Telstra  made under the auspices of s   of the SRC Act remains in operation in the sense that it has not been the subject of any inconsistent outcome in the context of a subsequent review by the AAT  The statutory scheme allows for progressive and evolving decision making giving effect to the provisions of ongoing review of relief or entitlements in the nature of course of workers compensation  being review which allows for adjustment or change in the light of events and circumstances which may subsequently happen  The statutory scheme hence reflects a flexible scope for adjustment by way of decisions in the nature of awards to be made subsequently to the determination of s   liability  whether that determination be made in isolation  or in the context of decision making concerning consequential relief that may be required in the light of evolving circumstances  It is therefore a scheme which allows progressively for ongoing relief  and is thus not comparable of course with the process of curial resolution of the traditional common law entitlement of an injured employee for damages as a consequence of the negligent conduct of an employer  The opening words of s    s ubject to this Part     are consistent with the flexibility inherent in the ensuing codification of the various facets of compensation envisaged     The first instance decisions of this Court in Power  Hill and Riddle  which I have reviewed  each reflect in my opinion correctly the operation of the statutory scheme  and in particular its provision for ongoing adjustment designed to accommodate changing circumstances inclusive for instance  as here involved  of changing medical diagnosis  The approach to statutory construction and operation evident in those first instance authorities is not at odds with the approach to statutory construction and operation adopted by the Full Court in Lees subsequently to Power and Hill and prior to Riddle       I would therefore conclude   contrary to the decision of the primary judge  that the AAT below was duly empowered   upon the true construction of the SRC Act and in the events which happened             i  to make findings of fact that effectively undercut the necessary findings of fact made in the initial or original decision of Telstra under s   of the SRC Act to accept liability in respect of Mr Hannaford s claim for compensation  and    ii  to do so in circumstances where the AAT was undertaking its review of whether any compensation should be payable or further payable  for instance under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and or under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and    iii  to do so in the circumstances further where Telstra s s   decision remained in force to the extent that it had not been actually reversed  and had not been the subject of any adverse review per se by the AAT              In short  it matters not  upon the true construction of the SRC Act   that there has never been any reconsideration of the determination of Telstra of   May   whereby liability under s   thereof for Mr Hannaford s claim originally made on   May   had been accepted      Emphasis added  citations for cases referred to in the passage quoted omitted consideredSecretary  Department of Social Security v Murphy   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The submission for Mr Bryant that this constituted   Wednesbury unreasonableness  misconceives the nature of that type of error of law  As Gummow J explained in Minister for Immigration and Multi cultural Affairs v Eshetu at     this descriptor  derived from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation   refers to that body of administrative law which is concerned with the judicial review of the abuse of discretionary powers  When standing in the Commission s place so as to decide whether Mr Bryant had an entitlement to compensation under s   of the SRC Act the Tribunal was not exercising a discretionary power  Neither does s   of the SRC Act posit an eligibility test grounded in a state of administrative satisfaction to a state of affairs  The principles attending the judicial review of a decision made under this type of statutory provision were comprehensively discussed by Gummow J in Eshetu s case  but are of no present relevance  That is not to say that no error of law is revealed  If the Tribunal reaches a conclusion critical to its determination without any material to support that conclusion that is an appealable error of law  Secretary  Department of Social Security v Murphy   FCA         ALD     at     followedTelstra Corporation Limited v

    FCR     that  questions of liability to pay compensation under s   of the SRC Act can involve  primary aspects  of liability such as whether there is an  injury  for the purposes of that Act  The Commission also emphasised that the Tribunal was not obliged  subject to procedural fairness considerations  to limit the conduct of its review to the case presented by the parties  citing Grant v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD   and Bramwell v Repatriation Commission     ALR   in support of this proposition   In Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   FCAFC         FCR     after

claim for compensation  and    ii  to do so in circumstances where the AAT was undertaking its review of whether any compensation should be payable or further payable  for instance under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and or under ss   and   of the SRC Act   and    iii  to do so in the circumstances further where Telstra s s   decision remained in force to the extent that it had not been actually reversed  and had not been the subject of any adverse review per se by the AAT              In short  it matters not  upon the true construction of the SRC Act   that there has never been any reconsideration of the determination of Telstra of   May   whereby liability under s   thereof for Mr Hannaford s claim originally made on   May   had been accepted      Emphasis added  citations for cases referred to in the passage quoted omitted  Mr Bryant did not seek reconsideration of the determination of   January    The status of this determination is identical to the earlier determination made by Telstra  that of   May   analysed by Conti J in Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   Mr Bryant sought reconsideration only of the later    March   determination  described at the outset of these reasons  When  on   July   a decision was made on reconsideration it was that decision  and that decision alone  which became the  reviewable decision  for the purposes of s   of the SRC Act    In the passage from Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford which I have quoted above Conti J does not  in terms  mention s   of the SRC Act   instead referring to ss           and   of the SRC Act   However  his Honour s reference to these particular provisions was clearly by way of example  witness their being preceded by  for instance   The compensation for which s    compensation for medical expenses and the like  s    compensation types for injuries resulting in incapacity  s    compensation for injuries resulting in incapacity where the employee is in receipt of a lump sum benefit  and s    compensation for non economic loss  respectively provide are but particular types of compensation eligibility for which is enlivened  subject to the additional satisfaction of their relevant statutory criteria  once it has been concluded that an  injury  for the purposes of the SRC Act has been suffered  Compensation for an injury which has resulted in permanent impairment  for which s   of the SRC Act provides  is another  Each of these is a type of compensation for which Part II of the SRC Act provides  In these circumstances  there is no material distinction to be drawn between Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford and the present case   It follows  to paraphrase and adapt for present application the conclusions reached in Telstra Corporation Limited v Hannaford   that  providing procedural fairness was observed  the Tribunal was duly empowered  upon the true construction of the SRC Act and in the events which happened   i  to make findings of fact that effectively undercut the necessary findings of fact made in the decision of the Commission under s   of the SRC Act to accept liability in respect of Mr Bryant s claim for compensation  and   ii  to do so in circumstances where the Tribunal was undertaking its review of whether any compensation should be payable or further payable under s   of the SRC Act   and   iii  to do so in the circumstances further where the Commission s s   decision remained in force to the extent that it had not been actually reversed  and had not been the subject of any adverse review per se by the Tribunal   To the extent that Mr Bryant contends for a contrary conclusion  that contention must be rejected   Paragraphs       and   of the Tribunal s reasons evidence that the Tribunal did consider whether Mr Bryant indeed suffered from the hitherto accepted  injury  of  muscle tension type headaches   The Tribunal concluded that he did  In so doing  the Tribunal necessarily accepted that Mr Bryant suffered from a

jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s   of the AAT Act  Though that statute terms the proceeding an  appeal  it is one in the Court s original jurisdiction  That jurisdiction is only engaged if there truly is a question of law  for that is what s   specifies the appeal is  on  TNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ALR     Birdseye v

notice  I am satisfied that the Commission was right to adopt this stance consideredWhittaker v Comcare   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In regard to the construction and application of Table     in the Approved Guide  Mr Bryant s submission was that the Tribunal s reliance on an earlier Tribunal decision  O Rourke v Comcare   AATA     led it to apply an incorrect construction of the term  minor interference   Mr Byrant s submissions proceeded as follows  The global approach to  minor interference  in O Rourke v Comcare   is contrary to the approach the Court has taken to interpreting the Guide in Whittaker v Comcare   FCA         FCR   and Comcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR    These cases are  it was submitted  supportive of the proposition that  where there is ambiguity in a phrase  as there is with  minor interference  then the Tribunal should take the approach most favourable to the employee  If the global approach in O Rourke v Comcare has the effect of limiting or reading down the meaning of  minor interference  then it ought not be followed  If an  activity of daily living   ADL  is interrupted  temporarily suspended or ceased altogether because of a headache that amounted  it was submitted  to an interference and whether it is minor or significant depended on the frequency  duration and severity of attacks  Where headaches amount to more than a de minimus interference with ADL  it was submitted that this would then constitute a  minor interference   It was submitted that Mr Bryant s medical history  as provided to Dr Lethlean  which history was assumed to be uncontroversial  would fall within the meaning of  minor interference  so construed and hence amounted to a   impairment under Table     of the Approved Guide   On behalf of the Commission  it was submitted that the comparison between the term  difficulty  as considered in Whittaker v Comcare and Comcare v Fiedler   and the term  interference  as used in Table     of the Approved Guide was not appropriate to support a de minumus argument  In support  the Commission pointed to the observation of the Full Court in Fiedler at   that   There is no reason to think the Tribunal considered that any difficulty with digital dexterity  no matter how slight  was sufficient to come within par   of Table       Like the other provisions of the Approved Guide  if competing constructions of Table     are open  that which favours the employee is the one to be preferred  Whittaker v Comcare   FCA         FCR   at      Full Court  citing with approval remarks
