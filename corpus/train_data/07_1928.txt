Armacel Pty Limited v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedNews Corporation Ltd v Lenfest Communications Inc     NSWLR   Dr Bell relies  in particular  upon the observations of Giles J in News Corporation Ltd v Lenfest Communications Inc     NSWLR   at    It is convenient to set out the relevant passage of Giles J judgment  which is as follows    But against them stands the compelling consideration that Lenfest is a foreign corporation  served out of Australia  over which the Court asserts jurisdiction only when it is sufficiently shown by News that  inter alia  the proceedings fall within one of the cases in Pt     r  A of the Supreme Court Rules   It is difficult to conceive of leave to serve a subpoena or a notice to produce upon such a foreign defendant who does nothing  that is  does not apply pursuant to Pt   r    or Pt     r  A  in order to assist the plaintiff to establish the Court s jurisdiction  Whatever its strength  and whether or not its strength varies according to the circumstances  from the comity earlier discussed a foreign defendant served outside Australia should not lightly be subjected to the jurisdiction of this Court  but more importantly should not have imposed upon him one of the Court s compulsory processes in aid of establishing the jurisdiction itself  That position is not changed when  while contesting the jurisdiction  the defendant participates in the proceedings with a view to establishing the absence of jurisdiction   It will be noted that Giles J drew attention to the consideration that a respondent seeking to challenge the jurisdiction of the court should not have imposed upon it one of the Court s compulsory processes in aid of establishing the jurisdiction   The rule which Giles J considered in News was  in my view  not materially different from the rules of the Federal Court   and it seems to me that the principle stated by his Honour is one that I ought to follow   The effect of so doing is that I do not consider that at this stage of the proceedings in which the jurisdiction is under challenge  the applicant can invoke the compulsory processes of the Court  The rules of the Federal Court provide that a notice to produce has the force and effect of a subpoena  Accordingly  the issue of a notice to produce must be considered as an attempt to invoke the Court s compulsory processes in the way discussed by Giles J in the News    Mr Wood  who appears for the applicant  submitted that the decision of Giles J is distinguishable  He drew attention to what appears at   to   where his Honour observed that he did not think that Pt   rule   of the Supreme Court Rules should be read down and that it empowers the service of a notice to produce on a foreign party  However  I do not consider those observations of Giles J bear upon the issue before me this morning   I propose to make an order in similar terms to that which was made by Giles J in the News   Accordingly I will order that the respondent is not obliged to produce the documents referred to in the notices to produce until further order of the Court   I will also order that the applicant in the proceedings  Armacel Pty Limited  pay the costs of the notice of motion filed on   December       I certify that the preceding eighteen   numbered

Kosmodemyanskaya as surrogate for the ships Taras Schevchenko  Delphin and Kazakhstan and Tor Shipping Co     FCA   October   Mr Wood also referred me to a decision of a Full Court of this Court in Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v The Owners of the ship Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya as surrogate for the ships Taras Schevchenko  Delphin and Kazakhstan and Tor Shipping Co     FCA   October    Mr Wood referred me to a passage of the judgment of Beaumont  Burchett and Lindgren JJ appearing at    Their Honours there observed that the adjectival rules to be applied at the hearing of the case were those appropriate to a final hearing  so that the Court s power to dispense with the rules of evidence  which is available on an interlocutory hearing  was not available   I do not consider that the observations of the Full Court in Zoya are of assistance  Their Honours were dealing with an entirely different situation  the matter was an admiralty matter in which a party  who was said to be the owner of a vessel that had been arrested  sought an order setting aside the arrest of the ship  There was no question but that the ship was present in Australia s territorial waters   Zoya was not a case in which there was a question of submission to the jurisdiction  the matter involved the construction and application of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   I do not consider that it follows from what their Honours said in that case that the hearing of the motion to set aside the order for service  or the originating process in the present case  is a final hearing in the way in which the admiralty matter was considered to be a final hearing in Zoya  referred toSmall v Commissioner of Railways     SR  NSW    There was debate before me in addition to the issue of principle which I have mentioned  about the terms of the notice to produce  Dr Bell submitted that the notice to produce infringed the fundamental principle  stated in authorities such as Small v Commissioner of Railways     SR  NSW    that a notice to produce or subpoena ought not to be used as a substitute for discovery   That issue does not arise because I have decided the issue of principle in favour of the respondent to the proceedings  Nevertheless  the tentative view that I have come to is the notice to produce is not a substitute for discovery because it does not call for a judgment as to the relevance of particular matters  and at this stage of the proceedings seems to me to sufficiently identify the documents  It is true  as Dr Bell observes  that the notice is drafted in very wide terms and there may be some room for further debate about the scope of the notice  Nevertheless  as I have said  that issue does not call for determination this morning
