SZHQC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The applicant has not identified any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in dismissing his application on the basis that it had no reasonable prospects of success  The grounds contained in the affidavit accompanying the application for leave to appeal are misconceived and no arguable basis has been advanced upon which an appeal might succeed  The applicant has not satisfied the test in D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR   to warrant a grant of leave to appeal  The decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration   The applicant has failed to show that Barnes FM erred in the exercise of her discretion  In the light of the applicant s extensive litigation history  I am satisfied that no substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  even supposing her Honour s decision to be wrong  The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the

review of administrative action and said at   that where an issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time  it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceeding between the parties  Further  in Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR     the High Court stated at   that      Except in the most exceptional circumstances  it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party  after a case had been decided against him  to raise a new argument

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant reapplied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the Tribunal s decision  Federal Magistrate Barnes was satisfied  at
