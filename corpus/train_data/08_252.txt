Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first respondent contends that leave is required for the appellants to raise the first ground of appeal  NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     He further contends that  in any event  as the Tribunal made no relocation finding  no issue arises in connection with whether the Tribunal assessed the issue of relocation properly   With respect to the second ground of appeal  the first respondent submits that the decision to refuse the adjournment application by the Federal Magistrate was made in the exercise of his discretion as trial judge  It was contended that the decision was open to the Federal Magistrate   The first respondent is correct in contending the first ground of appeal was not raised before the Federal Magistrate and  therefore  the appellants require leave  NAJT   FCAFC       FCR    No explanation has been given for the failure to raise this matter in the Federal Magistrates Court  The appellant  of course  was unrepresented both before the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court  In order to determine whether leave should be granted to the appellants to raise this ground on appeal  I shall shortly consider the merits of the ground  As the first respondent asserts  in order to attack any finding of the Tribunal on issues of relocation  there must first be a finding  There was no finding because the question of relocation never arose  It would only have arisen if the appellant had made out his primary contention that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution if he were to return to India  I accept  as the first respondent contends  that because the Tribunal made no relocation finding this ground raises no relevant issues on appeal  Leave must be refused   In relation to the second ground of appeal  although it is desirable that applicants in these cases be represented where possible  it is not a matter of right  The Federal Magistrate refused the adjournment application on the grounds that no satisfactory explanation was provided for the late request for the adjournment and that the lack of merits in the case did not warrant any further delay in the matter  No error has been shown in the Federal Magistrate s exercise of discretion  For that reason  this ground also fails  The decision of SZFDE   HCA   is not relevant to this ground followedSZHTL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au
