Immigration   FCAFC         FCR   at     distinguishedTelstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No       ALD   Telstra relies on the decision of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No       ALD     Telstra v ACCC  No      That case concerned a Pt A competition notice issued by ACCC under s  AKA of the Act  Section  AKA  provided  relevantly  that ACCC must not issue such a notice unless it had first given the addressee carrier or carriage service provider a written notice inviting it to make a submission to ACCC on the proposal to issue the Pt A competition notice   In Telstra v ACCC  No     ACCC sought leave to argue that there should be a severance of the respective parts of the Pt A competition notice pursuant to s   of the AI Act so as to preserve the validity of those parts which had been notified in the notice of invitation  Her Honour held  at     that there could not be a severance  She held that s   had no application to a decision made under an Act as distinct from an instrument  at   and also distinguished between questions of severance involving an  excess of power  and a lack of power to make an entire instrument  at     It suffices to say that s  AKA  was a prohibition on the issuing of a Pt A competition notice unless ACCC had first taken the steps mandated by s  AKA a    The statutory provisions in the present case are different  Section  CR  required ACCC to take specified matters into account in making a decision  namely  a final determination  and s  AQA required ACCC to have regard to any determination of principles relating to the price of access to a declared service if it was required to arbitrate  make a decision upon  an access dispute under Div   in relation to that service
