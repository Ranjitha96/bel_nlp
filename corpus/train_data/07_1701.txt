made for the purpose of obtaining a lease of the Permanent Casino Site  and   or    was made in order to obtain the exclusivity of the casino licence in the first   years of operation  and was

Prepayment was in the nature of a capital payment  the Commissioner also relied on the  surrounding circumstances  or  background  arguing that the legal agreement pursuant to which the Prepayment was made did not reflect the whole arrangement between the parties  City Link Melbourne Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at     City Link  Federal Court     The  surrounding circumstances  or  background  were said by the Commissioner to comprise documents temporally proximate to the Transaction Documents containing descriptions of the Prepayment and the benefit sought to be obtained from making it  Three documents in particular were referred to by the Commissioner  an explanatory memorandum produced by Star City s legal advisors on   April   three days before Star City made its final offer  a letter written by Star City s legal advisors to the NSW State Revenue Office on   April    five days after Star City made its final offer  and a letter written by Star City to the NSW Treasurer on   December   the day before the Transaction Documents were executed  see Annexure at         and     The  surrounding circumstances  or  background  relied on by the

December   letter  although the Commissioner submitted that the letter explicitly states that SHCP was the party liable for the Prepayment  the inferences that the Commissioner sought to draw from the letter are not open on the face of it  First  the letter was sent by Star City to the Treasurer of New South Wales  as the CCA s nominated recipient of the Prepayment  The letter was not a communication between the parties to the Occupational Licence Agreement  As such  it is not relevant to the proper construction of cl     of the Occupational Licence Agreement  It does not and cannot provide evidence of the objective factual background known to the parties at or before the date of the Agreement  The letter does not form part of the relevant factual matrix in which the Agreement was set which might highlight the context in which the words were used and the purpose for which they were chosen  Codelfa Construction at     Secondly  the letter was concerned with and addressed an issue separate from the use to which the Commissioner sought to put it  The letter dealt with the method by which the Prepayment was to be paid  The fact that the letter described that issue in a particular way does not point to the conclusion that the Commissioner sought to draw from it that the party obliged to make the payment had been absolved of liability or was not in fact liable   Thirdly  even if the letter were to be considered as part of some relevant factual matrix  it would not assist in resolving the question of the proper construction of the Occupational Licence Agreement  The letter was an attempt by Star City to gain leverage in its bargaining with the CCA in circumstances where it was the preferred candidate for the grant of the casino licence and  if successful  would be required to pay the Prepayment  The letter was an attempt by Star City to secure repayment of the Prepayment if a possible legal challenge to the grant of such a licence  by an opposition bidding consortium associated with the late Mr Kerry Packer  had been successful  Such a challenge was made although it was unsuccessful  Darling Casino Ltd v New South Wales Casino Control

v Hart   HCA         CLR   at          This definition  of scheme  is very broad  It encompasses not only a series of steps which together can be said to constitute a  scheme  or a  plan  but also  by its reference to action in the singular  the taking of but one step   The Commissioner is under no obligation to show a series of steps to prove a scheme  However  if  as here  he elects to rely upon

CLR   at     and Hart at   and    A series of disjointed or unconnected steps could not amount to a scheme  That is because the existence of a scheme and its identification for the purposes of s  A is

at                A particular course of action may be  to use a phrase found in the Full Court judgments  both  tax driven  and bear the character of a rational commercial decision  The presence of the latter characteristic does not determine the answer to the question whether  within the meaning of Pt IVA   a person entered into or carried out a  scheme  for the  dominant purpose  of enabling the taxpayer to obtain a  tax benefit     Emphasis added             Always the question must be whether the terms of the Act apply to the facts and circumstances of the particular case   In addition  even if one or more of the schemes was capable of being a scheme for the purposes of Part IVA   Star City did not obtain a tax benefit in relation to it  The Commissioner contended that in determining the answer to that question  it was necessary to construe and apply Pt IVA according to its terms  Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart   HCA         CLR   at     So much may be accepted   The process of identifying a  tax benefit  is prescribed by s  C  It requires an assessment of what might reasonably be expected to have happened if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out  This process has been described as the identification of the  alternative postulate  Hart at   and Macquarie Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at     This is an objective assessment  Calder v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at   Macquarie at   Pridecraft Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   at       Section  D b  is not directed at attributing a purpose to  the scheme  Hart at    The test of purpose is objective  Actual subjective purposes are irrelevant  Hart at    And if there is more than one purpose  the question is whether the taxation benefit purpose was the   ruling  prevailing or most influential purpose    Spotless at     Moreover  as Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Hart at        The bare fact that a taxpayer pays less tax  if one form of transaction rather than another is made  does not demonstrate that Pt IVA applies  Simply to show that a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit does not show that Pt IVA applies   The fact that the Consortium s advisers referred to taxation considerations including the non deductibility of the  Second Specified Payment Amount  and the deductibility of the Prepayment is not surprising  It would be surprising  if not negligent of them  if they did not  And the terms in which they referred to these issues does not assist the Commissioner  As Gummow and Hayne JJ said   tax laws affect the shape of nearly every business transaction    It goes without saying that any rational economic actor will endeavour to minimise the tax consequences of a business transaction  For that reason  it must be shown not just that a tax benefit was received  but also that the  dominant purpose  of the transaction was to obtain the tax benefit  In this case  an objective consideration of the Bid Process and Transaction Documents reveals no such dominant purpose on the part of Star City   The Commissioner s arguments in favour of the application of Pt IVA assume a degree of unilateral freedom on the part of the Star City Consortium to frame the arrangement in terms of its choice which the history of the Bid Process denies  see Annexure at   to    Throughout the negotiations  there were two considerations that remained consistent  the Casino would operate on leased land owned by the State and rent would be paid for use of those Premises   Thus  from the outset  the transaction comprised a number of necessary and essential components including the Casino Licence  the Construction Lease and the Freehold Lease  Components made necessary and essential by  inter alia  the Casino Control Act and by the fact that the Premises were vested in the Crown  It is also important to re emphasize that for the State parties  the CCA and the Treasury  commercial considerations required payment of as much money as could be obtained as soon as it could be obtained appliedFederal Commissioner of Taxation v James Flood Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Occupational Licence Agreement recorded the agreement obliging Star City to pay the Prepayment  Star City was  definitively committed  to the outgoing  the Prepayment  Federal Commissioner of Taxation v James Flood Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    That outgoing was incurred by Star City in its capacity as the holder of the Casino Licence entitling it to operate the Casino for which it required premises from which to conduct that activity  The Prepayment was thus an outgoing incurred by Star City in gaining or producing assessable income under s   of the   Act and   or s     of the   Act    Subject to the next issue  there was no dispute between the parties that  if the Prepayment was an outgoing incurred by Star City in gaining or producing assessable income under s   of the   Act and   or s     of the   Act   then a proportion of the Prepayment was allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of Star City for each year of income in the Primary Rental Period in accordance with s  KZM of the   Act   see   above   In relation to the  negative limb  of s   of the   Act and   or s     of the   Act   the Commissioner submitted that even if the Prepayment was an outgoing incurred by Star City in gaining or producing assessable income  the Prepayment was on capital  not revenue  account and therefore not deductible under s   of the   Act and   or s     of the   Act   This argument also fails consideredFederal Commissioner of Taxation v South Australian

three matters to be considered   a  the character of the advantage sought  and in this its lasting qualities may play a part   b  the manner in which it is to be used  relied upon or enjoyed  and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part  and  c  the means adopted to obtain it  that is  by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods

of Taxation     FCR   Several points must be made about these contentions  First  the findings of fact made in one case provide no guidance to the decision in another  Yet  in essence  that is the path the Commissioner s argument by reference to Jupiters would have me take  Secondly  and no less fundamentally  the Commissioner s contention that Star City and the CCA did not undertake a real commercial negotiation should be rejected  Taken as a whole  the negotiations between the parties are properly described as  hard bargaining   It would be wrong to approach that negotiation piecemeal and say of part of it that Star City was free to choose its own terms and in that particular respect simply because the particular point was not shown to be the subject of extended debate or negotiation  As it happens  however  both the amount to be paid as rent and the terms on which rental would be paid were points of critical centrality in the negotiations between Star City and the CCA and matters about which the CCA  not Star City  had the ultimate decision  The Commissioner s contention that the rent payable during the  Primary Rental Period  was not the result of hard bargaining is without foundation  cf JB Chandler Investment Company Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   and Jupiters at     A summary of the Bid Process is set out in the Annexure to these reasons  In referring to these facts and matters  I should not be taken as accepting that separately or collectively they form part of the  factual matrix  or assist in the identification or characterisation of the advantage sought by the Prepayment  see   below  All the documents contain are successive statements by parties to a difficult and complex commercial negotiation and  in particular  the stance each took in the bidding process at that time  The documents record nothing more that the state of the negotiations as they developed   This description of the history of the negotiations between the parties reveals that each side of the negotiation  unsurprisingly  sought to obtain the best commercial result it could  For the State parties  the CCA and the Treasury  commercial considerations required payment of as much money as could be obtained as soon as it could be obtained  But there are two considerations that remained consistent  the Casino would operate on

arguable  Whether or not a position is reasonably arguable was explained by Hill J in Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at   in the context of s  K in the following terms       Subject to what has been said the view advanced by the taxpayer must be one where objectively it would be concluded that having regard to the material included within the definition of  authority  a reasoned argument can be made which argument when contrasted with the argument which is accepted as correct is about as likely as not correct  That is to say the two arguments  namely  that which is advanced by the taxpayer and that which reflects the correct view will be finely balanced  The case must thus be one where reasonable minds could differ as to which view  that of the taxpayer or that ultimately adopted by the Commissioner was correct  There must  in other words  be room for a real and rational difference of opinion between the two views such that while the taxpayer s view is ultimately seen to be wrong it is nevertheless  about  as likely to be correct as the correct view  A question of judgment is involved   In the present case  the Commissioner sought to impose penalties at   under s  L of the   Act   Section  L provided       Subject to this Part  if     a  a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year  and             b  the shortfall or part of it was caused by the taxpayer in a taxation statement treating an income tax law as applying in relation to a scheme in a particular way  and                      c  the scheme was a tax avoidance scheme within the meaning of section   and              d  none of the scheme sections applies in relation to the scheme                      the taxpayer is liable to pay  by way of penalty  additional tax equal to             e  if  when the statement was made  it was reasonably arguable that the way in which the application of the law was treated was correct   of the amount of the shortfall or part  or                      f  in any other case   of the amount of shortfall or part   Three issues are significant  first  the intended operation of s  L by reference to the definition of  scheme sections  in s  L d  secondly  the definition of  tax avoidance scheme  in s  L c  and  finally  whether Star City s position was  reasonably arguable  for the purposes of s  L e  followedWalters v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Whether the scheme identified by the Commissioner is a scheme within the meaning of s  A is a question of fact  Walters v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at         Where there is no evidence of an express agreement or arrangement  the question is whether an inference as to the existence of a scheme can be
