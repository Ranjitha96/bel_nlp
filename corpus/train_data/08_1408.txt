Strangio v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAhern v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  Qld    FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Further  the Federal Magistrate declined to adjourn the hearing of the petition until the determination of the appeal to the Court of Appeal  After noting the curial history of the matter  including the judgment delivered by Justice Williams in the Supreme Court  her Honour stated  at     The determination as to whether or not to grant an adjournment in the proceedings is a discretionary one  Whilst the court is mindful that it should not proceed to sequestrate the estate of a debtor where an appeal is pending against the judgment relied on as the foundation of the bankruptcy proceedings  in this case the judgment relied on as the foundation of the bankruptcy proceedings is a judgment of Judge Holt and nowhere is there evidence before the court that the appeal to the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Victoria is based on genuine and arguable grounds  Ahern v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  Qld    FCA         ALR   at     Mr Strangio  has had ample opportunity to place such evidence before the court including any as contained in the two affidavits relied upon and filed this day  No material persuasive of the granting of an adjournment or that could even properly found such an application was before the court  Having determined to refuse the application for an adjournment the court proceeded to hear the petition  Each of the grounds of opposition are rejected  All formal evidence as necessary has been filed and the court is satisfied with the proof of those matters  No opposition to the granting of the petition was put in submissions made by Counsel for  Mr Strangio   The court exercises the discretion conferred by section   of the  Bankruptcy Act    Cth  in favour of  Westpac    Mr Strangio was legally represented in the Federal Magistrates Court but unrepresented in this Court  In this Court  he relied on his own affidavits of   August   and   September    In his   September affidavit  he deposed that his appeal to the Court of Appeal was still on foot  A copy of a notice of appeal was annexed to this affidavit  In his   August affidavit  he deposed that he was informed by the Federal Magistrate on   July   and later by another Court officer that he had   days in which to lodge his appeal   Westpac relied on the affidavit of Robert Hinton of   September   which exhibited a copy of the transcript of the hearing before the Federal Magistrate   A proposed notice of appeal was attached to Mr Strangio s application for an extension of time  The grounds stated were         The learned Magistrate erred in law by making a sequestration Order against the appellant in disregard of the principles enunciated by the Federal Court of Australia in Ahern v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  Qld    FCA         ALR   at     Ahern        The learned Magistrate erred in law by finding that   no opposition to the granting of the petition was put in submission   made by Counsel for the appellant when  in fact  the appellant s Counsel had submitted that the petition should be dismissed on the basis of the principles enunciated in Ahern       The learned Magistrate denied the appellant natural justice by failing to accede to the appellant s application to adjourn the hearing of the petition pending the making of an application to stay execution of the judgment debt to the Court of Appeal   Mr Strangio would argue on appeal that the Federal Magistrate misapplied the principle in Ahern   In Ahern   which was also an appeal from a decision refusing an adjournment of a creditor s petition  the Full Court observed  at   that  in general a court exercising jurisdiction in bankruptcy should not proceed to sequestrate the estate of a debtor where an appeal is pending against the judgment relied on as the foundation of the bankruptcy proceedings provided that the appeal is based on genuine and arguable grounds   A Full Court of this Court followed Ahern in Adamopoulos v Olympic Airways SA     ALR     at   per Pincus J and     per Burchett and Gummow JJ   As already indicated  the Federal Magistrate s decision to refuse Mr Strangio s adjournment application was a discretionary one  The principles applicable on an appeal against the exercise of discretion are well established  see House v The King   HCA         CLR     at     per Dixon  Evatt and McTiernan JJ  Australian Coal and Shale Employees  Federation v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     at   per Kitto J  and Ahern  at     per Davies  Lockhart and Neaves JJ  In order for an appellate court to interfere with an exercise of discretion  it is not enough that the appellate court considers that  had it been the first instance judge  it would have taken a different course  Rather  the appellant must show that there was some error in exercising the discretion  as for example  that the first instance judge acted on a wrong principle  In the present case  there is nothing shown below or in the affidavits filed or the submissions made in this Court that would lead me to conclude that the Federal Magistrate made any discernible error in exercising her discretion  Her Honour did not deny Mr Strangio natural justice as he would allege followedJess v Scott     FCR   Under the Federal Court Rules  the Rules  the applicant was required to file and serve a notice of appeal against the sequestration order within   days from the date of the Federal Magistrates judgment  namely  on or before   August   see O   r    Mr Strangio filed his application for an extension of time in which to appeal some   days outside the prescribed appeal period  Pursuant to O   r   the time limit in O   r   may be extended at any time for  special reasons   In Jess v Scott     FCR     a Full Court of this Court said  at         the expression  special reasons  is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty one days  But it may be so distinguished  not necessarily will  for the rule gives a discretion  wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case  Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary  We do not think the use of the expression  for special reasons  implies something narrower than this   As counsel for Westpac pointed out  Mr Strangio also requires leave to appeal from her Honour s refusal of an adjournment since this decision is interlocutory in character  see Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  s  A   Mr Strangio  who as I have said was not represented in this Court  did not expressly seek leave to appeal before or at the hearing  It is plain enough  however  that he challenges her Honour s refusal of an adjournment  I would treat his submissions at the hearing as in substance an application for leave to appeal against this refusal and an application for an extension of time in which to file and serve an application for leave to appeal  see O   r    I would dispense with the need for a notice of motion referred toD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In determining whether leave to appeal against an interlocutory decision should be granted  the Court must be satisfied that the decision under challenge is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered  and that substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision under challenge were wrong  see D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR     at     per Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ  The question on the extension of time is whether this test has sufficient prospect of being satisfied   In practice  in this area  much the same considerations are relevant for the extensions of time and grant of leave to appeal  Unless the Court grants these applications for an extension of time and  in the case of the interlocutory decision  leave to appeal  there can be no competent appeal against the Federal Magistrate s judgment and orders   Mr Strangio submitted  in effect  that he was misled about the time limit involved in filing a notice of appeal  Westpac did not argue that it has suffered any particular prejudice merely by virtue of the delay in lodgement citedAdamopoulos v Olympic Airways SA
