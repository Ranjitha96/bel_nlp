Bolnisi Gold NL  in the matter of Bolnisi Gold NL  Corrigendum dated   November     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRe APN News   Media Ltd     ACSR   By cl    b  of the Scheme  the Bolnisi shareholders are deemed to warrant to Coeur that the shares the subject of the transfer to Coeur Australia will be unencumbered and that the shareholders will have full power and capacity to transfer them to that company  The attention of Bolnisi shareholders is drawn to the deemed warranty in the Scheme Booklet  I have no difficulty with such a deemed warranty  see Re APN News   Media Ltd     ACSR   at       Clause   of the MIA is headed  Exclusivity  and may be described as containing a  no shop  provision  Clause   of the MIA  headed  Payment of costs  may be described as providing for a  break fee   There is a  fiduciary carve out  from cl    The maximum period during which the no shop provision can operate is the period of seven months from the date of the MIA  that is to say  the period from   May   to   December     The amount of the break fee is US    million  Interestingly  as counsel for Bolnisi observe in their submission  in this case the break fee is  reciprocal  that is to say  the break fee is payable by Coeur  as well as by Bolnisi  in the circumstances set out in the MIA  Of course the break fee is not payable by Bolnisi merely because its shareholders do not agree to the Scheme   I discussed no shop and no talk and break free provisions in Re APN News   Media Ltd     ACSR   at     and in Re Investa Properties Ltd   FCA   at      In the present case  Norman Alfred Seckold  the Chairman and a Director of Bolnisi  states as follows in his affidavit of   October            Clause   of the Merger Implementation Agreement between Bolnisi and Coeur     is an exclusivity provision which provides that  during the exclusivity period  competing third party proposals are not to be sought and discussions or negotiations may not be entered into in relation to a third party proposal  Clause   also provides that if third party proposals are received by a party  that party must notify the other party at least   hours before the Board of Bolnisi or Coeur  as applicable  recommends acceptance to their shareholders      Clause   of the Merger Implementation Agreement is a break fee provision that enables either Bolnisi or Coeur to compensate the other party a break fee of US    million within   days of a demand for payment if certain events occur      Both clauses   and   of the Merger Implementation Agreement were agreed between Bolnisi and Coeur following arm s length commercial negotiations over a period of one month  Both parties were separately advised and represented in such negotiations by external legal advisers and by external financial advisers  with extensive experience of transactions of this kind  Bolnisi received legal advice from Minter Ellison on the operation of both provisions and that Bolnisi had regard to the Takeovers Panel Guidance Note   in the negotiations set out above      I believe that the no shop  no talk and exclusivity provisions do not operate against the interests of Shareholders and it was in their interests that the board of Directors determined to include such provisions citedRe Investa Properties Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html

Arrangement will become effective on the following day   December   after this Court grants  if it does  its approval to the Scheme on   December    In Re NRMA Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR   Santow J had to consider the position of a condition subsequent to which a scheme of arrangement was subject  Although it could not be known whether the condition subsequent would be satisfied until after the approval of the Court was granted  his Honour held that the presence of the condition subsequent was no obstacle to the Court s approval of the Scheme   Santow J distinguished a condition subsequent that was clear  certain and self executing  from a provision for a variation of a scheme  His Honour stated  at     Clarity and certainty are thus the touchstones  Provided that clarity and certainty are present on the face of the scheme and no new decision making process intrudes after court approval  it does not matter that different results may emerge in different  but clearly identified  eventualities  A key question is whether the scheme is  according to its own terms  self executing in the sense that certain results follow in certain defined events   In my view  the present condition subsequent  that is to say  the Palmarejo Plan of Arrangement becoming effective under Canadian law  satisfies this test  I do not think that Santow J s reference to a  new decision making process  is apt to catch the Canadian decision making processes  extraneous to this Scheme  that will be involved in the Palmarejo Plan of Arrangement becoming effective   Before the hearing  affidavits were filed stating the matters referred to in r     of the Federal Court  Corporations  Rules    Cth   Mr Seckold  and failing him  Peter James Nightingale  a Director and Company Secretary of Bolnisi  have consented to chair the Scheme meeting   Counsel s submissions addressed other matters of detail on which I was also satisfied  I will have a copy of counsel s submissions placed on the Court file so that that will be available to be read by anyone interested citedRe Solution   Holdings Ltd     ACSR   Bolnisi drew this matter to the attention of the Court so that the Court would be aware at the earliest stage that if it should ultimately approve the Scheme  Bolnisi proposes that the approval would be relied on by the United States Securities Exchange Commission for the purposes of s  a  of the Securities Act    US   Approvals have been given at the second court hearing in similar circumstances in connection with a number of previous schemes  see the discussion by Jacobson J in Re Solution   Holdings Ltd     ACSR   at     and the earlier authorities to which his Honour there referred
