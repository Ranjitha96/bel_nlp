Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedWitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Contempt of court  including that species of contempt which consists of the breach of orders or of the court or undertakings to the court  must be proved beyond reasonable doubt  Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at       All contempts are criminal in nature   CLR at    The court approaches in the adjudication of charges of contempt on the basis that criminal standards of proof and specificity apply  In this case the respondent  as was his right  did not himself give evidence although he tendered some documents   The genesis of the orders made by Wilcox J appears to have been a handwritten heads of agreement signed by the director of the applicant  Mr Dowe  and Mr Monamy following the conclusion of mediation conducted with registrars of the court on   December    The respondent has referred to that document as informing his interpretation of the orders   Paragraph   of the handwritten document has a number of interlineations in different handwriting but significantly it sets out  in what appears to me to be unarguably clear words  the requirement that the respondent change his registered business name to  Simply Natural Floor Coverings   with  Floor  and  Coverings  written as two words each commencing with a capital letter  and use this business name on all advertising  letterhead  promotions and the like in lieu of  Simply Natural Floorcoverings   written as three words    The respondent raised issues as to the fact that he was not personally present when Wilcox J made the orders and that he was in dispute with his then solicitor as to whether he had agreed to the orders being made in the terms in which they were made  Exhibit   contains some material which supports the proposition that there was some dispute between Mr Monamy and his solicitor on that topic appliedJohnson v Miller   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The difficulty with the formulation of the finding of contempt contained in paragraph   of the statement of charge is that it relies on evidence of a number of disparate acts which changed over a period  There is a real possibility that there may be some duplicity in the charge as formulated  having regard to the evidence that I have recited  In Johnson v Miller   HCA         CLR   at     Dixon J made clear that a prosecutor had to specify with precision the precise act or omission relied on to constitute the particular contravention charged  That case involved a situation in which a prosecution had been brought alleging that within a particular time period a person had left licensed premises in breach of s   in the Licensing Act      SA   The evidence tendered at the hearing revealed that there were many persons who had left during that time  but the prosecutor could not identify which of those many persons was relied on as the person whose departure evidenced the contravention  The charge was found bad for duplicity on that basis   Here it seems to me that the applicant is relying on a number of events and different appearances of the website  I think that in fairness to the respondent the applicant must elect which particular instance it wishes to claim is a contravention and to allow the respondent an opportunity to answer in respect of that instance  I will defer making any final decision on that matter because I did not raise this issue with Mr Freeman when he was addressing   This charge relates to order    It is plain beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent used the word  Floorcoverings  as one word on his  advertising or  webpage until some time prior to   April    If I am wrong in my conclusion that the ordinary reasonable person would not perceive a difference in the depiction because of the small space on the website that now appears between the word  floor  and the word  covering  I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that  in fact  for the reasons  that I have expressed the respondent  to date  uses  Floorcoverings  as one word  I am fortified in that conclusion by the fact that I regard the construction of order   as being relevantly aided by reference to order   which required the respondent immediately to change his business name to one in which the words  Floor Coverings  appeared as two words with their first letters capitalised appliedDow Jones   Company Inc v Gutnick   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent has failed to publish any form of disclaimer on the website and that the use of the HTML meta tag is a deliberate evasion of the obligation to publish something that is able to be read in the ordinary way on the website  The contents of the HTML meta tag are not and at no time have been published on the website  What was required by order   was that there be published a disclaimer  that is it  be put forward in a form which actually communicated it  The act of publication in a bilateral act of someone putting forward a message and another person being able to read it and actually reading it  In this context it was clear beyond reasonable doubt that the order required that that the publication  in the sense of something which the person accessing the page would see and be able to read then and there  would occur whenever the page was opened  See Dow Jones   Company Inc v Gutnick   HCA         CLR   at              The order in my view  beyond reasonable doubt  should be construed as requiring the disclaimer referred to appear in a way which is immediately apparent on the website in words that can be read in the English language by anyone who opens the webpage  An ordinary and natural reading of the order dictates that construction   I did raise with Mr Freeman the possibility that order   was or contained an ambiguity in the sense that the words  above the fold  were to my mind  and I think on the evidence  meaningless without expert evidence or other evidence as to what they conveyed  I have seen in the evidence copies of the website and I am unable to detect from viewing them what it is that might be referred to as  above the fold  in the order  However  I am satisfied that this ambiguity makes no difference whatsoever to the construction of the order in the sense that it was a requirement of the order that there be prominence on the website in the position of the disclaimer and that it be published
