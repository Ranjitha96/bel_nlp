Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedLe v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  First  according to the learned Federal Magistrate  the Tribunal failed to discharge its obligations under s   of Act by failing to ensure Ms Le and her children were given an adequate opportunity to present their case and by proceeding in the absence of an interpreter  His Honour held that  where a hearing has not concluded in the sense that witnesses available have not given evidence     there is a continuing obligation on the part of the Tribunal to ensure that the invitation to the hearing remains genuine and is not simply a hollow or empty gesture  see Le v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA     Le v Minister    at    His Honour added at      If an opportunity has been given during the hearing for a further hearing to occur then that opportunity should be conveyed through and  sic  interpreter to the Applicant  Failure to do so in my view renders the process which occurred after the interpreter left the hearing room as meaningless  There is no evidence that the Tribunal arranged for its transcript to be made available to the Applicant or that it sought any assurance that what had been said at the Tribunal hearing would be interpreted  Instead the Tribunal relies on knowledge that the agent apparently had  Vietnamese  staff and that the agent could  arrange to explain what we have discussed with your client when you ve got use of some staff to help explain to her    The Federal Magistrate also had regarded to what he called the agent s  significant concessions  made in the absence of an interpreter and without knowledge of the content of the s  A letter  see Le v Minister at      His Honour noted that the agent was unwilling to accept responsibility for determining whether there should be a further hearing and purported to leave this matter to the Tribunal  His Honour considered the agent s failure to press for a further hearing involved an  extraordinary concession  in the circumstances of the case  see Le v Minister at    His Honour described the agent s approach to the Tribunal as  obsequious   The agent was  so his Honour thought  more concerned with his personal preference than with the interests of his clients  His Honour regarded the agent as negligent in failing to press for a further hearing in order that the other witnesses could give their evidence  His Honour remarked  at   that     There is simply no evidence to suggest that the clear invitation properly referred to by the Tribunal was ever passed on in detail to the Applicant  It would be wrong for the Court to assume that it occurred     The exchange between the agent and the Tribunal was critical  Without the offer being accurately and contemporaneously interpreted the conclusion I reach is that offer of a further hearing upon receipt of the s  A letter could not properly by interpreted as a genuine offer and the ongoing obligation of the Tribunal to ensure that its original hearing is valid   Further  his Honour noted the  clear evidence of circumstances which at the very least would bring into question the voluntariness of the withdrawal of the sponsorship document  as well as the fact that the purported withdrawal had not been properly translated  He observed  at     that     At the very least the other evidence of the witnesses available to the  sic  called but not called due to the absence of the interpreter may have provided the Tribunal with other evidence in the absence of the departmental officers which would have made it less likely for the Tribunal to rely upon the written document obtained on the Applicant s allegations after a five hour interview without a break and without refreshment      The obligations imposed upon a Tribunal under s   should not be narrowly confined to an invitation to appear but also to  give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   It is the invitation to give evidence and present arguments that is crucial  The giving of evidence is not confined simply to the Applicant but extends to those witnesses whom the Applicant has evinced an intention to call  It is not appropriate for the Tribunal to simply seek to transfer the obligation it has under s   to the Applicant s agent  In the present case it is particularly inappropriate to extend the further invitation in the absence of an interpreter when the Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the extension of that invitation has been accurately interpreted and communicated to an Applicant   For these reasons  his Honour found that there had been a breach of s   of the Act   Secondly  the Federal Magistrate found    the Tribunal ought to have made additional enquiries pursuant to ss   and   of the Act to obtain evidence from or about the Minister s officers and their conduct  and   the Tribunal made an assessment of the facts that was not reasonably open to it  Accepting that there was no general duty on the Tribunal to make enquiries  his Honour said  at        However  in this instance the Tribunal was able to easily request the attendance of the relevant Departmental officer or officers who conducted the interview which resulted in the withdrawal of sponsorship  It was after all the interview process which was subject to significant challenge and the voluntariness of the withdrawal statement questioned  Whilst the Tribunal was able to assess the subsequent explanation from the nominator as to why the withdrawal document had been signed it should in my view following my reasoning in relation to the previous ground have permitted the Applicant to adduce further evidence in support of the application which may have given greater corroboration to the likelihood or otherwise of the withdrawal having been made voluntarily  It could then assess evidence from relevant Departmental officers  Although the decision of Wilcox J in Prasad appears to be obiter  it is obiter which I am prepared to follow to the extent that in this instance for the Tribunal to proceed to a decision without making any attempt to obtain evidence from the Departmental officers that it conducted itself in a manner which could properly be described as exercising a decision making power in a manner so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised it      By making a finding that it did not accept the Department s officers  would have fabricated his admissions or pressured him into formally withdrawing his sponsorship  the Tribunal was not making an assessment of the facts reasonably open to it  Accordingly this ground succeeds   His Honour found that the other grounds for judicial review were not made out  The Minister challenges his Honour s judgment citedPlaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Tribunal s decision was a  privative clause decision  within the meaning of s   of the Act  As a result  it can only be set aside on judicial review if jurisdictional error is shown  see Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at     and     The Federal Magistrate based his decision principally on s   of the Act  This provision requires the Tribunal to  invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present argument relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   The Act  in s   imposes an equivalent obligation on the Refugee Review Tribunal  The Tribunal is bound to extend an invitation under s   where the documentary material before it would not lead it to make a decision in the review applicant s favour  see ss   and     Part of the Minister s challenge to the judgment under appeal involves a challenge to findings  if this is what they were  that were in the nature of findings of fact or mixed fact and law  This Court must make its own assessment in light of the judgment under appeal  In a case of this kind  the appellate court is in as good a position as the Federal Magistrate to form a view about any facts in issue  compare Warren v Coombes   HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs ACJ  Jacobs and Murphy JJ and Fox v

    FCR     SZFDE   at      It suffices to note that  as his Honour said  in a passage subsequently referred to with approval by the High Court  there are sound reasons of policy why a person whose conduct before an administrative tribunal has been affected  to the detriment of that person  by bad or negligent advice or some other mishap should not be heard to complain that the detriment vitiates the decision  SZFDE at   referred to in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne  Callinan  Heydon  and Crennan JJ  For the

Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Did it matter that this exchange took place only between the Tribunal and Mr Oladejo and in the absence of Ms Le and an interpreter  For the following reasons  I do not think so  I accept that  as the Minister submitted  this was not a case in which the Tribunal did not complete the steps in the review process that it considered necessary to afford a real  in the sense of fair  opportunity to present evidence and arguments  compare Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per Kenny J   It is immaterial that Mr Oladejo had no right to address the Tribunal  providing he had the capacity to answer the Tribunal s enquiries of him on Ms Le s behalf  Although present to assist Ms Le  Mr Oladejo had no right to address the Tribunal at the hearing on   March    The right  though not the capacity  of someone other than the review applicant to address the Tribunal at a hearing is circumscribed by the Act  When appearing before the Tribunal  the review applicant is entitled to have another person present to assist  although the assistant is not entitled to present arguments or address the Tribunal  unless the Tribunal is satisfied that exceptional circumstances justify the assistant in doing so  see s  A  and    The review applicant has no other right to representation when appearing before the Tribunal  see s  A   The Act does not  however  limit the capacity of another person to assist the review applicant at a hearing  when he or she is invited by the Tribunal to do so  Whether a person has the capacity to assist will generally depend on the relationship between the review applicant and the other person   It is clear enough that Mr Oladejo had the capacity to discuss the further conduct of the hearing with the Tribunal on Ms Le s behalf  Section  A of the Act does not affect a review applicant s right to engage a representative otherwise than while appearing before the Tribunal  see s  A   In the present case  Ms Le had instructed the law firm of Koenig and Simons to act for her in relation to her review application  Mr Oladejo was apparently a consultant to the firm  Furthermore  as we have seen  on the day of the hearing  Ms Le specifically advised the Tribunal that she had appointed Mr Oladejo as her representative to act on her behalf in relation to her application and to be an  authorised recipient   The Act plainly contemplates that review applicants can appoint representatives to act on their behalf in relation to proceedings before the Tribunal  see  e g  ss      B   G and  C  Generally speaking  these representatives will be registered migration agents  although there are other specified persons who may also assist  Under s  B of the Act  a registered migration agent must notify the Tribunal when he or she gives immigration assistance to a person in relation to a review application after agreeing to represent the review applicant in respect of the review  Furthermore  the transcript shows that  from the outset of the hearing and with Ms Le s tacit consent  the Tribunal permitted Mr Oladejo to act as her representative and he did so act  Amongst other things  before the critical exchange  the Tribunal had already exchanged comments with him concerning the possibility of a further hearing  The interpreter was  of course  present on these earlier occasions and  on the first two occasions  so too was Ms Le   Further  in keeping with his appointment as her representative  Ms Le also nominated Mr Oladejo as her  authorised recipient  for the purposes of the Act  The appointment of an authorised recipient attracts the provisions of s  G of the Act  Under s  G  a review applicant may give the Tribunal written notice of another person who is authorised  to do things on behalf of the applicant that consist of  or include  receiving documents in connection with the review  and  in this event  the Tribunal must give the authorised recipient  instead of the applicant  any document that it would otherwise have given to the applicant  although s  G does not apply  to the Tribunal giving documents to  or communicating with  the applicant when the applicant is appearing before the Tribunal  see  G    The circumstances may show  as they do in this case  that the review applicant has authorized another to represent him or her  as the law permits  for the purposes of communications between him or her and the Tribunal  Although the Act makes specific provision for the manner of certain written communications  it does not do so in respect of oral communications with a review applicant s representative of the kind in question in this case   The communication between the Tribunal and Ms Le s representative was not rendered nugatory because it was not contemporaneously translated to Ms Le  There is no basis in the Act or elsewhere to require that any oral communication between the Tribunal and the review applicant s authorised representative be translated contemporaneously to the review applicant  The Tribunal has no general duty to provide an interpreter on every occasion when it is seeking to communicate with a review applicant  The Act does impose an obligation to provide an interpreter where a request is made by a person appearing before the Tribunal to give evidence for the purposes of communication between the Tribunal and that person  unless the Tribunal considers the person sufficiently proficient in English  s  C  and    Moreover  the Tribunal must provide an interpreter if the Tribunal considers that a person appearing before it to give evidence is not sufficiently proficient in English  even though no request was made  s  C   Obviously  this obligation extends to a review applicant where he or she is appearing to give evidence and lacks proficiency in English  In this case  the Tribunal had complied with its obligations under s  C by providing an interpreter  as requested  for the review applicant and other witnesses when they gave their evidence to the Tribunal  It was not  however  obliged to ensure that its discussion with Ms Le s representative regarding the possibility of a further hearing was translated to Ms Le herself   It does not follow from this that a representative is at large with respect to his client s affairs  Registered migration agents  as Mr Oladejo was required to be  are subject to regulation by the law  including the Act  the Migration Agents Regulations    Cth  and the Code of Conduct made under these Regulations and s   of the Act  Under the Code  registered migration agents are required to act in the lawful interests of their client at all times  clause     to deal with their clients competently  diligently and fairly  clause     and to have due regard to a client s dependence on the agent s knowledge and experience  clause      Further  they  must     within a reasonable time after agreeing to represent a client  confirm the client s instructions in writing to the client      act in accordance with the client s instructions  and     keep the client fully informed in writing of the progress of each case or application that the agent undertakes for the client     clause      Mr Oladejo was thus obliged to seek Ms Le s instructions on the matter of a further hearing and  for this purpose  to inform her of his discussion with the Tribunal   For these reasons  I accept the Minister s contention that there was no proper basis for the Federal Magistrate to conclude that the Tribunal s repeated offers to conduct a hearing were not genuine merely because the offers were made to Mr Oladejo and were not contemporaneously translated to Ms Le  Accordingly  I accept the Minister s submissions with respect to the first ground of appeal advanced at the hearing of the appeal   Further  having regard to the transcript and the Tribunal s reasons for decision  there was no warrant for the Federal Magistrate s finding  if this is what it was  that the Tribunal sought to transfer its responsibilities regarding a further hearing to Ms Le s representative  In this context  it must be borne in mind that the Tribunal is bound to consider the review applicant s wishes  although it does not have to act on them  Section   of the Act provides in effect that the Tribunal must have regard to the review applicant s wishes  as expressed in a notice under s   as to the witnesses that should be called to give oral evidence  In the exchanges about the possibility of a further hearing  the Tribunal was in substance asking whether the review applicant s wishes  as expressed at the outset of the hearing  remained the same and thus whether she wished to have the hearing continued on another day when an interpreter was available  Although not obliged to comply with Ms Le s wishes  it was open to the Tribunal to take the view that Ms Le  as advised by Mr Oladejo  was in the best position to assess whether  in view of what had occurred at the   March hearing  the s  A letter and her response to it  the remaining witnesses should be asked to give their evidence at a further hearing  Since Ms Le did not request a further hearing after the s  A letter  then  it was open to the Tribunal to conclude that  having regard to the evidence and other material already before it  including the discussion with Mr Oladejo  there was no call for a further hearing  The Minister s fifth ground of appeal is thus made out distinguishedRose v Bridges     FCR   I accept that  as the Minister contended  it was incumbent on Ms Le  as an applicant for judicial review  to present some evidence that Mr Oladejo had not communicated to her that the Tribunal was prepared to convene a further hearing if the failure so to communicate was part of her case  compare Rose v Bridges     FCR   at   per Finn J  There was  as the Minister said  no evidence before the Federal Magistrate that Mr Oladejo had failed to inform Ms Le  through an interpreter  that the Tribunal was willing to reconvene to hear the evidence from the remaining witnesses  Ms Le did not seek to adduce any evidence to this effect  Accordingly  it was not open to his Honour to proceed  as he apparently did  on the basis that Mr Oladejo had not conveyed this information to Ms Le  in breach of his obligations to her  To the extent that his Honour did so proceed  he was in error  I would accept the Minister s submissions under the second ground of appeal citedWarren v Coombes   HCA

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per Madgwick J  MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at       per Weinberg J  SBBA v Minister for

per Wilcox and Madgwick JJ  In the present case  it could well be said that the Tribunal did not consider whether the primary decision maker s perception of what had occurred at the Departmental interview was fundamentally defective because of the mistranslation of Mr Nguyen s statement  As we have seen  this issue was clearly raised on the evidence  including specifically by Mr Nguyen  As this possibility was not the subject of argument  it is unnecessary to consider it further referred toMohammed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www

Teoh   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ and Deane J and   per McHugh J  In this circumstance what vitiates the decision is the manner in which it was made  Since this is a limited proposition  it does not conflict with the larger statement that the Tribunal is under no general duty with respect to making enquiries  see Prasad at     per Wilcox J and Azzi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     per Allsop J  but contrast SZEGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at       per Edmonds J   Today  at least in the context of migration cases  judicial discussion of the significance of a failure to obtain further information on a critical issue ordinarily commences with Prasad  In Prasad   Wilcox J expressed the view  in obiter dictum  that it was unreasonable in the circumstances of the case  where a  spouse  visa was at issue  not to seek out the explanations of certain inconsistencies in the material before the decision maker  It was plain enough that explanations for the inconsistencies were readily ascertainable  Wilcox J referred to the recognised authorities and said  at     that     A power is exercised in an improper manner if  upon the material before the decision maker  it is a decision to which no reasonable person could come  Equally  it is exercised in an improper manner if the decision maker makes his decision which perhaps in itself  reasonably reflects the material before him in a manner so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable person could have taken this course  for example by unreasonably failing to ascertain relevant facts which he knew to be readily available to him  The circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to inquire are  I think  strictly limited  It is no part of the duty of the decision maker to make the applicant s case for him  It is not enough that the court find that the sounder course would have been to make inquiries  But  in a case where it is obvious that material is readily available which is centrally relevant to the decision to be made  it seems to me that to proceed to a decision without making any attempt to obtain that information may properly be described as an exercise of the decision making power in an manner so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised it  It would follow that the court  on judicial review  should receive evidence as to the existence and nature of that information    Emphasis added  Wilcox J adhered to his approach in Prasad in Sun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   at    See also Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission     ALR   at   per Wilcox J  Prasad and such cases as Videto   Luu v Renevier and Detsongjarus were proceedings under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the Judicial Review Act   Although not on all fours with the common law  the grounds of review under that Act reflect  to some extent  the common law grounds for judicial review  see Peko Wallsend at     per Mason J  The discussion in these cases is of some assistance therefore in the present context   In Yang   which was not a Judicial Review Act case  the Minister s delegate rejected an application for a student visa on the basis that the applicant s proposed plan of study represented a  regression  in his studies of some three years  In reaching this conclusion  the delegate relied on the applicant s statement that he had completed up to  year   in China and wanted to study at  Year   level in Australia  Ryan and Finkelstein JJ held  at   that if the concept of regression was to be the determinative factor  in circumstances where the information that the applicant provided was insufficiently detailed  there was a duty on the delegate to request further relevant information  After referring to such cases as Prasad and Videto   their Honours observed at   that     The obscure statement that he had acquired a  Year   qualification in China was not borne out by the translation of his Chinese school certificate  In such a case of  obvious omission or obscurity  a decision maker should adopt the simple expedient of requiring further information from the applicant    though  if the reply is unhelpful  a decision maker is clearly not obliged to go further        In Yang   an unreasonable exercise of a discretionary power to enquire  or to cause an enquiry to be made  rendered the manner of making the ultimate decision

  ALR   at   per Gleeson CJ    and   per McHugh and Gummow JJ and     per Kirby J   This is one of those rare or exceptional cases where a decision maker acting reasonably would have made some further enquiry before making a decision  At the least  a decision maker  acting reasonably in the Wednesbury Corporation sense  would have sought to verify whether the primary decision maker s statements regarding Mr Nguyen s supposed admissions derived from what the primary decision maker mistakenly understood to be the effect of Mr Nguyen s written statement  Additionally  a decision maker  acting reasonably in this sense  would have enquired whether the interviewing officer  acting under the misapprehension that Mr Nguyen said that his marriage relationship had ended  had advised Mr Nguyen to withdraw his sponsorship  In the circumstances of this case especially the mistranslation  a decision maker acting reasonably might also have made some enquiry as to whether the interpreter at the Departmental interview was adequately qualified and  perhaps  whether the interpreter had accompanied the others to Mr Huynh s residence that day   These enquiries were not difficult to make  The Tribunal ought to have known that they might readily be made  Presumably  they would have yielded at least some relevant information on issues that were plainly critical to the outcome of the Tribunal s review  Of course  once the Tribunal received this information  it was bound to deal with it as the Act required and the ultimate decision on the merits of Ms Le s application was a matter for it to decide in conformity with the Act and the Regulations   Accordingly  the present is a case where the failure by a decision maker to make a straightforward enquiry for information that was apparently readily available and relevant to critical issues can be characterized as unreasonable in the Wednesbury Corporation sense  I would uphold the Federal Magistrate s decision on this ground   It is unnecessary to discuss the Minister s seventh ground of appeal  which challenged the Federal Magistrate s holding that the Tribunal had made an assessment of the facts not reasonably open to it  His Honour made this statement after finding that the Tribunal s failure to enquire was an unreasonable exercise of decision making power  This ground raises matters considered under the sixth ground

that Act reflect  to some extent  the common law grounds for judicial review  see Peko Wallsend at     per Mason J  The discussion in these cases is of some assistance therefore in the present context   Thus  in Videto at   Toohey J referred to the need for a decision maker to make enquiries when the material before him or her contained  some obvious omission or obscurity that needs to be resolved before a decision is made   His Honour emphasized the fact that Mr Videto did not have the benefit of legal advice to assist him in placing all relevant material before the decision maker  In Luu v Renevier   a Full Court of this Court agreed that the failure of a decision maker to make enquiries can  in some circumstances  vitiate a purported exercise of power  The Court held  at     that a decision was unreasonable  within s  e  and  g  of the Judicial Review Act  where a decision maker made a critical finding that was unsupported by evidence  Further  a decision was unreasonably made  for the purposes of these provisions  where  to the knowledge of the decision maker  there was other readily available factual material likely to be of critical importance on the critical issue  which was not obtained  At   the Court said     The underlying rationale of the approach suggested in Prasad is that the ground of unreasonableness  in the context of the  Judicial Review Act  may be related to the manner in which the power is exercised      One may say that the making of a particular decision was unreasonable and  therefore  an improper exercise of the power because it lacked a legally defensible foundation in the factual material or in logic  But  equally  one may be able to say that a decision is unreasonably made where  to the knowledge of the decision maker  there is readily available to him or her other factual material  likely to be of critical importance in relation to a central issue for determination  and which has not been obtained    The Court held  at   that the decision was unreasonable because the decision maker made adverse findings about the risk of recidivism on Mr Renevier s part on the basis of inadequate medical material     yet no attempt was made even to obtain a report from the psychiatrist known to be attending Mr Renevier  still less to obtain the opinion of a specialist endocrinologist      Had that course been taken  and yielded the information which was placed before the primary judge  the conclusion could not rationally have been reached that there was a real risk of recidivism    In Yang   which was not a Judicial Review Act case  the Minister s delegate rejected an application for a student visa on the basis that the applicant s proposed plan of study represented a  regression  in his studies of some three years  In reaching this conclusion  the delegate relied on the applicant s statement that he had completed up to  year   in China and wanted to study at  Year   level in Australia  Ryan and Finkelstein JJ held  at   that if the concept of regression was to be the determinative factor  in circumstances where the information that the applicant provided was insufficiently detailed  there was a duty on the delegate to request further relevant information  After referring to such cases as Prasad and Videto   their Honours observed at   that     The obscure statement that he had acquired a  Year   qualification in China was not borne out by the translation of his Chinese school certificate  In such a case of  obvious omission or obscurity  a decision maker should adopt the simple expedient of requiring further information from the applicant    though  if the reply is unhelpful  a decision maker is clearly not obliged to go further        In Yang   an unreasonable exercise of a discretionary power to enquire  or to cause an enquiry to be made  rendered the manner of making the ultimate decision unreasonable so as to give rise to jurisdictional error discussedLuu v Renevier

Judicial Review Act case  the Minister s delegate rejected an application for a student visa on the basis that the applicant s proposed plan of study represented a  regression  in his studies of some three years  In reaching this conclusion  the delegate relied on the applicant s statement that he had completed up to  year   in China and wanted to study at  Year   level in Australia  Ryan and Finkelstein JJ held  at   that if the concept of regression was to be the determinative factor  in circumstances where the information that the applicant provided was insufficiently detailed  there was a duty on the delegate to request further relevant information  After referring to such cases as Prasad and Videto   their Honours observed at   that     The obscure statement that he had acquired a  Year   qualification in China was not borne out by the translation of his Chinese school certificate  In such a case of  obvious omission or obscurity  a decision maker should adopt the simple expedient of requiring further information from the applicant    though  if the reply is unhelpful  a decision maker is clearly not obliged to go further        In Yang   an unreasonable exercise of a
