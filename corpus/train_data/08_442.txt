for the misleading conduct can benefit from an increase in value in the property acquired by the time of trial   I accept the substance of the evidence of Roberts as to assessment of the sustainable annual net profit  Counsel for the respondents made some progress in cross examination of Roberts  particularly as to some items of expense  However  there was little ultimate difference between the experts as to total expenses per annum as at the date of settlement  Roberts  approach to the assessment of income is more acceptable than that of Drewitt Smith  However  the actual results for     were better than those for     and those for the period taken by Roberts  I would  therefore  take the later higher figure  rounded up to   as the maintainable annual profit  I am confirmed in this by noting that in the following year the net profit was comparable  with revenue rising  In my opinion  the trading results more than   months after purchase have little relevance as to the value of the motel at the time of purchase  To give any significant weight to them would go beyond use envisaged in HTW Valuers   CLR    The later results received some attention because of the way in which the respondents put their case  That attention was sufficient to illustrate the difficulty in determining why the results improved in later years capital expenditure by the purchasers  better management by the purchasers  improvement in the Australian economy and improvement in the local economy  due particularly to increased coal mining  all played a part  Furthermore  there is no way of telling how an alternative investment of the purchase price may have fared over the period to trial   This integer reflects the rate of return from a business that a purchaser seeks to achieve from the capital outlaid on the purchase of the business  Generally speaking  a purchaser will accept a lesser return on purchase price  and so pay a higher price  for a business that is either very secure or has good prospects of improving than for a business that is riskier or stagnant  That judgment will be affected by factors such as location  facilities and improvements  trade mix  style and pattern of trade  opposition and potential for improvement  This can be observed by comparing varying capitalisation rates reflected in the purchase price of different motels analysed by the valuers  The calculation of the capitalisation rate in a transaction depends upon the assumption made as to maintainable net profits at the time of purchase of the motel  It is thus necessary to consider the features of each motel and choose the deduced capitalisation rate most appropriate for the motel being valued   In the present case  much of the guess work is removed as the capitalisation rate actually represented by the purchase price paid by the first applicant on the basis of the represented figures is known it was    This is confirmed by the contemporaneous valuation carried out by Robertson and Robertson for the financier  The represented results for the financial years ended on   June     June   and   June   and the six months from   July   to   December   were considered  The valuer deduced an annual net profit of   and applied a   capitalisation rate to arrive at the valuation of   increased to   in view of the purchase price  The valuer considered that this was in line with capitalisation rates deduced from a number of other sales   Roberts adopted the rate of    In his opinion  the evidence in relation to motels that could be described as comparable to the Sovereign Inn Motel was generally within a range of between   and    In substance  Roberts agreed with Robertson and Robertson   Drewitt Smith considered that the most directly comparable sales supported a capitalisation rate of     to     but adopted     to reflect the motel s present underperforming position and the time required by an alternative operator to improve occupancy and overall profitability   The difference of opinion between the valuers as to the capitalisation rate that should be deduced from other sales was the subject of cross examination and was scrutinised in submissions  In my opinion  the actual rate of   that was paid  supported by a contemporaneous valuation  is decisive as to that which was represented to the purchaser  However  that was not the true picture as to the past  and the future was not known   If the actual results were known  an informed purchaser would have recognised the possibility of correcting the downturn in results by better management and would have been prepared to accept a lower capitalisation rate  and so paid more  on that account  In my opinion  a capitalisation rate of     would be appropriate  That choice is confirmed by the improvement of revenue in the following year  albeit with no greater profit  citedKizbeau Pty Ltd v WG   B Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At the time of the decision of the High Court in

purchase price was    The first applicant claims the difference between the purchase price and the value of the motel at the time of purchase  based upon the true results  of   together with some consequential losses related to financing  The evidence relates to the date of completion rather than that of contract  but it is agreed that nothing turns upon that in this case  The first applicant s claim accords with the conventional measure of damages in a case such as this it is often referred to as the Potts v Miller basis  a reference to Potts v Miller     CLR    The respondents say that that measure is inappropriate in the present case as the purchaser did not rescind but elected to operate the motel profitably with improving results such that by the time of trial the motel was worth at least as much  if not more  than the purchase price paid  As will appear  I reject the respondents  contention  The respondents also contest the valuation of the motel as at the time of purchase

not retain the property and claim damages on a Potts v Miller basis  No authority was cited in support of it and it is contrary to authority in the High Court from Holmes v Jones   HCA         CLR   onwards   It is common ground that the value of this motel is to be assessed by capitalisation of the annual net return  It is  thus  necessary to arrive at the annual net return and a capitalisation rate having done so  the formula is     rparenmid  capitalisation rate   net return   value  The respective valuers disagree about each integer   The first applicant s valuer  Mr Ron Roberts  took the   week period from November   to October   to assess the annual net return  That was the period for which the primary records maintained by the vendors were available and it incorporated summer and winter seasons and holiday periods  The primary documents were analysed by accountants retained by the first applicant  With some adjustments to that analysis  Roberts deduced a net weekly income of
