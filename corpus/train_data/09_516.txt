that there are good reasons to give s  ZF a generous interpretation  His Honour did not refer expressly to the remarks of Wilcox J in McMullen   however the passage to which I have referred from McMullen was approved by Tamberlin J in Johnstone v HIH Limited   FCA   at        referred toKing v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe opt out requirements of Part IVA are an important element of the scheme laid down by that part of the Act  In King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd   FCA   at     a Full Court observed that these requirements ensure that group members can make an informed decision about their rights  The Full Court said at   and   that the opt out notice must not mislead group members and must be expressed with clarity and simplicity  Section  Y provides for the Court to approve the form and content of an opt out notice  Section  Y  would ordinarily also require the Court to approve the form and content of the notice to group members advising them of the settlement  Section  ZB b  provides that persons who exercise the right to opt out of a proceeding under s  J are not bound by a judgment given in a representative proceeding referred toLopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAlso  at the time of the mediation  the company appeared to have limited financial capacity  As I have said  it was uninsured  Its last trading price was     which is the lowest price that can be quoted on the ASX  This is a matter of considerable importance in determining whether to exercise the power  I will refer later to the similar circumstances that arose in Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA    The terms of settlement provide that the parties to the agreement are the applicants in each proceeding  the respondents and the group members referred to in each of the proceedings  Clause   of the agreement provides the essential terms of the settlement  which are that there is to be a verdict for the respondents  and the respondents are to pay to the applicants the sum of   million in full and final settlement of both sets of proceedings  In Lopez   Finkelstein J referred at   to the onerous task involved in the consideration of an application  As I mentioned earlier  the application in Lopez has some striking similarities to the situation which arises in the present matter  That is because  in Lopez   there was a very real likelihood that if the case went to a final hearing  the group members would not receive anything like the amount they will receive upon the approval of the compromise  The reason for this was that the company was hopelessly insolvent and success in the proceeding would have left group members in a position where their claim would be reduced to the ability to prove in a winding up  As his Honour remarked at    that is hardly an enticing position   A further similarity in Lopez was that there was an insurance fund which was available  His Honour referred at   to the effect of s   of the then Corporations Law which had the effect that the approval of the settlement and the application of the insurance funds would not  in any way  adversely affect the interests of unsecured creditors of the company  Whilst Village Life is conceded to have limited assets  what I have said about Lopez is not to suggest in any way that the company is insolvent  In this case  as Mr Abadee submitted  the stark consequences of the Court withholding its approval to the settlement would be that any successful judgment that may be obtained by the applicants and subsequently by group members would be wiped out by the legal costs which would be incurred in pursuing the proceedings to final judgment  The estimate of those costs provided in Mr Moulis s affidavit  is in an amount of approximately     million  Mr Moulis is an experienced practitioner in this field  and I accept his estimate as being within the range in this type of matter  It seems to me to be likely that the individual respondents  who would be entitled to indemnity from the insurer  would incur costs of that order in defending the proceedings  Accordingly  if the matter were to proceed to a final hearing  the entire amount of the insurance fund would be eaten up by legal fees  That is  of course  an unfortunate consequence of the complexity of this type of proceeding  Nevertheless  it is a fact which informs the fairness and reasonableness of the settlement which has been reached  Although the letter from the individual respondents  solicitors suggests that two of the respondents may have some funds at present  it is  in my view  reasonable to infer that were the matter to proceed to final judgment  all of the personal respondents would have to eat into their own assets to such an extent that there would be nothing left for the applicant and group members  That is to say there would be no financial return from success in the proceeding followedMcMullen v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd     FCR  In McMullen v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd     FCR   at   Wilcox J observed that the power in s  ZF  was    intended to confer on the Court the widest possible power to do whatever is appropriate or necessary in the interests of justice being achieved in a representative proceeding  His Honour expressed the view that Part IVA involved the introduction of a novel procedure and that it was at the time impossible to foresee all the issues that might arise in the operation of the Part  He said that for that reason  it was desirable to empower the Court to make orders necessary to resolve unforeseen difficulties  As his Honour observed  the only limitation is that the Court must consider the order to be appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceeding  In Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     Sackville J observed that there are good reasons to give s  ZF a generous interpretation  His Honour did not refer expressly to the remarks of Wilcox J in McMullen   however the passage to which I have referred from McMullen was approved by Tamberlin J in Johnstone v HIH Limited   FCA   at        followedMultiplex Funds Management Ltd v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Multiplex Funds Management Ltd v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR     a Full Court considered the question of whether a compulsory funding agreement in similar terms to the funding agreement of the present matter contravened the opt out nature of representative proceedings  Although not stated explicitly in Multiplex   it is clear enough from the analysis of the relevant provisions of Part IVA that s  J and the right to opt out is an essential ingredient of the scheme  In spite of that  the Court came to the view that the conditions of the funding agreement which effectively imposed an opt in requirement did not contravene the provisions of Part IVA  I observed at   that the execution of the funding agreement as a condition of inclusion in the represented group operates as a substantial practical disincentive to a group member to exercise the right to opt out of the proceeding  Although the appellants in that case submitted that this subverts a fundamental principle of Part IVA   I said at   that group members are nevertheless entitled to opt out  and I came to the view that the funding agreement did not contravene the provisions of Part IVA  French J  as his Honour then was  and Lindgren J agreed with the views that I expressed  I do not consider that Multiplex is authority for the proposition that the Court lacks power to dispense with the requirements of s  J  I do not consider that the general dispensing power contained in s  X  is applicable  However  in my view  there is power in s  ZF to dispense with the requirements of opt out notices followedTaylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA   at   to   I endeavoured to set out the principles which apply to the exercise of the power under s
