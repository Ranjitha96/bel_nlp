federal ct  html  In AWB Limited v Cole   FCA     AWB v Cole   I determined a claim for legal professional privilege over a document that AWB Limited  AWB  inadvertently produced to the Commission of Inquiry  the Commission  that is being conducted by the Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole AO RFD QC  the Commissioner   The present proceeding  which was instituted by AWB on   May   relates to claims for legal professional privilege over a large number of documents   I have two notices of motion before me  Under the first motion  AWB seeks the continuation of an interim injunction  which Kenny J granted on   June   until the hearing and determination of the proceeding or further order of the Court  By the second notice of motion  the Commonwealth seeks to have certain preliminary questions determined pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules prior to any trial of the issues of legal professional privilege that are raised by the proceeding   The Commonwealth has informed the Court that it will consent to the continuation of the injunction pending the final determination of this proceeding if it is unsuccessful on its notice of motion  The Commonwealth also said that it would consent to the continuation of the injunction pending the determination of its notice of motion  The Commissioner has indicated that he will abide any order of the Court  save as to costs  The Commonwealth therefore submitted that there is no present controversy as to the continuation of the injunction until the determination of this proceeding appliedBass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd

Tallglen    at       It would not be appropriate to separate a question if it would not permit or involve a conclusive or final judicial decision that is based on concrete facts  either established or agreed  for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties  Bass at     and     and Reading at      In Bass   Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ said at      As the answers given by the Full Court and the declaration it made were not based on facts  found or agreed  they were purely hypothetical  At best  the answers do no more than declare that the law dictates a particular result when certain facts in the material or pleadings are established  What those facts are is not stated  nor can they be identified with any precision  They may be all or some only of the facts  What facts are determinative of the legal issue involved in the question asked is left open  Such a result cannot assist the efficient administration of justice  It does not finally resolve the dispute or quell the controversy  Nor does it constitute a step that will in the course of the proceedings necessarily dictate the result of those proceedings  Since the relevant facts are not identified and the existence of some of them is apparently in dispute  the answers given by the Full Court may be of no use at all to the parties and may even mislead them as to their rights  Courts have traditionally declined to state   let alone answer   preliminary questions when the answers will neither determine the rights of the parties nor necessarily lead to the final determination of their rights  The efficient administration of the business of courts is incompatible with answering hypothetical questions which frequently require considerable time and cause considerable expense to the parties  expense which may eventually be seen to be unnecessarily incurred   The separate question procedure poses special problems where the preliminary question is one of mixed fact and law  Bass at      In that situation  it is essential that there be precision both in formulating the question and specifying the facts upon which it is to be decided for the reasons given by Brooking J in Jacobson v Ross     VR   at     In Bass at     the High Court said that it would be contrary to the judicial process and no part of the judicial power to effect a determination of rights by applying the law to facts which are neither agreed nor determined by reference to the evidence in the case  The Full Federal Court applied this principle in Rainsford at     and Director of Fisheries at      In Rainsford at     Kenny J said that  in order for a court exercising federal jurisdiction to utilise the separate questions procedure  either the parties must agree on the relevant facts or the court must determine the facts before deciding the question   While the refusal of declaratory relief on discretionary grounds will always be heavily dependent on the facts of the particular case  the discretion must be exercised within a framework of relevant legal principle  The cases afford guidance as to the way in which the discretion is to be exercised  In this sense  the question whether declaratory relief should be refused as a matter of discretion raises questions of fact and law  albeit heavily weighted towards the former  The separation of such a question poses special problems for the reasons stated by the High Court in Bass at     and by Brooking J in Jacobson at     In my opinion  the statements of principle by Branson J in Reading  which are summarised above in paragraph   are directly applicable  So too are the principles stated in Bass and Jacobson concerning mixed questions of fact and law  I am not satisfied that all of the necessary facts have been ascertained  agreed or proven so as to permit the judicial determination of question     as a separate question  Further  I am not satisfied that  on a separate trial of question     the Court would be placed in a position where it can consider all relevant matters before it exercises its discretion to grant or refuse relief   The Commonwealth expressly conceded that this proceeding is neither hypothetical nor abstract  and raises a genuine controversy that constitutes a  matter  appropriate for judicial determination  Bass at     Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at     and   and Oil Basins Ltd v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at      Nonetheless  the Commonwealth submitted that  because of the presently incomplete definition of the issues that will have to be resolved in this Court  the proceeding is premature  In my opinion  this submission does not assist the Commonwealth s application for separate trials  In any proceeding  the process of joining and defining the issues of fact and law that will fall the decision takes some time  and will ordinarily follow the institution of proceedings  The issues in this case are still being defined and there are several reasons why that process is incomplete  the Commonwealth wished to pursue its notice of motion for separate questions at this hearing  which the Court had originally set aside as a hearing at which it was anticipated that there would be a trial of all issues  AWB has filed most but not all its evidence in support of its privilege claims  and the Commissioner has  thus far  taken the stance that it would be inappropriate for him as a submitting respondent to assist the Commonwealth  or the Court  to determine the merits or otherwise of AWB s claims for privilege citedTepko Pty Ltd v Water Board

Tallglen    at       The courts have repeatedly warned of the dangers that attend the trial of separate or preliminary questions  In Tepko at       Kirby and Callinan JJ said that the attraction of trials of separate questions are often more chimerical than real  savings in time and expense can prove illusory and the process can generate other problems such as interlocutory appeals and consequent delays  Their Honours concluded that single issue trials should only be embarked upon when their utility  economy and fairness to the parties are beyond question  at      In Direct Factory Outlets   Sackville J said  quite correctly  that the dangers of separate trials are well illustrated by the numerous cases in which the process has miscarried  In Save the Ridge at     Black CJ and Moore J said that the O   procedure is one that should be adopted with caution as it can be fraught with difficulties  In Tallglen at     Giles CJ said that the ordering of separate trials must be carefully controlled lest fragmentation of the proceedings  particularly when the exercise of rights of appeal is borne in mind  brings delay  expense and hardship greater than that which the making of the order was intended to avoid  Similar statements can be found in this Court  see eg Novartis Corp Protection Australasia Pty Ltd v Orica Australia Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Stone J   In my opinion  this is not a case in which it can be said that  the utility  economy and fairness to the parties  of hearing and determining the separate questions posed by the Commonwealth is   beyond question  Tepko at       Nor is this simply a case where there is a risk that the asserted advantages of separate trials will prove to be illusory  It has not been demonstrated that the proposed separate trial would deliver any savings of time and cost  when compared with a single trial of all issues  If a separate trial were to be ordered  and if that trial resulted in the dismissal of the proceedings on discretionary grounds  the question whether legal professional privilege attaches to the documents would then be susceptible to determination by the Commissioner under s  AA  The process of determination before the Commissioner would  it seems to me  give rise to issues which would be no less complex than those presently before this Court  In addition  determinations by the Commissioner may not finally resolve the issue of legal professional privilege  The Commonwealth accepted that those determinations could be directly challenged in this Court under s  B of the Judiciary Act   as the Commissioner has no authority to make determinations that are wrong in law  Alternatively  determinations by the Commissioner could be the subject of judicial review proceedings in this Court pursuant to the provisions of the ADJR Act   The Commonwealth argued that if this Court refused to make a declaration in favour of AWB on discretionary grounds  and thereby allowed the Commissioner to proceed under s  AA  this Court in any subsequent proceedings under s  B or the ADJR Act would have the benefit of the issues having been properly joined and defined in a reasoned decision by the Commissioner  The Commonwealth added that the Commissioner s determinations could reduce the number of documents in dispute  either by upholding claims to legal professional privilege or by concluding that particular documents are irrelevant to his inquiries  However  on the material before me  it is equally arguable that the processes of a separate trial of questions     and     in this Court  potentially complex proceedings before the Commissioner pursuant to s  AA  and then further applications to this Court challenging or seeking to review determinations by the Commissioner  will be productive of greater delay and greater costs than would be incurred if the current proceedings proceed in the ordinary way to a trial of all issues  The evidence before me does not satisfy me that the multiple processes envisaged by the Commonwealth are likely to prove to be more efficient  less costly and less protracted consideredReading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian

hypothetical questions which frequently require considerable time and cause considerable expense to the parties  expense which may eventually be seen to be unnecessarily incurred   In Reading at     Branson J said that all of the facts that are on any fairly arguable view relevant to the determination of the separate question must be ascertainable  either as facts assumed to be correct for the purposes of the preliminary determination  or as agreed facts or as facts to be judicially determined  Where the separate question involves the grant or refusal of declaratory relief  the Court must be placed in a position where it can consider all relevant matters before it exercises its discretion to grant or refuse the relief  Reading at       On the other hand  an issue will not generally speaking be  ripe  for separate determination if it is simply one of two or more alternative ways in which an applicant frames its case  and its determination would leave other significant issues unresolved  Reading at     and Souflett Beheer at     In Reading   Branson J at     listed factors that have been taken into account by the courts in making or refusing orders for the trial of a separate question  The relevant factors include the following     i  whether the separate questions will contribute to the saving of time and cost by substantially narrowing the issues for trial or even lead to the disposal of the action     ii  whether they will contribute to the settlement of the litigation     iii  whether they will give rise to significant contested factual issues both at the time of the hearing of the preliminary question and at the time of trial     iv  whether there will be any significant overlap between the evidence adduced on the hearing of the separate question and at trial  and    v  whether the questions will prolong rather than shorten the litigation   In my opinion  the statements of principle by Branson J in Reading  which are summarised above in paragraph   are directly applicable  So too are the principles stated in Bass and Jacobson concerning mixed questions of fact and law  I am not satisfied that all of the necessary facts have been ascertained  agreed or proven so as to permit the judicial determination of question     as a separate question  Further  I am not satisfied that  on a separate trial of question     the Court would be placed in a position where it can consider all relevant matters before it exercises its discretion to grant or refuse relief   There is no agreement between AWB and the Commonwealth as to the facts and circumstances which are relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion  The argument before me made it plain that there would be significant factual disputes if I proceeded with an immediate trial of the separate questions  as requested by the Commonwealth  And there is a real prospect that significant contested factual issues would arise between the parties if question     were to be set down for preliminary hearing at a future date  In Reading at     Branson J said that a factor which tells against the making of an order under O   r   is that the question may give rise to significant contested factual issues both at the time of the hearing of the preliminary question and at the time of trial   The Commonwealth s argument that s  AA offers an alternative remedy that would be more efficient and less time consuming than court proceedings was advanced largely by way of assertion  It was disputed by AWB  and the Commonwealth s contention was not made good by placing relevant facts and evidence before the Court   The Commonwealth submitted that  by virtue of the extensive investigations that have already been conducted by the Commissioner  the Commissioner and those assisting him are already familiar with the factual background to AWB s privilege claims  This was not disputed by AWB  At this stage  however  it is unclear whether  and to what extent  the resolution of the privilege claims will turn on the evidence that has already been gathered by the Commission  AWB has not argued these privilege claims in the Commission or adduced any evidence in support of them before the Commission  Over the past week  pursuant to directions made by this Court  AWB has filed affidavit evidence in support of its privilege claims in this proceeding  The Commonwealth has not suggested that any of this evidence has previously been considered by the Commissioner  In the course of its submissions  the Commonwealth asserted that the Commission is already in possession of much of the evidence necessary to determine AWB s privilege claims  But  again  this assertion was not supported by evidence  On the material before me  I am not in a position to form any view as to the extent to which the evidence already possessed by the Commission will be directly relevant to the determination of AWB s privilege claims   Branson J held that the same principle should be applied where a claim for judicial review is made under the ADJR Act and alternatively under s  B  In such a case  Branson J said at     that  the power of the Court to dismiss the application summarily where it is clear that no order would be made in favour of the applicant if a hearing were conducted  extends to the alternative claim formulated by reference to s  B of the Judiciary Act    Having regard to the fact that the Migration Act provided that the Authority s decision was amenable to full merits review before the Tribunal  and the fact that the applicant had already commenced proceedings in the Tribunal  Branson J concluded that a more convenient and satisfactory remedy existed before the Tribunal  Accordingly  she dismissed the application   McGowan stands for the proposition that  in the context of judicial review  the court has the power to dismiss a judicial review application summarily where it is clear that the court would decline to grant relief at a final hearing  It does not assist in resolving the present application under O   r    It is not in dispute that this Court has power to refuse declaratory relief in the exercise of its discretion  The only question is whether  in the circumstances of this case  it is appropriate to order that this question be the subject of a separate preliminary trial  That question turns on the particular facts and circumstances

that there be precision both in formulating the question and specifying the facts upon which it is to be decided for the reasons given by Brooking J in Jacobson v Ross     VR   at     While the refusal of declaratory relief on discretionary grounds will always be heavily dependent on the facts of the particular case  the discretion must be exercised within a framework of relevant legal principle  The cases afford guidance as to the way in which the discretion is to be exercised  In this sense  the question whether declaratory relief should be refused as a matter of discretion raises questions of fact and law  albeit heavily weighted towards the former  The separation of such a question poses special problems for the reasons stated by the High Court in Bass at     and by Brooking

declaratory relief where the issue is one which the Parliament has entrusted to a specialist body or tribunal  or a more convenient or satisfactory remedy otherwise exists  In Forster   the Court in fact granted declaratory relief  notwithstanding the existence of pending proceedings before the mining warden in which the same issue would arise for decision  The leading judgment was delivered by Gibbs J  with whom McTiernan  Stephen and Mason JJ relevantly agreed  Having held that nothing in the provisions of the Mining Act    NSW  excluded Jododex s right to apply to the Court for a determination of its legal rights  at     Gibbs J turned to the Court s discretion to make a declaration at        The question whether the Court should make a declaration which would have the effect of deciding a question in issue in pending proceedings may often be of some difficulty  It is of course important that the proceedings in the present case were not pending in an ordinary court  However  there were some obvious reasons why a judge should hesitate before intervening when the matter was about to come before the warden  It was  of course  possible that the warden would give effect to the contention that Jododex held a valid exploration license and would therefore refuse to grant any authority to enter to the appellant  The warden might have declined to grant the appellant s applications for some other reason  Moreover  if it were ultimately held that Jododex s contention ought to fail  the proceedings before the warden would have been delayed and the appellant would have been put to additional cost and inconvenience  On the other hand  to determine the existence of the right which Jododex sought to establish  it was necessary to ascertain the true meaning and effect of a statutory provision and of an instrument in statutory form  These were pure questions of construction such as would appropriately be decided in the Supreme Court  They were difficult questions  and apparently rights of considerable value depended on the answers to them  When all these conflicting considerations are weighed  it seems to me that it cannot be said that it was not a proper exercise of judicial discretion to proceed to make a declaration in all the circumstances of the case      The fact that Jododex was seeking a declaration to forestall a possible contrary decision by the warden was not regarded as an objection to the grant of declaratory relief  per Gibbs J at     In Salmar at     Mason JA said     In the context of this case it is  however  important to note that the courts have regarded the availability of another suitable remedy as a matter which is relevant to the exercise of the discretion  The significance and weight of this consideration becomes the greater if it appears that questions of the kind sought to be determined ordinarily fall within the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal having a special capacity or experience in dealing with questions of that kind  It is clearly undesirable that there should be a departure from the ordinary and established course of deciding matters in the absence of a discernible advantage to be derived from that departure    But it may nevertheless appear  as I think it does in this case  that the question for determination is one of general significance readily susceptible of decision by the Equity Court  and that there is advantage in having the question determined by that Court in preference to awaiting the outcome of a decision in accordance with the established procedure  In this case  so it seems to me  advantage or utility lies with the making of a declaration  The question is  as I have remarked  one of general significance of a kind which the Equity Court is frequently called upon to decide   In its submissions  AWB did not dispute the basic proposition that the existence of another suitable remedy is a matter which would be relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion  However  AWB disputed that the procedures now available under s  AA constituted another suitable remedy  and that the Commission can be regarded as  or equated with  a specialist tribunal of a kind described in Forster and Salmar   AWB also said that a judicial determination of the subsistence of legal professional privilege offered it discernible advantages

The fact that Jododex was seeking a declaration to forestall a possible contrary decision by the warden was not regarded as an objection to the grant of declaratory relief  per Gibbs J at     The Commonwealth s argument is principally founded upon statements made by Walsh J in his dissenting judgment at   as follows   In my opinion  when a special tribunal is appointed by a statute to deal with matters arising under its provisions and to determine disputes concerning the granting of rights or privileges which are dependent entirely upon the statute  then as a general rule and in the absence of some special reason for intervention  the special procedures laid down by the statute should be allowed to take their course and should not be displaced by the making of declaratory orders concerning the respective rights of the parties under the statute  In other words  I think that it will ordinarily be a wise exercise by the Supreme Court of the discretion which it has under s    of the Equity Act to decline to undertake the tasks which have been committed by the Parliament to a specialized tribunal  Whilst I agree with Gibbs J  that s    ought not to be construed as if it contained words excepting from its operation cases arising under the Act  I think that the procedure set out in the Act itself should be regarded as the normal procedure for dealing with such cases      Walsh J acknowledged that grounds for judicial intervention might exist if the decisions of the warden were immune from judicial review   In its submissions  AWB did not dispute the basic proposition that the existence of another suitable remedy is a matter which would be relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion  However  AWB disputed that the procedures now available under s

federal ct  html  The Commonwealth could not refer me to any case in which the Court has made an order under O   r   for the separate trial of the question whether declaratory relief should be refused as a matter of discretion  prior to any consideration of the merits of the claim for declaratory relief  It did  however  refer me to McGowan v Migration Agents Registration Authority   FCA         FCR      McGowan    which concerned the dismissal of a judicial review application   In McGowan   the applicant sought judicial review of a decision by the Migration Agents Registration Authority to suspend her registration as a migration agent until she satisfied certain conditions  The applicant made an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under s   of the Migration Act for a merits review of the Authority s decision to suspend her registration some days before she instituted proceedings in the Federal Court seeking judicial review of the Authority s decision  The application was founded principally on the provisions of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act      ADJR Act    but also relied in the alternative on s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act   The relief sought by the applicant included an order pursuant to s   of the ADJR Act setting aside or quashing the Authority s decision  and in the alternative  orders by way of prohibition and injunction pursuant to s  B discussedEdelsten v Minister of Health     FCR   By notice of motion  the Authority applied for orders dismissing the application on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action or alternatively on the basis that it should be dismissed pursuant to s  b ii  of the ADJR Act  The first ground was not pursued  Section  b ii  provides that the Court may refuse an application for judicial review on the ground that adequate provision is made by any law other than the ADJR Act under which the applicant is entitled to seek a review of the relevant decision  Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules requires that a party who seeks to have an application for review dismissed on the ground set out in s  b ii  or in the exercise of the Court s discretion must apply promptly for such dismissal  This rule is designed to avoid the necessity for a court to consider the whole of the applicant s case where  even if otherwise the applicant would succeed  it is clear that no order would be made in favour of the applicant  Edelsten v Minister of Health     FCR   at     McGowan forms part of a line of cases which recognises that the Court has a discretion to decline to embark on the judicial review of an administrative decision if a full merits review of that decision is available before an independent statutory tribunal  and the tribunal s decision can then be
