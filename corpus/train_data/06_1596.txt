Bective Station Pty Limited v AWB  Australia  Limited   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCarr v J A Berriman Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is common ground that Bective Station did not make full payment under its first contract to purchase wheat from AWBA until a date which the evidence does not fix precisely but which was shortly after   August    It was on   August   that AWB Limited  presumably acting on behalf of AWBA  issued a statement of liquidated claim against Bective Station in the District Court of New South Wales  Clause   of the Standard Terms authorised AWBA to withhold delivery under the Second Contract until all overdue payments were made under the first contract  AWBA was thus entitled to withhold delivery throughout March   and  indeed  until at least late August    Bective Station did not thereafter request delivery of wheat or purport to terminate the Second Contract for breach because of AWBA s failure to deliver wheat under the Second Contract  Clause   of the Standard Terms  which provided that stipulations as to time were of the essence  did not operate to bring the contract to an end  assuming clause   to have not earlier ceased to operate because of Bective Station s overdue payments  it authorised an innocent party to elect to terminate the contract   Carr v J A Berriman Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Fullagar J at     The contentions of Bective Station that the Second Contract was terminated in March   by reason of non delivery of the wheat as required by the Second Contract  or alternatively on or before   August   by effluxion of time  therefore fail   Bective Station s further alternative contention that the Second Contract was terminated on   October   or five days thereafter  is founded on AWB Limited s letter dated   October    Omitting formal matters that letter was in the following terms       The purpose of this correspondence is to

  FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The nature of tendency evidence was considered in Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd   FCA         FCR   by Sackville J  with whom Whitlam and Mansfield JJ agreed  In that case the appellant alleged that the respondent s agent had made misrepresentations which induced the appellant to lease certain premises in a shopping centre  The appellant sought to adduce evidence that the agent had made similar representations to other prospective tenants of the shopping centre  Sackville J accepted that the admissibility of the evidence sought to be adduced was to be determined by reference to s   as evidence that the agent had a tendency to act in a particular way   In my view the affidavit evidence of Messrs Rowland  Setter and Gillogly referred to above is not relevantly distinguishable from the kind of evidence sought to be adduced in Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd   It is therefore to be regarded as tendency evidence falling within s    I note incidentally that in each case the evidence may  in any event  have been admissible in reply because of the evidence of Mr Adams that  in effect  he would never have said anything to the effect that  there will be no wheat in Australia from March   until the harvest begins in October    The application on which I was invited to rule  however  was an application to adduce the evidence pursuant to s     For the evidence of Messrs Rowland  Setter and Gillogly to be admissible under s   it was necessary for the requirements of both paragraphs  a  and  b  of the subsection to be satisfied  As mentioned above  Bective Station had given the notice required by paragraph  a    In determining that their evidence had significant probative value I took into account that     a  each of them gave evidence of a conversation with Mr Adams which took place within a few days of the conversation between Mr Vickery and Mr Adams   b  each of them gave evidence of Mr Adams using language similar to the language which Mr Vickery claimed that Mr Adams had used in conversation with him   c  each of them gave evidence of Mr Adams saying words to the effect that the supply of wheat could or would run out  and   d  Mr Adams  affidavit evidence was that he definitely did not say words to the effect that  there will be no wheat in Australia from March   until the harvest begins in October  as such a statement was  in his opinion  ridiculous because he could not conceive of any circumstances where the supply of wheat in Australia would ever run out citedPort Jackson Stevedoring Proprietary Limited v Salmond   Spraggon  Australia  Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A claim for damages for breach of contract must ordinarily be brought within six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued   Limitation of Actions Act    Vic  s     Limitation Act    NSW  s    However  the parties to the contract may agree a shorter limitation period   Port Jackson Stevedoring Proprietary Limited v Salmond   Spraggon  Australia  Proprietary Limited   HCA         CLR   per Barwick CJ at       The parties are in agreement that the time within which AWBA was obliged to institute a proceeding to recover damages from Bective Station for breach of the Second Contract is governed by the Second Contract  and in particular by the Standard Terms  However  there is a dispute between the parties as to the proper construction of the Standard Terms in this regard   Bective Station placed reliance on clause   of the Standard Terms and argued that as the cross claim was not filed within   months of the termination of the Second Contract it is time barred  The cross claim was filed on   March   referred toRonnoc Finance v Spectrum Network Systems Ltd     NSWLR   In Sunbird Plaza Gaudron J at   said         there is no loss of bargain whilst the contract remains on foot  It is for this reason that a vendor must bring his contractual obligation to sell to an end before he can maintain an action for damages for loss of bargain     citations omitted     See also Ronnoc Finance v

agreed  observed in Sunbird Plaza Pty Ltd v Maloney   HCA         CLR   at        Loss of bargain damages are recoverable only if the contract is at an end  Once termination due to the defendant s wrongful conduct is established the plaintiff is entitled to damages for loss of bargain     Barwick C J  suggested in Ogle   Ogle v Comboyuro Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   that termination is not an essential element in an action for loss of bargain damages  except in the case of anticipatory breach  but the preponderant opinion in Australia and England is against his view
