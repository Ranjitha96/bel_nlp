Background  The facts are not in issue  the following being drawn largely from the applicant s submissions   The applicant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on   June    He first entered Australia on   April   when he was   years old as a dependent of his father  who was employed with the Bangladesh Embassy in Canberra  On   April   he lodged an application for a subclass   Business

www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is presently important to emphasise  as Hayne J did in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng   HCA         CLR   at   that the development and application of the test of reasonable apprehension avoids the need for a court          to attempt some analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the decision maker  It objectifies what otherwise would be a wholly subjective inquiry and it poses the relevant question in a way that avoids having to predict what probably will be done  or to identify what probably was done  by the decision maker in reaching the decision in question   Because of the manner in which the case was originally put  it is appropriate to refer as well to the further observation of Hayne J in Jia Legeng  at   that      Saying that a decision maker has prejudged or will prejudge an issue  or even saying that there is a real likelihood that a reasonable observer might reach that conclusion  is to make a statement which has several distinct elements at its roots  First  there is the contention that the decision maker has an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the particular case  Secondly  there is the contention that the decision maker will apply that opinion to that matter in issue  Thirdly  there is the contention that the decision maker will do so without giving the matter fresh consideration in the light of whatever may be the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case  Most importantly  there is the assumption that the question which is said to have been prejudged is one which should be considered afresh in relation to the particular case   The applicant s case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman   was founded upon the four  elements  propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above  Put in terms of those elements  it was contended that  first the Senior Member had on   May   formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal  ie that the applicant had committed  or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed  a criminal offence on   May    This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test  It was also relevant in addition by reason of para     of Direction No   as unresolved criminal charges as  general conduct  which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para     when considering whether it was likely to be repeated  Secondly   despite his protestations to the contrary  it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible  relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend  cf Applicant VEAL of   at    Thirdly   it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case  To the contrary  the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter  thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on   May    Finally   it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so called general conduct was likely to be repeated  This much is apparent from Direction     As with the Eastman case  I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive  While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four  elements  referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended  that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes  These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal s processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Because  as will be seen  the application of this test in this matter does require an examination  amongst other things of the Tribunal s reasons  it is important to emphasise that the lay observer would be scrutinising those reasons through a quite different prism and by reference to a quite different contingency  than a judge would be when scrutinising a decision maker s reasons for decision for the purpose of discerning an error justifying judicial review  cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at      To say this is not to accord the hypothetical observer licence to indulge in implausible or improbable interpretations of reasons for decision  The lay observer is expected first and foremost to be  fair minded  citedVakauta v Kelly   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  While the evidence in the matter is that the Tribunal member who issued the listening device warrant was named in an AFP statement of facts given to the applicant in August   it has not been suggested that he was aware at the time of the Tribunal hearing that the member hearing the review application was the person who issued the warrant  Neither did the Tribunal member disclose that fact if he was then actually aware of it  In consequence  and counsel for the Minister accepted  there was no issue of waiver of bias in this matter  see Vakauta v Kelly   HCA         CLR   at     see also Shingles v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority   FCA   citedShingles v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits

immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant s contentions are R v Eastman     FLR   and R v George     NSWLR    In each case  at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question  the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was   Eastman   or subsequently became   George   the accused in the proceedings  In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do with the subject of the later charges  In Eastman the contrary was the case and  when the matter was drawn to his attention  the trial judge disqualified himself on the ground of reasonable apprehension of bias  As he said  at       What distinguishes this application from the application made in R v George is that the warrants were issued by me on the application of one or more police officers so as to facilitate the acquisition of evidence against the accused  In two instances the exercises were successful  because the Crown proposes to lead evidence of having installed listening devices under the authority of two warrants and the evidence thereby obtained  The ground for disqualifying myself is much stronger than that confronted by the trial judge in R v George        In George in contrast  an appeal challenging a conviction of the ground of apprehended bias was dismissed  the Court having regard to the nature of a criminal trial  the various activities in which judges may be involved in the administration of criminal justice and particularly  to the absence of any association  of the listening device matter  with this particular case    ii  Procedural Fairness  The applicant s case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman   was founded upon the four  elements  propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above  Put in terms of those elements  it was contended that

consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case  To the contrary  the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter  thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on   May    Finally   it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so called general conduct was likely to be repeated  This much is apparent from Direction     In light of what was said by Gallop J in Eastman   the applicant contends as well that  having made a decision to issue a warrant which required him to form a view of the applicant s recent charge  the Tribunal member ought to have disqualified himself from hearing the subsequent application which required him to form a view of the applicant s conduct and whether he was likely to re offend   For my own part  I again emphasise that the test to be applied does not require analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the Tribunal  There is no evidence as to whether  if at all prior to his decision the member recalled issuing the warrant involving Mr Islam  Such view as the lay observer might take on that matter  provided it is reasonable  may well be mistaken  That is not to the point   The Tribunal did not disclose at the hearing its participation in the issue of the warrant  The member may well have had no memory of that  The member  equally  may have known or have become aware of that participation but have considered he could or should neutralise the significance of it by determining the matter without taking into account  in any way  the   May   allegations  Alternatively and despite the significance to be attributed to  general conduct  at the stage of exercising the s   discretion  which could include  unresolved charges pending a hearing  Direction No   the member may have been of the view that account ought not be taken of the   May charge in any event as the applicant had not been convicted as charged  I express no view on any of these speculations other than to say that they would be contingencies which a fair minded lay observer could reasonably canvas in forming his or her judgment of the matter   As with the Eastman case  I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive  While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four  elements  referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended  that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes  These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal s processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity   As Eastman illustrates  the potential is there for apparent compromise of an official s decision making whenever a close relationship or association exists between the subject matter of an administrative or judicial decision to be taken by that official  and adverse information obtained  or an adverse opinion formed  relating to that subject matter in the course of  or as a result of  a separate earlier decision taken by the same official for other purposes  Where it might reasonably be said that the having of  or having had  that information or opinion by virtue of a prior official decision might compromise the proper and impartial taking of the later decision  the same official ought not participate in the later decision  To do so would involve the member in the discharge  in the circumstances  of incompatible functions  Such was the case here   It was inappropriate for the Tribunal member  having determined to authorise the issue of the warrant in relation to Mr Islam  to have then made the s   refusal determination given the association in subject matter of the two determinations or at least to have done so without the informed waiver of objection by Mr Islam to his so doing  Absent such waiver  I am satisfied that the  double might  test of the fair minded lay observer would inevitably be satisfied   I have emphasised the complex of competing possible views  that the conduct of the Tribunal member  the course of the hearing and the Tribunal s decision  could reasonably engender in the lay observer  In my view  despite the Tribunal s and  for that matter  the Minister s disclaimers  such an observer could reasonably entertain an apprehension that the Tribunal s decision might have suffered from prejudgment  The closely associated decision making that occurred here ought not be countenanced  The Tribunal should have procedures to guard against such a possibility citedR v George     NSWLR   The authorities most immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant s contentions are R v Eastman     FLR   and R v George     NSWLR    In each case  at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question  the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was   Eastman   or subsequently became   George   the accused in the proceedings  In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do

FairnesscitedApplicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is unnecessary to refer separately here to the applicable principles other than to note  as I do below  the applicant s primary reliance on the decision of the High Court in Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR     As I earlier indicated  the two grounds of this application are that  first  the Tribunal s decision was affected by reasonably apprehended bias and  secondly  denial of procedural fairness  As to the latter ground  as formulated in the application it was that            The issue of whether the applicant had committed a criminal offence on   May   was credible  relevant and significant to the decision on whether or not to affirm the refusal of the visa  As such  the Tribunal was required  as a matter of procedural fairness  to give the applicant an opportunity to respond to information regarding the allegation that he had committed an offence on   May                  During the hearing of the application before the Tribunal on   November   the Tribunal repeatedly denied the applicant an opportunity to provide a detailed or adequate response to the allegation that he had committed an offence on   May     During the course of the hearing there was some movement in  and a coming together of  the grounds  This will become apparent in what follows    a  Apprehended Bias  The applicant s case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman   was founded upon the four  elements  propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above  Put in terms of those elements  it was contended that  first the Senior Member had on   May   formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal  ie that the applicant had committed  or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed  a criminal offence on   May    This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test  It was also relevant in addition by reason of para     of Direction No   as unresolved criminal charges as  general conduct  which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para     when considering whether it was likely to be repeated  Secondly   despite his protestations to the contrary  it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible  relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend  cf Applicant VEAL of   at    Thirdly   it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case  To the contrary  the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter  thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on   May    Finally   it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so called general conduct was likely to be repeated  This much is apparent from Direction     On both of these issues the reasonable and fair minded lay observer could well consider he or she was being asked to  but was unable to  accept that the Tribunal could satisfactorily bifurcate the information it might possess on both those matters  and that it could reach its conclusion on each by reference  for example  to the three bail breaches while not taking into account in any way the view it had of the significance and character of the   May   charge derived from the listening device hearing  While the significance of  subconscious effect  is to be treated with circumspection in procedural fairness cases given the relevant inquiry in such cases  cf Applicant VEAL at   the issues of appearance and judgment in apprehended bias cases are  in my view  differently appointed  They do involve an appeal to the good sense and experience of the reasonably informed and fair minded lay  not judicial   observer   If the lay observer might experience some difficulty or reserve in accepting the potential efficacy of a self imposed  Chinese wall  in containing a prior formed opinion  that would well be compounded by the somewhat Delphic character of the Tribunal member s concluding comment on the November   warning from the Minister about  any further conduct bringing him within the provisions of s       Unfortunately this warning appears to have not been taken seriously   Unlike in Applicant VEAL both the Tribunal and the applicant were aware of the charge and of its being disregarded  As Mr Islam indicated when told it would be so treated  I appreciate it  it was to his advantage  What Mr Islam did not know and was not told  was of the member s participation in the issue of the warrant  The non disclosure of that participation did not of itself raise a procedural fairness issue  It did set the scene  though  for the applicant s apprehended bias challenge   I will order that     The application be allowed      The decision of the Tribunal be set aside      The matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law      The first respondent pay the applicant s costs of the application     I certify that the preceding sixty
