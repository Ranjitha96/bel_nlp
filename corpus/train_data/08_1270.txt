Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham     ALR   Scarlett FM found that the Tribunal s assessment of the appellant s credibility was based upon his evidence to the Tribunal  independent country information  inconsistencies within the appellant s own evidence and inconsistencies between his evidence and the independent country information  His Honour relied upon the decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham     ALR     which held that the assessment of the credibility of an applicant is a matter of fact and is a matter solely for the administrative decision maker  Scarlett FM observed that there is no basis for conducting a judicial review and interfering with the Tribunal s findings provided there is evidence upon which a credibility finding may be made   Scarlett FM satisfied himself that the appellant s own evidence and the independent country information were sufficient to allow the Tribunal to make its findings concerning the appellant s credibility  The Court finds that his Honour did not err in making such finding followedSZBYR and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Tribunal found that there were inconsistencies in the appellant s evidence  Scarlett FM noted that it was well established that inconsistencies in evidence do not constitute  information  for the purposes of s  A of the   FCA     Act  see SZBYR and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another     ALR   at     and accordingly do not constitute  information  for the purposes of s  AA  His Honour also observed that the Tribunal offered the appellant an opportunity to comment on certain aspects of the evidence  although before his Honour the appellant denied that he was given such opportunity   The Court observes that s  AA of the Act does not contain an equivalent provision to s  A   Section  A  identifies material which is not  information  for the purposes of the application of that section  However  as s  AA is merely an alternative form of notification available to the Tribunal  see s  A A    the Court considers that the exclusions contained in s  A  apply with equal force to s  AA  Such inference is supported by the collective use of the term  information  in s  A A  of the Act  a subsection which applies to both ss  A and  AA   as such use implies uniformity of meaning  Section  A A  provides       A  The Tribunal is not obliged under this section to give particulars of information to an applicant  nor invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information  if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant  and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information  under section  AA     Accordingly  the Court considers that what is not  information  for the purposes of s  A  of the Act is also not  information  for the purposes of s  AA   It follows from the above that no error is apparent in the Federal Magistrate s finding in relation to the Tribunal s compliance with s  AA of the Act  The appellant s second ground of appeal is accordingly rejected affirmedSZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The appellant
