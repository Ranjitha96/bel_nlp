 http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appellants have not filed a transcript of evidence that demonstrates error on the part of the interpreter  In the absence of transcript or other suitable evidence  I cannot infer that the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing or errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants  I can ascertain no breach of s   of the Act  See generally Soltanyzand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at      The appellants did rely upon part of the transcript said to be  carried out by  the appellant husband  However  the appellant husband himself required an interpreter for the Tribunal hearing and before me  The Federal Magistrate considered this issue and implicitly found that the evidence of the transcript carried out by the appellant husband was not probative  The asserted errors in translation are based on the opinion of a person whose understanding of English was not of a sufficient level to undertake the task of translation   To be accepted as having any probative value  evidence would need to be led by a person competent in English and Indonesian to indicate the matters that had been mistranslated or not translated at all  This has not been done  I can find no merit in the first ground of appeal citedWACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http
