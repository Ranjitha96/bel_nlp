SZIWJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedApplicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   The starting point for consideration of the appellant s arguments seem to me to be conveniently addressed in a decision of a Full Court in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   at   to    The Full Court there observed that    It is plainly not necessary for the tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in its written reasons   Their Honours pointed out that there is a distinction between the tribunal failing to advert to evidence which  if accepted  might lead to a different finding  and a failure by a tribunal to address a contention which  if accepted  might establish that the applicant has a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  Their Honours observed at   that the  inference that the tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons   However  that is an inference which will not too readily be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point   It is therefore important to note  as I have already pointed out  that the Tribunal expressly recorded the appellant s adviser s post hearing submissions which stated that the factors relied upon by the appellant may not of themselves amount to a claim for asylum but that cumulatively they created a profile of an imputed association with Falun Gong  It seems to me to follow from this and also from the lengthy statement of the appellant s claims in the Tribunal that the reasons given by the Tribunal must be read in light of those two factors  that is to say the issue which the appellant now seeks to agitate was expressly referred to by the Tribunal before it gave its findings and reasons  and the findings are therefore to be informed by that fact   I reject the submission put by counsel for the appellant that the Tribunal failed to address a contention  I do not think the appellant s argument is supported by what was said in Applicant WAEE at    The present case falls for consideration upon a fair reading of all of the reasons of the Tribunal  I have already given my views on that question   In my view it follows that the orders to be made are that the appeal be dismissed with costs       I certify that the preceding thirty

appellant seeks to raise in her amended notice of appeal do not appear on their face to be within the grounds that were raised before the Federal Magistrate  However  I think it is arguable that they fell within the unreasonableness ground and  in any event  counsel for the Minister disclaimed any prejudice to the Minister by the raising of these grounds on appeal  Accordingly  applying the principles stated by a Full Court in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   to   I would be prepared to grant leave to the appellant to raise the grounds on the appeal  That  of course  is not to say that amended grounds could be raised on appeal if the principles referred to by the High Court in Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR   at

Affairs     ALR   at   this is that the tribunal is to consider all of the component integers of the appellant s claim followedJegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   The appellant relied upon the decision of Moore J in Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA    That case was referred to with apparent approval by Finkelstein J in Jegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at    Kaur was a case in which it was argued that the tribunal considered each of the facts put forward by the applicant in isolation but failed to consider their cumulative weight  His Honour accepted that this may amount to constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction  His Honour cited a number of authorities in support of that proposition   In my view the present case falls within the approach taken by Finkelstein J in Jegatheeswaran at    His Honour observed that the separate treatment of the incident relied on in that case did not indicate that the tribunal failed to look at the case in its entirety  His Honour remarked that the tribunal stated that it reached its conclusion  h aving considered the evidence as a whole  and that there was no reason to doubt the statement  In my view that is apt in the present case  Sundberg J agreed with the reasons given by Finkelstein J  The reasons of Emmett J at   are also consistent with this approach referred toKaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The appellant relied upon the decision of Moore J in Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA    That case was referred to with apparent approval by Finkelstein J in Jegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at    Kaur was a case in which it was argued that the tribunal considered each of the facts put forward by the applicant in isolation but failed to consider their cumulative weight  His Honour accepted that this may amount to constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction  His Honour cited a number of authorities in support of that proposition   However  in the present case  for the three reasons that I have mentioned above  I consider that the Tribunal dealt with all of the integers of the claim and that the facts put forward to support the profile were considered cumulatively  Indeed  that was the view which was eventually reached by Moore J in Kaur at   to    It seems to me that the reasons given by the tribunal in Kaur pointed more strongly in the direction of a compartmentalised consideration of the claims than appears in the present case citedNABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No
