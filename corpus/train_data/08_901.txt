Tran v The Commonwealth   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAttorney General of New Zealand v Ortiz and Others   AC   In Attorney General of New Zealand v Ortiz and Others   AC     Lord Denning said at  A B    So far as England is concerned  whenever there is legislation providing that goods are to be forfeited for one cause or another  the law has always said that the forfeiture does not take effect until the goods are seized and that the title then relates back to the cause of forfeiture  If the owner or anyone else disputes the forfeiture  there are proceedings for condemnation  After condemnation  the title is perfected and can no longer be disputed by anyone   Lord Ackner observed in the same case at  C    An Act may provide for automatic forfeiture  or it may provide merely that the goods shall be liable to forfeiture if some further step is taken to that end referred toBanwell v Erceg     NSWLR   In Banwell v Erceg     NSWLR   Yeldham J at   said        there is no reason to read down or qualify the words  in respect of any contravention  so that they relate only to proceedings for an offence in respect of such contravention   In Olbers   French J considered s  A of the FMA which made provision for the forfeiture of  inter alia  a boat used in an offence against various sections of that Act  French J rejected the submission that a conviction for the alleged offence upon which forfeiture arose was necessary before forfeiture under that section took effect  see    His Honour concluded that satisfaction  to a high degree of probability  that the offences had been committed was sufficient for s  A of the FMA to take effect and it was not necessary for him to find that the offence had in fact been committed  see Olbers at     Applying the test of French J  if the Court is satisfied  to a high degree of probability  that contraventions exist  such is sufficient to engage s  A  of the Migration Act   It is not necessary that such  contraventions  should constitute  offences  for s  A  to become operative  It follows that the entry into the migration zone of all Relevant Persons on the ship constituted contraventions of the Act   Section  A  of the Migration Act refers to things that are  forfeited  to the Commonwealth  An analysis of the authorities referred to hereunder reveals that  depending upon the terms of the legislation  forfeiture may effect an immediate divestment of property or a divestment only after seizure has occurred referred toBert Needham Automotive Co  Pty  Ltd  v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia     FLR   In Bert Needham Automotive Co  Pty  Ltd  v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia     FLR    applied by the Full Court in Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth and Another   FCAFC         FCR   Rath J considered provisions of the Customs Act concerning the time at which the forfeiture occurred  see     and found at   that title passed to the Crown  immediately upon a cause of forfeiture arising  without either seizure or condemnation  Such a strict construction is consistent with decisions on customs legislation both in England and Australia   The Annandale   Burton v  Honan     His Honour continued    The terms  forfeiture   seizure  and  condemnation  are not defined in the Act  They are well known terms in customs legislation  The term  condemnation  refers not to a proceeding which has the effect of vesting title in the Crown  but to a proceeding which determines that upon some cause previously arising title had vested in the crown  Burton v  Honan   Willey v  Synan   referred toBurton v Honan   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Burton v Honan   HCA         CLR   at   Dixon CJ said of s   of the Customs Act     On authority it is clear that under the provisions of s      provided the facts exist which justify a forfeiture  the title to the goods vests in the Crown when the forfeiture takes place in consequence of the occurrence of the facts  No further proceedings are requisite to make title  although of course further proceedings may be necessary either to vindicate the title of the Crown or to exclude the claim of some person asserting a right to the goods   In response to the submissions of Tran  it is not a requirement of the Migration Act that notice of forfeiture be given to Tran  Section  A has automatic effect upon the occurrence of the events prescribed in such section  It is not relevant to the automatic forfeiture that each of the Relevant Persons was subsequently granted a visa to remain in Australia  nor is it relevant that Tran was not convicted of an offence under s  A of the Migration Act resulting from him establishing a defence under s     of the Criminal Code of a sudden and extraordinary emergency  Quite apart from the fact that an  offence  is not required to enliven s  A  the basis of the acquittal was an exculpatory provision  and contraventions exist under ss      A and   of the Migration Act by virtue of the ship s entry into the Migration Zone  The contraventions arise from the action of either Tran or others on board the ship upon such entry  and it is the contraventions which result in forfeiture referred toCheatley v The Queen and Others     CLR    On or about   October   on retrial the Applicant was acquitted by jury verdict because he established a defence to the offences  pursuant to section     of the Criminal Code in that he had brought the Relevant Persons to Australia in circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency    AGREED QUESTIONS FOR DETERMINATION     The agreed questions for determination pursuant to O   r   of the Rules are as follows       Whether the Applicant s ship with the markings Hao Kiet BL TS  Ship  was forfeited to the Commonwealth by force of section  A of the Migration Act upon the Ship entering the migration zone or at any later time up to the time of its destruction      If the answer to question   is  yes  whether the forfeiture of the Ship constituted an  acquisition of property  within the meaning of section  xxxi  of The Australian Constitution  Constitution       If the answer to questions   and   is  yes  whether  absent  just terms  compensation  section  A of the Migration Act would be invalid to the extent that it effected the forfeiture of the Ship        If the answer to question   is  no  whether the destruction of the Ship pursuant to section  B of the Customs Act constituted an  acquisition of property  within the meaning of section  xxxi  of the Constitution       If the answer to question   is  yes  whether  absent compensation under section  AB of the Customs Act   section  B of the Customs Act would be invalid to the extent that it authorised the destruction of the Ship      In the light of the answers to questions   to   whether the Applicant is entitled to an amount of compensation from the Respondent       in respect of the forfeiture of the Ship  under section  B of the Migration Act   or       in respect of the destruction of the Ship  under section  AB of the Customs Act     TRAN S SUBMISSIONS     Tran submits that the ship was destroyed by the Australian Customs Service in the exercise of the power contained in s  B of the Customs Act   and that the Migration Act accordingly has no application      If the Migration Act does apply  Tran denies that he contravened any provisions of the Migration Act and accordingly submits that compensation representing just terms must be paid under s  xxxi  of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act    Cth   the Constitution       Tran submits that a mere contravention of the Migration Act does not result in forfeiture under s  A of such Act and that only a contravention constituting an offence may lead to the imposition of a penalty of which forfeiture may comprise a part  Tran submits that unlike the circumstances in Olbers Co Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another   FCA         FCR   in which an offence under s   of Fisheries Management Act    Cth   the FMA  resulted in forfeiture of a boat  Tran s ship was not used in the commission of an offence nor was it involved in any contravention of the Migration Act   Tran submits that no contravention of the Migration Act has occurred because Article   of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees   as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees    the Refugee Convention  applies  Such article states     t he Contracting States shall not impose penalties  on account of their illegal entry or presence  on refugees who  coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article   enter or are present in their territory without authorization  provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence    Tran acknowledges that forfeiture without compensation might occur in circumstances where there has been a conviction for a criminal offence  see for example Mutual Pools   Staff Pty Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   per Mason CJ at    However  Tran submits that even in such limited circumstances the person who is to be deprived of his property is entitled to be notified  see Cheatley v The Queen and Others     CLR   at       Tran submits that dispossession of the valuable property right without compensation cannot be imputed to the legislature unless such deprivation is expressed in unequivocal terms incapable of any other meaning  see The Commonwealth v Hazeldell Limited   HCA         CLR   per Griffiths CJ and Rich J at    Tran submits that the use of the word  contravention  in s  A should be narrowly construed in view of the provisions of the Refugee Convention set out above  authorities relating to the forfeiture of property resulting from the commission of an offence in relation to criminal offences rather than circumstances of asylum seekers  and having regard to the second reading speech of Minister Ruddock when s  A was introduced into the Migration Act   In such speech the distinction was drawn between those who were in need of a  safe haven  and those who were not genuine refugees  The Minister referred to the provisions inserted into the Migration Act and the Customs Act to allow the detention  forfeiture  seizure and disposal of  inter alia  ships used in smuggling operations  Tran submits that he has not been found to have committed any criminal offence under the Migration Act or to have been involved in any contravention thereof     Tran submits that the provisions relating to seizure contained in s  B of the Migration Act were not complied with  nor is there any evidence that the Secretary by his  authorised officer    as defined in s   of the Migration Act   detained  forfeited  seized or disposed of the ship  Nor was written notice of seizure as provided by s  D of the Migration Act provided to Tran stating that the ship would be condemned if proceedings against its condemnation were not commenced within   days         Accordingly Tran submits that whilst s  A of the Migration Act provides for automatic forfeiture of a vessel used in contravention of such Act  the process contained in Subdivision C of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act must be completed for the ship to be finally forfeited  Had the prescribed process been followed  and had Tran made a claim for the ship under s  F of the Migration Act   Tran s submission that he did not contravene the Migration Act would have been heard and taken into consideration      In contradistinction to the facts in Re Director of Public Prosecutions  Ex parte Lawler and Another   HCA         CLR     Tran submits that he successfully defended the charge under s  A of the Migration Act since his defence relating to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency succeeded under s     of the Criminal Code Act    Cth   the Criminal Code     THE MIGRATION ACT     Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act is entitled  Automatic forfeiture of things used in certain offences   Subdivision A is entitled  Automatic forfeiture  and s  A which is the only section contained in such Subdivision relevantly provides    Forfeiture of things used in certain offences     The following things are forfeited to the Commonwealth     a  a vessel used or involved in a contravention of this Act  where the contravention occurred in Australia  if the contravention involved     i  the bringing or coming to Australia of one or more persons who were  or upon entry into Australia became  unlawful non citizens  or    ii  the entry or proposed entry into Australia of one or more such persons    Subdivision B of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act is entitled  Seizure   Section  B contained in such subdivision relevantly provides    Seizure of things used in certain offences     An authorised officer may seize a thing in Australia  or may order an officer to seize a thing in Australia  if     a  the thing is forfeited under section  A   or    b  the authorised officer reasonably suspects that the thing is forfeited under section  A      Subdivision C of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act is entitled  Dealing with things seized as automatically forfeited   Section  D within this subdivision provides for a notice requiring an officer to give written notice of seizure of the thing to the owner or  if the owner cannot be identified after reasonable inquiry  to the person having possession or custody of the thing immediately before it was seized  see s  D   Section  D  provides    Notice of seizure     The notice must     a  identify the thing  and    b  state that the thing has been seized  and    c  specify the reason for the seizure  and    d  state that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless     i  the owner of the thing  or the person who had possession  custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized  gives the Secretary  within   days  a claim for the thing  or    ii  within   days  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited  and    e  specify the address of the Secretary    Note  Section  F condemns the thing if it is not claimed within   days  unless the Minister gives an order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited  Section  H condemns the thing if a claim is made  but the claimant does not get a court order supporting the claim  unless the Minister gives an order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited    Section  E provides    Dealing with thing before it is condemned     The Secretary may  on behalf of the Commonwealth  cause the thing to be disposed of or destroyed if     a  its custody or maintenance creates serious difficulties  or    b  the expenses of its custody or maintenance between its seizure and condemnation are likely to be greater than its value      If the Secretary causes the thing to be disposed of  the Secretary may cause the disposal to be subject to specified conditions        Section  F relevantly provides    Thing condemned if not claimed in time     By force of this subsection  the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth   days after notice of seizure of the thing has been given under section  D   unless     a  the following conditions are satisfied     i  within the   days  the owner of the thing or the person who had possession  custody or control of it immediately before it was seized gives the Secretary a written claim for the thing     ii  the claim is in English     iii  the claim sets out an address for service on the person making the claim  or    b  within the   days  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited    Note  Section  I requires things condemned as forfeited to be dealt with in accordance with the Secretary s directions    Section  G relevantly provides    Dealing with claim for thing     If the thing is claimed under section  F     a  an officer may retain possession of the thing whether or not any proceedings for the condemnation of the thing have been instituted  and    b  the Minister may give a written order that the thing is not condemned as forfeited  and    c  unless an order has already been made under paragraph  b  the Secretary may give the claimant a written notice stating that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless     i  the claimant institutes proceedings against the Commonwealth within one month to recover the thing  or for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited  or    ii  within one month  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not condemned as forfeited    Note   An officer may retain possession even if the Secretary does not give notice  If so  the claimant will be able to recover the thing only if a court orders its release to the claimant    Note   If the Secretary does give the notice and the claimant institutes proceedings  whether the claimant recovers the thing will depend on the outcome of the proceedings    Where a claim is made for the thing  s  H is applicable  Section  H has application where the Secretary gives the claimant notice under s  G relating to the institution of proceedings to recover the thing or for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited  see s  H       Section  H  provides      If the claimant institutes such proceedings within the period of one month after the notice is given  the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth unless     a  before the end of the proceedings  the

A CONTRAVENTION OF THE MIGRATION ACT       Section  A of the Migration Act makes provision for forfeiture of a vessel where the vessel has been used or involved in a  contravention  of the Migration

Keyser v British Railway Traffic and Electric Company  Limited     KB   Lord Hewart CJ in referring to the term  forfeited  in s   of the Customs Consolidation Act    UK  said at     There may be

in the ordinary sense of that word involves an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm  A contravention of an Act does not necessarily involve the commission of an offence unless the Act or the law otherwise makes it so  cp Dimella Constructions Pty Ltd v Stocker     SASR   referred toGeorgiadis v Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www

at     where the majority said    Not every Commonwealth law with respect to the acquisition of property falls within s   xxxi  of the Constitution   It may be outside that paragraph because  although it effects an acquisition of property  it is a law of a kind that is clearly within some other head of legislative power  That is the case with a law imposing taxation or a law providing for the sequestration of the estate of a bankrupt  Or it may be outside s   xxxi  because it effects an acquisition of a kind that does not permit of just terms  as in the case of a law imposing a penalty by way of forfeiture  And  it may fall outside s   xxxi  because it cannot fairly be characterized as a law for the acquisition of property for a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws  That will generally be the case with laws directed to resolving competing claims or providing for  the creation  modification  extinguishment or transfer of rights and liabilities as an

AGREED QUESTIONS FOR DETERMINATION     The agreed questions for determination pursuant to O   r   of the Rules are as follows       Whether the Applicant s ship with the markings Hao Kiet BL TS  Ship  was forfeited to the Commonwealth by force of section  A of the Migration Act upon the Ship entering the migration zone or at any later time up to the time of its destruction      If the answer to question   is  yes  whether the forfeiture of the Ship constituted an  acquisition of property  within the meaning of section  xxxi  of The Australian Constitution  Constitution       If the answer to questions   and   is  yes  whether  absent  just terms  compensation  section  A of the Migration Act would be invalid to the extent that it effected the forfeiture of the Ship        If the answer to question   is  no  whether the destruction of the Ship pursuant to section  B of the Customs Act constituted an  acquisition of property  within the meaning of section  xxxi  of the Constitution       If the answer to question   is  yes  whether  absent compensation under section  AB of the Customs Act   section  B of the Customs Act would be invalid to the extent that it authorised the destruction of the Ship      In the light of the answers to questions   to   whether the Applicant is entitled to an amount of compensation from the Respondent       in respect of the forfeiture of the Ship  under section  B of the Migration Act   or       in respect of the destruction of the Ship  under section  AB of the Customs Act     TRAN S SUBMISSIONS     Tran submits that the ship was destroyed by the Australian Customs Service in the exercise of the power contained in s  B of the Customs Act   and that the Migration Act accordingly has no application      If the Migration Act does apply  Tran denies that he contravened any provisions of the Migration Act and accordingly submits that compensation representing just terms must be paid under s  xxxi  of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act    Cth   the Constitution       Tran submits that a mere contravention of the Migration Act does not result in forfeiture under s  A of such Act and that only a contravention constituting an offence may lead to the imposition of a penalty of which forfeiture may comprise a part  Tran submits that unlike the circumstances in Olbers Co Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another   FCA         FCR   in which an offence under s   of Fisheries Management Act    Cth   the FMA  resulted in forfeiture of a boat  Tran s ship was not used in the commission of an offence nor was it involved in any contravention of the Migration Act   Tran submits that no contravention of the Migration Act has occurred because Article   of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees   as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees    the Refugee Convention  applies  Such article states     t he Contracting States shall not impose penalties  on account of their illegal entry or presence  on refugees who  coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article   enter or are present in their territory without authorization  provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence    Tran acknowledges that forfeiture without compensation might occur in circumstances where there has been a conviction for a criminal offence  see for example Mutual Pools   Staff Pty Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   per Mason CJ at    However  Tran submits that even in such limited circumstances the person who is to be deprived of his property is entitled to be notified  see Cheatley v The Queen and Others     CLR   at       Tran submits that dispossession of the valuable property right without compensation cannot be imputed to the legislature unless such deprivation is expressed in unequivocal terms incapable of any other meaning  see The Commonwealth v Hazeldell Limited   HCA         CLR   per Griffiths CJ and Rich J at    Tran submits that the use of the word  contravention  in s  A should be narrowly construed in view of the provisions of the Refugee Convention set out above  authorities relating to the forfeiture of property resulting from the commission of an offence in relation to criminal offences rather than circumstances of asylum seekers  and having regard to the second reading speech of Minister Ruddock when s  A was introduced into the Migration Act   In such speech the distinction was drawn between those who were in need of a  safe haven  and those who were not genuine refugees  The Minister referred to the provisions inserted into the Migration Act and the Customs Act to allow the detention  forfeiture  seizure and disposal of  inter alia  ships used in smuggling operations  Tran submits that he has not been found to have committed any criminal offence under the Migration Act or to have been involved in any contravention thereof     Tran submits that the provisions relating to seizure contained in s  B of the Migration Act were not complied with  nor is there any evidence that the Secretary by his  authorised officer    as defined in s   of the Migration Act   detained  forfeited  seized or disposed of the ship  Nor was written notice of seizure as provided by s  D of the Migration Act provided to Tran stating that the ship would be condemned if proceedings against its condemnation were not commenced within   days         Accordingly Tran submits that whilst s  A of the Migration Act provides for automatic forfeiture of a vessel used in contravention of such Act  the process contained in Subdivision C of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act must be completed for the ship to be finally forfeited  Had the prescribed process been followed  and had Tran made a claim for the ship under s  F of the Migration Act   Tran s submission that he did not contravene the Migration Act would have been heard and taken into consideration      In contradistinction to the facts in Re Director of Public Prosecutions  Ex parte Lawler and Another   HCA

A CONTRAVENTION OF THE MIGRATION ACT       Section  A of the Migration Act makes provision for forfeiture of a vessel where the vessel has been used or involved in a  contravention  of the Migration Act       The ship was boarded in the migration zone as defined in s   of the Migration Act and none of the   persons referred to in para   of the agreed statement of facts  Relevant Persons  on board held a valid Australian visa  Section   of the Migration Act provides that  subject to various exceptions which are not relevant for present purposes  a non citizen must not travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect      Pursuant to s  B b  of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   Australia  includes the coastal sea of Australia  Subsection  B  of Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  defines    coastal sea  as including the territorial sea of Australia  Section   of the Migration Act defines  enter Australia  as follows     enter Australia    in relation to a person  means enter the migration zone   The authority relied upon by the Commonwealth  namely Lawler   concerned the forfeiture of a foreign fishing boat used for unlawful commercial fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone  Section   of the FMA requires a licence for a person to use a foreign boat for commercial fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone  Section  a  of the FMA empowers the Court to order forfeiture of a boat used in the commission of the offence  The High Court in Lawler concluded that such forfeiture did not amount to an  acquisition of property  for the purpose of s  xxxi  of the Constitution   Deane and Gaudron JJ observed  at   that there were two reasons why some laws  stand outside s  xxxi      Those reasons were firstly that the guarantee of  just terms  does not apply to laws  clearly encompassed in another power  and secondly that there was no guarantee of  just terms   outside the area in which s   xxxi  operates as a grant of power    Their Honours concluded at     That phrase  acquisition of property on just terms  must be read in its entirety and  when so read  it indicates that s   xxxi  applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms  It is not concerned with law in connexion with which  just terms  is an inconsistent or incongruous notion  Thus  it is not concerned with a law imposing a fine or penalty  including by way of forfeiture  or a law effecting or authorizing seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize  Laws of that kind do not involve acquisitions that permit of just terms and  thus  they are not laws with respect to  acquisition of property  as that expression is used in s   xxxi    In Lawler McHugh J said at       The complete answer to the contention of the prosecutors is that an order made under s    does not effect an acquisition of property for the purposes of s   xxxi   An order made under s    is a drastic but incidental measure whose purpose is to facilitate compliance with those provisions of the Act which regulate commercial fishing in Australian waters  When the forfeiture of property is a reasonably proportional consequence of a breach of a law passed under a power conferred by s    of the Constitution   no acquisition of property for the purpose of s   xxxi  takes place  The notion of paying fair compensation to the owner of property which is validly forfeited to the Crown for a breach of the law is simply absurd  In the case of the forfeiture of property to the Commonwealth for breach of a law of the Parliament  the question is whether the forfeiture is reasonably incidental to the exercise of a power other than s   xxxi   If it is not  the forfeiture is invalid  If it is  s   xxxi  has no operation   Consistent with the finding in Lawler and in Olbers   there has been no  acquisition of property  within s  xxxi  of the Constitution in the present proceedings because of the forfeiture of the ship  It follows that unless the forfeiture is set aside Tran is not eligible for compensation under s  AB of the Customs Act or under s  B of the Migration Act    Although the Commonwealth wrote to Tran on   July   informing him that the ship was destroyed pursuant to s  B  of the Customs Act   at that time Tran had no rights in the ship in consequence of its automatic forfeiture  Such letter cannot operate to provide any rights in the ship if a deprivation of such rights had already occurred  If the forfeiture is successfully challenged  a divesting of rights in the ship from the Commonwealth to Tran may result  In this event  because the ship had been destroyed  any claim by Tran could only be made for compensation arising out of the loss of the ship   The questions asked are to be answered as follows         Section  A has effected an automatic forfeiture of the ship when it entered the migration zone  That forfeiture remains contestable because the ship has never been condemned as forfeited  for all legal purposes  in the Commonwealth as legal owner of the property      The forfeiture of the ship did not constitute an acquisition of property within the meaning of s  xxxi  of the Constitution   but if a successful challenge is made to the purported forfeiture  circumstances could arise in which an acquisition of property within s  xxxi  may have occurred               The Court declines to answer these questions because it is unnecessary to do so in view of the answers to questions   and                  Whilst the forfeiture remains  the Applicant is not entitled to compensation under either the Migration Act or the Customs Act      I

involves an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm  A contravention of an Act does not necessarily involve the commission of an offence unless the Act or the law otherwise makes it so

well known terms in customs legislation  The term  condemnation  refers not to a proceeding which has the effect of vesting title in the Crown  but to a proceeding which determines that upon some

html   On or about   October   on retrial the Applicant was acquitted by jury verdict because he established a defence to the offences  pursuant to section     of the Criminal Code in that he had brought the Relevant Persons to Australia in circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency    AGREED QUESTIONS FOR DETERMINATION     The agreed questions for determination pursuant to O   r   of the Rules are as follows       Whether the Applicant s ship with the markings Hao Kiet BL TS  Ship  was forfeited to the Commonwealth by force of section  A of the Migration Act upon the Ship entering the migration zone or at any later time up to the time of its destruction      If the answer to question   is  yes  whether the forfeiture of the Ship constituted an  acquisition of property  within the meaning of section  xxxi  of The Australian Constitution  Constitution       If the answer to questions   and   is  yes  whether  absent  just terms  compensation  section  A of the Migration Act would be invalid to the extent that it effected the forfeiture of the Ship        If the answer to question   is  no  whether the destruction of the Ship pursuant to section  B of the Customs Act constituted an  acquisition of property  within the meaning of section  xxxi  of the Constitution       If the answer to question   is  yes  whether  absent compensation under section  AB of the Customs Act   section  B of the Customs Act would be invalid to the extent that it authorised the destruction of the Ship      In the light of the answers to questions   to   whether the Applicant is entitled to an amount of compensation from the Respondent       in respect of the forfeiture of the Ship  under section  B of the Migration Act   or       in respect of the destruction of the Ship  under section  AB of the Customs Act     TRAN S SUBMISSIONS     Tran submits that the ship was destroyed by the Australian Customs Service in the exercise of the power contained in s  B of the Customs Act   and that the Migration Act accordingly has no application      If the Migration Act does apply  Tran denies that he contravened any provisions of the Migration Act and accordingly submits that compensation representing just terms must be paid under s  xxxi  of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act    Cth   the Constitution       Tran submits that a mere contravention of the Migration Act does not result in forfeiture under s  A of such Act and that only a contravention constituting an offence may lead to the imposition of a penalty of which forfeiture may comprise a part  Tran submits that unlike the circumstances in Olbers Co Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another   FCA         FCR   in which an offence under s   of Fisheries Management Act    Cth   the FMA  resulted in forfeiture of a boat  Tran s ship was not used in the commission of an offence nor was it involved in any contravention of the Migration Act   Tran submits that no contravention of the Migration Act has occurred because Article   of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees   as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees    the Refugee Convention  applies  Such article states     t he Contracting States shall not impose penalties  on account of their illegal entry or presence  on refugees who  coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article   enter or are present in their territory without authorization  provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence    Tran acknowledges that forfeiture without compensation might occur in circumstances where there has been a conviction for a criminal offence  see for example Mutual Pools   Staff Pty Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   per Mason CJ at    However  Tran submits that even in such limited circumstances the person who is to be deprived of his property is entitled to be notified  see Cheatley v The Queen and Others     CLR   at       Tran submits that dispossession of the valuable property right without compensation cannot be imputed to the legislature unless such deprivation is expressed in unequivocal terms incapable of any other meaning  see The Commonwealth v Hazeldell Limited   HCA         CLR   per Griffiths CJ and Rich J at    Tran submits that the use of the word  contravention  in s  A should be narrowly construed in view of the provisions of the Refugee Convention set out above  authorities relating to the forfeiture of property resulting from the commission of an offence in relation to criminal offences rather than circumstances of asylum seekers  and having regard to the second reading speech of Minister Ruddock when s  A was introduced into the Migration Act   In such speech the distinction was drawn between those who were in need of a  safe haven  and those who were not genuine refugees  The Minister referred to the provisions inserted into the Migration Act and the Customs Act to allow the detention  forfeiture  seizure and disposal of  inter alia  ships used in smuggling operations  Tran submits that he has not been found to have committed any criminal offence under the Migration Act or to have been involved in any contravention thereof     Tran submits that the provisions relating to seizure contained in s  B of the Migration Act were not complied with  nor is there any evidence that the Secretary by his  authorised officer    as defined in s   of the Migration Act   detained  forfeited  seized or disposed of the ship  Nor was written notice of seizure as provided by s  D of the Migration Act provided to Tran stating that the ship would be condemned if proceedings against its condemnation were not commenced within   days         Accordingly Tran submits that whilst s  A of the Migration Act provides for automatic forfeiture of a vessel used in contravention of such Act  the process contained in Subdivision C of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act must be completed for the ship to be finally forfeited  Had the prescribed process been followed  and had Tran made a claim for the ship under s  F of the Migration Act   Tran s submission that he did not contravene the Migration Act would have been heard and taken into consideration      In contradistinction to the facts in Re Director of Public Prosecutions  Ex parte Lawler and Another   HCA         CLR     Tran submits that he successfully defended the charge under s  A of the Migration Act since his defence relating to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency succeeded under s     of the Criminal Code Act    Cth   the Criminal Code     THE MIGRATION ACT     Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act is entitled  Automatic forfeiture of things used in certain offences   Subdivision A is entitled  Automatic forfeiture  and s  A which is the only section contained in such Subdivision relevantly provides    Forfeiture of things used in certain offences     The following things are forfeited to the Commonwealth     a  a vessel used or involved in a contravention of this Act  where the contravention occurred in Australia  if the contravention involved     i  the bringing or coming to Australia of one or more persons who were  or upon entry into Australia became  unlawful non citizens  or    ii  the entry or proposed entry into Australia of one or more such persons    Subdivision B of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act is entitled  Seizure   Section  B contained in such subdivision relevantly provides    Seizure of things used in certain offences     An authorised officer may seize a thing in Australia  or may order an officer to seize a thing in Australia  if     a  the thing is forfeited under section  A   or    b  the authorised officer reasonably suspects that the thing is forfeited under section  A      Subdivision C of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act is entitled  Dealing with things seized as automatically forfeited   Section  D within this subdivision provides for a notice requiring an officer to give written notice of seizure of the thing to the owner or  if the owner cannot be identified after reasonable inquiry  to the person having possession or custody of the thing immediately before it was seized  see s  D   Section  D  provides    Notice of seizure     The notice must     a  identify the thing  and    b  state that the thing has been seized  and    c  specify the reason for the seizure  and    d  state that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless     i  the owner of the thing  or the person who had possession  custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized  gives the Secretary  within   days  a claim for the thing  or    ii  within   days  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited  and    e  specify the address of the Secretary    Note  Section  F condemns the thing if it is not claimed within   days  unless the Minister gives an order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited  Section  H condemns the thing if a claim is made  but the claimant does not get a court order supporting the claim  unless the Minister gives an order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited    Section  E provides    Dealing with thing before it is condemned     The Secretary may  on behalf of the Commonwealth  cause the thing to be disposed of or destroyed if     a  its custody or maintenance creates serious difficulties  or    b  the expenses of its custody or maintenance between its seizure and condemnation are likely to be greater than its value      If the Secretary causes the thing to be disposed of  the Secretary may cause the disposal to be subject to specified conditions        Section  F relevantly provides    Thing condemned if not claimed in time     By force of this subsection  the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth   days after notice of seizure of the thing has been given under section  D   unless     a  the following conditions are satisfied     i  within the   days  the owner of the thing or the person who had possession  custody or control of it immediately before it was seized gives the Secretary a written claim for the thing     ii  the claim is in English     iii  the claim sets out an address for service on the person making the claim  or    b  within the   days  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited    Note  Section  I requires things condemned as forfeited to be dealt with in accordance with the Secretary s directions    Section  G relevantly provides    Dealing with claim for thing     If the thing is claimed under section  F     a  an officer may retain possession of the thing whether or not any proceedings for the condemnation of the thing have been instituted  and    b  the Minister may give a written order that the thing is not condemned as forfeited  and    c  unless an order has already been made under paragraph  b  the Secretary may give the claimant a written notice stating that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless     i  the claimant institutes proceedings against the Commonwealth within one month to recover the thing  or for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited  or    ii  within one month  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not condemned as forfeited    Note   An officer may retain possession even if the Secretary does not give notice  If so  the claimant will be able to recover the thing only if a court orders its release to the claimant    Note   If the Secretary does give the notice and the claimant institutes proceedings  whether the claimant recovers the thing will depend on the outcome of the proceedings    Where a claim is made for the thing  s  H is applicable  Section  H has application where the Secretary gives the claimant notice under s  G relating to the institution of proceedings to recover the thing or for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited  see s  H       Section  H  provides      If the claimant institutes such proceedings within the period of one month after the notice is given  the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth unless     a  before the end of the proceedings  the Minister gives a written order that the thing is not to be condemned as forfeited  or    b  at the end of the proceedings  there is     i  an order for the claimant to recover the thing  or    ii  if the thing has been sold or disposed of  an order for the Commonwealth to pay the claimant an amount in respect of the thing  or    iii  a declaration that the thing is not forfeited    HAS THERE BEEN A CONTRAVENTION OF THE MIGRATION ACT       Section  A of the Migration Act makes provision for forfeiture of a vessel where the vessel has been used or involved in a  contravention  of the Migration Act       The ship was boarded in the migration zone as defined in s   of the Migration Act and none of the   persons referred to in para   of the agreed statement of facts  Relevant Persons  on board held a valid Australian visa  Section   of the Migration Act provides that  subject to various exceptions which are not relevant for present purposes  a non citizen must not travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect      Pursuant to s  B b  of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   Australia  includes the coastal sea of Australia  Subsection  B  of Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  defines    coastal sea  as including the territorial sea of Australia  Section   of the Migration Act defines  enter Australia  as follows     enter Australia    in relation to a person  means enter the migration zone referred toWhim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan and Another   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Whim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan and Another   FCA         FCR   the Full Court considered the application of s   of the Customs Act which provided that where a notice was served in respect of goods seized pursuant to s   of the Customs Act    the goods shall be deemed to be condemned as forfeited to the Crown  unless the owner gave notice stating a claim to the goods  At   O Loughlin J  with whom Spender and French JJ agreed  said    h  istorically the word  forfeiture  and its derivatives has meant an immediate loss of all interest in property as well as a loss of the right of possession    His Honour continued    Indeed  the concept of forfeiture does not evolve out of any administrative decision to which the provisions of the Judicial Review Act might attach  on the contrary  it arises by force of statute upon the happening of certain prior events   In Olbers French J considered the operation of s  A of the FMA which is contained in Subdivision B of Division   thereof and entitled  Automatic forfeiture of things   Except that s  A of the FMA provides for forfeiture upon the commission of  an offence  whereas the provisions of s  A of the Migration Act provides for forfeiture upon  a contravention  the provisions of each Act relating to forfeiture are equivalent  Each Act also contains provisions having the same effect relating to seizure and subsequent dealings with the thing including condemnation  Section  C of the FMA requires the giving of notice of seizure and s  E makes provision for the thing to be  condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth  unless a claim is made for the thing within   days after notice of the seizure   French J  at   concluded in Olbers that upon a proper construction of s  A of the FMA the vessel  the Volga  which entered Australian waters contrary to the licensing provision of the FMA  was forfeited to the Commonwealth and passed into the ownership of the Commonwealth in January     namely when the Volga first entered such waters  In affirming such decision  the Full Court at   observed that the forfeiture effected by s  A constituted a forfeiture of all interest in the Volga   Applying the rationale adopted in Olbers to the provision of the Migration Act   automatic forfeiture of the ship occurred pursuant to s  A of the Migration Act upon the entry of the ship into the migration zone on   July   carrying the Relevant Persons in contravention of the Migration Act    Such forfeiture  although effective to transfer all rights in the ship to the Commonwealth  did not finally determine that such rights should remain with the Commonwealth  French J concluded in Olbers at     The question whether property has been forfeited pursuant to s  A remains contestable after seizure until the exhaustion or non invocation of the mechanisms for contesting it under Subdiv C  That it remains for a time a contestable question does not mean that its resolution is in any sense discretionary  The characterisation of a thing as  condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth  under s  E does not involve the final transfer of title in something which was forfeited by operation of s  A   Of course if it were the case that the thing purportedly forfeited could be shown  after condemnation  not to have been forfeited  then it might be said that condemnation had effected a divesting  That is not a question which needs to be finally considered here  It does seem however that the condemnation provisions have at least a privative character   Upon forfeiture under s  A of the Migration Act   a procedure is available to determine whether the forfeiture is confirmed by condemnation under s  F of such Act  In the present proceedings neither seizure nor the condemnation process prescribed by Subdivision C of Division  A of Part   the Migration Act have been invoked  However  the fact that there has been no seizure or condemnation has no effect upon the forfeiture effected by s  A of the Migration Act   That forfeiture has vested all rights of the ship in the Commonwealth   After considering the meaning of the word  condemned  the Full Court in Olbers at   said at     Understood in this way the provisions of ss  B to  G do not themselves effect a forfeiture of the relevant property  Nor are they to be understood as conferring any broad  indeed  unfettered  discretion upon the Court  Rather  they provide a mechanism by which it can be adjudged and formally recorded whether a forfeiture has already occurred   The issue of visas to the Relevant Persons  the acquittal of Tran and the operation of the Refugee Convention may become relevant during proceedings for condemnation if the forfeiture is challenged  However  in the absence of any challenge to the forfeiture it follows there has been a deprivation of all of Tran s rights in the ship from the time it entered the migration zone  Since the forfeiture remains a  purported forfeiture   see French J in Olbers at     because the condemnation process has not been invoked  the forfeiture is not  beyond question   see French J in Olbers at     The Commonwealth submits that no compensation is payable under s  xxxi  of the Constitution because Tran has no interest in the ship as a consequence of its forfeiture citedWilley v Synan   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html
