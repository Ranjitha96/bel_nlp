Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Limited  No     FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCalderbank v Calderbank   Fam  The appellation  Calderbank offer  has its origin in the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Calderbank v Calderbank   Fam   at    In essence  a Calderbank offer is one which is made in a proceeding before judgment on the basis of it being without prejudice save as to costs and in which an offer for settlement or resolution of the proceeding is made  The right is reserved to refer to the offer if any issue arises as to costs once judgment is delivered  A court can take the offer into account in determining what costs order should be made notwithstanding that the payment into court procedure provided in the court s rules has not been followed  If the party to whom the offer is made does not obtain a more favourable result than the offer made and it is established that in the circumstances of the case that party ought to have accepted the offer  then costs will be awarded on the same basis as if there had been a payment into Court prior to judgment and judgment for a lesser amount had been obtained consideredJacomb v Australian Municipal  Administrative  Clerical   Services Union   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe refusal or rejection of a Calderbank offer  of itself  does not automatically mean  or give rise to a presumption  that the Court should make an order for costs on either a party party basis or  depending on the circumstances  an indemnity basis where the result is less favourable to the offeree than the offer  It must be established that it was unreasonable in all the circumstances for the offeree to reject the offer   Jacomb v Australian Municipal  Administrative

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlPursuant to s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  the Court has a broad general discretion in determining how  in what manner  and whether  costs should be borne and paid as a result of the conclusion of any proceeding  The usual order for costs is that costs follow the event and are paid on a party party basis unless there are special circumstances which warrant the making of some other order  However  it has long been established that the Court may award costs on a solicitor client or indemnity basis where the particular circumstances of the case warrant the Court departing from the usual order of party party costs  Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited   FCA         FCR    In Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited  supra  Sheppard J set out some of the circumstances which he considered had been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion to make an order for payment of costs not on the

that an invitation to a plaintiff to discontinue proceedings with no order as to costs is not a genuine attempt to resolve the proceeding by way of compromise for the purposes of considering the consequences of an offer made in a Calderbank letter  In an appropriate case  the giving up by a defendant of the opportunity to recover from the plaintiff the costs it has incurred in defending a proceeding can constitute consideration for a compromise which is real  particularly where the costs incurred have been substantial  The reasoning of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Leichardt Municipal Council v Green   NSWCA   supports this proposition  The cases to which I have referred in the previous paragraph do not appear to have taken into account the fact that such an offer involves the defendant giving up the opportunity to recover its costs from the plaintiff  If the proceeding was pursued to judgment in favour of the defendant  then the defendant would be able to obtain an order to recover its costs from the plaintiff  The renunciation of that opportunity  in my opinion  clothes the offer with the cloak of a genuine compromise of substance  As Giles J said in
