Elderslie Finance Corporation Limited v Newpage Pty Limited   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toJackson v Sterling Industries Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for Mr Hamilton and Newpage in liquidation  Mr Johnson  submitted that Mr Parson s attitude supported the applicants  claim that the money paid into Casino Busters  bank account should be subject to an asset preservation order while the issues surrounding its payment to Casino Busters were sorted out  The power of the Federal Court to grant such relief was recognised by the High Court in Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Deane J  with whom Mason CJ  Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed   It is important to bear in mind  however  that the purpose of such an order is to protect the processes of the Court from abuse not to provide security for the applicant for such an order  see generally Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited   Applications for such relief are often  as in this case  made ex parte  The Court does not have the benefit of hearing argument as to why such an order should not be made from the person against whom the order is sought  For this reason the Court needs to be circumspect in making such orders  In this case  however  I am satisfied that on the evidence before me the applicants have made a prima facie case that the payment by Newpage to Casino Busters is a voidable transaction under s  FE of the Corporations Act   Given Mr Parson s refusal to assist the provisional liquidator in the exercise of his duties and his denial of any knowledge of the transaction  there is reason to suspect that any order of the Court made to recover the money paid to Casino Busters and apparently still held in its bank account may be frustrated by prior dispersal of the assets  In the circumstances it is appropriate that I make the orders sought by the applicants  in the form of the penal notice that is annexed to these reasons  freezing the relevant bank account of Casino Busters up to but not exceeding the amount of   and requiring Mr Parson to give disclosure of the circumstances under which Casino Busters received the two payments mentioned above at      I certify that the preceding fifteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable
