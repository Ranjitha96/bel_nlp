Australian Medic Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedTowney v Minister for Land and Water Conservation  NSW      FCR   Section   has been the subject of little judicial consideration although it has been usefully considered by Sackville J in Towney v Minister for Land and Water Conservation  NSW      FCR    For present purposes it is sufficient if I note that in that case his Honour indicated that the section contemplated the application of an objective standard  His Honour went on to observe at   In applying the standard specified by s   of the Evidence Act   it is to be borne in mind that the expression  proper understanding  is by no means narrow  The dictionary definition of  proper  includes  complete or thorough  the definition of  understand  includes  to apprehend clearly the character or nature of  and  to grasp the significance  implications or importance of   Macquarie Dictionary   It may or may not be correct to say that the test stated in s   of the Evidence Act   is  or appears to be  narrower than the principles governing implied waiver under the general law  cf Cross on Evidence  Aust ed  par    Any precise assessment of the scope of s   must await further decisions  However  I think it fair to say that  if a privileged document is voluntarily disclosed for forensic purposes  and a thorough apprehension or appreciation of the character  significance or implications of that document requires disclosure of source documents  otherwise protected by client legal privilege  ordinarily the test laid down by s   of the Evidence Act will be satisfied   While it is true that each of the invoices on its face requires no explanation of its contents  other than the need for translation from Chinese  the invoices themselves bear upon a number of potential questions  There is sharp disagreement between the parties over the incidence  effects and duration of the alleged parallel importation  The invoices that have been produced relate to a quite confined period in   and    For my own part I am satisfied that the significance properly to be attributed to them can only be discerned if one also is aware of the nature of the request that was addressed on Hamilton s behalf to Lo   Lo  Whether it was quite specific or quite general in character  for example  could markedly affect how one would forensically evaluate the significance of the invoices  Hamilton  having tendered the Lo   Lo emails and attachments  cannot now in my view properly resist putting into evidence its own lawyers  request   In the circumstances I am satisfied that client legal privilege has been lost in relation to that request because the disclosure of the request itself is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the invoices citedLactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It is well accepted that the aim of the court s power to amend under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules is to allow all the issues which arise in a proceeding to be determined and for a decision to be given on the real
