 Leake   Jacob s Precedents of Pleadings   th Ed    Sweet   Maxwell at     as  the particulars game  i e  where parties deliberately engage in mutual brinkmanship as to the concealing and revealing of their respective cases  see  further  Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at   and    Be this as it may  the ACCC and Mr Day have each filed notices of motion which require determination of the applications they respectively make in respect of these issues of practice and procedure  The issues raised are not unrelated but I shall nonetheless consider each in turn  The Amended Defence Whether any of the many complaints made by the ACCC in respect of the adequacy of the amended defence are warranted requires a consideration of the whole of that pleading in the context of the response it makes to the statement of claim  That makes it desirable to set out in full each of these pleadings  It would detract from continuity and ready comprehensibility of reasoning so to do in the main body of this judgement  I therefore annex the pleadings to it citedDare v Pulham   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe following statement by Murphy  Wilson  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ in Dare v Pulham   HCA         CLR   at   remains pertinent to the role of pleadings and particulars as provided for by O   and O   of the Federal Court Rules     Pleadings and particulars have a number of functions  they furnish a statement of the case sufficiently clear to allow the other party a fair opportunity to meet it   Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v  Mount Oxide Mines Ltd   In liq     HCA         CLR     at p     they define the issues for decision in the litigation and thereby enable the relevance and admissibility of evidence to be determined at the trial   Miller v  Cameron   HCA         CLR     at pp       and they give a defendant an understanding of a plaintiff s claim in aid of the defendant s right to make a payment into court  Apart from cases where the parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on issues chosen at the trial  the relief which may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings  Gould and Birbeck and Bacon     CLR  at pp       Sri Mahant Govind Rao v  Sita Ram Kesho   LR   Ind App     at p      But where there is no departure during the trial from the pleaded cause of action  a disconformity between the evidence and particulars earlier furnished will not disentitle a party to a verdict based upon the evidence  Particulars may be amended after the evidence in a trial has closed   Mummery v  Irvings Pty  Ltd    HCA         CLR     at pp         though a failure to amend particulars to accord precisely with the facts which have emerged in the course of

edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOrder   rule   was relied upon by the ACCC  In that regard  my attention was helpfully drawn to the reference to that rule by French J  as his Honour then was  in Smith v Barron   FCA         FCR   at     as part of his Honour s rationale for striking out a defence which consisted mostly of bare denials including a bare denial in respect of a particular paragraph of a statement of claim which made detailed factual allegations as to events in a particular period by reference to which it was alleged that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that a company was either insolvent or would become insolvent by reason of incurring those debts  His Honour contrasted these bare denials with an affidavit read before him in which  on information and belief sourced from the company s directors  it was attested that they had reasonable grounds to expect and did expect that the company would be able to pay its debts at these times and with the requirement  found in the certificate in Form  B which must accompany a pleading and derived from O   r  B  that  inter alia  a legal practitioner certify that there existed a reasonable basis for the denial of allegations  His Honour also drew attention to particular matters alleged in the statement of claim that had not really been disputed by the director concerned in his public examination  Against this background  it becomes apparent why his Honour reached the conclusion that the defence filed was really just a  holding defence  rather than an attempt in good faith to plead to the statement of claim  This case is different  In its prescription that a defence ought not to be pleaded in an evasive way  O   r   emphasises a principle of pleading practice which is a subset of the more general requirements  found in O   r  b  and r  c  respectively  that a pleading must not have a tendency to cause prejudice  embarrassment or delay to a proceeding or constitute an abuse of process  In the face of a statement of claim noteworthy for its temporal imprecision  it is not  for example  evasive  to admit  as this defence does  para     that   for a period of time prior to June    Mr Day  was a managing director of  Craftmatic     Nor is it necessarily evasive to admit that one was but  a  rather than  the  managing director  One of the rules with respect to corporations  replaceable by virtue of s   of the Corporations Act    Cth  is that found in s  J of that Act  which provides    The directors of a company may appoint   or more of themselves to the office of managing director of the company for the period  and on the terms  including as to remuneration  as the directors see fit    emphasis added    Further  even if Craftmatic did have but one managing director at any given time  the difficulty with this statement of claim is in ascertaining what is that given time  Mr Day s obligation is to respond to the allegation made  not to speculate by making an admission as to a period of office holding which may be irrelevant to the contraventions alleged  There is no doubt that O   r   is directed to the end of requiring a party responding to a pleading to identify what truly are the issues of fact which remain controversial in the proceeding  Other rules directed to that end are  in their application to a defence  O   r  B and r   already mentioned  and O   r   and r   citedWarner v Sampson     QB  Order   rule   expressly authorises a traverse by a  statement of specific non admission   Paragraphs   and   of the amended defence each comply with that authorisation  In so doing on the basis of an alleged absence of knowledge on the part of Mr Day  they also each exemplify the observation made in Lindgren KE and Branson CM  Federal Civil Litigation Precedents  Butterworths    at   that   denial is usually employed where the alleged fact is in a party s knowledge and a non admission where it is not   I respectfully agree with that observation  The practical effect of an express non admission is the same as that of an express denial   Warner v Sampson     QB   at   per Hodson LJ  in that the opposing party is thereby put to proof of the issue but the difference between the two lies in the occasion for their employment as a matter of pleading practice  Paragraph   of the amended defence responds to para   of the statement of claim  In the way in which it is cast  para   of the statement of claim also makes  rolled up  allegations in that it conjoins allegations in respect of the separate matters of the provision of a script and the giving of instructions for the use of that script  Mr Day admits that a script was available but otherwise expressly does not admit the allegations in para   of the statement of claim on the basis of absence of knowledge  This he is entitled to do  On behalf of the ACCC criticism is further made of the way in which Mr Day s amended defence responds to the allegations as to his knowledge of pleaded facts  Allegations as to his knowledge are to be found in para       and   of the statement of claim with the responses to these allegations being found in para       and   of the amended defence  The responses take the form of express non admissions on the basis of absence of knowledge  A noteworthy feature of these paragraphs of the amended defence is their engagement with para     of that document  In para     in some detail  Mr Day makes positive allegations as to the management and control of Craftmatic and as to the nature and extent of his involvement in that management and control  It is submitted on behalf of the ACCC  with reference to the responsive paragraphs of the amended defence  as read with para     that   These paragraphs are in substance and effect pleadings of circumstances by which it might be that  Mr Day  does not know particular things but are vague and evasive and do not address the pleaded issue of whether he knows those particular things  underlining in written submission   Thus  it is submitted  para     does not amount to an allegation of material facts  contrary to O   r    A more detailed critique  which I have taken into account  of para     follows to the end of seeking to demonstrate that para     is evasive
