Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mercorella  No     FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Sobey interests did not contend that the material referred to in the affidavit of Mr Lockett was not in admissible form  There was a submission that certain of the material available to Mr Nicol arose from the erroneous disclosure of other privileged material  but there was no evidence from the Sobey interests to support that claim  and it was also accepted that the disclosure of that material was made in circumstances where in practical terms the privilege in that material could not now be maintained  see Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR    In other words  even if that material had been privileged  it had been disclosed and it was too late to do anything about it   Apart from the blanket claim that client legal privilege in the documents in PT   PT   and PT   does not exist because of the  fraud  exception to the entitlement to have communications treated as subject to legal professional privilege  Mr Nicol contended that there were particular documents in respect of which client legal privilege was not made out because     a  the documents were not described in a way which supported the claim for privilege and were not otherwise proved to be privileged     b  the documents comprised communications which were either not confidential  or where privilege had been waived by disclosure to a third party   c  the documents were not  or were not shown to be  made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice   d  the documents were invoices for the provision of legal services which did not contain privileged information or were not prepared for the dominant purpose of giving or receiving legal advice   I attach to these reasons a schedule identifying the documents over which privilege has not been claimed or  where privilege was claimed and disputed  in respect of which the Sobey interests adduced no evidence in support of the claim  An example is PT      It also separately identifies in Part   the documents over which privilege is claimed and which Mr Nicol  save for the contention based on the  fraud  exception  does not dispute  In Part   it identifies the documents about which there is a dispute  the disputed documents   I have addressed those documents separately  The fourth part of the schedule reflects my rulings on the disputed documents in the light of my reasons below  and again subject to consideration of  the fraud exception   I have in the fifth part of the schedule reflected my rulings on the documents in parts two and four  that is  documents over which I have found privilege to exist subject to consideration of the fraud exception  in the light of my conclusions on the contentions about  the fraud exception  referred toEsso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The parties did not dispute the principles generally applicable to the determination of whether a document is subject to legal professional privilege  At this interlocutory point  the common law governs the determination of whether the disputed documents are the subject of legal professional privilege  Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at      Legal professional privilege protects from disclosure any material brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice or for the dominant purpose of use in existing or reasonably participated legal proceedings  Esso at    The privilege is that of the client  rather than that of the legal practitioner referred toGrant v Downs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The party asserting the privilege in relation to a particular document or documents has the

see Propend   and per Doyle CJ in HLC at    That privilege was found to exist in HLC even though  at least arguably  the communication between the witness and the solicitor was not privileged  It existed because the document recording the statement was a communication by the solicitor who had taken the statement of the information provided by the witness  and had the necessary purpose  in that

Ltd  in liq  v Arthur Andersen     SASR   at   Doyle CJ said     I conclude from this reference to authority that the claim of privilege will fail only if there is material raising an arguable case that the relevant communications were made for the purpose of furthering or assisting a crime or fraud  and that fraud in this context embraces a range of legal wrongs that have deception  deliberate abuse of or misuse of legal powers  or deliberate breach of a legal duty at their heart  It is not enough  I consider  that one could simply say that a transaction constituted sharp practice  or fell below the normal standard of commercial probity  It is not enough  I consider  that one would regard a transaction on which advice was sought as artificial  or as deliberately structured to take advantage of the law on a topic  In light of the authorities  one cannot be more precise than that      It is not necessary to show that the solicitor in question is implicated  What is in issue is the purpose of the client   Senior counsel for both the Sobey interests and for Mr Nicol said that his Honour s observations reflected the current state of the law   They disagreed firstly as to whether the evidence on this application  in essence the affidavit of Mr Lockett  raised an arguable case that the relevant communications between the Sobey interests and Mr Tanti or other legal advisers from TP and the TP internal records were made for any identifiable purpose  They disagreed secondly upon whether  whatever the purpose for obtaining that legal advice may be  it would engage public policy so that the communications in issue would not be privileged from disclosure   In HLC   the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia  Doyle CJ  Lander and Bleby JJ  held that a

instruments would be protected  even if those concerning the creation of those instruments were not   There are a number of documents where Mr Nicol says their description and the supporting evidence of Mr Lee does not support the claim of privilege or where the description indicates the documents are not privileged  Senior counsel for Mr Nicol submitted that Mr Lee s affidavits did not generally go any distance to supporting the claim for legal professional privilege  His affidavit of   March   does not say that he has examined the documents in PT   and PT   but I infer from its contents that he has done so  He addresses sequentially the documents in issue  or most of them  and expands a little upon their description in the List of Documents  It asserts a purpose for many of the documents  I do not place much weight on that evidence as the affidavit does not indicate that he has made any inquiries beyond himself examining the documents  He has not deposed to any knowledge of the circumstances of the work carried out by TP or to any other matters which might enhance the weight to be given to his assertions  His affidavit of   March   concerning the documents in PT   is structured the same way  although it expressly states he has inspected the documents and that he sets out  the basis for our client s claim for privilege   In effect  his affidavits do little more than provide a description of most of the documents in issue  and make an assertion or submission as to why each should be privileged   I have looked at the documents in PT   and PT   to ensure I understand as much as possible of Mr Lee s evidence referred toKennedy v Lyell     Ch D   It does not necessarily follow that a document which records the communication may not be privileged  The recording of the communication may have been made for the dominant purpose of giving legal advice to the Sobey interests  In the cases of a document which records only  and apparently fully  the
