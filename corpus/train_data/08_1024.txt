Cadd v Repatriation Commission   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlaffirmedRe Cadd and Repatriation Commission   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  Shortly thereafter he completed an application to the Repatriation Commission for acceptance of  anxiety stressed  as war caused  As the Tribunal noted in its reasons   Re Cadd and Repatriation Commission   AATA   at     The application is dated   March   and includes comments that Mr Cadd ceased work on   February   as a result of his resignation and that his claimed disability had resulted in behavioural problems which in turn had resulted in  finishing work    A witness statement Mr Cadd provided to the Tribunal indicated that  between   and   he applied for employment without success  The statement listed a large number of primarily hotels and clubs which he approached for employment  He did not get a job nor  as he indicated in his evidence to the Tribunal  was he ever given a particular reason for this  In consequence  he accepted in cross examination that he had not performed remunerative work since March    By   his applications included the advice that he was not able to work more than   hours per week because of his then medical condition  That advice to prospective employers reflected the opinion in a report of a psychiatrist  Dr Ewer  of   April   that his impairments were such as to make him unfit for paid employment as he could not work eight hours per week  Dr Ewer diagnosed his overall impairment then as being   per cent attributable to PTSD and   per cent to Major Depressive Disorder  The same report indicated that the PTSD had  just emerged in the last year  and in   should be considered as  temporary    The medical evidence accepted by the Tribunal was that of Dr Ewer who provided some number of reports on Mr Cadd dating from    As the Tribunal noted  at   of its reasons  those reports       record diagnoses of changing conditions  Dr Ewer s report dated   April   recorded diagnoses of pathological gambling and adjustment disorder with depressed mood  Dr Ewer s report dated   August   again records diagnoses of pathological gambling  this time in remission  and alcohol dependence in remission  The same report records some features of PTSD  but states that Mr Cadd does not satisfy the diagnostic criteria necessary for PTSD  Dr Ewer s report of   April   stated that Mr Cadd was suffering from a major depressive disorder  It also stated that Mr Cadd did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for PTSD  It was not until his report of   April   that Dr Ewer reported that Mr Cadd had developed a number of additional symptoms so that  as of   April   Mr Cadd did satisfy the diagnostic criteria for PTSD  In his most recent report dated   July   Dr Ewer addressed the issue of depression and its cause  He commented as follows       The aetiology of his depression is probably multifactorial  His longstanding alcohol misuse probably contributed to him becoming depressed  His gambling losses were another substantial cause of his depression  His marital disharmony was another substantial cause of his depression  It is also probable that the emerging Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms contributed to his depression  citedFlentjar v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It is not contended by the applicant that the Tribunal misstated the inquiry it was required to undertake in applying s  c  an inquiry which the Tribunal acknowledged was encapsulated in the four questions formulated by Branson J in Flentjar v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD   at      which are unnecessary to repeat here   Suffice it to say that for present purposes it is only necessary to note the following     i  The Tribunal acknowledged  correctly  that the relevant  remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking  for s  c  purposes was a reference to the type of work the veteran had previously undertaken  and not to any particular job  see Banovich v Repatriation Commission     ALR   at    Further the parties accept the Tribunal in this case correctly characterised that type of work in Mr Cadd s case as  a club manager     ii  The Repatriation Commission conceded that Mr Cadd was prevented  because of his war caused conditions  from continuing to undertake work as a club manager  The Tribunal found in accordance with Dr Ewer s evidence that from some stage during the assessment period  ie the period from the application day to the date when the application or claim was determined  VE Act s   his PTSD disability alone would prevent employment for more than eight hours per week     iii  In considering whether s  c  was satisfied the Tribunal indicated the decisive issue was  as it is in this application  whether the exclusionary provisions of s  a i  applied to Mr Cadd s circumstances  It held that it did citedBanovich v

citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  For my own part  and conscious of the frame of mind to be brought to bear by a reviewing court in judicial review proceedings  see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at     I am satisfied that on a fair reading of the Tribunal s decision it cannot fairly be said to have misapprehended and thus misapplied the test in s  a i  of the VE Act  There can be no doubt that the Tribunal understood and asked itself the question required to be asked when considering whether in the circumstances a veteran ceased to engage in remunerative work for reasons other than his war caused incapacity and disease  As the respondent correctly contends  the Tribunal addressed the evidence both medical and of Mr Cadd that related to that question  In light  i  of the events which occurred since he ceased to have remunerative work in February   ie his persistent inability to get work   ii  of his medical condition at February   until the onset of PTSD in   and  iii  of his own appreciation  albeit for the most part in retrospect  of his fitness for work  but compare his   March   application noted by the Tribunal  at   of its reasons  the conclusion that Mr Cadd ceased to engage in remunerative work for a reason other than incapacity from war caused condition was one that clearly was open to it   I accept  as I earlier indicated  that the reasons given for this conclusion were economically expressed but they are discernible  At best the appeal seeks a review on the merits of the Tribunal s decision  Such is not permissible   I will order that the application be dismissed with costs   I certify
