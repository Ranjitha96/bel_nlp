Lau v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedKim v Witton     FCR   Her Honour described the application as no more than an application seeking merits review  and as one not disclosing any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal  She said that the findings of the Tribunal that there had been a breach of Condition   were open to the Tribunal  by a combination of what the applicant said he had been doing and what he had said to the delegate  so that the activity at Stonemasons was one that normally attracts reimbursement  cf Kim v Witton     FCR   at    Her Honour also concluded that the Tribunal s finding that the reasons for not cancelling the visa did not outweigh the reason for cancelling the visa was open to it on the material before it   Consequently  the Tribunal decision was not infected by jurisdictional error and the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed   The present application is supported by an affidavit of the applicant to which is annexed proposed grounds of appeal  There is substantial overlap in what is said in each of those documents consideredSandoval v

citedGomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   I should note that the arguable ground of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal was not explicitly identified before the Federal Magistrate  It emerged in the course of submissions on this application  prompted by a general reference in the proposed notice of appeal to the decision of the Tribunal being unfair and not carefully considered  I am mindful of the observations of the Full Court in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at   about the circumstances in which a new or refined proposed ground of appeal should be allowed in such circumstances  but as the applicant was not represented and because the Federal Magistrate was asked to consider generally the way in which the Tribunal had exercised its discretion under s   I think this is a case in which the point should be allowed to be considered on appeal   I will hear the parties as to how the appeal should
