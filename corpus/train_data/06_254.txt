Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Eddy   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedArnold v Queensland     ALR   That is enough to provide this Court with jurisdiction to make a sequestration order against the estate of Mr Abdul Karim on a petition presented by the Bar Council  See subs   of the Act  The fact that the Bar Council is not a separate legal entity does not deny its standing as a creditor for the purposes of the Act  cf   subs   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  Arnold v Queensland     ALR   at   per Wilcox J  A partnership is not a legal entity separate from its partners and yet it may be a creditor for the purposes of the Act  So much is implicit in subs   of the Act which provides     Subject to the Division  all debts and liabilities  present or future  certain or contingent  to which a bankrupt was subject at the date of the bankruptcy  or to which he or she may become subject before his or her discharge by reason of an obligation incurred before the date of the bankruptcy  are provable in his or her bankruptcy   Moreover  under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   an action by two or more persons claiming as partners who carry on business in partnership within Australia may be brought in the partnership name  Applying the same facilitation  there seems no reason why an action by the constituent members of the Bar Council  claiming as such  may not be brought in the name of the Bar Council  particularly where the debt arises out of the performance by the Bar Council of the statutory functions and duties vested in it by the LPA   It follows that I decline to dismiss the application on the ground of the Bar Council s standing consideredNilant v Macchia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is common ground that the requirements of reg     were not complied with  Indeed  I would agree with the Bar Council s submission that they were blatantly breached  While I agree that the conduct complained of relates to a  proceeding   the calling of the creditors  meeting  under the Act  See Nilant v Macchia   FCA         FCR   at       per Hill J  at   per Weinberg J  having regard to the intent of the regulation as described in   supra  I do not agree that such conduct can be characterised as a formal defect or irregularity so as to be saved from invalidity by subs   of the Act  In my view  the blatant breach of the requirements of the regulation would be  of itself  sufficient to grant declaratory relief in terms of the first prayer in the Bar Council s application   There is a further consideration  Mr Fisher s status as a creditor of Mr Abdul Karim is also put in issue by the Bar Council  The Bar Council submits that on the basis of the facts set out at   supra  I should find that Mr Fisher is not a creditor  There is  in my view  considerable force in this submission  Counsel for Mr Abdul Karim submitted that the subsequent   March   withdrawal by Mr Fisher of his statement of claim as a creditor was no more than a concession that he did not want to vote at a meeting of creditors  That may explain the withdrawal  on the same date  of the proxy in favour of Mr Illek  but not the withdrawal of the statement of claim  It was also submitted that Mr Abdul Karim would not lightly sign a statement of affairs including  as a liability  an amount which  to his knowledge  was not a liability  To do so  it was submitted  would render Mr Abdul Karim liable to the prospect of a penalty of imprisonment for   months  see subs  f  and    But the fact that Mr Abdul Karim genuinely believed Mr Fisher was a creditor and  apart from his statement of affairs  there is no evidence to suggest he did so believe  while it may absolve him from the penal consequences of s   does not make Mr Fisher a creditor  if he was not already one  More telling is the action of Mr Fisher in subsequently withdrawing his statement of claim   The state of evidence on this issue is less than satisfactory  however  I think it is open for me to find  and I do so find  that Mr Fisher was not a creditor of Mr Abdul Karim on   February   appliedPretorius v Dalton Carpet Tiles Pty Ltd     FCR   I am not prepared to make an order in terms of the third prayer in the Bar Council s application an order restraining Mr Dennis from calling a further meeting of Mr Abdul Karim s creditors because the   days prescribed by s   of the Act have passed and there is no application for an extension of time before me  See Pretorius v Dalton Carpet Tiles Pty Ltd     FCR   at      Mr Dennis has no power to call any such meeting   Mr Eddy must pay the Bar Council s costs of the application   I give the parties liberty to

of the Act  relevantly par  a  mandates that the meeting of the debtor s creditors be held not more than   working days after the relevant consent or approval was given  The relevant consent was given on   January   and  having regard to week ends and the Australia Day public holiday on   January   it seemed to be common ground that  in the absence of time being extended see Re Ringuet     FCR   the last day on which the meeting could be held was Wednesday    February   the day on which it was purportedly held   Regulation     of the Bankruptcy Regulations mandates that the controlling trustee give to  inter alia   each creditor  at least   days before the first meeting of creditors is called under an authority under s   notice in writing of the date  time and place of the meeting  a copy of his  the controlling trustee s  report  a copy of his  the controlling trustee s  statement and a copy of information relating to his remuneration   The intent is clear each creditor is to receive  in sufficient time before the meeting  the information needed to make a determination about voting see the various voting alternatives open to creditors under subs   of the Act  The importance of getting this information on a timely basis is manifest in the modification to subs  Y  of the Act made by Part   of Schedule   of the Bankruptcy Regulations  s   and reg     namely            lA  The controlling trustee may adjourn a meeting to undertake further investigation in relation to the controlling trusteeship  that the controlling trustee considers necessary               IB  The creditors attending the meeting may  by special resolution  revoke the trustee s decision to adjourn the meeting            In other words  the trustee s right to adjourn is conditional upon it not being vetoed by creditors  Of course  creditors can only exercise their veto if they are present at the meeting and here the creditors were not only not given timely notice of the meeting but the notice wrongly informed them not to attend the meeting because it would be adjourned consideredWentworth v NSW Bar Association   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The different status and standing of the New South Wales Bar Association on the one hand and the Bar Council on the other was the subject of observation in the joint judgment of Deane  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Wentworth v NSW Bar Association   HCA         CLR   at      The Bar Association is a company limited by guarantee  Its articles of association provide for  a Council of the Association   Article   and for its business to  be managed by the elected members of  that  Council   Article     It is that Council  constituted by its elected members  which functions as the governing body of the Bar Association and which has been referred to as  the Bar Council   The Bar Council has no separate legal identity but  as will later appear  it has specific statutory powers and functions in relation to barristers and candidates for admission to the Bar   In his written submissions  counsel for Mr Abdul Karim submitted that the New South Wales Bar Association is not an entity having the benefit of the order for costs relied upon by the Bar Council to establish standing as a creditor nor is it or does it purport to be the applicant in the present proceedings  So much may be accepted even though the terms of the certificates certifying the orders made by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal on   June and   September   which were produced by the Bar Council in response to a notice to produce might suggest that the costs orders were in favour of the Bar Association and not the Bar Council  The first certificate reads         That Michael Saadey Abdul Karim pay the costs of the Association of these proceedings in the sum of            The second certificate reads         That Michael Saadey Abdul Karim pay the costs of the Bar Association in the sum of            Both certificates show the applicant as being The Council of the New South Wales Bar Association and  in my view  the reference to  the Association  in order   of the first certificate and the reference to  the Bar Association  in order   of the second certificate should be read as being shorthand references to The Council of the New South Wales Bar Association  in other words  the Bar Council  and not the Bar Association itself  In any event  that is how I propose to read them  Such a reading is consistent with the terms of subs   of the Legal Profession Act    the LPA   s  E of the Legal Profession Act    NSW  which provides        The Tribunal must make orders requiring an Australian legal practitioner whom it has found to have engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct to pay costs  including costs of the Commissioner  a Council and the complainant  unless the Tribunal is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist            The term  Council  is defined in s   of the LPA to mean  the Bar Council or the Law Society Council    Indeed  counsel for Mr Abdul Karim said there was no dispute that there is a debt owing to the Bar Council  What is disputed  he submitted  is the standing of the Bar Council to bring a proceeding in this Court as a creditor in the name of the Bar Council  rather than in the names of its identified constituent members
