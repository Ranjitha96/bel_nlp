Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A failure to take into account a relevant consideration only vitiates a decision if that consideration was one which the administrator was   bound   to take into account  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR     None of the considerations identified by the Applicant are relevant considerations which the President was   bound   to take into account when making a decision pursuant to s  PH   And some of the   Particulars   alleging considerations which  it is said  should have been taken into account do not fully set forth the facts relevant to the consideration relied upon   One specific matter may be instanced  One  Particular    again repeated in respect to the other Grounds of Review   asserts that the First Respondent failed to consider correspondence in which it is alleged the delegate   told the applicant he would be harmed if he continued the complaint    Such a statement in correspondence emanating from the Commonwealth or its officers or delegates  without more  would be disturbing  The context  however  explains the true nature of what was being conveyed to the Applicant   There is no objective basis upon which any such view could be reached in the present case  To the extent  for example  that it is alleged that it was unreasonable to take into account some considerations  a fundamental difficulty confronting the Applicant is that the considerations taken into account have been held to be relevant to the exercise of the discretionary power conferred by s  PH   A further difficulty is that the weight to be given to any consideration is a matter for the First Respondent and not for the Court  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR    Mason J there at     in an oft cited passage  observed  It follows that  in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations  it is generally for the decision maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power     I say  generally  because both principle and authority indicate that in some circumstances a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance  or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance  The preferred ground on which this is done  however  is not the failure to take into account relevant considerations or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations  but that the decision is  manifestly unreasonable   This ground of review was considered by Lord Greene MR in Wednesbury Corporation     KB at       in which his Lordship said that it would only be made out if it were shown that the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come to it  This ground is now expressed in ss  g  and  g  of the AD JR  Act in these terms      However  in its application  there has been considerable diversity in the readiness with which courts have found the test to be satisfied      But guidance may be found in the close analogy between judicial review of administrative action and appellate review of a judicial discretion  In the context of the latter  it has been held that an appellate court may review a discretionary judgment that has failed to give proper weight to a particular matter  but it will be slow to do so because a mere preference for a different result will not suffice      So too in the context of administrative law  a court should proceed with caution when reviewing an administrative decision on the ground that it does not give proper weight to relevant factors  lest it exceed its supervisory role by reviewing the decision on its merits   Nothing of that kind has been exposed in the present proceedings   A further way in which the Applicant wishes to advance the Ground of unreasonableness  and also a way in which he seeks to contend that there has been a failure to take into account matters said to be relevant  is his repeated requests made of the Commission and the delegate as to the   need to gather more information    The Applicant urged both the President of the Commission  and later the delegate  to make inquiries  The delegate took the position that it was not his task to conduct detailed inquiries with a view to resolving potentially competing factual accounts  but rather to seek to conciliate the complaint if at all possible  At the outset  in a letter written to the Applicant on   November   the delegate wrote in part as follows    As I have indicated in previous correspondence my function is not as such to make a final or binding determination of the factual issues in the complaint  I am not required to make an operative decision of these matters  I am to inquire into the complaint and to attempt to conciliate it  This may or may not be what you would wish ideally to be the position  you may wish that the legislation provided something different from this  But I do ask you to understand that that is what the legislation provides and that it is all that I can do  Please assist me by focussing on this and by bearing in mind during the conciliation that this is what is involved  It will help you to understand what I am doing and what I have done citedMinister for Immigration   Citizenship v Haneef   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii

Keefe Nominees Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Although it is by no means clear  it is considered that s   does not preclude an order for costs being made in favour of the Attorney General  Such a conclusion is at least consistent with the following observations of Spender J in O Keefe Nominees Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd  No     FCA         FCR   at    His Honour there addressed s  A of the Judiciary Act    Cth  as follows  Section  A  provides that where an Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Australia intervenes in proceedings in a court under that section  the Court may make such order as to costs against the Commonwealth or the State as the case may be as the Court thinks fit  In my opinion  where there is intervention by an Attorney General under that section  the Court does not have power to order costs in favour of the intervening Attorney General  Subsection   provides that where an Attorney General has intervened in a court  then  for the purposes of the institution and prosecution of an appeal     the Attorney General shall be taken to be a party to the proceedings   The effect of this subsection is that  where an Attorney General has intervened under s  A for the purposes of an appeal  costs orders may be made against him or her or in his or her favour  But subs   provides that where the Attorney General has instituted an appeal in which the Attorney General has intervened  the Court hearing the appeal may make such order as to costs      as the court thinks fit    The significance of according to the Attorney General the status of   a party to the proceedings   as explained by his Honour  is a reason for concluding that costs can be awarded both for and against the Attorney General   The orders of the Court are     The Further Amended Application as filed on   March   be dismissed       The Applicant to pay   of the costs of the Fourth Respondent   I certify
