cases cth FMCA  htmlThere is before me an Application for Leave to Appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on   December     SZMTM v Minister for Immigration and Anor   FMCA   in which the Federal Magistrate dismissed with costs an application for judicial review of a decision made by the second respondent  the Refugee Review Tribunal   the Tribunal   handed down on   August    The Tribunal s decision affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent   the Minister   dated   April   not to grant a protection visa to the applicant  On   November   Driver FM ordered that the applicant s application for judicial review be listed for a preliminary hearing under r     of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules     the FMC Rules    That hearing took place on   December    On that day the learned Federal Magistrate dismissed the application pursuant to r    a  of the FMC Rules  The effect of that order was that the decision of the Tribunal was affirmed  Rule     of the FMC Rules is in the following terms        Show cause hearing     At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause  the Court may   a  if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed dismiss the application  or   b  if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court  or   c  without making an order under paragraph  b  make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application       To avoid doubt  a dismissal under paragraph    a  is interlocutory appliedfollowedDecor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe discretion which the Court has in respect of such an application for leave to appeal is a wide one  However  it must not be exercised idiosyncratically and ordinarily would be informed by the principles articulated and explained by a Full Court of this Court in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR    In that case the Court held that  in determining whether leave to appeal should be granted from certain interlocutory decisions made by a judge in a patent case    The decision in question must be demonstrated to be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered on appeal  and    The Court must be satisfied that substantial injustice would be visited upon the applicant if leave is not granted  This is the test which I propose to apply to the application before me in the present case  The applicant is a citizen of the People s Republic of China   the PRC    She arrived in Australia on   February   on a subclass   business visa  On   March   the applicant lodged an application for a Protection  Class XA  Visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  A delegate of the Minister refused the application for a protection visa on   April   and notified the applicant of that decision by letter dated  incorrectly    December    The reasons which accompanied that letter were dated   April    On   May   the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision  The protection claims which the applicant made originally were set out in a typed statutory declaration expressed in English  This statutory declaration accompanied her application for a protection visa  In that declaration  the applicant claimed that she had escaped from her husband  who was violent towards her  with the help of her friend  Ms Zhang  but that they were both later arrested for anti revolutionary activities  In the proceedings before the Tribunal the applicant claimed to fear persecution in the PRC on the basis of her political opinions  She also claimed to have been a victim of domestic violence whose problems had been publicised in newspaper articles by a journalist from the Fujian Daily   She claimed that she had been accused of being a counter revolutionary on account of these articles  and that she had been subsequently detained for one month during which time she had been tortured and interrogated  The applicant appeared at a hearing before the Tribunal on   July    At that hearing  she had the assistance of an interpreter qualified to interpret as between Mandarin and English  On   July   the Tribunal sent a letter dated that day to Ms Priscilla Yu who was then acting as the migration agent for the applicant  In that letter the Tribunal invited the applicant to comment on and or respond to information which was then of concern to it and which it considered to be relevant to its consideration of the applicant s application  That letter was issued pursuant to s  A of the Migration Act    Cth    the Act
