the document until it was read  He  however  relied upon the implied undertaking as to discovery for that decision followedEsso Australia Resources Limited v Plowman   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Esso Australia Resources Limited v Plowman   HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ said after referring to the implied undertaking as to discovery  It would be inequitable if a party were compelled by court process to produce private documents for the purposes of the litigation yet be exposed to publication of them for other purposes  No doubt the implied obligation must yield to inconsistent statutory provisions and to the requirements of curial process in other litigation  eg discovery and inspection  but that circumstance is not a reason for denying the existence of the implied obligation   Whilst those documents are subject to the implied undertaking referred to in O   r  A of the Hong Kong Rules  in my opinion  consistent with the decisions in Esso Australia Resources Limited v Plowman   HCA       CLR   and Patrick v Capital Finance Pty Ltd  No     FCA     the applicant should make production of those documents in this jurisdiction  No doubt the applicant will  at or before making production  apply to the High Court of Hong Kong for a release from the implied undertaking in relation to those documents  I should say that the defendants in the Hong Kong proceedings have indicated they have no objection to the documents being produced citedHarman v Home Department State Secretary     AC   That rule states the rule in Harman v Home Department State Secretary     AC    Mr Robertson said that his client was unable to produce the document  which it has discovered  by reason of that rule  It seems to me that there are two answers to that proposition  The first is that whilst  of course  the implied undertaking in relation to discovery binds a party  it does not prevent a party making discovery under obligations of other rules of court citedMulley v Manifold     CLR   There are two answers given by the applicant in response to this aspect of the application  First  it is contended the respondent has failed to identify any documents which it says the applicant has failed to discover  Secondly  the applicant contends it has not been shown that any of that correspondence would be relevant in relation to any of the issues raised on the pleadings in this proceeding  I want to make it clear that whilst many of the rules relating to discovery have changed over the recent past it is still a requirement of discovery that the document which is sought to be discovered is relevant to an issue raised on the pleadings in the sense described by the High Court in Mulley v Manifold     CLR    Attempts have been made today to show that there might be evidence which would indicate that some correspondence could be relevant to this proceeding  That  in my opinion  is not an appropriate way of addressing the question of discovery and  in particular  in addressing a question of discovery so late in the proceeding and so shortly before trial   It seems to me  if the respondent wishes to identify documents which it says ought to have been discovered  it must be able to do so precisely by reference to the pleadings and by reference to the document which it says ought to be discovered  In other words  it ought to be able to discharge the obligation which lies upon a party seeking further and better discovery  In my opinion  the respondent has failed to do so in respect of this category of documents and for that reason alone I would decline to make the order sought  However  I am also not persuaded  at this stage  that any of the documents sought are relevant in the sense to which I have referred   The second category of documents has three groups of documents within it  First  it contains a witness statement given by a director of the applicant  and secondly  it lists a witness statement given by a defendant in the Hong Kong proceedings  Both of those documents were filed in the proceedings in Hong Kong  The third group of documents  within this larger category  are documents which were discovered by the defendants in the Hong Kong proceedings notfollowedNilsen Industrial Electronics Pty Ltd v National Semiconductor Corporation     FCR   There are  as I have said  authorities contrary to those two decisions and I was taken to them by Mr Robertson  counsel for the applicant  In Nilsen Industrial Electronics Pty Ltd v National Semiconductor Corporation     FCR     Olney J

He  however  relied upon the implied undertaking as to discovery for that decision followedPatrick v Capital Finance Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Chief Justice Mason s dicta was applied by Tamberlin J in Patrick v Capital Finance Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at   to    The point which the Chief Justice made and which was applied in Patrick v Capital Finance Pty Ltd  No     FCA   is that  notwithstanding the implied undertaking  if rules of court of a jurisdiction apply to a party who has a document in that party s possession by reason of a process in another jurisdiction  that party is still obliged to comply with the processes in the second jurisdiction and make discovery of the document if it be an application for discovery and production if production follows upon discovery  For that reason  in my opinion  the document should be produced   Secondly  there has been no suggestion made by the applicant that the applicant could not obtain a release from the implied undertaking in the High Court of Hong Kong  Indeed  the applicant has sought and obtained a release in relation to other documents  I infer from the fact that such a release has been obtained  that the applicant could obtain a release in relation to the implied undertaking in respect of the witness statement of Cheng Chun Keung  The same applies to the documents discovered by the defendants in the Hong Kong proceedings which are presently in the possession  custody or control of the applicant  The applicant has discovered those documents and the respondent seeks production of them   Whilst those documents are subject to the implied undertaking referred to in O   r  A of the Hong Kong Rules  in my opinion  consistent with the decisions in Esso Australia Resources Limited v Plowman   HCA       CLR   and Patrick v Capital Finance Pty Ltd  No     FCA     the applicant should make production of those documents in this jurisdiction  No doubt the applicant will  at or before
