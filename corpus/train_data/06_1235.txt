Norilya Minerals Pty Ltd  In the Matter of Dean Edward Ireland v Adam Jonathon Ireland as named Executor of the Estateof Dean Edward Ireland   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedIreland v The Queen  unreported CCA Sup Ct of A  Library Number     May  Norilya applied to the trial judge for restitution orders under s   of The Criminal Code  WA   Those orders were made on   August    They took the form of orders directing the transfer of moneys and assets to Norilya from accounts and companies apparently controlled by the prospectors  The prospectors each lodged an appeal against their convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal  Enforcement of the restitution orders was stayed  However the appeals were dismissed on   May   Ireland v The Queen  unreported CCA Sup Ct of WA Library Number     May    The restitution orders made were thereafter enforced  Norilya recovered     upon the execution of the orders  Norilya commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on   August   against the prospectors  In their defence to the civil action filed   December   the prospectors denied that the samples submitted for assay from the phase   and phase   drillings contained gold which had been added to those samples  In August   Norilya applied for summary judgment in the civil action in reliance on the convictions of the prospectors  Summary judgment  for damages to be assessed  was granted against each of the prospectors in August    The calculation of the damages in that case would  of course  have had to take account of sums received under the restitution orders citedEasterday v R     A Crim R  In   the prospectors lodged a petition for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy  The petition was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal by the Attorney General pursuant to s   of the Sentencing Act    WA   Such a petition is to be heard and determined under the section as if it were an appeal against the convictions  Upon the hearing of the petition the Court quashed the convictions of each of the applicants on   March   Easterday v R     A Crim R    The result turned upon non disclosure by the Crown of a document relating to share trading patterns in the market at the relevant time which might have pointed to other persons as responsible for the alleged salting of the assay samples  The failure by the Crown to disclose the report to the defence in a timely fashion was found by Scott J to have put the prospectors in the position where a relevant line of investigation could not be pursued  He was of the view that the Crown s case was a very strong circumstantial evidence case but that notwithstanding that the appeal should be allowed  Steytler J observed  at       the hearing of the appeal before us  the appellants sought to mount a case which was rather different to that advanced by them at trial  They acknowledged that salting had occurred  They conceded that the evidence was overwhelming in that respect  However  they advanced the proposition that it was not them who had salted the tenements and that the fresh or new evidence now available demonstrates that others had both the motive and opportunity to do so  They contend that the absence of this fresh or new evidence at the trial and at their previous appeal deprived them of a real chance of acquittal which would otherwise have existed  citedEasterday v State of Western Australia     WAR  The Court of Criminal Appeal  in a judgment published on   June   declared the restitution orders to be null and void  It also held that it had a discretionary power to order the repayment of moneys paid pursuant to a restitution order  The Court gave the parties the opportunity to make submissions as to further orders that should be made Easterday v State of Western Australia     WAR   citedEasterday v State of Western Australia   WASCA  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  htmlOn   October   following submissions  the Court said it would further order that Norilya repay to each of the prospectors the amount received by it from that prospector pursuant to the making of the restitution orders  An application for a stay by Norilya was dismissed  Steytler J said      seems to me that in this case  too  the effect of a stay would be that the applicants would not be restored to all that was lost by them as a consequence of the erroneous judgment     Instead  Norilya would be allowed to benefit from the judgment by retaining money which it would not otherwise have held and to which it has yet to establish any entitlement     The position would  in reality  be no different than if the Court had declined to make orders for restitution pending the outcome of the civil action  That being so  and given the potential prejudice which that course might work upon the applicants  as a consequence  at least  of what would then be their inability to resort to any funds  which might otherwise have been repaid by Norilya  for the purpose of funding their defence of the civil action  and given also that no other basis has been put forward to support the imposition of a stay  it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to order a stay and I would decline to do so       v State of Western Australia   WASCA    at      The formal order of the Court of Criminal Appeal required Norilya to repay to Mr Ireland the sum of      The judgment for damages which had been entered against each of the prospectors in the civil action in the Supreme Court was set aside by consent on   December    Mr Dean Ireland had lodged a debtors petition on   March   pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   He became bankrupt on that date  Norilya lodged a proof of debt in the bankrupt estate for the amount of    This was for the difference between loss and damage suffered by Norilya and the total amount recovered by it from the prospectors under the restitution orders  On   April   Norilya received a distribution of     in the bankrupt estate  Mr Ireland was discharged from bankruptcy with effect from   March    The civil action in the Supreme Court of Western Australia was commenced between Norilya  then Noranda  and the prospectors on   August   by writ of summons  The indorsement on the writ stated that      Plaintiff s claim is for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation  alternatively damages for misleading or deceptive conduct pursuant to sections   and   of the Fair Trading Act   arising out of representations made by the defendants in or about

that case the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that a right of action which the former bankrupt had to challenge certain orders of the Industrial Commission  remains vested in his trustee  It

cth HCA  htmlNorilya is concerned that the discharge of Mr Ireland from bankruptcy does not excuse it from the requirement to seek leave to prosecute its claim for fraud in the civil action  It is concerned  moreover  that the claim for fraud may arguably be a claim for liquidated damages comprising the purchase price paid by it to Mr Ireland at the direction of Acarus to acquire a   interest in the tenements  So the damages claim  albeit based in fraud  may give rise to a  provable debt  within the meaning of s    To the extent that the claim seeks recovery of moneys paid by way of the purchase price for the tenements  it is arguably a claim for liquidated damages  As was said in Spain v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand Limited   HCA         CLR    at   per Knox CJ and Starke J      is well said by Mr Odgers  Pleading and Practice    th ed  p    whenever the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled     can be ascertained by calculation or fixed by any scale of charges  or other positive data  it is     liquidated       On the other hand  in Cornelius v Barewa Oil and Mining NL  In liq      ALR   Burt CJ observed that  at             claim for damages for fraudulent

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlNorilya contends that by reason of the High Court s decision in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Limited   HCA         ALR   an action for

in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract or promise  The bankrupt is not discharged from liability  The claim may be pursued by the claimant during the bankruptcy and after discharge from bankruptcy  By contrast  a claim for unliquidated damages for misleading or deceptive conduct by the bankrupt  which induced the claimant to make a contact with the

one of some complexity and the justice of the case requires that Norilya has the opportunity to pursue what may be in effect  a set off against the obligation which it has to repay the restitution moneys under the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal Macquarie Bank Ltd v Bardetta     ALR   at      Conti J   I am not disposed to attach any such condition to the grant of leave  which in this case will only be necessary in relation to the fraud claim  The question whether any stay of proceedings should be sought in the light of the unsatisfied orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal is a matter for the Supreme Court  The justice of such a condition is not immediately apparent  For the preceding reasons I propose to grant leave to Norilya to continue with the proceeding issued against the respondent and others in the Supreme Court of Western Australia  In my opinion the costs of this proceeding should be costs in the Supreme Court proceeding  but I will hear from the parties as to
