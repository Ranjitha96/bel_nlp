is manifest  such as the likelihood of plainly inconsistent judgments  considerable caution should be exercised in summarily dismissing the subsequent application at an early stage of the proceeding when it may be more appropriate for the issue to be considered upon  meticulous examination  of  precisely pleaded defences  Custombuilt Homes Pty Ltd v Dowell   WASCA   at   per Wheeler JA  with whom Steytler P agreed    The alleged unreasonableness is not manifest  No doubt it would have been more convenient for the issues raised in the current proceeding to have been advanced in New South Wales  but that is not the question  It is not appropriate when considering the Anshun principle to say what a party could reasonably have done  The proper question is  was it unreasonable to do as that party did  In any event there is much force in the view expressed by Wheeler JA in Custombuilt Homes that one should exercise considerable caution in summarily dismissing an application before the issues are crystalised after the filing of a defence  To this one might add  and or contentions of fact and law   A judgment dismissing the matter before the Court is interlocutory in nature  It would

austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Kooee points to Primus  application for a declaration in the proceeding in this Court for a declaration that the release provisions of the Separation Deed are void and of no affect against it with respect to the matters the subject of this proceeding  Primus says that in New South Wales it relied on the release provisions to defeat an argument by Kooee that Primus had been negligent in the provision of information required under the Separation Deed  Primus says that  in this Court  it wishes to allege that the release provisions are ineffectual to protect Kooee from allegations that it misled and deceived Primus  and made misrepresentations which led to Primus entering into the Separation Deed  It relies on the principle referred to in Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd  No    New York Deli case    FCA         FCR   at     to the effect that exclusion clauses can t operate to defeat claims made under s   of the Trade Practices Act   Primus contends that a ruling to that effect would not lead to a judgment inconsistent with that in New South Wales which concerned an examination of entitlements under the Separation Deed itself and not any claims based on a statutory remedy or allied contractual claims   The application and statement of claim in the current proceeding came to Kooee s attention in January    In a letter to Primus  solicitors dated   January   the solicitors for Kooee said that the Federal Court proceeding came as a surprise to Kooee as it arose out of the same series of transactions that were the subject of the New South Wales case  The letter asked for the reasons why the subject matter of the  Victorian proceeding  was not raised in the  NSW proceedings   In a reply letter  dated   February   the solicitors for Primus took issue with the suggestion that the current proceeding arose out of the same series of transactions as in the New South Wales litigation  After identifying the different nature of the two sets of proceedings  the letter said  The quantification of loss in the current proceedings will have regard to the amount of the debt recovered  and not recovered  in the NSW proceedings  but there is no question of double recovery   The letter also stated  no doubt on instructions  that  Our client  Primus  was unaware of the potential availability of the causes of action which found the present proceedings at the time the NSW proceedings were instituted  Having sought and received legal advice as to its rights  our client determined to initiate the current proceedings promptly appliedLing v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The invocation of the Anshun principle is a serious step and a power

legal principle sought to be invoked by Kooee is usually described as Anshum estoppel having its roots in Australia in the judgment of the High Court in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   see especially at   and     per Gibbs CJ  Mason and Aichin JJ  The question for determination in the current proceeding is whether the Anshun principle applies to require Primus  proceeding in this Court to be dismissed without adjudication of its merits   Before embarking on an examination of the relevant facts which are said to give rise to the operation of the Anshun principle  it is important to bear in mind the parameters of the principle guided by Anshun itself and subsequent judgments of the Full Court of this Court and various State Courts of Appeal  I now

earlier proceeding  Gibbs v Kinna at    These two factors were described by Kenny JA in Gibbs v Kinna at   as     necessary but not sufficient considerations for the application of the principle       Another factor indicative of unreasonableness is whether any judgment or order made in the later proceeding would conflict with any judgment or order made in the earlier proceeding  Anshun at   Gibbs v Kinna at   and Egglishaw at    Putting to one side this factor and the two factors examined in the preceding paragraphs  there still remains a question whether the failure to raise the claim in the earlier proceeding was unreasonable  Egglishaw at     The claims raised in the current proceeding were relevant to the subject of the earlier proceeding given that the same parties were agitating issues concerning the breakdown of their commercial relationship  However  the fact that the New South Wales litigation and this proceeding are closely related is insufficient to invoke the Anshun principle  The question remains whether it was unreasonable for Primus to defer reliance on its current claims   Based in large part on the inadequacy of the response of Primus  solicitor when asked why he did not raise the current issues earlier  the subject matter of the current claims could have been raised in the New South Wales Supreme Court at first instance  This may have been done by way of an amendment to that proceeding  with the original New South Wales claims raised in addition or in the alternative   The alleged unreasonableness is not manifest  No doubt it would have been more convenient for the issues raised in the current proceeding to have been advanced in New South Wales  but that is not the question  It is not appropriate when considering the Anshun principle to say what a party could reasonably have done  The proper question is  was it unreasonable to do as that party did  In any event there is much force in the view expressed by Wheeler JA in Custombuilt Homes

and law   A judgment dismissing the matter before the Court is interlocutory in nature  It would still be open to Kooee to advance its submissions based on the Anshun principle at the trial of the proceeding when the issues will be more clearly defined   This is not a clear case for the invocation of the Anshun principle  The critical facts will differ substantially from the essential facts which were relevant in New South Wales  where the Separation Deed was the main focus of the Court s analysis as distinct from the conduct of Kooee over a confined period  There is no risk of inconsistent judgments or orders  It was not unreasonable for Primus to refrain from advancing its current claims before the Supreme Court of New South Wales referred toPrimus Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Kooee Communications Limited   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  There is a further consideration in support of the view that Primus did not act unreasonably in not raising the issues in the current application in the New South Wales Supreme Court proceeding  That reason would defeat the current motion even if the view that the facts are not substantially the same is in error  The reason is that no judgment or order can be made in the current proceeding which will conflict with any judgment or order made in New South Wales  The judgments in New South Wales give effect to the Separation Deed by interpreting the rights of the parties under it  Any judgment in this proceeding will focus on the conduct of Kooee in the six month or so period leading up to the termination of the VSPA to examine whether Kooee engaged in conduct of the kind which caused compensable damage to Primus  As Einstein J said at   in Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Kooee Communications Limited   NSWSC     The VSPA received only minimal attention during the hearing  It is likely sufficient for present purposes to do no more than to set out the recitals and some detail from the schedules   An examination of the entirety of those reasons gives no cause for concern of any likely embarrassment in the sense that this Court will be required to consider taking a contrary view on any issue to that taken by Einstein J or the Court of Appeal  On this ground alone the motion must be dismissed  It is not unreasonable to defer the bringing of a claim which could have been brought in an earlier proceeding if there is no likelihood of inconsistent orders or judgments  In this context the submissions of Primus on the deed of release issue referred to at   above are persuasive referred toR   J Lyons Family Settlement Pty Ltd v   Macquarie Street Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  A finding of relevant unreasonableness is not to be made lightly  It is a severe test different from a test of severe inconvenience  The starting point should be free access to the courts  R   J Lyons Family Settlement Pty Ltd v   Macquarie Street Pty Ltd   NSWSC   per Bryson JA   Primus  from   until   supplied telecommunications carriage services to Kooee for re sale to customers of Kooee  Primus carried out functions in Kooee s name such as billing  revenue collection  call centre support and customer relations  A written agreement known as the Virtual Service Provider Agreement or the VSPA regulated the commercial relationship between Primus and Kooee  Amongst other things  the VSPA provided for the distribution of revenue collected by Primus between Primus and Kooee resulting from the re sale of telecommunications services to Kooee s customers  The parties entered into the VSPA in July    A  letter agreement  dated   April   extended the operations of the VSPA until   August     During the operation of the VSPA  Primus and Kooee had a difference of opinion about the operation of the provisions of the VSPA which dealt with the distribution of income between Primus and Kooee and  in particular  the amounts owing to

proceeding is an abuse of process  It based that submission on the judgment of the High Court in Walton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   where at     Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ held that it would be an abuse of process to allow a party to litigate afresh a matter which has already been disposed of in earlier proceeding  That is because it would be manifestly unfair to do so  No such abuse of process arises here  The matter sought to be now litigated is entirely different in character to that disposed of in the earlier proceeding  The earlier litigation resolved a dispute about the meaning of the Separation Deed  This proceeding concerns a dispute about the circumstances which led to its making   The Court will order as follows     The respondent s motion of   March   is dismissed
