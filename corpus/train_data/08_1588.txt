Review   Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedWoodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems   RPC   The Registered Designs Act    UK  adopted the concept of the informed user  with the consequence that UK courts can provide some guidance in this country  The first useful judicial exposition of the informed user standard in England appears to be that of his Honour Judge Fysh QC  sitting as the UK Patents County Court  in Woodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems   RPC     Architectural Lighting    In Architectural Lighting   his Honour  at   defined the informed user as follows  First  this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design and I would think  a regular user at that  He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say  through use at work  The quality smacks of practical considerations  In my view the informed user is first  a person to whom the design is directed  Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of  the man in the street    Informed  to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer  it imports the notion of  what s about in the market  and  what has been about in the recent past  I do not think it requires an archival mind  or eye  or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations  if any   In connection with the latter  one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things  as Mr Davis reminded me  these are not petty patents  Therefore  focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology  if any   I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the  man skilled in the art  whose  nerd like   and other  attributes seem too technical  Technip France SA s Patent   EWCA Civ       R P C

appropriately regarded as an informed user  In the present context  women as a class are the ordinary users of ladies  garments  but not all women have the requisite degree of familiarity to be described as informed users  Thus  whilst there will be some women who subscribe to fashion magazines  such as Vogue or Collezioni that illustrated the prior art in this case  and have particular

referred toSmith  Kline   French Laboratories Ltd s Design Application   RPC   Ultimately  it seems to me that what was said in Smith  Kline   French Laboratories Ltd s Design Application   RPC   at   is as true a guide as any  In this case  Graham J  as the UK Registered Design Appeals Tribunal  said that      colour cannot be ignored  though normally differences in colour are unlikely to be important  Colour may or may not make a material difference  depending upon the circumstances and nature of the design in question   I would adopt this approach in considering designs registered under the Designs Act   The fact that a design is registered in colour through the use of colour photographs  unaccompanied by a statement of newness and distinctiveness  is relevant to determining the extent of the monopoly sought and given  Everything that is shown in the registered design  unless disclaimed in some way  forms part of the subject matter protected by registration  The pattern  including colour  that is shown on the registered Review Design is thus part of what is protected  and is  as the above reasoning indicates  to be accorded some weight  How much weight is to be given to pattern and colour will depend on the nature of the product and the relative importance of the different visual features of the registered design  as viewed by the informed user  having regard to the prior art  and the freedom of the designer to innovate  If colour is important  it will be so because the factors relevant to the registered design lead to this conclusion  As indicated already  pattern  including colour  is a feature that an informed user would consider has some significance in creating the overall impression of the Review Design  a conclusion borne out by the use of colour photographs to depict the design in the registration application   In the present case  an informed user would  as Ms Mudie s evidence and the prior art showed  regard colour as an element in the pattern that forms part of the overall look of the registered Review Design  The Review Design is depicted on the register in a colour photograph of a store dummy wearing a garment in a patterned fabric in natural tones with orange  brown and blue fine  fronds leaf  pattern  giving it  as Ms Mudie and Ms Ellis agreed  an African or tropical look  This pattern  and the colour that is part of it  is  however  only one element in the overall impression of the registered design  It is  as previously observed  entirely different from the pattern on the Redberry garment   The applicants claimed that Redberry had made  imported and sold garments copied from the Review Design  Copying is not  however  relevant to the issue of infringement  compare Proctor   Gamble at   per Jacob J  Copying from registered designs is permissible providing the copying does not result in a product that embodies a design that is substantially similar in overall impression to the registered design   A design is a registrable design if the design is new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design  see s    The expression  prior art base  is defined in s   and includes designs publicly used in Australia and designs published in a document within or outside Australia  Redberry argued that the Review Design was not validly registered because it was not new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base  see s    The Redberry challenge was effectively to distinctiveness rather than newness  see s    Section   calls for a determination as to whether the design said to be registrable is distinctive  which means the design is not substantially similar in overall impression to a design or designs forming part of the prior art  The test of substantial similarity here again turns on the considerations set out in s   of the Designs Act  to which reference has already been made referred toReview Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The applicants also sought general damages on an alternative basis  As I stated in Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd   FCA     New Cover   in a case of design infringement  general damages may be awarded on the basis of the diminution of the value of the Review Design as a chose in action  The manner in which such damages are to be assessed is discussed in New Cover and applies in this case as well  As in New Cover   there is no satisfactory evidence as to the sales history of the Review Design  but there is some evidence as to the value to Review of its designs and the image they created  Adopting the approach as outlined in New Cover   if it had been necessary to do so  I would have assessed the effect of infringement at the time it occurred  and had it been made out  on the potential market for the Review Dress at     In the circumstances of this case  had the claim for infringement been made out  a further question would have arisen as to whether Redberry could successfully invoke s  b  of the Designs Act   Kun Ming Liu  Redberry s managing director  secretary and shareholder  gave evidence that Redberry sourced its garments from China  where other persons manufactured them  and imported them into Australia for wholesale sale  Mr Liu s evidence was that Redberry  through its buyer  bought ready made garments or commissioned garments after having seen the manufacturer s sample  Mr Liu denied that Redberry arranged for the manufacture of any particular garment  He was unable to say  however  whether the Redberry garments in question in this case had been bought ready made or commissioned after the buyer was given a sample   Mr Liu stated that  at the time of trial  Redberry employed a buyer named Sui Qiang Ke to select garments from suppliers and manufacturers in Guangzhou  but that Mr Ke had not bought the Redberry garment  Mr Liu stated that  between February   and February   Redberry had employed another person based in China to assist Mr Ke  by the name of Qi Hong Wang  Mr Liu s evidence was that Ms Wang had not worked for Redberry since that time and he had been unable to contact her  By implication  it was Ms Wang who had been the buyer for the Redberry garments   There was no evidence  documentary or otherwise  identifying the manufacturer in China of the Redberry garments  Mr Liu sought to explain what might be seen as an evidentiary deficiency by reference to the failure to find Ms Wang  Further  Mr Liu s evidence was that Redberry did not keep records beyond five years  a period corresponding with taxation law provisions   This did not  however  explain the lack of records that would have identified the manufacturer of the Redberry garments since the documents in question would presumably have related to a period less than five years ago  I accept that the deficiencies in the documentary record produced to the Court were thus not adequately explained  These deficiencies weighed against accepting Mr Liu s evidence   On balance  however  whilst there were some unexplained deficiencies and inconsistencies in Mr Liu s evidence  I would ultimately accept his evidence as essentially truthful  The applicants failed to persuade me that I should not do so  As I have said  Mr Liu was  amongst other things  Redberry s managing director and was knowledgeable about the generality of his company s business  Difficulties with his evidence arose from the fact that he had virtually no facility in English language  I formed the impression that  overall  he gave his evidence truthfully even if this reflected his distinctive and perhaps culturally conditioned understanding of what had occurred and what was required in answering the questions addressed to him  I accept that Redberry did not employ its employees to make the garments in question  Mr Liu s evidence left open the possibility  however  that Redberry commissioned another person to make the garments to a sample that Redberry s buyer had been shown  Accordingly  had the buyer s direction to make the garments and or the making of the garments taken place in Australia   then Redberry might properly have been regarded as having made the garments in contravention of s  a  of the Designs Act  In this event  Redberry would have been liable for a primary infringement  as opposed to a secondary infringement and Redberry would have been unable to rely on s  b  of the Designs Act  I discuss below the significance of the fact that  on Mr Liu s evidence  the buyer commissioned the making of the garments in China   where the garments were manufactured   The applicants sought additional damages under s   of the Designs Act  I would not regard such additional damages as having been warranted  even if the infringement claim were made out  I refer to the general principles concerning additional damages as outlined in New Cover at     If Redberry infringed  its conduct in importing and selling the Redberry garments in July   was in ignorance of Review  s design rights and at a time when the existence of such rights had only briefly been a matter of public record  Redberry s infringing conduct  if this is what it was  could not on any view be considered flagrant  see also   above  Redberry apparently ceased the conduct of which the applicants complain when it became aware of their claim and  in any case  before the issue of proceedings  The amount of profit to Redberry was modest less than     In substance  the applicants  case on additional damages rested on allegations as to the  the closeness of copying  and that it was  the apparent business practice of Redberry and or related entities to engage in copying the garment designs of other designers   Ultimately  notwithstanding the submissions of the applicants  counsel to the contrary  I would regard the evidence designed to support these allegations as irrelevant and  therefore  inadmissible  Put another way  the evidence that the applicants sought to have admitted under s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  is not so admissible because it would not have the significant probative value that the provision requires  Two of the applicants  other garments were the subject of specific cross examination  PS   and PS   and PS   and PS    being two sets of identical Review and Redberry garments  were put to Mr Liu in cross examination and he conceded  as indeed he had to do  that they were very much the same  Indeed  they were plainly identical or virtually identical  At most  however  this evidence  if admissible  established that  on at least two occasions  Redberry had imported and sold by wholesale garments that were copies of Review garments   Other labels were also canvassed in cross examination  but nothing additional need be said about this   In the designs context  copying per se is not unlawful  however  and does not establish a design infringement citedJones v Dunkel     CLR   Counsel for the applicants argued that  when Redberry called Mr Liu  it called the wrong witness  and that it should have called the buyer  Mr Ke  In relation to the absence of Mr Ke  he relied on the rule in Jones v Dunkel     CLR     Jones v Dunkel    The applicants  counsel argued that the inference as to Redberry s status as a manufacturer might  in the absence of testimony from Mr Ke  be more comfortably drawn against Redberry  I reject this submission  The evidence was that Mr Ke had not bought the garments in question  This being so  it might fairly be thought unnecessary and even inappropriate to call him  In this circumstance  the absence of testimony from Mr Ke does not justify an application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel    In this context too  counsel for the applicants relied on the similarity between the Redberry garment and the Review Design  as supportive of the fact that the manufacturer of the Redberry garments had copied the Review Design  This would not  however  provide any evidence that Redberry  as opposed to someone else  made the garments in question  Counsel for the applicants also sought to rely on evidence that the applicants and other persons had alleged on other occasions that Redberry had copied garments and thereby infringed copyright and trade mark  For the reasons explained below  however  I would not regard this evidence as admissible citedJumbunna Coal Mine NL v Victorian Coal Miners  Association   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As noted
