Asaad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Counsel for Mr Asaad seeks a declaration that the above provision does not authorise Mr Asaad s removal from Australia in circumstances where the removal would pose a serious threat to his safety or that of other persons  Counsel says that because a substantial question of statutory construction is involved  there is a prima facie case to be tried and the status quo should not be disturbed  see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O Neill   HCA         CLR   at    This  it is said  and the balance of convenience in this case  together weigh in favour of Mr Asaad and warranted the making of the interlocutory orders he seeks   Mr Asaad has filed an affidavit affirmed by Ms Paula Farrugia  a psychologist  who has known Mr Asaad for about four months while visiting the Villawood Detention Centre in which he is detained  Ms Farrugia has been informed by Mr Asaad that he suffers from acute epilepsy and has been informed by other detainees that they have observed him suffering from seizures  Ms Farrugia understands that Mr Asaad has epileptic seizures on an almost daily basis and that he has regularly had two to three epileptic seizures per day  She herself has observed his condition after a seizure  which lead to large bruises on his face and arms   In January   Ms Farrugia discussed Mr Asaad s condition with him and he indicated that he had previously been hospitalised at Canterbury Bankstown Hospital  Liverpool Hospital and at a psychiatric unit at Bankstown Hospital  Ms Farrugia states that Mr Asaad had been on a hunger strike for   days in January   and during March and April he had been on a further hunger strike for   days as part of an effort to have his request for relocation granted consideredBeyazkilinc v Manager  Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Counsel for the Minister submits that this Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the application on the basis that the question of the reasonable practicability of removal is not a jurisdictional fact  Counsel refers to the decision of Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager  Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre   FCA         FCR     which involved a decision under s   of the Act to remove from Australia an unlawful non citizen in detention who suffered from mental illness  His Honour held that the proposed removal of Mr Beyazkilinc from Australia pursuant to the subsection was a  privative clause decision  as that term is defined in s   of the Act   The question of the reasonable practicability of the removal was held by his Honour not to be a jurisdictional fact  Counsel for the Minister says that  applying this ruling in the present case  the Court does not have jurisdiction and therefore the application to restrain the Minister must fail   In the course of his judgment in Beyazkilinc   FCA       FCR     Besanko J referred at     to four relevant factors to be taken into account in determining whether there was an arguable challenge to removal  At     his Honour noted that  while two of the factors suggested that the question of reasonable practicability should be characterised as a jurisdictional fact  the other two factors spoke strongly against it and outweighed the first two factors   Counsel for Mr Asaad contends that the relevant decision in this case is not a privative clause decision  see s   of the Act   and as a result would not be a decision for the purpose of s  A  This would in turn mean that there is room for argument that the reasoning of Besanko J is wrong  Counsel also contends that once the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked  then it has jurisdiction to do whatever is necessary to ensure that it determines the matter and does justice on the application   In my view  it is reasonably arguable  at least sufficiently so for the purposes of granting interlocutory relief in the present case  that the reasoning and decision of Besanko J is wrong when his Honour weighed the various considerations leading to the conclusion concerning the jurisdictional fact  I am also of the opinion that there is sufficient room for argument in this case on the question of the application of the privative clause  Accordingly  in order to preserve the status quo and having regard to the balance of convenience  which  on the evidence  I am satisfied  clearly favours the non removal of Mr Asaad from Australia  I grant the interlocutory relief sought by Mr Asaad   The foregoing are the reasons for my decision to make the orders on   May    I direct that the parties approach my Associate in chambers to arrange for the listing of this matter for further appropriate directions    I certify that the preceding

sought interlocutory relief against his removal from Australia and Mansfield J made an order that the Commonwealth of Australia be restrained from removing him until further order  His Honour s judgment in that case was not appealed
