SZLKP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn adopting this course  it seems to me that the Tribunal was alive to the procedure  counselled by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at especially   para    There  in respect of a Tribunal proceeding  the court noted that the Tribunal had not identified particular aspects of the visa Applicant s account as important issues in the course of the hearing  that it had not challenged what the visa applicant had said  and that it did not say anything to him that would have revealed to him particular issues that were live issues in the context of the consideration of that particular visa application  Rather  based on what the delegate had decided  the Tribunal had left the visa Applicant in that case in a position where he would  and should  have understood that there was a quite different central and critical issue for determination  in the context of that case  as to whether the Tribunal was satisfied that a claim for a protection visa had been made out  No such criticism can be voiced of the way in which the Tribunal dealt with the case in this instance  nor in any failure on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court to quash the decision of the Tribunal on such a basis  Instead  what is revealed is a considered value judgment by the Tribunal  having well and truly put the male Appellant on notice in respect of critical  factual issues for determination  It is worthy of note  also  that the Tribunal asked the male Appellant  in the course of the hearing  whether he had any other information to provide in relation to the visa application  and that he responded that he did not  It was then that the Tribunal gave the male Appellant notice that the Tribunal might  on the information before it  be in a position to give an oral decision  The response  apparently made by the male Appellant  was that he wanted to change his life  and that he came  here  ie  to Australia
