Byrne v Repatriation Commission   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlaffirmedByrne v Repatriation Commission   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth AATA  html  A coronial inquiry found that Mr Byrne had died in a   tragic accident   and that the cause of his death was drowning  That conclusion was adopted by the Repatriation Commission  which refused Mrs Byrne s claim for a pension  upon being satisfied that the veteran s death was not service related  The Veterans  Review Board affirmed the Commission s decision  which was later affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal   Byrne v Repatriation Commission   AATA    Mrs Byrne appeals the Tribunal s decision   Mrs Byrne put to the Tribunal that her husband suffered from ischaemic heart disease  IHD  and coronary artery disease  CAD  each said to be war caused conditions  It was accepted by the Tribunal that Mr Byrne did suffer from CAD  at    The issue in this appeal concerns the Tribunal s finding that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that CAD was not a contributing factor to the death of Mr Byrne by drowning  Two grounds of appeal are pressed  The Tribunal s finding that it was not satisfied that Mr Byrne suffered from IHD is not challenged and those parts of the notice of appeal which refer to IHD are not pressed  It is convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal first citedByrnes v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mrs Byrne relevantly posited to the Tribunal that her husband s ability to survive in the waters of Tantangara Dam when his boat overturned was impaired by war caused CAD  The Tribunal accepted that hypothesis to be reasonable  at    By s   of the Act  the applicant s claim was then required to succeed unless      one or more of the facts necessary to support that hypothesis were disproved beyond reasonable doubt  or    the truth of another fact in the material  inconsistent with the hypothesis  was proved beyond reasonable doubt   thus disproving  beyond reasonable doubt  the accepted hypothesis      Byrnes v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at   Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   at     Mrs Byrne submits that  as a matter of construction  the Tribunal s satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt only applied to his death by drowning and that the Tribunal failed to apply the test as enunciated in Byrnes to the contribution of  relevantly  CAD to the death   That submission is rejected  The Tribunal had already determined that the kind of death was drowning  at    That was not in issue  It is clear that the Tribunal understood that the question for determination was whether it was satisfied that the hypothesis that CAD had contributed to his death had been disproved beyond reasonable doubt  The Tribunal set out the test as enunciated in Byrnes at    In that context and as a matter of construction  the requisite satisfaction expressed at   of the Tribunal s decision related directly to the contribution of CAD   The first and primary ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to refer to the evidence or other material that was the basis for its finding that CAD did not contribute to Mr Byrne s death  Mrs Byrne submits that the Tribunal gave no reasons or no sufficient reasons for that conclusion as required by s  B  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth    It is necessary to have some understanding of the context of the Tribunal s conclusion and the structure of the Tribunal s decision  The Tribunal considered the whole of the evidence before it  then gave its reasons and consideration under consecutive headings   The Tribunal acknowledged  at   that  having found a reasonable hypothesis  Mrs Byrne s claim would succeed unless the hypothesis was disproved beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with the principles enunciated in Byrnes at   and noted in the Tribunal s decision  It then stated at      Having considered all the evidence  we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Byrne s death did not arise out of and was not attributable to a cardiac event of a kind described by Associate Professor Richards  Dr Craig  Dr Freeman or Dr Burn  that is  a cardiac event that was a consequence of IHD or CAD      That was the evidence considered in detail under the heading  consideration of the kind of death    The Tribunal expanded on that conclusion with respect to IHD at   and  at   said     The opinions relating death to IHD and CAD were based essentially on there being no water in Mr Byrne s lungs and his  inability  to save himself  Those opinions concluded that death was caused by such a cardiac event rather than by drowning  On the evidence  we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Byrne drowned  and that neither IHD nor CAD contributed to his death      T  he evidence   as referred to in that paragraph  clearly refers back to the detailed discussion of the evidence earlier in the Tribunal s reasons  It was that evidence which disproved the hypothesis that Mr Byrne s ability to survive in the water was impaired by war caused CAD   There was detailed consideration of the evidence in the Tribunal s reasons  The Tribunal cited that evidence as the basis for its conclusion  The reasons explain how and why the Tribunal came to its conclusion  It rejected the premises on which the hypothesis of CAD as a cause of death was based  Once those premises were rejected  the hypothesis that CAD impaired Mr Byrne s ability to survive once in the water could not stand  In context  it cannot be said that the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its satisfaction  beyond reasonable doubt  that the cause of death was drowning  to which CAD made no contribution citedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   Mrs Byrne relevantly posited to the Tribunal that her husband s ability to survive in the waters of
