 In determining what s  H a  of the Federal Court Act requires  it is important to consider why it is necessary to describe or identify the group members in a representative proceeding  One reason  as

by a group member to opt out of representative proceedings may therefore be attended by serious consequences  although of course the litigation might also produce advantages for that group member

omitted      Although a reference to the authorities makes it tolerably plain that the court will exercise its undoubted jurisdiction to set aside a subpoena in a variety of cases  as  for example     unless the subpoena was issued for the purpose of a pending trial  hearing or application         where to require the attendance of a witness would be oppressive         where the subpoena had not

This summary was accepted by Beaumont J in Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Limited  No       ALR   at   and by Conti J in Mandic v Phillis   FCA   at       ALR   at   to    The stage which a proceeding has reached  and the issues to be resolved at interlocutory applications  are matters of immediate relevance to whether an order should be made for a subpoena or for a subpoena to be set aside  Re Universal Press Pty Limited v Provest Ltd  unreported  FCA  Hill J  G  of     July    Hill J there observed        With respect  the interests of justice and efficiency  will in most cases be best served if subpoenas are issued requiring documents to be produced at a time before the hearing but it does not follow from that that it will ordinarily be appropriate in the interest of justice for a subpoena to be made returnable before discovery itself has been given by the parties to each other or indeed before  as in this case  the defendant has even filed a statement of defence in the proceedings  Rather it seems to me  so that the issues are defined  that it will be a rare case indeed where the interests of justice will require a subpoena to be issued until the ordinary interlocutory steps have been completed            It must ultimately be borne in mind that a subpoena is intended to require the production of documents so that those documents can be available for tender during a trial and for the purposes of it  I use trial as encompassing of course interlocutory motions should such motions be relevant  In this context I would refer to what was said by Bowen LJ in Elder v  Carter     QBD    at p                  But I am as certain as one can be of anything with regard to practice  that does not intend to enact that at any stage of a proceeding a judge may make  subject to his discretion  an order on a third person for production of a document which belongs to the third person  unless the production of it at that moment is a thing to which the parties are entitled for the purpose of justice  and you are not entitled  for the purpose of justice at any moment during suit  simply because you are a litigant  to see what is in the possession of a third person and to have production of it  Such a thing was never heard of               See also  Botany Bay Instrumentation   Control Pty Ltd v Stewart     NSWLR at   per Powell J citedBright v Femcare Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlParticular reliance is placed by Counsel on behalf of Pharm a Care and IMF  Australia  Limited upon the need for compliance with s  H to be apparent   from the pleadings    See also  Bright v Femcare Ltd   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       ALR   at   per Kiefel J  with whom Lindgren and Finkelstein JJ agreed  These provisions  together with the other provisions contained within Pt IVA  may have to be considered in greater detail when the Motions are heard seeking either judgment pursuant to s  A or relief under O   rr   and   or O   r    The subpoena in issue refers to    e ach litigation funding agreement entered into by IMF  Australia  Limited as at   December   referred to in paragraph  c  of the application filed on   December         referred toFried v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt should be noted that considerable care should be exercised in placing reliance upon judicial interpretation of any provision without regard to the terms in which a particular statutory or regulatory provision was then expressed  One decision thus relied upon was Fried v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCA       ALR    At the time of that decision the power to set aside a subpoena was that conferred by O   r   which then provided that    t he Court may  of its own motion or on the motion of any person having a sufficient interest  set aside the subpoena wholly or in part    That decision may remain of assistance only in interpreting the expression   any person having a sufficient interest   as it appears in the current r   it has nothing to say about the phrase   a party    Moreover  and since the relief claimed by Pharm a Care and IMF  Australia  Limited is identical  and since both corporations were represented by the same Counsel  it appeared to matter little which was the entity that sought the relief  Such differences as may emerge in different proceedings where a subpoena is served upon a third party having no interest in a proceeding may in the present proceeding assume less relevance given the role played by funding agreements with IMF  Australia  Limited and the description of Group Members   Different solicitors  however  separately represented each of the applicants on the motions  There may have been some significance if an issue of costs needed resolution  The Second to Sixth Respondents did not dispute that IMF  Australia  Limited had a   sufficient interest   to apply to have the subpoena set aside  Rejected  however  is any contention that Pharm a Care does not have standing to seek to have the subpoena served upon IMF set aside citedHughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc     ALR  More importantly  however  it is not considered that there is any legitimate forensic purpose now being pursued by the Second to Sixth Respondents in seeking the production of the documents embraced by the subpoena at this point of time  In so concluding  it is recognised that a subpoena can be made returnable at a date prior to hearing  Indeed  there may well be many practical reasons why such a course may be desirable  Southern Pacific Hotel Services Inc v Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation Ltd     NSWLR   at   to   per Clarke J  So much was not put in issue by Counsel on behalf of Pharm a Care and IMF  A subpoena may be made returnable at a date prior to hearing where it is   in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding   to do so  Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc     ALR   at   per Toohey J  The time at which a subpoena is sought or served may  however  be of relevance to an order setting it aside  cf Kennedy v Wallace   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   per Gyles J citedImobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd  in liq    FCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAnd it matters not whether the forensic purpose of the Second to Sixth Respondents is tested by reference to their outstanding Motions to strike out the existing pleadings or by reference to their application for summary judgment pursuant to s  A of the   Act  Evidence as to facts is relevant to an application made under s  A  Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd   FCA   at   to     FCA         ALR   at   to   per Finkelstein J  But it was accepted by Senior Counsel on behalf of the Second to Sixth Respondents that those submissions of relevance to the identification of the present forensic purpose being pursued were its submissions that judgment should be entered pursuant to s  A  in summary form  by reason of  the alleged failure to properly identify those persons to whom a public duty was said to be owed for the purposes of the tort of misfeasance  the failure to properly plead the manner in which any breach of duty was said to have caused loss or damage  and the failure to properly plead the loss or damage said to have been suffered   These were all correctly characterised by Counsel for Pharm a Care and IMF as   pleading points    Such facts as may have been exposed by documents otherwise falling within the subpoena could thus not assist the Second to Sixth Respondents in its forthcoming application for judgment pursuant to s  A  Nor is the identification of the forensic purpose sought to be pursued by the Second to Sixth Respondents in seeking the production of documents from IMF  Australia  Limited assisted by submissions as to whether or not Pharm a Care has complied with the obligation imposed upon it by O   r   citedIO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe stage at which a subpoena is issued will necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case  Such relevance as the subpoena was seen as potentially having at the time the order was made for its issue has been answered by  the identification or clarification of the forensic purpose being pursued by the Second to Sixth Respondents  and the submissions now advanced by Counsel on behalf of both Pharm a Care and IMF  Australia  Limited   Rejected is the submission advanced on behalf of the Second to Sixth Respondents that the documents have some present relevance   be it described as   adjectival   or otherwise   Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd     ALR at   IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA   at      This conclusion in respect to the present subpoena does not preclude an application being made for an order under O   r   for a subpoena in the same or like terms at some future date  The Orders of the Court are  The subpoena as issued at the request of the

representative proceeding to  describe or otherwise identify the group members who will be affected by it and provides that the judgment binds any such persons other than any person who has opted out   The failure by a group member to opt out of representative proceedings may therefore be attended by serious consequences  although of course the litigation might also produce advantages for that group member            These factors suggest that it must be possible for persons who may be within the represented group to ascertain from the pleadings whether they are in fact group members  The point was made by Hedigan J in Cook v Pasminco Ltd   VSC     at   in relation to similar State legislation             It is beyond doubt that in a group proceeding the description of a group membership must be such so that it is at least possible to determine who falls within the group as described  Persons contemplated as being within the group would themselves not understand whether they were within it  unless the definition of the group is intelligible  although not necessarily exact  Members of the group are entitled to know what constitutes the essentials of the group  A decision concerning opt out cannot be sensibly made unless it is known what it is that is being opted out from             It follows from his Honour s observations that a person must be able to ascertain from the description of the represented group whether he or she is a member of that group                 Clearly enough  not every description or identification of the represented group will satisfy the requirements of s  H a  of the Federal Court Act   A useful  although not necessarily exhaustive test  is whether the description is such as to enable a person  with the assistance of a legal adviser if necessary  to ascertain whether he or she is a group member  If the description incorporates a reference to conduct alleged in the pleadings  a person or his or her adviser ought to be able  by reading the description and the relevant portion of the pleadings  to determine whether he or she is a member of the represented group  If a person cannot reasonably be expected to do this  the definition is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of s  H a        In Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG   FCA   at   Tracey J referred to   the need for precision in the framing of group

pursued by the Second to Sixth Respondents in seeking the production of the documents embraced by the subpoena at this point of time  In so concluding  it is recognised that a subpoena can be made returnable at a date prior to hearing  Indeed  there may well be many practical reasons why such a course may be desirable  Southern Pacific Hotel Services Inc v Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation Ltd     NSWLR   at   to   per Clarke J  So much was not put in issue by Counsel on behalf of Pharm a Care and IMF  A subpoena may be made returnable at a date prior to hearing where it is   in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding   to do so  Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc     ALR   at   per Toohey J  The time at which a subpoena is sought or served may  however  be of relevance to an order setting it aside  cf Kennedy v Wallace   FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   per Gyles J followedTrade Practices Commission v Arnotts Limited  No       ALR  The various grounds upon which an application may be made to have a subpoena set aside need not be presently canvassed in any great detail  Some of these grounds have been usefully collated by Powell J in Botany Bay Instrumentation   Control Pty Ltd v Stewart     NSWLR   at   as follows  citations omitted      Although a reference to the authorities makes it tolerably plain that the court will exercise its undoubted jurisdiction to set aside a subpoena in a variety of cases  as  for example     unless the subpoena was issued for the purpose of a pending trial  hearing or application         where to require the attendance of a witness would be oppressive         where the subpoena had not been issued bona fide for the purpose of obtaining relevant evidence and the witness to whom the subpoena had been addressed was unable to give relevant evidence          where the subpoena has been used for the purpose of obtaining discovery or further discovery against a party         where the subpoena has been used for the purpose of obtaining discovery against a third party        where to require a party to comply with a subpoena to produce documents would be oppressive         where the subpoena has been issued for a purpose which is impermissible  as  for example   fishing           This summary was accepted by Beaumont J in Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Limited  No       ALR   at   and by Conti J in Mandic v Phillis   FCA   at       ALR   at   to   consideredRe Universal Press Pty Limited v Provest Ltd  unreported  FCA  Hill J  G  of     July  The stage which a proceeding has reached  and the issues to be resolved at interlocutory applications  are matters of immediate relevance to whether an order should be made for a subpoena or for a subpoena to be set aside  Re Universal Press Pty Limited v Provest Ltd  unreported  FCA  Hill J  G  of     July    Hill J there observed        With respect  the interests of justice and efficiency  will in most cases be best served if subpoenas are issued requiring documents to be produced at a time before the hearing but it does not follow from that that it will ordinarily be appropriate in the interest of justice for a subpoena to be made returnable before discovery itself has been given by the parties to each other or indeed before  as in this case  the defendant has even filed a statement of defence in the proceedings  Rather it seems to me  so that the issues are defined  that it will be a rare case indeed where the interests of justice will require a subpoena to be issued until the ordinary interlocutory steps have been completed            It must ultimately be borne in mind that a subpoena is intended to require the production of documents so that those documents can be available for tender during a trial and for the purposes of it  I use trial as encompassing of course interlocutory motions should such motions be relevant  In this context I would refer to what was said by Bowen LJ in Elder v  Carter     QBD    at p                  But I am as certain as one can be of anything with regard to practice  that does not intend to enact that at any stage of a proceeding a judge may make  subject to his discretion  an order on a third person for production of a document which belongs to the third person  unless the production of it at that moment is a thing to which the parties are entitled for the purpose of justice  and you are not entitled  for the purpose of justice at any moment during suit  simply because you are a litigant  to see what is in the possession of a third person and to have production of it  Such a thing was never heard of               See also  Botany Bay Instrumentation   Control Pty Ltd v Stewart     NSWLR at   per Powell J
