State of New South Wales v Quin   HCA         CLR    Brennan J there observed at     The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository s power  If  in so doing  the court avoids administrative injustice or error  so be it  but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error  The merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant

terms of the extent of power and the legality of its exercise  In Australia  the modern development and expansion of the law of judicial review of administrative action have been achieved by an increasingly sophisticated exposition of implied limitations on the extent or the exercise of statutory power  but those limitations are not calculated to secure judicial scrutiny of the merits of a

such is not the present case  The materials now before the Court have been reviewed and provide no discernible basis upon which any suggestion as to bias on the part of the Tribunal could be sustained  The reasons for decision expose a careful account of the evidence being presented and a careful attempt to ensure that such inconsistencies as were apparent in the now Appellant s evidence were brought to his attention  Two hearings were afforded to the now Appellant  Moreover  it is seldom the case that a reasonable apprehension of bias can be established merely by reference to the reasons for decision  SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Tamberlin  Mansfield and Jacobson JJ   In the present appeal it would not be in the interests

www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  On   August   the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking to review the decision of the Tribunal  SZLVI v Minister for Immigration   FMCA    The Appellant now appeals to this Court   The Appellant appeared before this Court unrepresented  although he did have the benefit of an interpreter  He first appeared on   November    But on that occasion it emerged    perhaps surprisingly    that he had not read either the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court or his Notice of Appeal   The Notice of Appeal was apparently prepared by a migration agent  Serious questions necessarily arise in circumstances where a migration agent has    at least on the account given by the present Appellant    neither informed him as to why he lost before the Federal Magistrates Court  nor the grounds upon which the decision of the Federal Magistrate may be challenged on appeal  How an appellant can make an informed decision and give instructions as to whether or not he wishes to appeal in the absence of at least minimal explanation being provided to him  remained unexplained  A decision to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court cannot be entrusted to migration agents alone and without instructions  The difficulties confronting unrepresented litigants who do not speak English are not to be compounded by a failure to keep them informed or explain to them the steps being taken in their own applications for a Protection Visa  Such fundamental difficulties are noted so that the Respondent Minister or his Department may take such steps as they consider appropriate   For the purposes of the present appeal  the difficulties initially confronting the Appellant were addressed by adjourning the appeal until   November   in order to ensure that the Federal Magistrate s decision and the Notice of Appeal could be translated  On   November   the Appellant again appeared with an interpreter and made oral submissions   The final Ground of Appeal must also be rejected  The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate discloses that he reviewed the reasons for decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the procedure it had followed  He referred to the inconsistencies as found by the Tribunal in the now Appellant s account and considered the terms of the letter written to the now Appellant explaining what were perceived to be inconsistencies and the significance that the Tribunal may have attached to those inconsistencies  Indeed  the Federal Magistrate stated in conclusion that he considered there was   an obligation on the Court to independently consider whether argument based on material before the Court leads to a jurisdictional error     FMCA   at     That question was answered in the negative   No reason emerges from the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate to conclude that he did not   reasonably   consider the application before him   No reference may be found expressly in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate which refers to the risk to which the now Appellant would be exposed if he were to be returned to China  In the absence of any submissions being advanced in respect to that risk  and there apparently were none  the failure to address a submission or an aspect of the evidence does not expose error  Moreover  the Federal Magistrate referred to the findings of the Tribunal as to credibility  That was a sufficient basis in itself for a rejection of the application by the Federal Magistrates Court  The reference to   they   in the final Ground of Appeal is unclear  If it is a reference to the Tribunal  the Tribunal did in fact refer to the risk asserted by the now Appellant if he was to return to China  if it is a reference to the Federal Magistrates Court  the failure to refer to the risk exposes no appellable error appliedSZLVN v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html

Indigenous Affairs   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Although instances in which a bias allegation has succeeded as against the Tribunal fortunately may be rare  instances do occur where a reasonable apprehension of bias is made out  eg  VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA       FCR    Kenny J there relevantly concluded        The vice in this case was that  by the Member s conduct during the hearing  a fair minded observer might well infer that there was nothing the applicant could give by way of evidence or submit by way of argument that might change her mind about his claim    that he had fabricated his account  Virtually from the beginning of the hearing until its end  the Member expressed her disbelief in his truthfulness  Whether expressly  by implication  or by her tone of voice  she made it clear that she did not believe him and the account he gave  As well as repeated expressions of disbelief  there were her constant adverse comments on his evidence  and numerous displays of irritation  impatience  frustration and  sometimes  sarcasm  The applicant was regularly interrupted  Much of the Member s questioning of the applicant appeared calculated to undermine his case  rather than to facilitate a non partisan investigation into the facts
