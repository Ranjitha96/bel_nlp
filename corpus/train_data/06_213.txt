Macchia v Nilant  Trustee    FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRe  Mario Silverio Macchia Ex parte  Mario Silverio Macchia v Charles Philippe Louis Nilant as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Mario Silverio Macchia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant s application was heard on   April   and was opposed by the respondent  On   April   Lee J delivered his judgment   Re  Mario Silverio Macchia Ex parte  Mario Silverio Macchia v Charles Philippe Louis Nilant as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Mario Silverio Macchia   FCA   and ordered that        the period of bankruptcy limited by s  of the Act be abridged from   years to   year and   month from the date of filing of the statement of affairs  As a result   the applicant  will be discharged from bankruptcy as at   February     Lee J accepted that the date on which the statement of affairs had been filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy was   January     The applicant was legally represented before Lee J  The case advanced by the applicant was that the applicant had provided to the trustee a statement of his affairs in July   as part of the proposed Pt X composition  and in September   as part of the debtor s petition  and that the respondent was therefore not prejudiced by the applicant s failure to provide a statement of affairs earlier than  on the applicant s version    April   or on the respondent s version  shortly before   January    The applicant submitted that as the respondent had access to the July   and September   statements of affairs  he had sufficient information about the applicant s affairs to conduct the bankruptcy  No case was advanced on behalf of the applicant that the applicant had provided the trustee with a statement of affairs on   October     In his reasons  after reviewing the evidence  Lee J said at        On   October   the Trustee advised Mr Macchia that he had not received a copy of Mr Macchia s statement of affairs as required by s   of the Act and informed Mr Macchia that pursuant to s   of the Act discharge from bankruptcy would not occur until   years from the filing of the statement of affairs      On   October   Mr Macchia replied to the Trustee that he had provided a statement of affairs on   July   and again on   September   and asked that the Trustee obtain a copy of the statements from the Registrar as soon as possible      In a letter to the Trustee dated   October   Mr Macchia again referred to his debtor s petition and the statement of affairs and that he had  lodged  with that petition        By letter dated   October   the Trustee informed Mr Macchia that he had been made bankrupt on a creditor s petition   and not on the debtor s petition with which the statement of affairs had been supplied  The Trustee asked Mr Macchia to file a statement of affairs      On   December   the Trustee applied to the Court for an order that Mr Macchia be committed for contempt pursuant to sub s   of the Act for failure to file a statement of affairs as required by paragraph  a   Before the application came on for hearing Mr Macchia filed a statement of affairs on   January    Pursuant to s  of the Act discharge from bankruptcy will occur on   January   if the period of bankruptcy were not extended by an objection lodged by the Trustee   At     of his reasons  Lee J said     In the present case the bankrupt has been the author of his own misfortune in that he continued to maintain  in the face of the Trustee s advice that he was obliged to file a further statement of affairs  that he had complied with the requirements of the Act when he presented his own petition and by declining to comply with the Trustee s request that he do so   Apart from the statement of affairs  which was filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy on   January   Lee J referred in his judgment only to two statements of affairs  made by the applicant  namely  the statement of affairs of   July    provided as part of the attempts to reach a composition under Pt X    and the statement of affairs of   September    provided with the debtor s petition   His Honour made the orders abridging the time relying upon the provisions of s  c  of the Act and the case of Re  Rohde     FCR    Rohde     Before Lee J the applicant argued that there had in fact been compliance with s   of the Act in that the statement of affairs had been filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy as part of the debtor s petition on   September   being a date within   days of the sequestration order  albeit before the date of the sequestration order  Lee J rejected that argument  holding that on a proper construction  s   of the Act required that the statement of affairs be filed within   days after the date of the making of the sequestration order  and not   days before the making of that order   The respondent appealed the decision of Lee J and the appeal was upheld by the Full Court  The decision of the Full Court is reported as Nilant v Macchia     FCR    The Full Court overruled the decision of Rohde and held that the Court does not have power pursuant to s  c  of the Act to abridge the time limited by s   of the Act   It is plain from the judgment that the reference to  one or other of the statement of affairs  is a reference to the two statements of affairs which had been referred to by Lee J in his judgment  namely  the statement of affairs which was prepared and filed as part of the Pt X proceedings and the second statement of affairs which accompanied the debtor s petition presented to the Registrar in Bankruptcy by the applicant   There is no reference in either of the decisions of Lee J or the Full Court referred to above  to any claim or argument being advanced by the applicant on the basis that he made and supplied the respondent with a statement of affairs on   October     After the Full Court decision in   the applicant in March   applied for and was given leave to file a further amended application  The application was heard on   October    At that time  there were in existence further objections by the respondent to the discharge of the applicant from bankruptcy  The hearing was adjourned part heard  However  on   December   and before the hearing of the application was resumed the respondent withdrew his objections to the applicant s discharge from bankruptcy  The withdrawal of the objections meant that the applicant was discharged from bankruptcy pursuant to s   of the Act with effect from   January     that being three years from the filing of the statement of affairs with the Registrar in Bankruptcy  However  as at   December   the applicant had been treated as an undischarged bankrupt for almost three years beyond the date on which the bankruptcy terminated under the Act   Thus  by the time the application came on for the resumed hearing before Lee J on   February   the applicant had been discharged from his bankruptcy  At the resumed hearing the applicant further amended the application  In that amended application  the applicant relied upon s  b  and s   of the Act to seek a declaration that a  proceeding  under the Act had not been invalidated by a formal defect or irregularity  The  proceeding  which the applicant sought to be validated was the statement of affairs prepared in relation to the Pt X proceedings  or alternatively the statement of affairs dated   September   accompanying the debtor s petition  The declaration he sought was that either of those statements of affairs be deemed to have been filed in the office of the Registrar in Bankruptcy on   September   citedRe  Rohde     FCR   Apart from the statement of affairs  which was filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy on   January   Lee J referred in his judgment only to two statements of affairs  made by the applicant  namely  the statement of affairs of   July    provided as part of the attempts to reach a composition under Pt X    and the statement of affairs of   September    provided with the debtor s petition   His Honour made the orders abridging the time relying upon the provisions of s  c  of the Act and the case of Re  Rohde     FCR    Rohde     The respondent appealed the decision of Lee J and the appeal was upheld by the Full Court  The decision of the Full Court is reported as Nilant v Macchia     FCR    The Full Court overruled the decision of Rohde and held that the Court does not have power pursuant to s  c  of the Act to abridge the time limited by s   of the Act citedNilant v Macchia     FCR   The respondent appealed the decision of Lee J and the appeal was upheld by the Full Court  The decision of the Full Court is reported as Nilant v Macchia     FCR    The Full Court overruled the decision of Rohde and held that the Court does not have power pursuant to s  c  of the Act to abridge the time limited by s   of the Act citedMacchia v Nilant   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   March   Lee J  granting relief under s   of the Act  ordered that the statement of affairs signed by the applicant on   September   and presented to the Registrar in Bankruptcy on that date be deemed to have been made out and filed in the office of the Registrar in Bankruptcy  and a copy furnished to the trustee of the sequestrated estate of the applicant  on   September   in compliance with the requirements of s   of the Act   Macchia v Nilant   FCA   citedNilant v Macchia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The respondent appealed that decision and the Full Court upheld the appeal finding that s   of the Act does not confer a power to treat a failure to comply with s   of the Act as compliance with it  The case is reported as Nilant v Macchia   FCA         FCR     The Full Court held that relief under s   of the Act was not available because the bankrupt had not made any attempt to comply with s   of the Act which required a filing of a statement of affairs after the date of sequestration   Weinberg J said at   at      In the present case  the plain fact is that the appellant did not file a statement of affairs in accordance with the requirements of s   of the Act  but assumed erroneously that a statement of affairs previously filed with the Registrar on a debtor s petition would serve that purpose  There was no act on the part of the appellant which could be described as even purported compliance with the requirements of the section  His failure to comply with the requirements of s   does not give rise to a  proceeding under this Act  which would be invalidated but for the fact that any defect or irregularity is merely formal  In these circumstances  there is no proceeding capable of being brought before the Court on an objection concerning that invalidity    original emphasis  At   at   and   Weinberg J said     Where there has been an attempt to comply with the obligations of s     whether within the fourteen day period specified  or on some other occasion thereafter  it is entirely apt to speak of that attempt being a  proceeding under this Act  and being capable of being regarded by the Court as  not invalidated  by reason of any formal defect or error  Section   in such a case is to permit the period of bankruptcy to run from the date of purported compliance with the Act  or perhaps some later date  It follows that the bankruptcy will not continue for an unconscionably long period merely because of some relatively minor failure on the part of the bankrupt to comply with the strict requirements of s        Regrettably  it seems to me that s   cannot be invoked in the circumstances of the present case  where no step whatever has been taken by the bankrupt in purported compliance with the requirements of s    There is simply no  proceeding  or  step  taken in the course of the bankruptcy which is capable of being the subject of an order that it not be invalidated   Carr J at   at   said       In the present matter  where there has been no attempt to comply with s   until  at the earliest    April   there was no proceeding which by the operation of s   could escape invalidity due to formal defect or irregularity   There was no case made by the applicant at the hearing of the second application before Lee J in   nor at the hearing before the Full Court in   that the applicant had made a statement of affairs dated   October   and delivered it to the respondent  Indeed  the finding by the Full Court that the applicant made no attempt to make a statement of affairs until   April   at the earliest  is at the heart of the Full Court s decision  It was a crucial finding on which the whole decision rested   In addition to the legal proceedings referred to above  the applicant also took proceedings against the respondent for compensation in respect of the manner in which the respondent had carried out his duties as trustee of the applicant s bankrupt estate  These proceedings included an action against the respondent in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for the negligent conduct of the applicant s bankruptcy administration   On   May   the applicant and the respondent entered into a deed of release in respect of mutual claims made by each of the parties against each other in the various proceedings then pending  Pursuant to the deed of release the respondent agreed to pay the applicant a settlement sum  Clause   of the deed of release is particularly relevant to these proceedings  Clause   provides as follows         BAR TO PROCEEDINGS           Party not to take action         Subject to clause     a Party must not at any time take or continue any action  suit or proceeding  or make any claim or demand of any nature against the other Party relating to  or arising out of  or connection with  the Dispute or Macchia s bankruptcy except that the terms of this Document do not affect  limit or restrict           a  any issue between the Parties in relation to the estate of Macchia s mother           b  the existing rights of any party to receive a distribution or benefit from that estate  or          c  any right of Nilant or Macchia s creditors in relation to any property or income of Macchia which Macchia failed to disclose to Nilant and which would have been vested in Nilant as his trustee in bankruptcy or been available to his creditors   The respondent sought the summary dismissal or a permanent stay of the claims made in the substantive application by relying on the inherent power of the Court to prevent an abuse of process  alternatively upon O   r   of the Rules  The gravamen of the respondent s argument is that by his current application the applicant is attempting to relitigate a matter which has already been litigated appliedPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondent submitted further that the applicant is precluded from bringing the claims made in the application by reason of the principles enunciated in the case of Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Anshun    The respondent submitted that the claims now made properly belonged to the earlier proceedings  This is because the claims are based on a factual allegation  namely  that the applicant made and provided to the respondent a statement of affairs on   October   which was of crucial significance to the issues in contention in the previous litigation  and that it was open to the applicant to have advanced such a claim because there was evidence available to be presented  It was further submitted that the legal representatives of the applicant elected not to advance any case founded on the existence of a statement of affairs allegedly made on   October   in any of the previous proceedings  It was  therefore  unreasonable for the applicant not to have made the factual allegation now made in this application  as part of any one or more of the previous proceedings   The respondent also submitted that the claims made in the substantive application rendered the application an abuse of process   Further  the respondent submitted that the applicant s claim made by reference to s  A of the Act in par   of the substantive application  was  in any event  misconceived  It was submitted that although s  A of the Act was enacted after the conclusion of the proceedings in   the section did not assist the applicant  This was because s  A  of the Act contains a restriction which precludes the Court from making an order which would result in the discharge of the bankruptcy occurring at a date earlier than   days after the making of the Court order  It was not possible  therefore  for the applicant to obtain an order which would treat the alleged   October   statement of affairs as having been filed in October   because this would have the effect of backdating the discharge to a date in October    Relief under s  A of the Act was  therefore  only open to a bankrupt who had not yet been discharged from bankruptcy   As to the respondent s arguments that these proceedings are res judicata  the claims made in these proceedings are founded upon a different allegation of fact which formed the basis for the claims which were considered by Lee J and the Full Court in   and    For this reason  I would also not summarily dismiss the application on the basis that the matter is res judicata   Anshun at    No argument was addressed to me that there was an issue estoppel in relation to the date of the first attempt made to comply with s   of the Act after the date of sequestration   The Anshun estoppel principles have recently been considered by the Full Court of this Court in the case of Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    Wong    The Full Court said that the doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel are founded on the broad rules of public policy that a person ought not to be vexed twice for one and the same cause and that it was in the public interest that there be an end to litigation  At     at     the Full Court went on to say        It would be an abuse of process to allow parties to litigate repeatedly matters that have been finally determined by the Court  Also  quite apart from any psychological detriment that might flow from an individual having to undertake litigation of the same issue a second time  the State has an interest in ensuring that  once an issue has been determined according to law and all rights of appeal have been exhausted  that should be an end of the matter  The resources of the community ought not to be expended in the litigation  more than once  of the same issue      A plea in bar may be raised in respect of an issue  not only if the Court in the earlier proceeding was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment  but also in relation to every issue that properly belonged to the subject of the earlier litigation and which the parties  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier litigation  Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and    Anshun estoppel arises where the issue  now raised for the first time  properly belonged to the subject of the earlier proceeding but  by negligence  omission or accident  was not raised in earlier proceeding  In essence  where the issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time  it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceedings between the parties  Anshun at    distinguishedDumitrasku v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  In relation to his claim at par   in the application  the applicant relied upon the case of Dumitrasku v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FMCA    Dumitrasku  in support of his submission that the Court has power to make an order under s  A of the Act which would have the effect of backdating the date of his discharge to a date in October    The applicant also relied on the authority of Baral v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA    Baral  in support of that proposition   I accept the submission by the counsel for the respondent that the Dumitrasku case does not assist the applicant  In that case  the applicant was still a bankrupt at the time that he brought the application  The applicant s primary ground of relief was founded on s   of the Act  The applicant sought declarations that a statement of affairs had been filed with the Official Receiver in compliance with s   of the Act on   October   and that by the operation of s   of the Act he was discharged from bankruptcy on   October    The Federal Magistrate granted the relief claimed pursuant to s   of the Act   The Federal Magistrate also dealt obiter with the claim which the applicant had made in reliance on s  A of the Act  He said that he would have been prepared to grant relief under that section had he been required to do so  However  what is significant in that case was that the applicant was still bankrupt at the time of the making and hearing of the application  Here the applicant had been discharged from bankruptcy for more than eight years when the application was made  It is plain from the terms of s  A  of the Act that relief under s  A of the Act would not be available to a person who has already been discharged from bankruptcy at the time of making an application for that relief  Accordingly  the case of Dumitrasku relied on by the applicant has no application to this issue  Further  the Baral case relied upon by the applicant deals with annulment of bankruptcy and has no application to the construction of s  A of the Act distinguishedBaral v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In relation to his claim at par   in the application  the applicant relied upon the case of Dumitrasku v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FMCA    Dumitrasku  in support of his submission that the Court has power to make an order under s  A of the Act which would have the effect of backdating the date of his discharge to a date in October    The applicant also relied on the authority of Baral v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA    Baral  in support of that

  HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is well established that the Court s power to grant summary relief should be exercised with great caution  In Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR   at   Dixon J observed        A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination     I would not dismiss the applicant s application on the grounds that the claims made in the current application are within the ambit of cl   of the deed of release  It is arguable that on a proper construction of that clause  the applicant s substantive application relates to the applicant s right to receive a distribution or benefit from his mother s estate  and that the application is  therefore  not covered by the bar in the deed of release appliedWong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au

and may involve a range of factors that bear upon the general discretion of the Court where justice requires the non application of the general principle   Wong at     I do not accept the applicant s argument that the Anshun estoppel principles do not apply because the claims made in his current application would not conflict with any existing judgment as both of the decisions of Lee J in his favour were overturned on appeal  In my view  it is irrelevant to the operation of Anshun estoppel principles that the two first instance decisions were overturned on appeal  It does not follow that there are now no judgments with which the claims would conflict  Both of the Full Court decisions  and indeed  the decisions of Lee J  are based on findings of fact that during the period from the date of the sequestration order to   April   at the earliest  there was no attempt made by the applicant to file a statement of affairs  As previously mentioned  this finding is central to the Full Court s decision in    The claims made by the applicant in the application are directed at asking the Court to make factual findings which are directly contrary to the factual findings made in the previous proceedings  and to grant relief  previously denied  on the basis of that conflicting finding in the fact   In my view  this is a circumstance where the Anshun estoppel principles are capable of applying appliedSpalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the case of Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA   French J at   at   said     The doctrines of res judicata   issue estoppel and Anshun do not exhaust the circumstances in which a proceeding may be regarded as amounting to an abuse of process by way of attempted litigation of a dispute already judicially determined  As another Full Court said in Coffee v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         FCR    at          An attempt to litigate in the Court a dispute or issue which has been resolved in earlier litigation in another court or tribunal may constitute an abuse of process even though the earlier proceeding does not give rise to res judicata or issue estoppel  see Culture International v Scoles     FCR   at   and Walton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   at      Whether it does depends on the facts of the particular case     French J went on to say at   at      The public interest considerations underlying the power of courts to stay or dismiss the proceedings for abuse of process extend to preventing the waste judicial resources and their use for purposes unrelated to the determination of genuine disputes  They include the necessity of maintaining confidence in  and respect for  the authority of the courts Sea Culture International v Scoles     FCR    at   French J  Djaigween v Douglas     FCR    at   Carr J       The power to strike out a statement of claim or to dismiss an application as an abuse of process is to be exercised sparingly and upon an examination of the relevant circumstances of the particular case before the Court    appliedState Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Stenhouse Ltd   Aust Torts Reports     French J approved the following observations of Giles CJ in the case of State Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Stenhouse Ltd   Aust Torts Reports     at         whether proceedings are  or an aspect of proceedings is  an abuse of process because a party seeks to relitigate  an  issue already decided depends very much on the particular circumstances  The guiding considerations are oppression and unfairness to the other party to the litigation and concern for the integrity of the system of administration of justice     French J also adopted as matters relevant to the determination of whether there was an abuse  a non exhaustive list set out by Giles CJ in that case  These factors were     a  the importance of the issue in and to the earlier proceedings  including whether it is an evidentiary issue or an ultimate issue           b  the opportunity available and taken to full litigate the issue       c  the terms and finality of the finding as to the issue           d  the identity between the relevant issues in the two proceedings       e  any plea of fresh evidence  from and including the nature and significance of the evidence and the reason why it was not part of the earlier proceedings  all part of        f  the extent of the oppression and unfairness to the other party if the issue is relitigated and the impact of the relitigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice  and      g  an overall balancing of justice to the alleged abuser against the matters supportive of abuse of process    I would  on the application of these factors  have found that the applicant s substantive application was an abuse of process   Firstly  the factual issue as to the time at which the applicant first made a statement of his affairs for the purposes of the Act was of crucial importance in the earlier proceedings  Secondly  there was every opportunity available to the applicant to have advanced in the earlier proceedings a claim based on the factual assertion now made in the application  Thirdly  there are factual findings made in the earlier proceedings which are contrary to the factual position now being asserted in this application  As previously mentioned  the finding that no statement of affairs was made prior to   April   at the earliest  was crucial to the Full Court s decision in    Fourthly  the nature and the object of the relief claimed in the application  is substantially the same as in the earlier proceedings  Each of the earlier proceedings was concerned with the question of if  and when  the applicant had filed a statement of affairs under the Act  Fifthly  there is no plea by the applicant of fresh evidence  nor could there be such a plea  There was evidence available to the applicant and his legal advisers at the time of the hearing of the first application in   before Lee J upon which the claims now made could have been advanced in the earlier proceedings  Sixthly  if the Court were now to make factual findings along the lines claimed in the current proceedings  the factual findings on which the courts acted and upon which decisions were made in the earlier proceedings would be undermined  This would have a tendency to adversely impact upon the finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice  Further  the respondent has already been involved in four previous proceedings relating to the issue of the filing of the statement of affairs  and five years have elapsed since the Full Court decision in   citedWebster v Lampard   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I turn now to the respondent s argument that the applicant s claim in par   is  in any event  misconceived  It is also not necessary to decide this issue  but as the matter was argued and I will briefly set out the view to which I would have come  It is a well established principle that a court should not summarily dismiss an application on the basis that there is no reasonable cause of action unless it is clear that the case is bound to fail   Webster v Lampard   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  the applicant s claim is bound to fail
