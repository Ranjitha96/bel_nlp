Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd  No     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A different approach was that of Emmett J in Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd   FCA    His Honour there set forth as follows his understanding as to the effect of s  A    Another question concerning the effect of s A  is whether the provision does no more than require a corporation to go into evidence  That is to say  it does not ultimately reverse the onus but simply provides that the deeming takes effect unless the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary  Once such evidence is adduced  it is for the Court to make a judgment  on the balance of probabilities  having regard to all the evidence  as to whether the corporation had reasonable grounds for making the representation  If an applicant elects to adduce no evidence as to that question  then the only evidence before the Court would be that adduced by the corporation  Whether that is adequate to establish that the corporation had reasonable grounds for making the representations is a matter for the Court  However  once the corporation has adduced some evidence  there is no deeming arising from s A    More recently  in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR   the Full Court revisited the construction of s  A   Emmett J  one of the members of the Full Court  there observed    Under s  A  of the Trade Practices Act   a representation is to be taken to be misleading if it is a representation with respect to any future matter and the maker of the representation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation  Under s  A    the maker of the representation with respect to any future matter is to be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation unless it adduces evidence to the contrary  However  if evidence is adduced by a representor to the effect that the representor had reasonable grounds for making the representation  the deeming provision will not operate  Where the representor adduces such evidence  it is then a matter for the Court to determine  on the balance of probabilities in the ordinary way  whether or not the representor had reasonable grounds for making the representation   This is understood to be the same approach that His Honour had previously expressed  In McGrath Allsop J also referred to the views previously expressed by Emmett J in Universal Sports and continued    If evidence is adduced by the representor that is said to be evidence to the contrary  it will be for the Court to determine whether it is to the contrary in the sense just discussed  If it is  the deeming provision will cease to operate  That was the view of Emmett J  as understood by Keane JA  Downey v Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific Pty Ltd   QCA    That is my view  That was not  however  an expression of the view that the legal or persuasive onus has been changed by s  A    as some of the judgments in the  trend of established authority  referred to by Keane JA have stated  For instance  if evidence  to the contrary  is adduced by the representor  and if the representee itself adduces evidence tending to the lack of reasonable grounds  the matter might be equally poised  In such a case  there has been evidence  to the contrary  adduced by the representee  thereby eliminating the operation of the deeming provision  and  on the totality of the evidence  the proof of the reasonableness  or lack thereof  of the grounds is evenly balanced  Section  A  does not  in my view  mean that in those circumstances the representor has not met an onus  The section does not cast the legal or persuasive onus  in such a case  on the representor  Its terms do not say so  The enactment history makes clear that the terms were deliberately chosen not to say so  Keane JA  despite his reference to the  trend of established  first instance  authority  does not say so  In my respectful view  to the extent that decisions such as IMB Group   ATPR       Blacker   FCA     Kaye   FCA     Lewarne   FCA   and Emerald Ocean   ATPR     say  or may be taken as saying  that the legal or persuasive onus of proof is shifted to the representor by s  A    they are wrong  None examined the enactment history of s  A  If it be thought  contrary to my reading of Keane JA s reasons  that his Honour s reference to Kaye   FCA   as  established authority  was a conclusion that s  A  effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof  I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given   Perhaps not surprisingly  Emmett J also agreed with Allsop J as to the operation of s  A    FCA   at       FCR at      The third member

Pty Ltd   NSWCA       ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  It has not been suggested that the Applicants were   careless   in relying upon any of the representations of the Respondents  Even carelessness or negligence on the part of an applicant  it may be noted  will not deny relief    provided the carelessness has not been such as to destroy the causal connection between the contravening conduct and the loss or damage suffered  Henville v Walker   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at      Gleeson CJ there observed    It will commonly be the case that a person who is induced by a misleading or deceptive representation to undertake a course of action will have acted carelessly  or will have been otherwise at fault  in responding to the inducement  The purpose of the legislation is not restricted to the protection of the careful or the astute  Negligence on the part of the victim of a contravention is not a bar to an action under s   unless the conduct of the victim is such as to destroy the causal connection between contravention and loss or damage        For there to be the necessary causal relationship between a contravention of s   and loss or damage  so as to satisfy the requirements of s   it is not essential that the contravention be the sole cause of the loss or damage       The present case is not a case of carelessness or negligence  In the present proceeding  the Applicants acted at all material times prudently  They retained the services of an experienced person  Mr Mellor  made their own inquiries  and carefully considered the options

Nominees Pty Ltd   ATPR     The inquiry required by s   is not an inquiry into cause and effect in mathematical or philosophical terms  but is rather an inquiry into that conduct which influences action taken  Como Investments Pty Ltd v Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd   ATPR      Burchett  Ryan and Nicholson JJ there concluded  The law does not consider cause and effect in mathematical or in philosophical terms  The law looks at what influences the actions of the parties  Acknowledging that people are often swayed by several considerations  influencing them to varying extents  the law attributes causality to a single one of those considerations  provided it had some substantial rather than negligible effect  As Brennan J said in San Sebastian Pty Ltd v Minister administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act     HCA         CLR   at        The representation must be a real inducement or one of the real inducements to engage in the conduct which occasions the loss      Where a representation is relevant to the decision in question  and in its nature persuasive to induce the making of that decision  it accords with legal notions of causation to hold that it has a causative effect  And where a respondent  who may be taken to know his own business  has thought it was in his interests to misrepresent the situation in a particular respect  the Court may infer that the misrepresentation was persuasive  These inferences arise from the making of the respondent doing the thing it was calculated to induce him to do  All this is a matter of common sense  It has also been stated in the authorities  In Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at   Wilson J said   If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation   His Honour went on to say that the  inference may be rebutted  but this is to imply that in the absence of rebuttal the conclusion should stand     citedConstruction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Hadgkiss   FCAFC       ALR  http www austlii edu

reasonable grounds for making it  Ting v Blanche   FCA         ALR    Hill J there observed  at   The section is but an interpretation section  it does not of itself create a cause of action  nor define a norm of conduct  The relevant cause of action is to be found in s   of the Act by reference to the norm of conduct laid down in s   of the Act  What s  A does  in a practical sense  in cases where it applies  is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing  In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis     ALR     ATPR  Digest      s  A is  designed to facilitate proof   at ALR   ATPR    Representation as to future facts may  of course  constitute conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive within s   of the Act  irrespective of the operation of s  A  However  without the intervention of s  A the burden would remain upon the applicant to show that the representation  in whatever form it took  was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive  In the ordinary case where a representation as to future conduct or events is alleged to have been made  that means that the burden would be upon the applicant to show not merely that the conduct or event has not come to pass but also that at the time the representation was made the respondent did not believe that the conduct or event would come to pass or that there was no basis for a belief that the conduct or event would come to pass  James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd     ALR     Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     FCA       ALR    It will be readily apparent that

Brennan J said in San Sebastian Pty Ltd v Minister administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act     HCA         CLR   at        The representation must be a real inducement or one of the real inducements to engage in the conduct which occasions the loss      Where a representation is relevant to the decision in question  and in its nature persuasive to induce the making of that decision  it accords with legal notions of causation to hold that it has a causative effect  And where a respondent  who may be taken to know his own business  has thought it was in his interests to misrepresent the situation in a particular respect  the Court may infer that the misrepresentation was persuasive  These inferences arise from the making of the respondent doing the thing it was calculated to induce him to do  All this is a matter of common sense  It has also been stated in the authorities  In Gould v Vaggelas   HCA         CLR   at   Wilson J said   If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation   His Honour went on to say that the  inference may be rebutted  but this is to imply that in the absence of rebuttal the conclusion should stand       It has not been suggested that the Applicants were   careless   in relying upon any of the representations of the Respondents  Even carelessness or negligence on the part of an applicant  it may be noted  will not deny relief    provided the carelessness has not been such as to destroy the causal connection between the contravening conduct and the loss or damage suffered  Henville v Walker   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at      Gleeson CJ there observed    It will commonly be the case that a person who is induced by a misleading or deceptive representation to undertake a course of action will have acted carelessly  or will have been otherwise at fault  in responding to the inducement  The purpose of the legislation is not restricted to the protection of the careful or the astute  Negligence on the part of the victim of a contravention is not a bar to an action under s   unless the conduct of the victim is such as to destroy the causal connection between contravention and loss or damage        For there to be the necessary causal relationship between a contravention of s   and loss or damage  so as to satisfy the requirements of s   it is not essential that the contravention be the sole

     CLR   at   per Wilson J  Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd   NSWCA   at       NSWCA       ACSR   at   the fact is that those statements have been proven to have played a large part in the decision to acquire the SLP   followedJones v Dunkel     CLR   The explanation provided by Mr Wieland as to why the inspections may well have occurred at an earlier point of time  namely that the dates appearing on the records are the dates upon which those   in the office   subsequently completed the records  is rejected  Such an explanation is inconsistent with that which the records expose    the records requiring those conducting the inspections to certify that which they found and to state  for example  the   date of testing    Mr Wieland ultimately accepted that the explanation he was advancing as a   possibility   was but   speculation    In such circumstances  there is no reason not to find that the test records were carried out upon the dates set forth  The findings of fact that the machines were inspected on the dates appearing on the face of individual documents  it is considered  is supported by both the form of the documents themselves and the conclusion that Mr Wieland s evidence  especially in this respect  was considered to be unpersuasive  Moreover  those findings of fact are only further reinforced by the absence of any evidence being called from those persons employed in the Chinese factory to either support the   speculation   of Mr Wieland or to expressly state what the practice was in respect to the dating of inspection reports  cf Jones v Dunkel     CLR   at   per Kitto J  Given the importance of the dates upon which inspections did in fact occur  being evidence centrally relevant to when the SLP  s were manufactured and were in fact in operation  it is considered that those persons who in fact completed the inspection reports  or at least perhaps one of them  could have shed light on the matter and would have been expected to have done so  cf RPS v The Queen   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at   per Gaudron ACJ  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ   In the absence of the   as built   drawings for the second SLP   which failed  and in the absence of Mr Sun being called to give any evidence  the best evidence available to the Court as to the critical dimension presently in issue remained the measurements of Mr Better  That evidence  together with his conclusion  should be accepted  Even in the absence of recourse to the principle in Jones v Dunkel     CLR   at   per Kitto J  it is considered that the evidence of Mr Better was to be accepted   Rejected is the express written submission advanced on behalf of the Respondents that   there was no explanation provided as to why the centre tongue in each of the samples was so badly decomposed    It was Mr Better who provided that explanation   A further line of cross examination was to suggest that  if there had been insufficient axial clearance  the SLP   would not have been operable at all    or would not have been able to operate from April to August    Mr Better s June   Report addressed this possibility by maintaining that  Likely reasons for the operation during the   month period could be attributed to a combination of it being exposed to reasonably constant temperatures and the bearing assembly being greased regularly  It is also probable that there was some misalignment of the shaft and bearings and this would tend to cause point contact in the labyrinth  which would reduce the risk of seizing appliedLam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd     FLR   The contravening conduct of the Respondents may have caused loss or damage if that conduct was an inducement to the decision to purchase the SLP   Lam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd     FLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Samuels AJA and Meagher JA agreeing   The   causative threshold   remains a matter of judgment  Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Co Ltd   FCA         FCR   at    Lockhart  Gummow and French JJ there observed  at   A finding that a misrepresentation might have induced a decision will not of itself establish as a matter of probability that it did  Consistently with that finding  it may be that  on the balance of probabilities  a party was induced to make a decision by a combination of factors including the misrepresentation  Assuming a non trivial contribution to the causative process by the misrepresentation  then it may be actionable  Ultimately  the  causative threshold  beyond which liability attaches to a misrepresentation which is one of a number of factors inducing a decision that produces loss  will be a question of judgment  This is a familiar process adverted to in various related contexts by Mason CJ in March v E   M H Stramare Pty Ltd  supra  and in this Court in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers  Aust  Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR   at     and Pavich v Bobra Nominees Pty Ltd   ATPR       See also Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio     ALR   at    But the mere possibility that a misrepresentation might have induced a course of action by the representee can never of itself attach liability

making a representation as to a future matter to show that there were reasonable grounds for making it  Ting v Blanche   FCA         ALR    Hill J there observed  at   The section is but an interpretation section  it does not of itself create a cause of action  nor define a norm of conduct  The relevant cause of action is to be found in s   of the Act by reference to the norm of conduct laid down in s   of the Act  What s  A does  in a practical sense  in cases where it applies  is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing  In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis     ALR     ATPR  Digest      s  A is  designed to facilitate proof   at ALR   ATPR    Representation as to future facts may  of course  constitute conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive within s   of the Act  irrespective of the operation of s  A  However  without the intervention of s  A the burden would remain upon the applicant to show that the representation  in whatever form it took  was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive  In the ordinary case where a representation as to future conduct or events is alleged to have been made  that means that the burden would be upon the applicant to show not merely that the conduct or event has not come to pass but also that at the time the representation was made the respondent did not believe that the conduct or event would come to pass or that there was no basis for a belief that the conduct or event would come to pass  James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd     ALR     Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     FCA       ALR    It will be readily apparent that a representation as to future conduct or a future event will generally imply  and sometimes explicitly state  that the maker of the representation was of a particular state of mind as to the future conduct or event as at the time the representation was made       See also  Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at

outcome depended on the view taken of the section    FCAFC   at       FCR at       The construction given to s  A  by Emmett and Allsop JJ in McGrath   it is respectfully considered  should now be applied  On the facts of the present case  however  it would not have mattered which approach was followed   In the present proceeding  the bases upon which Mr Wieland believed the SLP   was both a reliable machine and would prove to be a reliable machine were summarised in the following exchange with his cross examiner  Can I go back to the penultimate proposition that I took you to that is that the Wieland SLP   has proved to be a reliable crusher and you said to me that that was an accurate statement as at September   correct    Mm  What are the facts  matters and circumstances upon which you rely to allow you to express the view as at September   that the Wieland SLP   had  at that stage  proven to be a reliable crusher    Well  we had one running in Australia and Peter had no issues with it  It was based on a design of a very well known crusher  the Telsmith   by   which  you know  you can find everywhere around the world in use  so it was well proven technology  So those two factors are the two that you ve identified  one  that there was one machine that was already running in Australia    Yes  Secondly  it was based  to use your words  on a design of another machine that had a proven track record of reliability  correct    Correct  Now  aside from those two matters  are there any other things that spring to mind    Yes  I mean we ve got a good workshop in China with new machine tools and we make other types of equipment so they had a good level of experience for building high tolerance machines   The grounds upon which Mr Wieland relied to assert that the SLP   would be a reliable machine thus essentially reduced themselves to two  namely   i  the fact that it was   heavily based   upon a design of another proven crusher  the   Telsmith   Single Toggle Jaw crusher      and  as Mr Wieland would have it  was not only based upon this design but was   over designed    The SLP   was said to be   an enhanced and improved design to the Telsmith   and a machine   reverse engineered   from the Telsmith  and    ii  the confidence that he had in his Chinese factory to manufacture the machine to a reliable standard    It is considered that the former ground may have gone some way towards making out the reasonable grounds for the representation that the SLP   would prove to be a reliable machine  but the confidence placed upon the Chinese factory was misplaced   Upon the basis of such evidence  it is considered that there were no reasonable grounds upon which any representation could be made that the SLP   would be a reliable machine  Had the former approach as to the construction of s  A  been applied such that there was an onus upon the Respondents to establish reasonable grounds for the making of the representation  that onus would not have been discharged  Upon the approach of Emmett and Allsop JJ in McGrath   and acting upon the basis that the Respondents did adduce   evidence to the contrary   it is considered that there was no reasonable basis upon which Mr Wieland could have made the representations as to reliability that he in fact made   It is also considered that there were no reasonable grounds for the other representation as to a future matter  namely the representation that   by installing the Second SLP   Readymix Holdings and Readymix Indonesia would not have any further problems with the operation of a SLP   machine     It is thus considered that there has also been a contravention of s   of the   Act by the First Respondent  Wieland Equipment   in respect to those   future matters   relied upon

HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at      As Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ observed    Claims for damages for pure economic loss present peculiar difficulty  Competition is the hallmark of most forms of commercial activity in Australia  As Brennan J said in Bryan v Maloney   HCA         CLR   at        If liability were to be imposed for the doing of anything which caused pure economic loss that was foreseeable  the tort of negligence would destroy commercial competition   Dorset Yacht Co v Home Office   UKHL       AC   at   sterilise many contracts and  in the well known dictum of Chief Judge Cardozo   Ultramares Corporation v Touche     NY   at   expose defendants to potential liability  in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class        That is why damages for pure economic loss are not recoverable if all that is shown is that the defendant s negligence was a cause of the loss and the loss was reasonably foreseeable    In Caltex Oil  Australia  Pty Ltd v The Dredge  Willemstad    HCA         CLR     the Court held that there were circumstances in which damages for economic loss were recoverable  In Caltex Oil  cases for recovery of economic loss were seen as being exceptions to a general rule  said to have been established in Cattle v Stockton Waterworks   LR   QB   that even if the loss was foreseeable  damages are not recoverable for economic loss which was not consequential upon injury to person or property  In Caltex Oil  Stephen J isolated a number of  salient features  which combined to constitute a sufficiently close relationship to give rise to a duty of care owed to Caltex for breach of which it might recover its purely economic loss   HCA         CLR   at      Chief among those features was the defendant s knowledge that to damage the pipeline which was damaged was inherently likely to produce economic loss   HCA         CLR   at      Since Caltex Oil  and most notably in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed   Vulnerability  in this context  is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken  Rather   vulnerability  is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff s inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant s want of reasonable care  either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant  Stapleton   Comparative Economic Loss  Lessons from Case Law Focused  Middle Theory      UCLA Law Review   at            In other cases of pure economic loss  Bryan v Maloney is an example  reference has been made to notions of assumption of responsibility and known reliance  The negligent misstatement cases like Mutual Life   Citizens  Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt   HCA         CLR   and Shaddock   Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council  No     HCA         CLR   can be seen as cases in which a central plank in the plaintiff s allegation that the defendant owed it a duty of care is the contention that the defendant knew that the plaintiff would rely on the accuracy of the information the defendant provided  And it may be  as Professor Stapleton has suggested     that these cases  too  can be explained by reference to notions of vulnerability   The reference in Caltex Oil to economic loss being  inherently likely  can also be seen as consistent with the importance of notions of vulnerability   It is not necessary in this case  however  to attempt to identify or articulate the breadth of any general proposition about the importance of vulnerability  This case can be decided without doing so   The   peculiar difficulties   presented by this cause of action need not therefore be confronted in the present proceeding  including the question as to whether the Respondents owed a duty of care to the Applicants    In many cases   it has been said    there will be no sound reason for imposing a duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from economic loss where it was reasonably open to the plaintiff to take steps to protect itself   Perre v Apand Pty Limited   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at   per McHugh J  Whether or not there was a duty upon the Respondents in the present proceeding need not be resolved   A hearing as to loss or damage should be held as soon as possible to bring this case  first commenced in March   to conclusion  Any future hearing as to loss or damage must separately address any loss or damage suffered by each of the Applicants and the cause of action upon which reliance is sought to be placed   Also outstanding is a Notice of Motion filed by the Respondents seeking further security for costs  That Motion was left outstanding pending these reasons being published   The parties are to bring in such Short Minutes of Orders as are considered necessary to give effect to these reasons together with directions as to the future conduct of the proceeding  including the resolution of the Motion seeking further security   Any order as to costs  it is presently considered  should await the resolution of the final hearing as to the quantification of loss of damage  if any  occasioned to the Applicants  or either of them  For present purposes  there is considered to be no reason why costs should not follow the event  It should also be noted that detailed written submissions were sought from the parties  The written submissions provided have proved to be of considerable assistance in the resolution of the issues consideredPriest v Last     KB   Even in the absence of the concession on behalf of the Respondents that a term was to be implied into the February   agreement  and even in the absence of the acceptance by Mr Wieland that it was as   plain as a pikestaff   that such a term was necessary to give business efficacy to the agreement  it would have been found that such a term would also have been implied pursuant to one or other of the statutory provisions otherwise in issue  It would  for example  have been difficult for Wieland Equipment to have denied that the purpose for which the SLP   was being purchased had not been made known  Not only had Mr Wieland been told of the very site to which the machine was being sent and the use to which it was to be put  it may otherwise have been safely assumed that a purchaser who purchases a rock crusher does so for the purpose of crushing rocks  cf Priest v Last     KB    There would have been no other purpose for which such a machine would be purchased  There may  however  have been some room for argument as to whether the SLP   was suitable for its particular use at the Jeladri Quarry  See  Brown I    The Swing of the Pendulum from Caveat Venditor to Caveat Emptor       LQR    But all such subtleties as may have emerged became unnecessary to resolve given the course ultimately pursued by the Respondents during oral submissions   It is regrettable  however  that the position as ultimately advanced by Counsel for the Respondents during the course of oral submissions was not communicated to either the Applicants or the Court at a far earlier point of time  The very purpose of requiring a written outline of submissions to be filed in advance of oral submissions is to provide notice to both the opposing party and the Court of the issues in need of resolution  Written submissions filed after the close of evidence can self evidently take into account an assessment of the submissions which can properly be advanced upon the basis of the evidence then available  That assessment may well be different to the manner in which a case has been opened  The failure to make a decision as to the submissions to be in fact advanced  and to make a decision confining submissions to issues more limited than those foreshadowed in either an opening or in a pleading  necessarily exposes both an opposing party and the Court to the very real potential for costs and resources to be unnecessarily incurred and expended   Such has been the experience in the present proceeding    at least insofar as the Court is concerned  Needless to say  the expeditious resolution of any dispute involves an identification of the issues to be resolved at the earliest opportunity citedRawley Pty Ltd v Bell  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Conduct is   likely to mislead or

misrepresentation might have induced a decision will not of itself establish as a matter of probability that it did  Consistently with that finding  it may be that  on the balance of probabilities  a party was induced to make a decision by a combination of factors including the misrepresentation  Assuming a non trivial contribution to the causative process by the misrepresentation  then it may be actionable  Ultimately  the  causative threshold  beyond which liability attaches to a misrepresentation which is one of a number of factors inducing a decision that produces loss  will be a question of judgment  This is a familiar process adverted to in various related contexts by Mason CJ in March v E   M H Stramare Pty Ltd  supra  and in this Court in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers  Aust  Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR   at     and Pavich v Bobra Nominees Pty Ltd   ATPR       See also Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio     ALR   at    But the mere possibility that

explanation provided by Mr Wieland as to why the inspections may well have occurred at an earlier point of time  namely that the dates appearing on the records are the dates upon which those   in the office   subsequently completed the records  is rejected  Such an explanation is inconsistent with that which the records expose    the records requiring those conducting the inspections to certify that which they found and to state  for example  the   date of testing    Mr Wieland ultimately accepted that the explanation he was advancing as a   possibility   was but   speculation    In such circumstances  there is no reason not to find that the test records were carried out upon the dates set forth  The findings of fact that the machines were inspected on the dates appearing on the face of individual documents  it is considered  is supported by both the form of the documents themselves and the conclusion that Mr Wieland s evidence  especially in this respect  was considered to be unpersuasive  Moreover  those findings of fact are only further reinforced by the absence of any evidence being called from those persons employed in the Chinese factory to either support the   speculation   of Mr Wieland or to expressly state what the practice was in respect to the dating of inspection reports  cf Jones v Dunkel     CLR   at   per Kitto J  Given the importance of the dates upon which inspections did in fact occur  being evidence centrally relevant to when the SLP  s were manufactured and were in fact in operation  it is considered that those persons who in fact completed the inspection reports  or at least perhaps one of them  could have shed light on the matter and would have been expected to have done so  cf RPS v The Queen   HCA   at       HCA       CLR

as cases in which a central plank in the plaintiff s allegation that the defendant owed it a duty of care is the contention that the defendant knew that the plaintiff would rely on the accuracy of the information the defendant provided  And it may be  as Professor Stapleton has suggested     that these cases  too  can be explained by reference to notions of vulnerability   The reference in Caltex Oil to economic loss being  inherently likely  can also be seen as consistent with the importance of notions of vulnerability   It is not necessary in this case  however  to attempt to identify or articulate the breadth of any general proposition about the importance of vulnerability  This case can be decided without doing so appliedYorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au
