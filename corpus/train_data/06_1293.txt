 The first of those four proceedings  being numbered NSD   of   and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant  was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle  for the most part  for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings  The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of   March    There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant  Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered   to   concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply  Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strike out of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts  issues and contentions  the proposed order   and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment  the proposed order    As to what version of Order   as to costs should be made  the Commissioner pointed out that IEF had made no submissions at the hearing in relation to the Commissioner s claim that  t he applicant pay the respondent s  ie Commissioners  costs of this motion and of the application  nor led evidence concerning the need to apportion costs incurred by the respondent between issues of additional and primary tax   The Commissioner referred to   of my reasons for judgment where I held that the  t  he Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date  inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application    and submitted that the text of the orders now sought should  reflect that finding precisely    I think that the Commissioner s submission is correct and reflects the substance of the outcome and the implications of my principal findings made earlier on   March   in the IEL Finance principal proceedings   ante    Accordingly I have made the orders in

four subject proceedings   IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   to provide draft declarations and or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that

paragraphs of amended statement of facts  issues and contentions  the proposed order   and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment  the proposed order    IEF contended the following in relation to the operation or implications otherwise of s  ZZP concerning what is described therein as  an appeal against an appealable objection decision under section  ZZ         i  the text of s  ZZP refers to the making of orders in relation to the decision  and so much usually involves the making of orders which either allow an appeal  disallow an appeal  or allow an appeal in part  often with a direction to the Commissioner as to how to assess or otherwise deal with the matter  in each of those cases however  the order disposes of the whole of the objection decision and not just part of it  and   ii  the section is expressed to operate where the appeal against the objection decision has been heard  and by necessary implication has been determined  it is only at that time that an order dealing with the whole of the objection decision may be made   In short  the contention of IEF seemingly boiled down to the proposition that since there can be only one objection decision  or more precisely in the dicta of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Queensland Trading and Holding Company Limited   FCAFC    Ryan  Heerey and Edmonds JJ  extracted in   below   only one decision in respect of each objection  there can only be an order of a court of competent jurisdiction made in relation to the whole of that objection decision  Absent any statutory inhibition to the contrary  more than one species or measure of relief may be available as a consequence of the exercise of what may be described as a statutory decision  The appellate proceedings in the Full Federal Court in relation to the subject litigious context have not yet of course been heard or determined  IEF submitted that the effect of the Court s ruling in relation to the Commissioner s interlocutory  strike out  motion  the orders sought thereby being summarised in   of my reasons for judgment of   March   is that IEF is estopped from challenging its liability to the primary tax controversially assessed by the Commissioner  whether by reason of the doctrine of abuse of process or of estoppel  That ruling of the Court in IEF s submission is procedural in nature  the same not having constituted the concluded determination of the Commissioner s objection decision s  in relation to each corporate taxpayer  ie each applicant  by reason of the taxpayers  pursuit of the subsisting appeals  That being so  IEF submitted further that the respective decisions of the Commissioner in relation to the objection to each assessment  the same not being divisible or susceptible to partial setting aside in the manner contended by the Commissioner  the appeals of each of the applicants  inclusive of course of IEF  cannot be partly dismissed  I interpolate to observe  for what it may presently matter  that the primary basis for my upholding the Commissioner s application for summary judgment was that of abuse of process  albeit that I found further in favour of the Commissioner on the basis of estoppel  Support for the propositions so advanced by IEF was said to be found in the judicial reasoning of the Full Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Queensland Trading and Holding Company Limited   where in the joint judgment of Ryan  Heerey and Edmonds JJ  the following appears at        As there can only be one objection by each of the taxpayers in respect of the assessment of primary tax and additional tax notified by the notice issued to each of them  there can in our view be only one decision in respect of each objection  and that is the objection referred to in s  ZY of the  Administration Act    The decision can accommodate both the disallowance of the objection or an allowance of it  in whole or in part  and in the latter case irrespective of whether it values reduction of the primary tax assessed  further remission of the additional tax assessed or both      The emphasis appearing in the third and fourth lines above was that of IEF  The issue here arising may be framed as to whether the order consequential upon a decision of the Commissioner may operate in the present context to the extent or of the scope framed by the Commissioner in   above  or whether expression may only be given to my findings on   March   in the way framed by the applicants in   above  being a way for which incidentally no precedent was cited  doubtless because of the unusual circumstances of the present proceedings involving not just more than a single year of income but three discrete taxpayer applicants  Given the significance of the indivisibility of an objection decision for which it contended  IEF submitted further that the appropriate course for adoption  in order to give consequential effect  should be for the Court to make an order or orders which would reflect the estoppel ruling  but which would leave or postpone the formulation of an ultimate order or orders in relation to the respective objection decisions until the pending appeal has been heard and determined  That outcome was submitted to be achievable by the adoption of what IEF proposed in terms of order   by way of an injunction alone  As to order   proposed by the Commissioner  which relates of course to the costs of the proceedings at first instance  it was explained by IEF that it has adopted for the purpose of its approach the wording in the final line of my principal reasons  being  The Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date  inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application    IEF submitted that since the dispute between the parties regarding so called penalty tax remains on foot  and that much of the evidence in relation to that issue is common to the dispute already litigated at first instance regarding primary tax  it was IEF s understanding that the Court was intending to refer thereby to so much only of the costs of the proceedings to date as related to the determination of the applicants  taxable income for the relevant years of income  that is to say  those years of income the subject of the so called estoppel point issue  The practical difficulty in that regard would be the resolution of what work has been exclusively referrable to the  penalty tax  issue remaining for resolution  as distinct from what work was referrable to the estoppel issue  to the extent those distinctions were susceptible to being drawn for the particular purpose citedHunter v Leahy and Others   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn

LIMITED Applicants AND    COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION Respondent   JUDGE   CONTI J DATE    SEPTEMBER   PLACE  SYDNEY   REASONS FOR ORDERS     On   March   I directed the parties to the four subject proceedings   IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   to provide draft declarations and or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that prior occasion  The first of those four proceedings  being numbered NSD   of   and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant  was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle  for the most part  for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings  The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of   March    There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant  Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered   to   concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply  Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strike out of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts  issues and contentions  the proposed order   and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment  the proposed order    The Commissioner submitted in response that the thrust of IEF s contentions I have outlined above tend to confuse the subject matter of the applicants  respective applications in the principal proceedings with the subject matter of the Commissioner s amended notice of motion filed on   July   being summary relief for abuse of process  The Commissioner drew attention however to Order   rule   subrule   whereof reads as follows          Where in any proceeding it appears to the Court that in relation to the proceeding generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings      a  no reasonable cause of action is disclosed                   c  the proceeding is an abuse of the process of the Court  the Court may order that the proceeding be stayed or dismissed generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings                Upon either footing  and by reason moreover of ss   and   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the Federal Court Act  the Commissioner asserted justification for an order in the form the subject of the Commissioner s proposed Order    see again   above   I was referred in that regard to the decision of Hunter v Leahy and Others   FCA         FCR   where in relation to the operation of s   of the Federal Court Act  French J observed at   and             It is accepted that courts of law and equity have general powers now accepted as an established part of their armoury to prevent the abuse or frustration of their processes in relation to matters coming within their jurisdictions                   Although the term  inherent jurisdiction  was used to describe such a power in courts of general jurisdiction  it is better described in a statutory court as an implied power      The Commissioner emphasised that an order was not sought that part of the objection decision be affirmed  but rather an order that the proceedings  so far as they relate to the objection decision in respect of primary tax  be dismissed  and that whether the objection decision is to be affirmed or set aside in part is a matter that may be dealt with when the remaining issue the subject of the proceedings  which relate to the objection decisions in respect of additional tax  have been determined  In my opinion and in the light in particular of the circumstance that the proceedings to date have been dominated by the issue as to liability to primary tax  the Commissioner s case in relation to the framework of the proposed Order   is to be preferred  The Federal Court s authority to make an order in relation to proceedings  so far as the same may constitute an abuse of process  does not originate from the Administration Act  but under and pursuant to the inherent powers of the Court and of the Federal Court Rules   in conformity with which the orders sought by the Commissioner have been presented  Moreover the power of the Court to make orders for the dismissal of proceedings  in whole or in part  originates under Order   rule   the concluding words whereof being reflected implicitly in the form of Order   proposed by the Commissioner in   above  That power resides also in the power of the Federal Court conferred by s   of the Federal Court Act  as the dictum of French J in Hunter makes clear  For ease of reference  section   reads as follows       The Court has power  in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction  to make orders of such kinds  including interlocutory orders  and to issue  or direct the issue of  writs of such kinds  as the Court thinks appropriate  It is upon that footing  which I pointed out in   of my reasons for judgment given on   March   in the strike out proceedings   supra   being  m y primary juridical basis for granting or upholding the Commissioner s application for summary judgment is that of abuse of process    I would make Order   as proposed by the Commissioner
