Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlWhen exercising the discretion conferred by s  A  of the   Act to grant leave to appeal  it may be accepted that that provision confers on the court   an unfettered discretion   in   unqualified terms   Decor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR   at   per Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ  Considerations relevant when deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted are  whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court  and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision were wrong   In the present proceeding it is not considered that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attendant with sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted  Nor is it considered that the Applicant would suffer substantial injustice  His application for a protection visa has been considered on its merits by both a delegate of the Minister and by the Tribunal  His application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court has been carefully considered and no legal error discerned  No injustice is exposed in such circumstances  The Federal Magistrate  in his reasons for decision  recounted the facts relevant to the Applicant s claim for a protection visa  Those reasons record that    n o supporting evidence   for the claims being advanced by the Applicant was provided to the Department and also record the rejection of the claim  Those reasons further record that the Applicant was subsequently invited to attend a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal but that he declined that invitation  Express reference is made by the Federal Magistrate to some of the findings made by that Tribunal  Albeit not set forth expressly in his reason for decision  it is relevant to note that the Tribunal further stated      The applicant did not attend the Tribunal hearing  The applicant only made the briefest of claims  The applicant claims he belongs to a minority group in Pakistan  the  Mohanjir  community who are Muslims by religion  Without further information from the applicant I am unable to accept that he belongs to the  Mohanjir  community  Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that he and his family have been persecuted by the majority community in Pakistan for several years            I am required to consider the situation if the applicant  a Pakistani citizen from Sialkot  were to return to Pakistan now or within a reasonably foreseeable future      But the independent evidence before me     does not suggest that the applicant would not receive the protection of the Pakistani authorities or that such protection would be ineffective  if the applicant were to be harmed  Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that if he returns to Pakistan he will be killed  harmed or persecuted for a Convention related reason  The mere fact that a person claims fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish either the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is  well founded  or that it is for the reason claimed        I do not accept there is a real chance the applicant will suffer harm now or in the foreseeable future if he were to return to Pakistan and I am not satisfied the applicant has a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention related reason     Given the paucity of the material submitted in support of his claim and the paucity of the material apparently available to the Tribunal  and the decision of the now Applicant not to accept the invitation extended to him to attend a hearing before the Tribunal  these conclusions were perhaps not unexpected  The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate then outline the manner in which he approached his task  The Federal Magistrate observed that   the applicant s original application made unparticularised contentions of   gross violations of the Regulations and the Act        An amended application was apparently filed from which the Federal Magistrate discerned   four essential points   citedLawrance v The Commonwealth of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn support of the Application the Applicant has filed

ordered although the application is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act  The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic  The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice  The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the court or justice to do justice between the parties  see Hughes v National Trustees Executors   Agency Co of Australasia Ltd   VR   at    This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant         There are two relevant matters concerning whether the Court should exercise its discretion to extend time  The first is whether a sufficient explanation for the delay has been forthcoming  the second is whether the proposed appeal would enjoy any prospect of success  such that it ought be

   That Application seeks both leave to appeal and   an order that compliance with Order   subrule   be dispensed with    Leave to appeal is required because the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application before that Court pursuant to Rule    a  of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules    Cth   Rule     provides as follow    Show cause hearing     At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause  the Court may   a  if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed   dismiss the application  or    b  if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed   adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made
