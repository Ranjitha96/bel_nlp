Hamilton v Diprose   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMeadow Springs v Balanced Securities     ACLC     Mr Buckley helpfully referred me to a recent decision of French J  Meadow Springs v Balanced Securities     ACLC      In that case French J at   pointed out that a direction given or a question determined under s   would protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or determination  His Honour thought it may be an open question whether it establishes a res judicata between the liquidator and any parties affected by it who are named as defendants in the application  but neither direction nor determination gives rise to a res judicata as between parties who may have competing interests affected by it
