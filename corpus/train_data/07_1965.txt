Fadu Pty Ltd  ACN       v ACN       Pty Ltd as Trustee of the  International Linen Service Unit Trust    FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I would preface my reasons by noting  first the provisions of s  L  s  M  s  e  and s   of the TP Act  Section  L provides     If the making of a contract after the commencement of this section contravenes this Act by reason of the inclusion of a particular provision in the contract  then  subject to any order made under section   or  A  nothing in this Act affects the validity or enforceability of the contract otherwise than in relation to that provision in so far as that provision is severable    Because of what I say below  I would emphasise that this provision on its proper construction requires severance of offending provisions  see SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson   HCA         CLR   at     but that it operates subject to any order made under s   and it is upon s   that the respondents rely in particular   Section  M  a companion provision  provides  insofar as presently relevant  that       This Act does not affect the operation of         a  the law relating to restraint of trade in so far as that law is capable of operating concurrently with this Act                 but nothing in the law referred to in paragraph  a      affects the interpretation of this Act   In this matter the respondents seek to do no more than to put that matter in issue  albeit contingently because their primary position is that the restraints are inoffensive at common law in any event  But if they are incorrect in that  and if the restraints are exclusionary provisions the applicants frankly concede they are and contravene s  a    the respondents  as of course  are entitled to apply for an order under s   to have the restraints varied  They equally are entitled  subject to any order made under s     to have the issue of severance under s  L determined  see SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson    By relying simply upon a common law claim in the present factual setting  the applicants have perforce exposed themselves to the defensive use the respondents seek to make of the TP Act   I grant the leave to amend that has been sought   The respondents have not made submissions to the effect that the offensive parts of the restraints could be severed  cf SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson   HCA         CLR   at     or that the  reading down  provision of the deed poll would permit the court to make an inoffensive agreement for the parties which they did not make themselves  The obvious reason for their not taking either of these course lies in their TP Act claims to which I now turn   There are four tiers of questions which possibly arise in relation to the respondents  claim  The first is whether as exclusionary provisions  the Deed Poll restraints contravene s  a  of the TP Act  The second is whether  on the application of the respondents  the Court should grant relief under s   of the Act so as to vary the contract in a manner it considers just and equitable  The third is whether  again on the respondents  application  the Court should grant relief under s   favourable to the applicants by way of varying the Deed Poll s restraints so as to prevent or reduce loss or damage to the applicants  The fourth is whether the offending restraints ought be severed under s  L of the TP Act   For reasons I later give it is only necessary to deal with the second of these in any detail   I need not repeat here the terms of s  L save to note that the severance requirement imposed by the section  see SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson   at   is expressly made  subject to any order under section    I propose to make such an order and that order will render severance under s  L unnecessary   I will direct the parties to bring in short minutes of order to give effect to my findings and conclusions  Additionally  I would note that while it is provided expressly in the Deed Poll of Restraint that it does not supersede the Heads of Agreement  see cl   no relief has been sought in this proceeding in relation to that agreement   I will also direct the parties to file and serve written submissions on costs within seven days of the handing down of these

been committed  regard shall not be had                      e  in the case of a contract for the sale of a business or of shares in the capital of a body corporate carrying on a business to any provision of the contract that is solely for the protection of the purchaser in respect of the goodwill of the business          I simply note in passing that there is a live issue between the parties as to whether the transaction of which the impugned deed poll was part  was itself a sale contract of a type envisaged by subpara    The subpara also gives rise to the question whether  if the deed contained restraints that did not offend the common law of restraint of trade  it would for that reason fall within s  e   assuming the transaction was of the relevant type and the restraints related to the protection of goodwill  cf IRAF Pty Ltd v Graham     ALR   at      ix  Protection of customer connection equally can contrive what is the acceptable duration of a restraint  hence the emphasis

from s  s purview  any provision of a contract for the sale of a business or of shares in the capital of a body corporate carrying on a business   that is solely for the protection of the purchaser in respect of the goodwill of the business   It is unsurprising that the view has been expressed that     t he test provided by s  e  seems     to encapsulate the conditions which by the common law are required to bring a restraint relating to a business within the policy of the law  see IRAF Pty Ltd v Graham   at    citedI   L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers  Brisbane  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR

collateral arrangement relating to the contract     in such manner as the Court considers just and equitable        I would again note in passing that the subsection unqualifiedly permits any party to the contract to apply for an order under it whether or not in a separate application  It is not limited to a party burdened by a provision that contravenes s     let alone a party who has suffered  or is likely to suffer  loss or damage by the contravening conduct  In this last respect the subsection appears to be quite unlike s    A   B  and   each of which conditions the making of their

first to deal with the TP Act claim before a common law claim  because of the way in which this matter was prosecuted by the applicants and because of the dispute over the respondents  amendments to its defence  I am content to deal with the common law claim first and without regard to any possible impact of the TP Act upon it in the circumstances   Save in one respect to which I will refer below  there is no obvious disagreement between the parties as to the general principles to be applied in testing the validity of covenants in restraint of trade  There are  predictably  differences in matters of emphases and in the alleged utility of analogies selected from the rich bazaar of decided case law    vi  The most recent elaboration of the legal nature of goodwill by the High Court was in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry at   ff  It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon what was there said other than to note that one of the definitions endorsed by the joint judgment was that of Lord Macnaghten in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Meuller   Co s Margarine Ltd   AC   at     where it was said       What is goodwill  It is a thing very easy to describe  very difficult to define  It is the benefit and advantage of the good name  reputation  and connection of a business  It is the attractive force which brings in custom  It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from a new business at its first start  The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source  However widely extended or diffused its influence may be  goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates  Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements  It differs in its composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same trade  citedAmoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Brothers Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www

be satisfied  The restraint must be reasonable in the interests of the parties in that it affords no more than adequate protection to the covenantee  while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public   see the Nordenfelt Case    It may be that although a restraint satisfies the first requirement it is injurious to the public for some reason other than being in excess of what is reasonable in the interests of the parties    ii  The onus of establishing that a restraint is reasonable as between the parties rests with the party who puts forward the restraint  while the onus of establishing that it is contrary to the public interest is on the party alleging this  Amoco   at          iii   The fact that the parties have bargained from a position of equality is     one of the circumstances to be considered in determining whether the covenants were reasonable  but it does not save from invalidity a covenant found to be unreasonable or contrary to the public interest  see also Creamoata Ltd v Rice Equalization Association Ltd     HCA       CLR   at       Per Gibbs J in Amoco   at       This is a proposition upon which the parties divide  the respondents emphasising that significant weight should be given in this regard to a commercial agreement reached  after hard bargaining  by parties  which each finds in its interests to accept  Amoco   per Menzies J  in dissent   Whether or not the observations of Menzies J accurately reflects Australian law is not a matter that I need consider as I do not consider that the Heads of Agreement represented  an ordinary transaction between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser  Brown v Brown     NZLR   at   per Cooke J  I will later return to this matter    iv  The question of reasonableness is a question of law for the Court which ultimately depends upon  a judgment the reasons for which do not admit of great elaboration  Amoco   at    The validity of the restraint is to be determined as at the date of the agreement  though facts occurring after that date may be relevant if they throw light on the circumstances existing at the date of the restraint  Amoco   at     The   August   agreement cannot on the evidence meaningfully be characterised as embodying an ordinary transaction between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser  The character Mr James gave the dealing which I accept  a walk in walk out on the basis of a quick clear severance so they didn t have to look at each other much longer  comes closer to the transaction described in Brown v Brown   between two brothers who carried on a business together through a corporate vehicle but who could no longer continue in business together  at          it was a transaction forced on the parties  in effect a case of one partner buying out the other because unhappy differences had made co operation impossible    I mention this  not for the purpose of inquiring into the adequacy of the consideration for the restraint  cf Amoco   at   but rather to indicate that the circumstances surrounding the transaction do not warrant its being characterised as having been  bargained from a position of equality  cf Amoco     and hence to be so considered in determining whether the restraints were reasonable citedPeters  WA  Ltd v Petersville Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   i  Public policy lies at the

present purposes that I express a concluded view on the correctness of this observation  The burden of the subsection in the end is simply one of statutory interpretation  But what the s  e  exception suggests for the purposes of the s   discretion is that there well could be circumstances in which it would be both appropriate and just and equitable to vary a restraint in a contract associated with the sale of an interest in a business so that it does no more than provide a level of protection that would be acceptable at common law for the policy reasons of the common law  Such an exercise of discretion would be permissible under s   in an appropriate case even if a provision valid at common law was not saved from contravening s   because of s  e  i e  because that provision did not operate in tandem with the common law  cf Peters  WA  Ltd v Petersville Ltd   at       I am satisfied that the present is a case in which a variation order should be made  I indicated in relation to the laundry hire restraint that I considered a three year period of restraint would appear to be reasonable as between the parties  I equally indicated that  save in relation to its extension into the Barossa Valley  the map tendered by the respondents  Appendix B to these reasons  delineates an area within which it would be reasonable to proscribe competition between the parties in relation to the applicants operating etc a laundry hire business  I also indicated what I consider to be the proper construction to be given the words  operate  and  operation  in the restraint but that  in any event  that meaning indicated what was a reasonable limit to the scope of the activities that could be the subject of an acceptable restraint   Accordingly  I would vary the Restraint clause as it relates to the laundry hire business so as      i  to limit the restraint to conducting  or being involved directly or indirectly  in the conduct of  a laundry hire business     ii  to limit the area of the restraint to that marked with a line in Appendix B to these reasons commencing at Aldinga and terminating at Barker Inlet but so as to exclude the area to the north between Williamstown  Tanunda and

potential customers  The protection of that interest in a given case can contrive what is the acceptable area or scope of a restraint  cf Whitehall v Bradford     Ch   esp at     where a ten mile radius restraint on a retiring partner of a medical practice was unsuccessfully challenged  the evidence establishing that  though the patients on the periphery of that area were small in number they contributed about one third of the total partnership income  see also Kennett v Crawford   SASR   C   S Constructions Pty Ltd v Dawson     ATPR     and Lloyd s Ships Holdings Pty Ltd v Davros Pty Ltd     FCR   at    Important in this regard for present purposes are observations of Viscount Maugham in the Privy Council in Connors Brothers Ltd v Connors     All ER   at   in the context of a covenant taken on the sale of a sardine business not to engage in any such business in Canada         the question of reasonableness being a matter of law for the court  it has never yet been supposed that it is necessary in relation to the trade of a large manufacturer or merchant to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the business which the covenant is designed to protect has been carried on in every part of the area mentioned in the covenant  In the cases in which the area has been the whole of England  or a substantial part of it  such as   miles or   miles from a named town  it has never been held that the covenantee was under an obligation to prove that the business has been carried on in all the towns and villages within the area  In the Nordenfelt case  no attempt was made to prove that all the governments of the world  or even of the civilised world  had ordered goods from the company  though the greater number no doubt had done so  A great deal no doubt depends on the nature of the business and the area in question  In a country of vast spaces  like the Dominion of Canada  it will always be possible  until the population of the country reaches a point now scarcely contemplated  to point to areas where there are only few settlers or inhabitants  and where  accordingly  few  if any  of the goods sold by the manufacturer have penetrated  If  for example  a restrictive covenant were limited to the province of Quebec  it would seldom be possible to prove that the goods were used in every part of that province  However  the goodwill of a business such as is now under consideration could not adequately be protected if the restrictive covenant had to be limited to the towns and villages where actual sales could be proved  whilst leaving the vendor free to establish a business  which would almost certainly be competitive   in all the adjoining places    Emphasis added  Footnotes omitted  citedBuckley v Tutty   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au

The restraint must be reasonable in the interests of the parties in that it affords no more than adequate protection to the covenantee  while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public   see the Nordenfelt Case    It may be that although a restraint satisfies the first requirement it is injurious to the public for some reason other than being in excess of what is reasonable in the interests of the parties  citedBrown v Brown     NZLR    ii  The onus of establishing that a restraint is reasonable as between the parties rests with the party who puts forward the restraint  while the onus of establishing that it is contrary to the public interest is on the party alleging this  Amoco   at          iii   The fact that the parties have bargained from a position of equality is     one of the circumstances to be considered in determining whether the covenants were reasonable  but it does not save from invalidity a covenant found to be unreasonable or contrary to the public interest  see also Creamoata Ltd v Rice Equalization Association Ltd     HCA       CLR   at       Per Gibbs J in Amoco   at       This is a proposition upon which the parties divide  the respondents emphasising that significant weight should be given in this regard to a commercial agreement reached  after hard bargaining  by parties  which each finds in its interests to accept  Amoco   per Menzies J  in dissent   Whether or not the observations of Menzies J accurately reflects Australian law is not a matter that I need consider as I do not consider that the Heads of Agreement represented  an ordinary transaction between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser  Brown v Brown     NZLR   at   per Cooke J  I will later return to this matter    ix  Protection of customer connection equally can contrive what is the acceptable duration of a restraint  hence the emphasis in the cases on the period reasonably to be allowed  a  to give the covenantee the opportunity  of cementing an old connection and of profiting from an established reputation  Brown v Brown     and to establish a relationship with the customers of the business Carlton   United Breweries Ltd v Tooth   Co Ltd     IPR   at   and  b  for severing the relationship between the covenantor and those who would patronize the business of the sale  IRAF Pty Ltd v Graham   at     The   August   agreement cannot on the evidence meaningfully be characterised as embodying an ordinary transaction between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser  The character Mr James gave the dealing which I accept  a walk in walk out on the basis of a quick clear severance so they didn t have to look at each other much longer  comes closer to the transaction described in Brown v Brown   between two brothers who carried on a business together through a corporate vehicle but who could no longer continue in business together  at          it was a transaction forced on the parties  in effect a case of one partner buying out the other because unhappy differences had made co operation impossible    I mention this  not for the purpose of inquiring into the adequacy of the consideration for the restraint  cf Amoco   at   but rather to indicate that the circumstances surrounding the transaction do not warrant its being characterised as having been  bargained from a position of equality  cf Amoco     and hence to be so considered in determining whether the restraints were reasonable citedGeraghty v Minter   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   v  The seller of the goodwill

may be had to such expansion of the business as might reasonably be contemplated  Lloyd s Ships   at   citedInland Revenue Commissioners v Meuller   Co s Margarine Ltd   AC    vi  The most recent elaboration of the legal nature of goodwill by the High Court was in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry at   ff  It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon what was there said other than to note that one of the definitions endorsed by the joint judgment was that of Lord Macnaghten in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Meuller   Co s Margarine Ltd   AC   at     where it was said       What is goodwill  It is a thing very easy to describe  very difficult to define  It is the benefit and advantage of the good name  reputation  and connection of a business  It is the attractive force which brings in custom  It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from a new business at its first start  The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source  However widely extended or diffused its influence may be  goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates  Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements  It differs in its composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same trade  citedWhitehall v Bradford     Ch    viii  The principal interest protected by restraints on competition on the sale of goodwill is customer connection  the customers being existing or potential customers  The protection of that interest in a given case can contrive what is the acceptable area or scope of a restraint  cf Whitehall v Bradford     Ch   esp at     where a ten mile radius restraint on a retiring partner of a medical practice was

which the area has been the whole of England  or a substantial part of it  such as   miles or   miles from a named town  it has never been held that the covenantee was under an obligation to prove that the business has been carried on in all the towns and villages within the area  In the Nordenfelt case  no attempt was made to prove that all the governments of the world  or even of the

the restrictive covenant had to be limited to the towns and villages where actual sales could be proved  whilst leaving the vendor free to establish a business  which would almost certainly be
