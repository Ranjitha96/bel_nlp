Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe appellant submits that the Tribunal member had a closed mind or that there was a reasonable apprehension that she did not bring an unprejudiced mind to the review  The particulars and submissions given in support of this ground contained in the appellant s first set of submissions all raise factual matters concerning the appellant s claims  In his further written submissions  the appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to provide him with a genuine opportunity to speak generally about his faith at the Tribunal hearing and that it had already formed a firm view before he was questioned about his faith because it was affected by incorrect independent country information  He refers to SZMSS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA   in support of this submission  Contrary to the appellant s submission  the Tribunal s reasons at   to   indicate that the appellant was given the opportunity to speak generally about his faith at the Tribunal hearing  cf SZMSS at    For example  the appellant recounted his conversion to and practice of Christianity and explained his understanding of the Bible  The Tribunal asked the appellant why he converted to Christianity and what he told people when he spread the gospel  These questions were largely responsive to the matters raised by the appellant  Other questions asked by the Tribunal concerned the appellant s own practice of Christianity in China and whether he had read or studied anything other than the Bible  Otherwise  the Tribunal asked the appellant a question about each of the second coming and the appellant s view of creation  The appellant answered each question  There is no indication in the Tribunal s reasons that it asked these questions in a manner that suggested pre judgment or a closed mind  cf SZMSS at    Questions exploring the appellant s knowledge of his claimed faith  on which he relied as a basis for a well founded fear of persecution  do not of themselves indicate bias or a closed mind or a failure to consider the appellant s claims  The Tribunal then turned to the appellant s knowledge of the Church he attended in Sydney  It put a number of questions concerning the beliefs and practices of the Church to the appellant and to Mr Ng  known as Brother Wu  who had accompanied the appellant to the hearing  The Tribunal said that it had done some reading about the Church and it appears that such reading may have informed the Tribunal s questions to the appellant and Mr Ng  However  this does not indicate bias or a closed mind  The ground of appeal based on an allegation of bias or apprehended bias by the Tribunal is not made out  Did the Tribunal fail properly to consider the appellant s claim affirmedSZNLJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThe appellant is a citizen of China  born in   who arrived in Australia on   August    He claimed to fear persecution in China based on his Christian activities and beliefs and his involvement in anti Three Gorges Dam activities  The appellant applied for a protection visa  which a delegate of the Minister refused to grant  The appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate s decision  He was invited to and did attend a hearing on   February    The appellant and a witness attended a further hearing on   March    The Tribunal made a decision affirming the decision of the delegate  Federal Magistrate Driver dismissed the appellant s application for review of the Tribunal decision   SZNLJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    This is an appeal from his Honour s decision  Before the Tribunal  the appellant claimed that he had suffered persecution in China by reason of his involvement in Christian activities and anti Three Gorges Dam activities  He claimed to have become a Christian in May   and to have distributed religious materials and the Bible  He claimed to have been involved with protests by peasants who had migrated due to the Three Gorges Dam project  He says that he was arrested  detained  tortured and subjected to physical and mental persecution as part of a process called  education through labour  between   November   and   December    After this incident  he went into hiding  illegally obtained an Australian visa and fled China  He claimed that he would be arrested if he returned to China because he had taken part in the underground movement of Christians and distributed religious materials and had helped the Three Gorges Dam peasants in their protests  The appellant also claimed that after he arrived in Australia  he attended the Christian Assembly of Sydney church in Lidcombe and a Christian church in Auburn  In view of the matters raised in the appeal  it is relevant to give some further detail of the basis of the appellant s claims  as recorded by the Tribunal in its decision
