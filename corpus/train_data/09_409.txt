SZMZQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThus  it cannot be said that the delay between the date of the delegate s decision and the date upon which the Tribunal heard and determined the matter affected the Tribunal s reasoning processes  It seems to me therefore that the Tribunal complied with its obligations under s   of the Act and that there was no denial of procedural fairness  As the High Court said in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at       What is required by procedural fairness is a fair hearing  not a fair outcome      The relevant question is about the Tribunal s processes  not its actual decision  The High Court s observations seem to me to be apt in the present case  Moreover  I do not see that the delay between the appellant s date of arrival in Australia and the date upon which the Tribunal dealt with the matter can be said to give rise to any ground of review  The appellant complained that he had forgotten the relevant facts which occurred in   but as the High Court observed in SZBEL at      I t is for the applicant for a protection visa to establish the claims that are made out  This is not a case in which the appellant was affected by any disparity between the issues considered to be dispositive by the delegate and the issues which arose in relation to the decision under review  Here it appears that the appellant s claim before the delegate had a different basis to the claim which he put before the tribunal in the written statement to which I have referred above referred toSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFinally  it cannot be said that there was any breach of s  A of the Act because the information upon which the Tribunal relied was not  information  within the meaning of section  A  see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALR   at     It follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding nineteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobsson      Associate     Dated    April     The Appellant was self represented        Counsel for the Respondents  P  Reynolds     Solicitor for the Respondents  Clayton Utz   Date of Hearing    April       Date of Judgment    April         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
