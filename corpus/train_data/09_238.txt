AZAAM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAdam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc   HCA         CLR   at   the Court said    Nor is there any serious dispute between the parties that appellate courts exercise particular caution in reviewing decisions pertaining to practice and procedure  Counsel for Brown urged that specific cumulative bars operate to guide appellate courts in the discharge of that task  Not only must there be error of principle  but the decision appealed from must work a substantial injustice to one of the parties  The opposing view is that such criteria are to be expressed disjunctively  Cases can be cited in support of both views  for example  on the one hand  Niemann v  Electronic Industries Ltd    V R      at p    on the other hand  De Mestre v  A D  Hunter Pty  Ltd      W N   N S W       at p     For ourselves  we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria  The circumstances of different cases are infinitely various  We would merely repeat  with approval  the oft cited statement of Sir Frederick Jordan in In re the Will of F B  Gilbert  dec       S R   N S W       at p           I am of opinion that      there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights  In the former class of case  if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of judges of first instance  the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice  The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably  and costs heaped up indefinitely  if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could  at will  in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in Chambers to a Court of Appeal       See also  Brambles Holdings Ltd  v  Trade Practices Commission   FCA         F L R      at p      A L R      at p    Dougherty v  Chandler     S R   N S W       at p     It is safe to say that the question of injustice flowing from the order appealed from will generally be a relevant and necessary consideration  The proceeding is listed for hearing on   March    The Federal Magistrates Court has now advised that the applicant can appear by video should this Court entertain the applicant s application and appeal  It does not seem that there was any good reason to reject the applicant s application to transfer the proceeding to the Victorian Registry  The proceeding had only recently been commenced  Because of the provisions of s   of the Migration Act    Cth  the applicant could not delay the commencement until she moved to Victoria citedHouse v The King   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe first respondent also submitted that the Court should not grant leave to appeal without identifying an error of the type described in House v The King   HCA         CLR   at     or find that the exercise of the discretion by the Federal Magistrate had miscarried  The first respondent indicated  however  that if the Court were of the opinion that an extension of time should be granted and leave to appeal be given  then the first respondent would consent to an order for transfer of the proceeding  I think  with respect  that the Minister was right to adopt the attitude to which I have referred which  in my opinion  was entirely reasonable  In House v The King   HCA       CLR   at     Dixon  Evatt and McTiernan JJ said    The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles  It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that  if they had been in the position of the primary judge  they would have taken a different course  It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion  If the judge acts upon a wrong principle  if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him  if he mistakes the facts  if he does not take into account some material consideration  then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so  It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order  but  if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust  the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance  In such a case  although the nature of the error may not be discoverable  the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred
