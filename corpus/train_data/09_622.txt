SZMBL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedSZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR  In SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR   Lander J  with whom Moore and Marshall JJ agreed  stated in relation to Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte Aala   HCA         CLR   and SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   the following  at     It should be only in exceptional circumstances that a Court should refuse to issue the constitutional writs once the Court has determined that the Tribunal had failed to comply with its imperative statutory obligations to an applicant seeking the review of a decision of the delegate refusing the applicant a protection visa  If it were otherwise  and the Court were required to inquire into the extent to which the failure by the Tribunal to comply with its statutory obligations to accord an applicant a fair hearing prejudiced the applicant  the imperative obligation imposed on the Tribunal might well be blunted       The appellant contended that on this approach relief would not be refused in the present case on the basis of inutility  Although the issue does not need to be determined I accept the first respondent s submission that the present case does not involve imperative statutory obligations within the meaning of that judgment  Further  I agree with the Federal Magistrate that there is a strong discretionary reason in favour of refusing relief  The inquiry which the appellant contended that the Tribunal should have conducted had to be undertaken by the Federal Magistrate in the context of the challenge to the Tribunal s decision  It would be odd  to say the least  if the Federal Magistrate had concluded that the appellant had not instructed the agent to include the political claim and yet remitted the matter to the Tribunal to determine that very same question  This is the more so when it is appreciated that both parties subpoenaed the agent to give evidence before the Federal Magistrate but neither side called on the subpoena  The agent answered the subpoena by filing an affidavit in which he set out his version of events  The appellant sought to tender the affidavit without calling the agent and intended to invite the Federal Magistrate to find that the contents of the affidavit were false  The Federal Magistrate upheld the first respondent s objection to such a course  Following discussion with the Court the appellant s counsel applied to amend the second ground of appeal  The application was refused as the proposed ground had no hope of success  It asserted that the Tribunal had failed to consider the appellant s risk of future persecution in Bangladesh when the reasons of the Tribunal on their face clearly showed that the Tribunal had given consideration to the very issue  Further reasons for dismissing the ground were given orally by the Court during the hearing  The original form of the ground alleged errors which on their face did not amount to jurisdictional errors  The written submissions similarly failed to identify any arguable jurisdictional errors  It is desirable that the first respondent move the Court prior to the hearing in such circumstances to have such groundless allegations rejected before written submissions are required citedSZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe appellant argued that the reference to  evidence as whole  included a reference to the evidence about the appellant s activities in Australia  If that were so the inclusion of consideration of evidence about the appellant s activities in Australia would be contrary to s  R  which required such evidence to be disregarded where  as here  the Court has found that those activities were undertaken to strengthen the appellant s claim  see SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR    This argument should not be accepted  The reference to evidence as a whole read in context excludes the evidence of the appellant s Australian conduct  It is unreal to suggest that the Tribunal having just said that it disregards the appellant s conduct in Australia  in the next sentence contradicts itself  That this is not the case is confirmed by the reference in the concluding summary four paragraphs later where the Tribunal repeats     I t has disregarded his politically related conduct in Australia since July   as it is not satisfied that he engaged in that conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee  It follows from these reasons that the appeal will be dismissed    I
