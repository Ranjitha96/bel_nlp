Vu v New South Wales Police Service   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBell v Queensland     IPR   I am entitled to have regard to that course of conduct  Indeed  s  K  and   of the Crimes Act   apply where a person has been charged with a number of offences against the same provision of a law of the Commonwealth  The Court is authorised to impose one penalty in respect of all of the offences  but that penalty is not to exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be imposed if a separate penalty were imposed in respect of each offence  In Bell v Queensland     IPR   at         Kiefel J considered it appropriate to impose one penalty in respect of a series of offences similar to Mr Vu s  see also Hamm v Middleton     IPR   at     per von Doussa J   I am satisfied that Mr Vu has shown genuine contrition for his offending  Not only did that appear clearly from the report of the Probation and Parole Service  but in his evidence before me I consider him to have been genuinely remorseful and to have recognised that he has exposed himself to pay whatever penalty the court might extract from him as a result of his foolishness and dishonesty   Mr Vu pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity  The police argues that his guilty plea must be seen in the context of an acknowledgment of the strength of the police case and a recognition of the inevitable discussedChen v New South Wales Police Service     IPR   In Chen v New South Wales Police Service     IPR   Jacobson J dealt with eight offences of infringement of copyright contrary to ss  b  and  A a  of the Act  In that case the offender had pleaded guilty before the magistrate to the eight offences and was then placed on a good behaviour bond for five years and ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty totalling    The penalty was payable in monthly instalments over a protracted period  The offender had sold counterfeit DVDs at a market on four occasions and had been found in possession of over   infringing CDs  And  at her brother s premises there were music CDs  DVDs  blank disks  paperwork and business cards in her name  She also had about   DVDs and two computers on which were found files of infringing films  The offender in that case was a single mother whose son had an illness and she had little means  His Honour came to the view that the penalty imposed was one which was proper and refused leave to appeal against the sentence   In this matter  although Mr Vu s period of offending stretched over a considerable period of about   months  it involved him being a distributor  rather than a manufacturer  of the infringing copies  I have had regard to his genuine contrition  all of the circumstances that I have described more fully above  including his early plea of guilty  his partial co operation  and his invidious position  which I do not regard  and which he does not ask me to regard  as an excuse but as a circumstance in which the offending occurred   I am satisfied that he is a man who has done something which he knows was inappropriate and he is very unlikely to re offend  It would not be appropriate to sentence him to prison  Having regard to his means and the impact on him financially  the totality of the circumstances  including his criminality and the need for general deterrence  I am of opinion that I should allow the appeal   The appropriate penalty which I consider should be imposed is a   year good behaviour bond with a self surety in the sum of   conditional on Mr Vu paying a penalty of    He has indicated that he expects to be able to pay this by instalments of   per month commencing in November    I have had regard to the fact that the police acknowledge that such a penalty is one within the range properly

htmlfollowedMarkarian v R   HCA         ALR       ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed  the Court engages in a process known as instinctive synthesis  It is impossible to have regard to each of the matters which s  A  requires be taken into account separately or to assign to each of them a particular figure or discount applicable to the offender  having regard to the particular circumstances each subsection addresses  Rather  the Court has to approach the determination of a sentence by taking into account all of the matters that are relevant  including those to which s  A  refers  in addition to all other matters bearing on the sentence that will be imposed in all the circumstances of the offence or offences  In general  the sentencing court will reach a conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed after weighing all of the relevant factors  Markarian v R   HCA         ALR   at         HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ   Because sentencing is a matter involving both an application of the general rule to be found in the statute imposing the penalty for the offence which creates it  and an assessment of the individual culpability of the defendant upon whose plea or finding of guilt a court is adjudicating  no other case can be a precise precedent for the appropriate penalty  Nonetheless  the courts must have regard to imposing penalties that are transparent and consistent and which the community can regard as an appropriate punishment having regard to the penalty which the Parliament has seen fit to impose as the maximum in the particular case  The mere fact that there is a maximum is not  of course  the only criterion by which the court imposes an appropriate penalty distinguishedPontello v Ceselli     IRP   In Pontello v Ceselli     IRP   Wilcox J  on a guilty plea  sentenced an offender who had been knowingly concerned in making and possessing numerous illegal copies of video films for the purposes of commercial distribution  He had also been convicted and fined for offences under the Trade Marks Act    Cth  arising from the same circumstances  His Honour said   Ceselli   IPR at      It is  however  appropriate for me to emphasise that the statute does provide for a gaol term for contraventions of s   and  A   I am informed that  so far as counsel for the informant is aware  no person has yet been gaoled for a breach of those provisions  but the fact that a gaol term is provided by the legislation does indicate the seriousness with which the offences have been regarded by the legislature  It may well be that  in a serious case of multiple infringement of these provisions  it will be appropriate for a gaol sentence to be pronounced   The offender had made   copies of one title    of another out of a total of   pirate tapes that had been seized  He had elaborate recording equipment at his home which enabled him to make multiple copies of individual tapes  Again that is distinct from the present case  albeit the defendant there was a video shop proprietor   Nonetheless  as was said in   by Wilcox J in Ceselli   IPR at   and by Sheppard J in Giannotis   IPR at   the time must surely come in this country where custodial sentences are appropriate for offences involving sale or hire of counterfeit DVDs and similar works  There are  however  factors in this case which have inclined me to the opinion that that is not an appropriate penalty in this matter  as I will explain below discussedPontello v Giannotis     IPR   In a related case  Pontello v Giannotis     IPR   at   Sheppard J observed that there was no doubt that piracy in the video industry was rife and that it was something that was well known  He referred to Wilcox J s remarks quoted above and also said that there was no doubt that this species of crime is often difficult to detect  Sheppard J said that the legislature had obviously taken a serious view of the offences  referring to the amendments that had been made in   which provided for substantial increases in the penalties  Those penalties  I understand  obtained to the time of the present offences but have now been replaced by the sections to which I referred at the commencement of this judgment  As his Honour also noted   IPR at   the offence under s  A a  was a serious one  DVDs have largely replaced videos as a means of viewing films   Nonetheless  as was said in   by Wilcox J in Ceselli   IPR at   and by Sheppard J in Giannotis   IPR at   the time must surely come in this country where custodial sentences are appropriate for offences involving sale or hire of counterfeit DVDs and similar works  There are  however  factors in this case which have inclined me to the opinion that that is not an appropriate penalty in this matter  as I will explain below referred toR v Carter     Cr App R  S    A number of jurisdictions have regarded the conduct of those who manufacture  sell or hire counterfeit works such as DVDs as meriting imprisonment  For example  in R v Carter     Cr App R  S    the English Court of Appeal  Criminal Division dealt with a defendant who had been found in possession of over   infringing copies    blank video tapes and three video recorders  Lord Lane CJ  Kennedy and Jowitt JJ noted that a suspended sentence of nine months imprisonment had been imposed and said   Carter   Cr App R  S  at           T o make and distribute pirate copies of films is to steal from the true owner of the copyright  the property for which he has to expend money in order to possess it  It is an offence really of dishonesty      I agree  In R v Kemp     Cr App R  S    at   Russell LJ  Turner and Hooper JJ said     Offences of counterfeiting are offences which normally attract at least a short sentence of imprisonment  They are difficult  time consuming and expensive to detect  The owners of copyrights are entitled to be protected against their unlawful exploitation  They are entitled to have their commercial reputation protected against those who would seek unlawfully to damage it  distinguishedR v Duckett     Cr App R  S    And  in R v Duckett     Cr App R  S    at   Jowitt and Astill JJ sitting as the Court of Appeal  Criminal Division said     Infringement of copyright is widespread  It does  in an ethical sense  involve stealing other men s property  and in its cumulative effect is able to cause serious damage to legitimate commercial and proprietary interests  Although the applicant did not engage in this dishonest business in a substantial way  his activities and those of many like him contribute to the damage to which we have referred  A serious view is to be taken of the distribution by way of business and the recording for such distribution of pirated material which  if bought legitimately  would cost substantial sums of money   There  the appellant had been sentenced to   months imprisonment  in circumstances in which he actually manufactured illegal CD ROM disks and was a ring leader of seven defendants in a counterfeiting business  Mr Vu s criminality is not of that order   There are no other offences that are required or permitted to be taken into account referred toR v Kemp     Cr App R  S    A number of jurisdictions have regarded the conduct of those who manufacture  sell or hire counterfeit works such as DVDs as meriting imprisonment  For example  in R v Carter     Cr App R  S    the English Court of Appeal  Criminal Division dealt with a

NSWCCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCCA  html  I am of opinion Mr Vu was genuine in pleading guilty and that he promptly acknowledged that he had done something that was wrong  He has not made any attempt to seek to excuse himself from  or to evade  his responsibility for what he did  His statement to the Parole Service that he would pay whatever penalty the court imposed on him demonstrated that  I am quite satisfied that  in his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity  he was doing what a basically honest person who has made a stupid mistake and engaged in a series of foolish and dishonest criminal acts could be expected to do once the cold light of day had exposed him to a recognition of his own wrongdoing  As Howie J said giving the reasons of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Sutton     MVR     NSWCCA   at        This Court has pointed out  time and time again  that the strength of the Crown case is an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty  The strength of the Crown case is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse and what weight should be given to that factor in determining the appropriate sentence   I am of opinion that this was a genuine guilty plea which Mr Vu made at the first available opportunity  Indeed  had Mr Vu been charged shortly after the first visits of the Federation officers  I am sure that his criminal conduct would have ceased then  although I cannot  and do not  take that into account  I reject the police s submission that I should give less than full weight to the plea of guilty   Mr Vu did co operate with the authorities to a degree  although  as the police pointed out  he made only admissions to hiring out copyright infringing DVDs and not to selling them to the Federation officers  It is not suggested that he concealed or hid any of the material which implicated him in his guilt for the offences  He readily made admissions relating to having purchased the counterfeit DVDs  He also pointed out to the police  when they executed the search warrant  where the counterfeit DVDs were and made admissions as to hiring them out  Although his co operation was perhaps not as fulsome as his evidence has been today or his admissions to his Honour were  I find that he has co operated to a significant degree with the authorities  There was evidence of some sales to the Federation officers  But  Mr Vu did not sell the counterfeits on any significant scale  Rather  the sales occurred infrequently from his stock of DVDs used primarily for the hire business   Most significantly I must have regard to the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on Mr Vu  I am satisfied that Mr Vu knows he must be punished  The likelihood that he would re offend is minimal to non existent   I am satisfied that the sentence I am to impose will adequately punish Mr Vu for his offences  In that regard I must have  as the police reminds me  regard to the strength of the police s case  the objective gravity of the offences  the need for general deterrence and the need for strong subjective deterrence  As I have said  the latter consideration is one which Mr Vu had accepted himself will be worked on him by a sentence of any kind   Mr Vu has argued that the effect of imprisoning him even on weekend detention would be such as to work a very adverse result on his family  No doubt some embarrassment would be caused to him in having to explain to his children what he had done and why he was to spend time in gaol  His sense of shame at having to do this would be significant and would cause him considerable embarrassment  Nonetheless  the authorities make it clear that in approaching an assessment of the effect on Mr Vu s family and dependents I must interpret s  A p  by having regard to whether these circumstances are exceptional  see R v Hinton   NSWCCA         A Crim R   at     per Howie J with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed  I am not satisfied that the matters on which Mr Vu relies are exceptional
