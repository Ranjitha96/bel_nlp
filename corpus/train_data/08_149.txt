NBMB v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAbebe v Commonwealth   HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Again  considerable reservation must be expressed with too readily drawing conclusions based upon individual exchanges recorded in a transcript  Tribunal members must be free to control their own procedures and to confine  when appropriate  evidence being given  Further  given the importance of the issues being addressed by the Tribunal  it must be recognised that it may not only be the applicant in those proceedings who may experience distress but also Tribunal members themselves may understandably exhibit a degree of frustration  As noted by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Abebe v Commonwealth   HCA       CLR   at            the fact that an applicant for refugee status may yield to temptation to embroider an account of his or her history is hardly surprising  It is necessary always to bear in mind that an applicant for refugee status is  on one view of events  engaged in an often desperate battle for freedom  if not life itself  But those difficulties are to be confronted by the Tribunal in the execution of its tasks  not by a court that is asked to review the way in which the Tribunal reached its decision   It is of importance that a party to administrative proceedings is confident that the proceedings have been conducted fairly  A comment to   wind it up   undermines that confidence  So  too  does another exchange when a Tribunal member observed    Do I have to squeeze information from you        Not only could the First Appellant s confidence in the impartiality of the proceedings have been undermined by such exchanges  the fair minded observer would also be similarly concerned  Even though it may be accepted that a Tribunal member  in the context of an inquisitorial review  may well frame questions differently to the manner in which questions may be asked by counsel or judges in judicial proceedings  the manner in which these questions    and other questions    were pursued was inappropriate  It is of obvious importance that a Tribunal member remains  and is seen to remain  measured in the manner in which a hearing proceeds and is not seen to rush questions and answers such that an informed observer may justifiably form a view that the Tribunal is not carefully seeking and considering the evidence being adduced in a measured and careful manner consideredApplicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural

to discharge its functions in a manner both free from bias and in a manner which is seen to be free from bias  The principles to be applied when considering an allegation as to apprehended bias are clear  difficulty  however  is frequently encountered in the application of those principles to the facts in issue  In NADH v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       ALR   Allsop J  with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed  summarised the general test as follows      The general test for apprehended bias is whether the relevant circumstances are such that a fair minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the decision maker might not bring or have brought an impartial mind to bear on the decision      His Honour thereafter went on to consider the approach to be adopted when the decision maker was an administrative tribunal such as the Refugee Review Tribunal  His Honour continued      To identify the obligation of the tribunal  and the content of the necessary apprehension in the circumstances here  a number of matters need be recognised  First  while it is necessary to demonstrate that the circumstances are such as would give rise to the relevant apprehension  the apprehension itself is not as to the fact or likelihood of a lack of impartiality  but of a possibility  real and not remote  thereof       Second  the identity  nature and function of the decision maker are important influences on the content of the requirement to conduct the relevant task with the observance of procedural fairness by not being tainted by the appearance of disqualifying bias       Third  the place of a decision maker such as the tribunal here should be recognised as different from a judge in open court     The tribunal does not administer public justice  The elements which affect the public confidence in the adjudication of disputes by an independent and impartial arm of government  in the broad sense  and which may be seen to inform what might be said to be freestanding norms of conduct and behaviour by judges conducting public hearings are not necessarily as easily transposable as strict obligations of administrative decision makers acting in private  The tribunal here must investigate the facts for itself unaided by counsel presenting the parties  cases  to the degree and extent it thinks appropriate  The tribunal which has to reach a state of satisfaction may want to test and probe a recounted history  It may have particular matters troubling it for resolution  which require questioning and expressions of doubt which are entirely appropriate  but which if undertaken or said by a judge in open court in adversary litigation might give rise to an apprehension of a lack of impartiality     At least in the absence of the identification of some prejudice or interest in the tribunal  for a complaint of apprehended bias based on the conduct of the tribunal in its procedure and the dealing with material before it in its reasons to be meaningful  it must carry with it an assertion of the apprehension of a possibility of predisposition  That is  the predisposition of the tribunal towards a result  other than a result reached by an evaluation of the material before it in a fair way with a mind that was open to persuasion in favour of the person in question  Unless that be demonstrated  it is hard to see how a decision maker has failed to conform to standards of procedural fairness  Such an approach accords with the need for neutral and fair decision making  without imposing on decision makers in an administrative context the burden of behaving at all times as would a judge in public in the deployment of judicial power     The enquiry is not directed to the personal thought processes of the decision maker  It is directed to his or her conduct  objectified  through the prism of what a fair minded and informed observer would reasonably apprehend     It goes without saying that a conclusion  from all the materials  including the decision and the reasons for decision  that a fair minded informed observer would reasonably apprehend a lack of impartiality in the sense discussed  does not carry with it the conclusion that there was a lack of impartiality   It is considered that the Tribunal in the present proceedings as reconstituted conducted its review in such a manner as to attract a reasonable apprehension of bias  It was accepted by the Respondent Minister that if that conclusion was reached  the Tribunal s decision was vitiated by jurisdictional error   This conclusion is reached upon the basis of a review of the transcript of the proceedings before the Tribunal as reconstituted  The transcript records a number of exchanges soundly basing a conclusion as to apprehended bias   It is considered that there is in the present proceedings a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal exhibited a   predisposition     towards a result  other than a result reached by an evaluation of the material before it in a fair way with a mind that was open to persuasion in favour of the person in question   NADH v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   supra   at     This conclusion is only reinforced by the refusal of the Tribunal to adjourn or postpone its hearing to enable a witness to be called on behalf of the First Appellant  a Pastor David Boyd  This witness  it is understood  was proposed to be called to give evidence as to the First Appellant s   Christian commitment and also the situation for Christians in Nepal    The request for the adjournment was made on   July   and dates provided as to the time when he would be unavailable to attend  The Tribunal unquestionably has a discretionary power to adjourn proceedings  Migration Act    Cth  s  b   Decisions as to whether or not hearings should be adjourned are largely within the discretion of administrative decision makers  Relevant to the exercise of that discretion by the Tribunal in the present context is the legislative direction that it must conduct its review in a manner which   is fair  just  economical  informal and quick    Procedural decisions of tribunals such as the Refugee Review Tribunal should not be lightly disturbed  Of present concern is not the decision in fact made to refuse to adjourn the proceedings  of present concern is that the refusal to do so only goes to reinforce an apprehension as to a lack of impartiality  Of itself  the refusal to adjourn the proceedings may have assumed little relevance  in context  however  it is yet a further factual basis upon which an informed bystander may question the impartiality of the Tribunal  The evidence sought to be called was not of marginal relevance but a matter of central relevance to the issues sought to be pursued by the Appellants   A review of the transcript also provides a basis for an informed observer concluding that the Tribunal was becoming anxious to confine the explanation being provided by the First Appellant or indeed concerned as to the manner in which it was approaching its own task  Thus  for example  at one point the Tribunal was questioning the First Appellant as to why she did not seek an explanation from her migration agent and her statement that   there was no point in making an application    The following exchange thereafter took place    MR HARDY  But you didn t ask him why   INTERPRETER  He just told me that         MR HARDY  But you didn t ask him why  So did this conversation take place  Because this is about your life and death here  and you didn t ask him why  INTERPRETER  What I told why I couldn t get protection  because he said to me that in because no one can get it because your case will fail  If you apply to the skilled migration you ve got right age and I don t I found a number on my point that can I can get from my age because of my cooking skill  and if I ve got one sponsorer it will be easy for you to get permanent resident here  So you don t need to apply for protection visa   After that I came to Lockman  I told him  because I was advised that to apply for migration  skilled migration  if I applied for a refugee application it would be unsuccessful  After that  then  we went again to understand further and we went  four people  Lina  Lockman  my husband and myself  We asked and we asked and we asked to apply for protection but again we were advised that not to apply for because of unsuccessful  Then I was advised that he needed one sponsor that he could help my case  After that we came back home  He called me on the phone I mean  he phoned me and then talk about that  that I found a sponsor to help you  and asked to go to Parramatta  that he had made an appointment to see the man  and then there is a restaurant that you can go to a restaurant where we met him   After that  Lockman took me over there  Then we talk about it and he said yes  The owner of the restaurant agreed that he could help me  After that  we left Pawar  After that  when we understood that he said that we already applied  he had already applied  and you could and you had been successful  It s been applied  And  indistinct  you could go  and you could return within month  At that time  Lockman Limbu was  indistinct    After that  my husband went  After two or three weeks after he left the application was rejected but the Pawar didn t tell us  and visa was not in my passport at that time and it was going to be expired  When I went in they said to me that I have the letter  it is rejected  and the letter there was only two days left  and what you have to do  and he told me that whatever he could  do it   MR HARDY  Can you wind up this a little bit soon  Yes  go on    The following exchange also took place    MR HARDY  No  I can t do anything with that  No  no  I can t do anything with that  How can it be that they re in gaol and it s not on the record  Where does your investigation come from  INTERPRETER  When I heard the can I speak some I would like the applicant to repeat the because it s very long  so         MR HARDY  Yes   INTERPRETER        I didn t understand to yes   MR HARDY  You re speaking very  very fast  okay  Maybe I am too  Yes  But also  the interpreter is  So it might have become it might have just got a little bit jammed  yes

Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     Kiefel  Weinberg and Stone JJ summarised the approach to be pursued as follows      In our view  the application for leave to rely upon the sole ground of appeal now raised should be refused  Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so         In Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR   Gibbs CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Dawson JJ observed  in their joint judgment  at    It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial  If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court  tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish         The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters  The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below  but which clearly has merit  is advanced  and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated  Where  however  there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point  and it seems to be of doubtful merit  leave should generally be refused  In our view  the proposed ground of appeal has no merit  There is no justification  therefore  for permitting it to be raised for the first time before this Court     In giving further consideration to the approach to be pursued  in NAJT v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       FCR   at   Madgwick J  with whom Conti J agreed  referred to these comments of Kiefel  Weinberg and Stone JJ and continued        Thus  relevant questions include        Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success    Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below    How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved    What is at stake in the case for the appellant    Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand    Is there any actual prejudice  not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly  to the respondent    If so  can it be justly and practicably cured    If not  where  in all the circumstances  do the interests of justice lie   In the present statutory context it has  not surprisingly  been further concluded that       the serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may be taken into account in determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice for leave to be granted where the appellant has been legally represented at all times  SZEPN v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   per Branson J   It is not understood that there was any dispute as to the principles to be applied when considering whether to grant or refuse leave    the dispute was as to the application of the principles to the facts now before the Court   In the present appeal there is no satisfactory explanation as to why the ground was not pursued before the Federal Magistrate  The now Appellants were represented in that Court  The explanation now provided to this Court
