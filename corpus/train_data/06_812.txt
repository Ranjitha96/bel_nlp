any prejudice to the respondent    whether the applicant has an arguable case   As I have already noted in my judgment  the applicant filed his application more than six months after the Notice of Termination was issued by HREOC pursuant to s  PH    The applicant in his application did not explain the delay in filing  However  there appears to have been relevant correspondence between the applicant and the Federal Court Registry  This correspondence was annexed to the HREOC claim filed   January   and constituted      a copy of a letter written by the applicant to the Federal Court Registry in Brisbane dated   July   stamped as received by the Registry on   July    In that letter the applicant stated that he wished to make a complaint concerning the matter  and that he believed that he had  not been dealt with by another statuary  sic  authority   The applicant in the letter stated that he enclosed the Notice of Termination issued by HREOC    a letter from Deputy District Registrar Reynolds of the Federal Court to the applicant  dated   July   which informed the applicant that his correspondence was insufficient to commence proceedings in the Federal Court  and stating that it enclosed a package that had been prepared in the registry for the assistance of self represented litigants who wished to commence Human Rights proceedings  In that letter the Deputy District Registrar invited the applicant to contact her if he had any queries    a letter from the applicant to the Deputy District Registrar dated   September   stamped as received by the Federal Court Registry on   October    In this letter the applicant acknowledged that there was a   day limit on making an application to the Federal Court under s  PO  and acknowledged that the correspondence he had sent was insufficient at the time to commence proceedings  In the letter he stated that his financial situation was extremely difficult and that he needed time to gather sufficient funds to proceed the matter with the assistance of a lawyer  He concluded the letter by asking       Could you please consider my request  citedForbes v Australian Federal Police  Commonwealth of Australia

Section   DD Act appears irrelevant  as that subsection deals only with discrimination in the context of offering employment  which was not the case here  As I noted earlier in this judgment however  s   deals with discrimination against existing employees on the ground of the employee s disability     a  in the terms or conditions of employment that the employer affords the employee  or    b  by denying the employee access  or limiting the employee s access  to opportunities for promotion  transfer or training  or to any other benefits associated with employment  or    c  by dismissing the employee  or    d  by subjecting the employee to any other detriment   In his application  the applicant has made reference to     a  the termination of his employment by the respondent  and  b  the circumstance that   during the process of the investigation made by Qantas Airlines  I was allowed under the EBA to be offered the redundancy package at the time  That was not the case  pending the outcome from the investigation    Accordingly  the applicant s substantive claim could potentially fall within the terms of par  c  in relation to the termination of his employment  or par  b  in the context of his claim that he has not received a redundancy package   The DD Act prohibits two types of discrimination disability discrimination  s   and indirect disability discrimination  s    The applicant has specifically relied on s   in his application before me  note also the TS p   ll     and has not relied on s   although HREOC also considered his complaint in the context of s   citedWaters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As observed by Brennan J in Waters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR   at   in considering the concept of reasonableness in a similar legislative provision     It is not possible to determine reasonableness in the abstract  it must be determined by reference to the activity or transaction in which the putative discriminator is engaged  Provided the purpose of the activity or transaction is not to discriminate on impermissible grounds  the reasonableness of a requirement or condition depends on whether it is reasonable to impose the requirement or condition in order to perform the activity or complete the transaction  There are two aspects to this criterion of reasonableness  first  whether the imposition of the condition is appropriate and adapted to the performance of the activity or the completion of the transaction  second  whether the activity could be performed or the transaction completed without imposing a requirement or condition that is discriminatory   or that is as discriminatory as the requirement or condition imposed  These are questions of fact and degree  Effectiveness  efficiency and convenience in performing the activity or completing the transaction and the cost of not imposing the discriminatory requirement or condition or of substituting another requirement or condition are relevant factors in considering what is reasonable   In the absence of submissions by the applicant  it is difficult to understand how the Barplus procedures  which required account of documents and monies received by flight attendants during the performance of their duties  were other than a reasonable requirement in the circumstances   Accordingly in my view there is no merit in the applicant s submissions that he has been the subject of unlawful discrimination within the meaning of the DD Act  citedWedesweiller v Cole     ALR   The discretion of the Court conferred by the words  or within such further time as the court concerned allows  appearing in s  PO  HREOC Act is similar to the discretion given to the Court in s   Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth    ADJR Act    Principles applicable to the exercise of the discretion under s  PO  were described by McInnis FM in Phillips v Australian Girls Choir   FMCA     based in turn on principles formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen     FCR   at   in relation to s  ADJR Act   These considerations articulated in Phillips have been applied in a number of Federal Court decisions including Pham   Ingram Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited   FCA    Jacobsen J  and Ingram Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited   FCA    Cowdroy J  and are relevant in the case before me  The principles listed by McInnis FM are as follows       There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made  Special circumstances need not be shown  but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so  The  prescribed period  of   days is not to be ignored   Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission     ALR   at       It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained   Lucic v Nolan     ALR   at    It is not a precondition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given  It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered  even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential precondition   Comcare v A Hearn     FCR   and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal     VR   at       Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay  It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised  see Doyle v Chief of Staff     ALR   at       Any prejudice to the respondent  including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay  is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension  see Doyle at       The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension  see Lucic at       The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted  see Lucic at       Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of exercise of the court s discretion  see Wedesweiller v Cole     ALR
