not be now resolved  See also  Miller v Wertheim   FCA   referred toCatto v Hampton Australia Ltd  In Liq    SASC  http www austlii edu au au cases sa SASC  htmlThat part of the dispute which presently manifests itself is an application by the Trustee to review a decision of a Deputy District Registrar of this Court  On   June   Deputy District Registrar Cujes made orders that         The full taxation proceed on the basis there exists a valid retainer agreement between the First Respondent  Mr Rickus  and his legal representatives for the purposes of the proceedings             The First Respondent is granted leave  pursuant to Order   sub rule   of the Federal Court Rules   to file and serve an amended bill of costs       Those orders were accompanied by a letter from the Deputy District Registrar also dated   June   to the solicitors for both the Trustee and Mr Rickus  The letter recorded  in part  what the Deputy District Registrar referred to as her   preliminary oral decision     in respect of     the validity of   a written retainer as between Mr Rickus and his legal advisers  The letter helpfully recorded a finding that   the retainer between Mr Rickus and his lawyers was partly oral  partly written and or partly to be implied by conduct    Reference was made by the Deputy District Registrar to s   of the Legal Practitioners Act    SA  and to a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Catto v Hampton Australia Ltd  In Liq    SASC    That decision was relied upon as authority for the proposition that   a successful litigant is entitled to recover from the other party amounts paid by the former in connection with the litigation  notwithstanding the unenforceability of any agreement between the litigant and solicitor       The letter concluded      I would continue to strongly urge the parties to attend a confidential conference or mediation with a view to  at the very least  narrowing and refining the issues in dispute  but hopefully reaching settlement on a commercial basis  The Trustee s application for review invokes O   r   of the Federal Court Rules which provides as follows      Every taxation of costs and every decision of a taxing officer shall be subject to review by a Judge  In summary form  the Trustee seeks to contend that  the Deputy District Registrar s decision is beyond power  and is  in any event wrong as a matter of law   Counsel for Mr Rickus contends that referred toMiller v Wertheim   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt may presently be assumed
