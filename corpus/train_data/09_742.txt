Australian Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Coroneo     SR NSW      Jordan CJ stated  at     A fixture is a thing once a chattel which has become in law land through having been fixed to land  The question whether a chattel has become a fixture depends upon whether it has been fixed to land  and if so for what purpose   If a chattel is actually fixed to land to any extent  by any means other than its own weight  then prima facie it is a fixture  and the burden of proof is upon anyone who asserts that it is not  if it is not otherwise fixed but is kept in position by its own weight  then prima facie it is not a fixture  and the burden of proof is on anyone who asserts that it is  Holland v Hodgson   LR   CP   at     My emphasis referred toNH Dunn Pty Ltd v LM Ericsson Pty Ltd     BPR

question that was referred to by Young CJ in Eq  as Young JA then was  in Eye Corp Australia Pty Ltd v Goliath Investments Pty Ltd     BPR       NSWSC   at      His Honour posed the question as being which of two theories is correct  the theory that tenants  fixtures never become part of the freehold  his Honour referred to Mowats v Hudson     LT     and the theory that they do but are subject to the tenant s right to detach them and thereby make them chattels again  his Honour referred to Horwitch v Symond     LT    affirmed by the Court of Appeal     LJKB   citedLees   Leech Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR  In Lees   Leech Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR     Hill J said  at        When it is said that an item is a  tenants  fixture  all that is meant is that the tenant has a right to remove the item at the expiration of the term of the lease or a reasonable time thereafter  cf D Arcy v Burelli Investments Pty Ltd     NSWLR    If the item in question were not a fixture  a fortiori it would belong to the tenant and could be removed by the tenant at any time  Thus  the whole concept of tenants  fixtures assumes that the items in question have become fixtures but that the tenant has a right in equity in the land  co extensive with the right of the tenant to come upon the land after the expiration of the lease and remove the fixture  The expression  tenants  fixtures  is apt to mislead unless adequately explained  The tenant does not own the freehold and a fixture does not belong to the tenant by virtue of being part of the freehold  Rather  fixtures are the property of the owner of the land  but in the case of  tenants  fixtures  they are subject to the tenant s right to remove them during the term of the lease or within a reasonable time thereafter and so convert them back into chattels  Under the general law  for the purposes of the limited exception to the quicquid plantatur maxim in favour of tenants  fixtures  the latter are things installed by a tenant for trade  domestic or ornamental purposes  If it matters  the fixtures with which I am concerned were all installed by NFD for the purpose of its trade  It may not matter because the right of removal is regulated by the Sublease which speaks generally of NFD s fixtures without reference to their purpose  In any event  so far as the evidence reveals  there were no fixtures installed by NFD for any purpose other than trade referred toMowats v Hudson     LT  This submission raises indirectly a question that was referred to by Young CJ in Eq  as Young JA then was

be  vis a vis LDC  a deemed removal by Vopak  a sale  and a deemed reinstallation by Vopak or by the Buyer of NFD s fixtures  Deemed removal  or at least an ignoring of  tenants  fixtures is not

Commissioner of Stamp Duties   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlNorth Shore Gas Co Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties   HCA         CLR     North Shore Gas Co   concerned the mains and service pipes of a gas company that were laid in streets and other convenient places in the area where the company supplied gas  All members of the High Court agreed that they were fixtures and were not within a proviso in the Second Schedule to the Stamp Duties Act    NSW  that exempted from stamp duty an agreement for the sale of  goods  wares or merchandise   This was so notwithstanding that under the gas company s Act of Parliament the mains and pipes remained the property of the company which was given express power to remove  alter  repair  replace or relay them  Dixon J  as the Chief Justice then was  said  at       The question for decision is  I think  whether the pipes and mains  considered as in situ and as part of such an undertaking  have no longer the quality of chattels personal  It must be steadily borne in mind that the agreement relates to the undertaking as a going concern  It contemplates a transfer of the mains and services as they lie in the ground  not as separate or detachable articles  but as an integral part of an undivided plant or system and actually in use      Ordinarily when the chattel elements by which a permanent system or apparatus is formed are assembled and embedded in the soil or established as part of a building they lose their independent nature and for the purpose of the law take on the character of land  Thus  if the land in which the mains were laid had belonged to the company for an estate in fee simple or for any less estate or interest and the company had not acted under its special statutory powers  the mains until removed would have formed part of the realty          The primary consequence of so fixing such things in the soil that they are treated as forming part of it is that ownership of the articles follows ownership of the land  Though removable tenants  fixtures may during the term be detached and become chattels belonging to the tenant  yet the better opinion appears to be that unless and until the tenant exercises his right of removal they form part of the realty    and for this reason  subject to the exercise of the tenant s right to convert them again into chattels  pass with the land  Whether personal property has become part of real property by virtue of being a fixture is not a matter of the subjective intention of the affixer  If we must speak in terms of intention  the only relevant intention is one that is objectively  presumed  from the manner  degree and object of affixation citedRe Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

edu au au cases vic VSCA  htmlIn Vopak Terminals Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue   VSCA         VR     it was decided for Victorian stamp duty purposes that certain petroleum storage tanks and other structures on leased premises were not fixtures  The decision  however  turned upon s   of the Landlord and Tenant Act    Vic  which provided that fixtures erected for any purpose by a tenant at his own cost and expense were to be the property of the tenant  and removable by him  It was held that this provision produced the result that eight storage tanks and other structures which  it was common ground  were fixtures under general law principles  were deprived of that characterisation by the statutory provision  The case is distinguishable as turning on the statutory provision
