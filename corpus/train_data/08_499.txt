SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAttorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe first ground of appeal is a restatement of the first ground for judicial review before the Federal Magistrate  It is  as the Federal Magistrate rightly pointed out  no more than a claim to have the Court perform a merits review of the Tribunal s finding  Her Honour dealt extensively with this ground in her reasons  An application for a judicial review of an administrative decision does not give rise to a merits review of the decision  Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR   at    The purpose of the review is to determine whether the Tribunal has exercised its power in accordance with its obligations and  in particular  without jurisdictional error  The Federal Magistrates Court and this Court has limited jurisdiction to determine whether the Tribunal has made jurisdictional error  If no jurisdictional error is shown  then the Tribunal s decision cannot be quashed  It is not entirely clear what is meant by the second ground of appeal  Her Honour said in her reasons that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to require the Tribunal to write to the applicant pursuant to the provisions of s  A requiring particular documentary evidence to be adduced  That clearly was right  She also said that if the Tribunal was of the opinion that there was a lack of evidence before the Tribunal  that was not information for the purposes of s  A  That also is clearly right  The second ground must be dismissed  It is also not entirely clear what is meant by the third ground  although an examination of her Honour s reasons does assist  It was put to her Honour as part of the third ground in support of the application for judicial review that the Tribunal had erred in questioning why it was that the appellant husband was not subject to further attacks after the home invasion  The Federal Magistrate rejected the argument that such an approach amounted to a consideration of a hypothetical situation or hypothetical issues  The Tribunal gave consideration to the issue which it identified in considering whether or not the appellant husband s account was credible  It was not a hypothetical issue but it was a reason in the Tribunal s opinion why the appellant husband s account could not be accepted  In my opinion  none of the grounds of appeal have been made out and the appeal must be dismissed  The appellants must pay the respondent s costs    I certify that the preceding sixty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander    Associate Dated    April   Counsel for

htmlcitedCoulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR     the majority said at       It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial  If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instances to the appellate court  tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish  The appellate process is to correct error  If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal  the appeal court will become de facto the primary court  That is undesirable  It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court  If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court  the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed  That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court s point of view  Moreover  to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court  If new grounds are advanced on appeal  it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court  In VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     the Court said that leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the trial judge should only be granted  if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so   After referring to the dicta in Coulton v Holcombe   HCA       CLR     the Court said that the Court may grant leave if the point which has not been raised in the Court below has merit and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting the point to be ventilated citedGomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlHowever  the Full Court of this Court has recognised that a residual discretion resides in this Court to allow a party to advance a ground of appeal not advanced before the Court from which the appeal is brought where it is in the interests of justice to do so  Iyer   FCA    In Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         ALR     the Full Court adopted the test propounded by the High Court in appeals to that Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA       ALR   at   that a party is bound by the conduct of the

htmlOf course  appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive  Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA    It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party s claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law  That said  however  it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court  H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         ALD

Multicultural Affairs   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlRarely will the Minister in an appeal to this Court from a migration judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court be able to point to any prejudice of the conventional kind  That cannot be a reason to allow a party to raise issues not raised in the Court below  In Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         ALR     Gyles J said at       In my opinion  it is wrong to analyse a question which arises here as requiring a balancing of prejudice  Departure from the proper role of appeal in the court system is not simply a discretionary procedural decision  Furthermore  in public law matters like this  it can always be said that no actual prejudice apart from costs is suffered by the respondent compared with the prejudice to the appellant  It can easily be overlooked that there is a significant public interest in the timely and effective disposal of litigation  This aspect has particular force in this area of public law  where delays in dealing with applications for protection visas are obviously to be avoided if possible  In the present case  there was no bona fide ground of appeal from the primary decision and the litigation should have ended at that point more than   months ago  The Minister has a legitimate interest in the timely disposal of applications for protection visas  There are other public interests  however  to which regard should be had  There are good reasons why this Court should not be made de facto the Court of original jurisdiction when sitting on appeal  Otherwise its role as an intermediate Court of Appeal will be undermined  The High Court should not be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from decisions of this Court which have not been reviewed  The respondent conceded that I needed to consider whether any of the grounds had any merit before determining whether or not I should allow the application to amend  The concession was rightly made having regard to the decisions of this Court and  in particular  VUAX   FCAFC    Adopting that procedure  however  means that in every case where there is an application to raise a ground not previously raised in the Court below  the party seeking to have the ground agitated will by reason of the application itself require the Court to consider the ground  It is a curious result when the Court would otherwise discourage such applications but a result which arises because the Court s overriding duty is to do justice  The reason for the power to allow a party to raise a ground on appeal for the first time is to do justice citedMetwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe High Court has made it plain that  ordinarily  a party is confined in its grounds of appeal to matters which have been raised in the Court below  The High Court said in Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR   at       It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case  Except in the most exceptional circumstances  it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party  after a case has been decided against him  to raise a new argument which  whether deliberately or by inadvertence  he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so  However  the Full Court of this Court has recognised that a residual discretion resides in this Court to allow a party to advance a ground of appeal not advanced before the Court from which the appeal is brought where it is in the interests of justice to do so  Iyer   FCA    In Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         ALR     the Full Court adopted the test propounded by the High Court in
