Bennett J in Croker  contended that the Notice of Appeal had such limited prospects of success as to be in itself a persuasive reason why security should be ordered   The Notice of Appeal as filed sets forth some   grounds of appeal  Ms Lawrance was invited on   March   to consider whether she wished to pursue all of those grounds or whether she wished to narrow or confine her appeal  On   March   she adhered to the grounds set forth   An appellant is of course entitled to raise for resolution such grounds of appeal as may properly emerge from the decision the subject of appeal  For the

of the case    A determination as to whether security should be awarded and  if so  the quantum of such security  is essentially one of risk management between the parties having regard to their legitimate interests  East Grace Corp v Xing   FCA   at   per French J   The quantification of any order for security is   certainly not an exact science   East Grace Corp v Xing   FCA   at   per French J   Relevant to any quantification is the anticipated duration of an appeal  the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the extent to which the preparation of written submissions would facilitate the expeditious resolution of the appeal  The fact is that the Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court sets forth some     grounds of appeal    A review of those grounds only supports a conclusion that the appeal would most probably take two days  if not more  It is  perhaps  inevitable that an unrepresented appellant may take longer to develop arguments and submissions than a party represented by experienced counsel  The hearing of the present Motions seeking security was heard over a two day period   The more wide ranging the challenge to a decision on appeal  however  the greater may be the reluctance to deny to those parties who have already vindicated their position at first instance the protection of an order for security  The more confined the grounds which an appellant may wish to pursue  the less persuasive may be the consideration that an appellant is   dragging his opponent from one Court to another   and seeking to re agitate some  if not all  of the grievances resolved at first instance consideredFletcher v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Ms Lawrance  however  has already had the opportunity to have her claims litigated and has lost  Although she is entitled to prosecute her appeal in this Court  different considerations apply when security for costs is ordered in respect to an appeal  Tait v Bindal People   FCA    Spender J there outlined the principles to be applied as follows      The position in relation to security for costs in the present matter is governed by s  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   S  provides that security is to be of such amount and given at such time and in such manner and form as the Court or Judge directs  As to whether security for costs should be ordered  Cowell v Taylor     Ch D   at   a case of more than   years ago  sets out the fundamental principle   The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant  that  from time immemorial  has been the rule at common law  There is an exception in the case of appeals  but there the appellant has had the benefit of a decision by one of Her Majesty s Courts  and so an insolvent party is not excluded from the Courts  but only prevented  if he cannot find security  from dragging his opponent from one Court to another      What that passage demonstrates is that there is a difference in principle in relation to the ordering of security for costs in a first instance matter and the ordering  or the consideration of the ordering  of security for costs where one is at the appellate level  The difference is that  at the appellant level  there has already been a determination adverse to the person against whom security for costs is sought and  if it be shown that there is a substantial risk that even if successful the respondent to the application for leave to appeal  or to an appeal  will be deprived of his costs  such an outcome would clearly be unjust     In a sense  it would be giving to a person who has been on the receiving end so to speak of a determination by the courts a free hit at great cost to the other party in the appeal proceedings  That consideration  it seems to me  is also reinforced by the judgment of Gummow J in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Anor   FCA     unreported   September    That case involved appeals against extradition with penal consequences  Such consequences were clearly very relevant considerations  but discretionary reasons moved the Court not to order  Such discretionary considerations  which were particularly noted by Gummow J  included the delay between the filing of the papers and the bringing of the applications for security  His Honour referred to a particular circumstance which is relevant here  and that is that the applicant for security has a judgment in its favour  There was a reference by Gummow J to Bethune v Porteous     VLR     again an old case  In that case  Hood J said  at    the reason underlying the numerous and varying cases in which appellants have been ordered to give security will be found in the injustice to a successful litigant that may be caused if he be compelled to contest the matter for a second time without a probability of obtaining his costs if ultimately successful   That really is the fundamental question of justice behind my decision to order security for costs    See also  Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at     Upton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Pty Ltd   FCA   at    followedFreeman v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  By reason of her impecuniosity  there is considered to be a real risk that any costs order which may ultimately be made against Ms

any outstanding costs orders which remain unsatisfied  Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd   FCA   at     Ms Lawrance has not paid the costs ordered to be paid by the Federal Magistrate  including not only the orders as to costs in favour of the present Respondents  but also orders as to costs made by the Federal Magistrate against Ms Lawrance in favour of persons not parties to the proceedings before that Court  Those costs orders included  for example  an order that Ms Lawrance pay the costs incurred by the Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Fox in relation to the unsuccessful application for their joinder as parties to the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings  A like order for costs was made against Ms Lawrance in favour of Dr Margaret Pickles in relation to an unsuccessful

citedLawrance v Commonwealth   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Some of these grounds  although not all  it should be noted  have been previously considered in this Court  Thus in Lawrance v Commonwealth   FCA   leave to appeal was sought in respect to a refusal to join the Guardianship Tribunal and to challenge rulings as to the admissibility of evidence  Leave to appeal was refused  In refusing leave  Buchanan J conducted a detailed review of the proceedings to date and concluded in part as follows          In any event she has not made out a sufficient case of arguable error with respect to any of the rulings which she desires to challenge if leave to appeal is given          It will be seen that one basis for refusing leave to amend the application  or to join the Guardianship Tribunal  was that such matters are beyond the jurisdiction of the FMCA by reason of s  PO of the HREOC Act  Another was that there was no material to suggest the existence of orders or instruments of the kind which Ms Lawrance sought to have revoked  Nothing has been advanced in support of the application for leave to appeal which satisfactorily addresses the foundation for these rulings or calls their correctness into question  At the hearing before me Ms Lawrance confirmed that the Guardianship Tribunal was not referred to anywhere in the material she put before HREOC in connection with her terminated complaint and she did not know of the existence of any orders by the Guardianship Tribunal relating to her or whether the Guardianship Tribunal had given any consideration at any time to her circumstances  Her desire to seek any relief against the Guardianship Tribunal  or in relation to its orders  must be seen as speculative and clearly outside the scope of her terminated complaint  There is no prospect an appeal in relation to this issue could succeed          The Federal Magistrate also excluded details of the conduct of numerous persons other than the personal respondents relating to matters which he had earlier ruled  on   November     Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia   Ors   FMCA     were outside the scope of the matters before him and outside the scope of the FMCA s jurisdiction as granted by s  PO of the HREOC Act  He stated that  t he applicant s evidence of these matters is therefore irrelevant and inadmissible insofar as she continues to pursue complaints which I had found not to be within jurisdiction   He indicated that he would have excluded the evidence upon discretionary grounds in any event     No matter of any substance has been advanced in support of the application for leave to appeal so far as those rulings are concerned  That circumstance alone dictates rejection of the application so far as it concerns rulings on evidence  There are other obstacles also     No submission has been advanced by the Respondents that the further pursuit of those issues which have been previously considered by Buchanan J amounts to an abuse of process  But it is considered that no reason has now been advanced by Ms Lawrance to reach any different conclusion to that reached by Buchanan J  The one reason advanced by Ms Lawrance as to why weight should not be given to the conclusions of Buchanan J was the contention that before his Honour the question as to whether there had been an error in the identification of the ambit of the complaint was not put in issue  This was one of the   fundamental questions of law   which it is contended was resolved erroneously by the Federal Magistrate   Insofar as Ms Lawrance contends that her Grounds of Appeal raise fundamental questions of law  she contends that the Federal Magistrate erred in both   i  the manner in which his Honour resolved the subject of the complaint made to the Commission  that error being as to the persons the subject of complaint and the period of time during which the conduct complained of occurred  and    ii    describing the comparator for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act   as  any unimpaired litigant       The former error  she contended  underlay the Federal Magistrate s rulings   inter alia   as to discovery and admissibility of evidence   Such Grounds of Appeal as seek to raise these contentions  it is considered  do not have any real prospects of success   The relevance of identifying the subject matter of the complaint as made to the Commission arises by reason of the fact that s  PO  of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act    Cth  confers an entitlement to make an application to this Court and the fact that s  PO  confines any such application to the same conduct as was the subject of complaint  Those subsections provide as follows      Application to court if complaint is terminated     If     a  a complaint has been terminated by the President under section  PE or  PH   and    b  the President has given a notice to any person under subsection  PH  in relation to the termination    any person who was an affected person in relation to the complaint may make an application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court  alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint           The unlawful discrimination alleged in the application     a  must be the same as  or the same in substance as  the unlawful discrimination that was the subject of the terminated complaint  or    b  must arise out of the same  or substantially the same  acts  omissions or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint   The Federal Magistrate in the present appeal relevantly concluded      The Court s jurisdiction in discrimination matters is confined by s  PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act    Cth  to the ambit of a complaint which was terminated by the President of the Commission  and to the respondents to the complaint  In the present matter  I decided at an interlocutory stage that Ms Lawrance s application did not encompass complaints against persons other than the present respondents  nor against government agencies except to the extent that the conduct of the personal respondents in   and   was alleged to have evidenced and formed part of a programme or policy directed at her by Commonwealth and State agencies     Any Ground of Appeal seeking to challenge this ruling and this conclusion has little  if any  prospects of success  It may be accepted that a complaint as made to the Commission is not to be construed as though it were in any manner analogous to a pleading  Even approaching the complaint as made to the Commission in as flexible a manner as possible  it is considered that it would be difficult to reach any conclusion other than that reached by the Federal Magistrate  Ms Lawrance clearly and unambiguously identified the persons against whom the complaint was being made and the period of time during which the conduct complained of was said to have occurred  Her letter of complaint to the Commission dated   April   thus stated in part as follows    The respondents to this complaint are Andras Markus  of the Australian Government Solicitor  and the following Federal Court staff  Michael Wall  Gerard English  Juliet Curtin  Kim Lackenby  Michael Packer and John Petkovshek      I wish to add a further respondent  the State of New South Wales       The conduct of which I complain began fairly soon after I filed a Notice of Appeal in NSD   of   in the Federal Court      The conduct that I have been exposed to since   has been unmistakeably aimed at me  and impossible to not notice    citedLawrance v Commonwealth  No     FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  It would also be erroneous to conclude that it was the manner in which the Federal Magistrate resolved the question as to the ambit of the conduct complained of to the Commission as being the sole determinant as to whether evidence was either admitted or excluded    that was but one of a number of reasons given for the conclusions reached  Thus  in Lawrance v Commonwealth  No     FMCA   the Federal Magistrate addressed the admissibility of evidence and concluded in part as follows      Fourthly  I have rejected very extensive material which amounts to no more than submissions repeating the general contentions of fact and law made in the applicant s points of claim documents  her particulars and her written submissions  These parts of the applicant s affidavits serve no useful function in assisting the Court or respondents to understand the applicant s case  and are embarrassing to the proceeding  I have therefore rejected those parts          Furthermore the alleged conduct of these other persons prior to   as narrated by the applicant in her affidavits  does not in my opinion carry any probative assistance towards establishing  directly or indirectly  the particular conduct complained about in this proceeding  nor its relevant character under the anti discrimination legislation invoked by the applicant  nor its relevant effects on the applicant  In my opinion  it is inadmissible under the relevancy test in s     The other fundamental error identified by Ms Lawrance is said to be the manner in which the Federal Magistrate identified the   comparator   for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act    Cth   This alleged error  it is said  emerges from the following observations of the Federal Magistrate      After hearing all the relevant evidence  including oral evidence from Ms Lawrance and all the personal respondents  I have decided that her application fails at its factual foundations  Ms Lawrance did not  at any stage in the proceeding  tender evidence which gave any substance to her allegations that the personal respondents acted  either individually or together  pursuant to a programme  policy  understanding or arrangement which imputed her with mental illness or other impairment amounting to a  disability  under the Disability Discrimination Act    Cth   Nothing in their individual conduct imputed her with a disability  nor amounted to sexual harassment or discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act    Cth   She was not victimised by any of them  nor by their employers nor other government agencies  as a result of her earlier complaints  She was treated no differently than any unimpaired litigant acting for herself or himself in similar circumstances  The conduct of the personal respondents was entirely innocent  and did not amount to any of the breaches of discrimination legislation which are alleged  There was no conduct on their part for which their employers  or the Commonwealth  or the State of NSW  are liable   The relevant Ground of Appeal contends as follows        Federal Magistrate Smith has acted upon a wrong principle and failed to take into account a material consideration     The definition of  disability  is that given under section  K   The comparator is not correctly identified as  any unimpaired litigant   The comparator is a person who is not being imputed with a psychiatric impairment or mental illness  and  is female       The Grounds of Appeal also seek to put in issue the procedural fairness extended by the Federal Magistrate to Ms Lawrance  The grounds are variously expressed and range from contentions that procedural fairness was denied by reason of the failure to consider evidence or submissions to the manner in which his Honour expressed his reasons for interlocutory applications  The Magistrate in one interlocutory decision   Lawrance v Commonwealth  No     FMCA   thus excluded evidence of events prior to   and stated in part as follows          The prejudice the respondents face in being forced to address all of that history is clear  and  in my opinion it should be excluded under s   of the Evidence Act       One Ground of Appeal seeks to contend that  nowhere is such prejudice identified  and its existence is unclear or not clear    It is said that the Federal Magistrate has denied the now Appellant procedural fairness   Grounds of Appeal asserting a denial of procedural fairness  it is considered  have little if any prospects of success  The Federal Magistrate has made rulings on the ambit of the complaint and that ruling was part of his Honour s approach to the evidence to be adduced  Extending the evidence beyond the period of time encompassed by the complaint would clearly expose the Federal Magistrates Court and the Respondents to further time being expended in the pursuit of that which was held to be irrelevant  The   prejudice   in doing so is readily apparent  In this Court  Counsel for the Second Respondent informed the Court without objection that subpoenas were issued to all of the individual Respondents to attend to give evidence  And they did so   In addition to submitting that her Notice of Appeal had such prospects of success as to not warrant an exercise of the discretion to order security  a further principal consideration relied upon by Ms Lawrance was her impecuniosity   All Respondents  for the purposes of the present Motion   conceded that Ms Lawrance was suffering financial hardship and would not be able to provide security   All Respondents nevertheless sought

Australia Act    Cth   S  provides that security is to be of such amount and given at such time and in such manner and form as the Court or Judge directs  As to whether security for costs should be ordered  Cowell v Taylor     Ch D   at   a case of more than   years ago  sets out the fundamental principle   The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant  that  from time immemorial  has been the rule at common law  There is an exception in the case of appeals  but there the appellant has had the benefit of a decision by one of Her Majesty s Courts  and so an insolvent party is not excluded from the Courts  but only prevented  if he cannot find security  from dragging his opponent from one Court to another      What that passage demonstrates is that there is a difference in principle in relation to the ordering of security for costs in a first instance matter and the ordering  or the consideration of the ordering  of security for costs where one is at the appellate level  The difference is that  at the appellant level  there has already been a determination adverse to the person against whom security for costs is sought and  if it be shown that there is a substantial risk that even if successful the respondent to the application for leave to appeal  or to an appeal  will be deprived of his costs  such an outcome would clearly be unjust     In a sense  it would be giving to a person who has been on the receiving end so to speak of a determination by the courts a free hit at great cost to the other party in the appeal proceedings  That consideration  it seems to me  is also reinforced by the judgment of Gummow J in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Anor   FCA     unreported   September    That case involved appeals against extradition with penal consequences  Such consequences were clearly very relevant considerations  but discretionary reasons moved the Court not to order  Such discretionary considerations  which were particularly noted by Gummow J  included the delay between the filing of the papers and the bringing of the applications for security  His Honour referred to a particular circumstance which is relevant here  and that is that the applicant for security has a judgment in its favour  There was a reference by Gummow J to Bethune v Porteous     VLR     again an old case  In that case  Hood J said  at    the reason underlying the numerous and varying cases in which appellants have been ordered to give security will be found in the injustice to a successful litigant that may be caused if he be compelled to contest the matter for a second time without a probability of obtaining his costs if ultimately successful   That really is the fundamental question of justice behind my decision to order security for costs    See also  Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at     Upton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Pty Ltd   FCA   at
