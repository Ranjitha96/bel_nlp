NAHR v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedNeal v Secretary  Department of Transport     ALR   The jurisdiction of this Court to review a decision of the AAT is confined by the terms of s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  which confines an appeal to  a question of law   In Neal v Secretary  Department of Transport     ALR   at   Franki J stated that     There is no appeal to this court on anything other than a question of law and therefore the court is not concerned with whether or not it would have come to the same conclusion as the Tribunal came to  but only with the question of whether the Tribunal erred in law  appliedPeko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The errors of law alleged are that the AAT took into account irrelevant considerations and that there was no evidence upon which it could reach the conclusion that it did  Mason J in Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Peko   explained the concept of relevant and irrelevant considerations as it applies to statutory decision makers as follows     In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations  this Court has held that  where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined  the factors that may be taken in to account in the exercise of that discretion are similarly unconfined  except in so far as there may be some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision maker may legitimately have regard  By analogy  where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute  the court will not find that the decision maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act    citations omitted  Contrary to the appellant s contention  there was evidence  to support the Tribunal s decision that the income derived by the applicant between   September   and   September   was in the sum of     being the statement of income to that effect made by the appellant on a credit card application dated   March     On this point  the AAT said  inter alia     Given the lack of information and evidence available to the Tribunal in seeking to calculate the likely income of Mr Trkulja in the period   September   to   September   it is virtually impossible to do so  Given the history of Mr Trkulja in failing to provide information  failing to maintain financial records  his evasiveness  and  at times  contradictions when under examination and speaking in generalities rather than specifics at the hearing  his evidence cannot be accepted  I am satisfied that his income in the relevant period was in excess of that claimed by him to be income in his statement filed with the trustee and the respondent  On the other hand  I am satisfied that the trustee s assessment  on the basis on which it was calculated  was excessive  I am inclined to agree with the respondent that  if anything  the respondent s assessment was likely to have been low  Nevertheless  the respondent s assessment was based on a signed application for credit by Mr Trkulja  albeit at a time prior to his bankruptcy and the commencement of the contribution assessment period  I acknowledge that  pursuant to s  X of the Act  the trustee may disregard information provided by the bankrupt and make an assessment on the basis of what the trustee consider to be the correct information where he considers the information provided by the bankrupt is or may be incorrect  However  I do not believe that this empowers the trustee to simply add up the total expenditure of the bankrupt during the period and assume that it represented income  Given the circumstances of this case  I am of the view that the respondent s assessment should be affirmed on the basis that there was little or no change in Mr Trkulja s circumstances between March and May   and September    Consequently  the decision in relation to the income contribution assessment should be affirmed   It was open to the AAT to determine that there was no relevant change to the appellant s circumstances between the date of the application and the relevant period in so far as those circumstances concerned his income  The weight accorded to the evidence before the AAT was a matter for the AAT   Similarly  the stated income of the appellant on a credit card application could not be said to be an irrelevant consideration as described in Peko   rather  it would seem to be directly relevant to the very question before the AAT  In reality  the appellant is seeking to re litigate facts determined by the AAT  It follows that the appellant fails on this ground of appeal   The appellant s second ground of appeal concerns the notice of objection filed by the trustee pursuant to s  D d  of the Act  which was upheld by the second respondent and the AAT  Section  D  of the Act relevantly provides     The grounds of objection that may be set out in a notice of objection are as follows             d  the bankrupt  when requested in writing by the trustee to provide written information about the bankrupt s property  income or expected income  failed to comply with the request           The appellant alleges that in making its finding on this point  the AAT relied upon hearsay evidence  In affirming the second respondent s decision on this ground of objection  the AAT set out a number of paragraphs from the second respondent s statement of facts and contentions filed in the AAT proceeding  However  prior to setting out these paragraphs  the AAT said     The background facts leading to the ground of objection pursuant to s  D d  of the Act were conveniently summarised in the respondent s statement of facts and contentions  The supporting documentation was provided to the Tribunal  appliedCollector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   In Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at   the Full Court stated     The limitation of the jurisdiction to the resolution of questions of law imposes a significant constraint upon the role of the Court in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal  The appealable error of law must arise on the facts found by the Tribunal or must vitiate the findings made or must have led the Tribunal to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make  A wrong finding of fact is not sufficient to demonstrate error of law    citation omitted
