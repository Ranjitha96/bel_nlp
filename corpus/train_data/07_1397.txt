CPSU  The Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCPSU v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Absent any other statutory provision touching on this issue  it would be necessary to determine whether s  c  of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  operates to preserve any rights or obligations acquired  accrued or incurred under s   of the old Act  However  reg     of Ch   of the Workplace Regulations is a statutory provision that touches on this issue  Regulation     provides as follows        Unless the contrary intention appears in a provision of             a  the Act  ie the new Act but not including Schedule   or regulations made there under  reg       or    b  the Work Choices Act  or    c  regulations made under the Act or the Work Choices Act            the amendments made by the Work Choices Act do not affect the enforcement in a court of rights and obligations that arose under the pre reform Act      Subregulation   applies whether or not proceedings had been commenced in a court before the reform commencement        The Court s attention was not drawn to any provision of the new Act  the Work Choices Act or any other regulations made under those Acts that discloses a contrary intention to reg       Support for the above approach is to be found in CPSU v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         FCR    In that case the Full Court gave consideration to an email which the managing director of the employer s employee relations group had issued to managers and team leaders at a time when redundancies were imminent  After referring to the  important values  inherent in individual employment contracts  the email stated     Managers will be held accountable to support the values of the Company s preferred model of individual employment      The email stopped short of telling managers and team leaders to discriminate against employees employed under awards or certified agreements in the redundancy process   The employer in CPSU v Telstra contended  that as the email had not been circulated to all managers involved in the redundancy process  it was akin to a proposal or a declaration of intention and did not itself change the selection criteria for redundancy  The Full Court at   rejected that contention  It found that it was open to the primary judge to conclude  as his Honour had done  that the selection process for redundancy could be influenced by senior management and that many managers would understand the email to be an instruction to give employees on individual contracts more favourable treatment in the redundancy process  The Full Court further held at   that  a  at the date of the email  redundancies were imminent and there could be little doubt that the email was to be taken into account in respect of them and  b  the email refined the criteria for redundancy by requiring preference to be given to employees who had signed Australian Workplace Agreements  The Full Court concluded at   that in the circumstances the email constituted an instruction that employees employed under awards or certified agreements were to be discriminated against in the redundancy process   In the present case I am satisfied that the process for approving leave  and in particular flex leave  for Commonwealth employees for   November   was influenced by the DEWR Advice  In particular  as discussed below  I am satisfied that the process for approving leave in the case of employees working in ACS  ATO  DVA and DEST was affected by the DEWR Advice  The DEWR Advice was reasonably open to be understood  and was understood by Ms Godwin  Ms Ellison and Ms Leggett amongst others  as an instruction not to grant employees leave to cover participation in the Day of Protest   For the above reasons I am satisfied that the circulation to Agencies of the DEWR Advice altered the position of Commonwealth employees  and in particular Commonwealth employees who were members of the CPSU  to their prejudice because it gave rise to a real risk that any requests made by them to take leave on   November   for the purpose of attending the Day of Protest would not be considered according to the usual practices of their respective Agencies but by reference to a more restrictive criterion  As the admissions and evidence referred to below concerning the individual applicants reveal  that risk eventuated in the case of each of the individual applicants  However  so far as Ms Clements is concerned  I am satisfied that her application to take leave was subsequently reconsidered by reference to the appropriate criterion  see   below    The Commonwealth accepted that the email sent by Ms Ellison on   November   to all ATO employees  see   above  and the email sent on the same day by the Personnel Branch of DEST to all DEST employees  see   above  altered the position of employees in those agencies or threatened to have that effect  It contended  however  that as the only memoranda produced by ACS and DVA were circulated to senior managers  and not to employees of the Agency generally  the memoranda did not themselves alter the position of any employee to his or her prejudice or constituted a threat to do so  I observe that this contention appears to overlook the staff notice issued by Mr Killesteyn on   November    see   above    I turn to the memorandum issued by ACS  As mentioned above  at the relevant time Ms Godwin was National Manager  Staffing in the ACS  Ms Godwin gave evidence that on   November   after the DEWR Advice was brought to her attention  she caused an email to be sent on her behalf to all National Directors  National Managers and Regional Directors regarding the Day of Protest  That email  which was sent at   am and marked as of high importance  stated     Any leave being applied for specifically to participate in the National Day of Action should not be approved  This position is the official position of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations      On   November   Ms Godwin had given what she described as  quick and dirty  advice to the same effect to a manager who was concerned about an application made by Mr McGill to take a day s flex leave on   November   referred toEsber v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my view the words  rights  and  obligations  in reg     carry the meaning that has been attributed to them in s  c  of the Acts Interpretations Act  In Esber v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ stated that s   protects anything that may truly be described as a right including inchoate or contingent rights  I conclude that the right of the applicants to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court to impose a penalty pursuant to s   of the old Act  and the obligation of the Commonwealth to pay any penalty so imposed  survived the enactment of the Work Choices Act citedKelly v Fitzpatrick   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Regulation     of Ch   of the Workplace Regulations provides support for this conclusion  As Tracey J observed in Kelly v Fitzpatrick   FCA   at     that regulation authorises a workplace inspector to institute a proceeding in respect of an alleged breach of a matter under the old Act  I note incidentally that the maximum penalties prescribed by the old Act for a breach of s   are the same as the maximum penalties now prescribed by the new Act under which s   has been renumbered s     CPSU is an organisation registered under the WR Act and an  industrial association  within the meaning of Pt XA of the old Act  It is affiliated to the ACTU which is the peak trade union body in Australia   It is not contentious that the individual applicants are all employed under the Public Service Act    Cth   the PS Act  and are thus APS employees  s   of the PS Act  s   of the Customs Administration Act    Cth  and s  A of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth   The Commonwealth is their employer  Their respective Agency Heads  on behalf of the Commonwealth  have all the rights  duties and powers of an employer in respect of them  s   of the PS Act   For those employees who work in DVA and DEST respectively  their Agency Head is the Secretary of their Department  For those who work in the ACS and the ATO respectively  their Agency Head is the Head of their Statutory Agency  s   of the PS Act  citedMaritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd     IR   As indicated above  I have concluded that each of Mr McGill and Mr O Connell was refused approval to take leave on   November   because he proposed to attend the Day of Protest  I also accept that a threat was made to dock Mr McAninly s pay for the time that he spent at the Day of Protest because he attended the Day of Protest  However  despite the link discussed above between attendance at the Day of Protest and membership of an industrial association  I am satisfied that the relevant determinations made by officers of ACS  ATO  DVA and DEST respectively were not made because employees affected by the determinations were members of an industrial association  Rather the evidence shows that the immediate or operative reason for the determinations was the circulation of the DEWR Advice   Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd     IR   at    The determinations were a direct consequence of the contravention of s  K  that resulted from the circulation of the DEWR Advice  They illustrate how the DEWR Advice altered the position of Commonwealth employees who were members of CPSU to the employees  prejudice  The officers concerned felt obliged to ensure that their respective agencies complied with the DEWR Advice appliedMcIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd     IR   In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd     IR   at     Greenwood J gave consideration to whether conduct that applied generally to employees might nonetheless be conduct undertaken for a prohibited purpose so far as some of those employees were concerned  His Honour at   said     Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee  It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost   I conclude that the DEWR Advice was issued because a significant number of Commonwealth employees were members of CPSU and  as a consequence  it was recognised within DEWR that many of them might wish to attend the Day of Protest  For the reasons given by Greenwood J in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd it is immaterial that the DEWR Advice might additionally have impacted on the positions of Commonwealth employees who were not members of an industrial association  Although the DEWR Advice did not in terms refer to membership of an industrial association  it was issued because of the CPSU membership of a significant number of Commonwealth employees
