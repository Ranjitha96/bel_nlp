au cases cth FMCA  html  This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on   July   dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  handed down on   February   see SZMBX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant   The appellant is a citizen of the People s Republic of China who entered Australia on   June    He entered on a visitor s visa  On   July   the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on   October    On   November   the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision   In a Statutory Declaration filed in support of his visa application the appellant claimed that  encouraged by his friend  who was a member of the China Democracy Party  CDP  he organised a protest against corrupt Communist officials who sold a large piece of farm land which included his family s land  but gave the appellant s family only minimal compensation  He contacted other locals in the village and handed out pamphlets which called on local people not to bear unfair treatment and to strive for their basic human rights  He claimed that he organised a protest  which was attended by about   people  The protest was quickly suppressed by the Public Security Bureau  PSB   He claimed  that through his relationship with his friend  the PSB came to believe that he was a key member of the CDP and that he had been instructed by the CDP to organise the protest  He claimed that he was wanted by the PSB and therefore went into hiding before illegally leaving China with the help of some friends  He was smuggled to Taiwan and came to Australia on a false Taiwanese passport   During the hearing the appellant said that  on   April   he had conducted investigations about people whose land had been taken by the authorities by going to families and asking about any land taken  When he visited the families  he was finding out about the land as well as organising the demonstration  He set a date for the demonstration on   April    On   April     copies of the pamphlet were printed and he gave pamphlets to anyone he encountered in the street  At the protest the police told him the protest was anti government  and that the protestors were breaking the law  The police held him by his jacket  There were about     police officers and there were now     people involved in the demonstration which became chaotic  After he fled the demonstration he lived at a friend s home  Three police cars went to his home on   April     The Tribunal found  on the evidence as a whole  that the appellant was not a credible witness  The Tribunal considered that the Statutory Declaration completed by the appellant was detailed and comprehensive and that  therefore  new claims made at the hearing raised doubts about his credibility and the veracity of his claims  The Tribunal found the appellant s evidence about how he organised the protest to be internally inconsistent  vague and unclear  The Tribunal found the appellant s alleged organisation of a large protest was implausible and it did not accept that the protest took place referred toAttorney General NSW v Quin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant complained that the Tribunal had failed genuinely to assess evidence favourable to him when it questioned the fact that the appellant raised substantial new claims at the hearing  and  in rejecting his claims  had made an unfair decision  The Federal Magistrate noted that s   of the Act provided that  in carrying out its functions  the Tribunal was to pursue the objective of providing a mechanism for review that was fair  just  economical  informed and quick  The Federal Magistrate referred to the observations of Brennan J in Attorney General NSW v Quin   HCA         CLR   at     and concluded that no breach of ss   or   of the Act had occurred   The appellant complained that the Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s  A  by failing to give the appellant particulars of information  failing to ensure that the appellant understood that it would be relevant to his review application and failing to give the appellant the opportunity to comment on the information  The Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had been given an opportunity to comment on the information at the hearing  The issue of the  appellant s  credibility  was squarely before the appellant  or should have been  and that the appellant should not have been taken by surprise that his application was not accepted  The Tribunal was not satisfied as to the appellant s credibility or the credibility of his account  That finding was open to the Tribunal   The Federal Magistrate was unable to find any other arguable case for jurisdictional error and dismissed the application
