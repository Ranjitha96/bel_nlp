CPSU  The Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia     FCR   In its written submissions on penalty the CPSU submitted  for the first time  that as there were at the relevant time   CPSU members within the APS whose employment was affected by the DEWR memorandum  the Commonwealth committed   contraventions of the WR Act by issuing the memorandum  It submitted         It is not unusual to use the singular term when referring to a composite number of penalties arising from a single act  Where multiple penalties are applied in respect of a single act which gives rise to a breach of the WRA  it is common for the orders made by the Court  and the case law  to refer to the penalties imposed as a composite  penalty    In such cases an order may be made for a single penalty  but the maximum available penalty is determined by the number of persons whose position was relevantly altered giving rise to individual breaches         See for example Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia at first instance and on appeal where a single penalty was imposed by Merkel J and apportioned between the breaches  The parties  the primary Judge  and Full Court referred consistently to this composite penalty as a single penalty                 Accordingly  the use of the singular word  penalty  may properly be taken to refer to a composite penalty arising from a number of breaches which arise from a single act  In the present case the  Further Amended Statement of Claim  permits such an approach   Nothing in the reasons for judgment in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia     FCR   at first instance or on appeal suggests that the issue of the nature of the claim in respect of penalty that the respondent was required to meet arose for determination in that case  Nor  at least before the Full Court  was any significance ascribed to the use of the word  penalty  as opposed to  penalties    In my view it would be unfair to the Commonwealth to allow the applicants now to depart from what  in my view  they claimed by the amended application  namely an order that the Commonwealth pay a single penalty in respect of the issuing of the DEWR Advice  I accept the submission of the Commonwealth that had it been aware that the applicants sought the imposition of a penalty in respect of each CPSU member within the APS it would have tested the applicants  evidence of the extent of CPSU membership  It may be that in this circumstance the Commonwealth would also have investigated more thoroughly the impact of the DEWR Advice on individual APS employees or different categories of APS employees within the various Departments and agencies   The maximum penalty for a body corporate for a contravention of Part XA of the WR Act is   penalty units  s  U a i  of the WR Act   This translates to    s  AA  of the Crimes Act    Cth    In Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia at   I observed     The authorities accept that the matters to be taken into account in determining whether particular conduct under the Act calls for the imposition of a penalty  and assuming that it does  the amount of the penalty  include       a  the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place  including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act       b  whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of the Act       c  where more than one contravention of Pt XA is involved  whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct       d  the consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of Pt XA of the Act       e  the need  in the circumstances  for the

judgment in this matter  CPSU  the Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA    I concluded that the circulation of certain memoranda of advice by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relation  the DEWR Advice  resulted in contravention by the Commonwealth of s  K  of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the WR Act   I also concluded that by denying the second and fifth applicants approval to access leave on   November   because they proposed to attend the Day of Protest organised to demonstrate opposition to proposed amendments to the WR Act  the Commonwealth breached two industrial instruments  namely the Australian Customs Service Certified Agreement      the ACS Agreement  and the Stay Here and Grow DEST Certified Agreement      the DEST Agreement    The proceeding was stood over to a date to be fixed for the purpose of making orders giving effect to my reasons for judgment and orders as to the penalties  if any  appropriate to be imposed  The parties were directed to provide to my Associate  if possible  an agreed minute as to the orders to be made  other than as to penalties  and written submissions on the order or orders  if any  as to penalty which they respectively contended should be made  The parties were invited to indicate in their respective written submissions if they sought a further oral hearing  Neither party

proscribed by s  K  of the WR Act results in one contravention or in a contravention in respect of each affected employee is answered by authority that I should follow  the number of contraventions equals the number of affected employees  see particularly Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority  No       IR   at   and CPSU  the Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited     IR   at     Orders are commonly made that a penalty imposed under the WR Act be paid to an industrial organisation where that organisation instituted the proceeding in question to protect the legitimate interests of its individual members  see CPSU v Telstra at      In this case the Commonwealth  understandably in the circumstances  did not seek an order that any penalty imposed be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund   It will be ordered that the penalty imposed be paid to the CPSU   I certify that the preceding twenty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of
