Shop Distributive and Allied Employees  Association v Woolworths Limited   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSeymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd     FCR   Both parties were in agreement that cl   incorporated by reference the provisions of the LSL Act  and did not merely preserve their operation as part of the law of Victoria  The fact that the provisions to which cl   refers are only those applying at the time of certification of the Certified Agreement suggests strongly that the intention of cl   was to give those provisions operation as part of the Certified Agreement  rather than to recognise their continued operation as part of the law of Victoria  in the absence of a federal instrument covering the relevant field  Compare Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd     FCR   at     per Gray J citedQueen in Right of the State of Victoria v Australian Teachers Union     IR   The arguments resting on the exhaustive nature of the definition in cl   of the Certified Agreement  and the presumption of consistency in the use of terms are weakened substantially in the present case  It is true that the definition in cl   is unqualified by words such as  unless a contrary intention appears  or  unless the context otherwise requires   It is a  means  and not an  includes  definition  and is therefore taken to be exhaustive  See the Queen in Right of the State of Victoria v Australian Teachers Union     IR   at    The difficulty is that cl   does not itself use the defined term  rather  it imports provisions that use the same expression  but which also include a definition of that term as used  It is easy to construe cl   as involving the importation of provisions relating to long service leave as a code on that subject  the content of which does not have to fit within the framework of the rest of the Certified Agreement  It is as if the imported provisions contained a term other than  ordinary pay  with a different meaning citedClyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is no doubt that consistency in the use of terminology  particularly defined terms  is to be valued highly in any document  Inconsistency in the use of the same or similar words produces confusion in the interpretation of documents  This is why there is a presumption that a word used in one provision of a statute has the same meaning when it is used in another provision of the same statute  In statutory construction  consistency of use is no more than a presumption  and a fragile one at that  In Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   Gibbs CJ described it as  not a presumption of very much weight   His Honour said   there is no rigid rule  it all depends on the context   In the same case at   Mason J  with whom Aickin and Wilson JJ concurred  said that the presumption  readily yields to the context   If the presumption of consistent use of terminology is so weak in legislative drafting  it must be even weaker in the context of a Certified Agreement  Typically  such agreements are the product of hard negotiation  in which wording of particular clauses is often agreed without reference to other provisions of the same document  Provisions are commonly transmitted from one agreement to the next in a series  without regard to whether their terminology sits well with the words used in newly adopted terms  The use of other agreements  and awards  as precedents can often result in the borrowing of provisions  again without regard to whether the words used in them are consistent with the rest of the agreement under consideration  For these and other reasons  consistency will often be absent  It is easy to see that the same word can be used in different provisions with different meanings   As well as providing examples of inconsistent use of style in numbering and lettering clauses  the Certified Agreement itself provides examples of inconsistency of terminology when it is likely that the same meaning is intended  For instance  it is not easy to see that the references to  weekly ordinary time wage rate  and  base ordinary time rate of pay  in cl   C   and   C   respectively are intended to mean anything different from  ordinary time rate of pay  in cl   B   and in the definition of  Ordinary Pay  in cl    A similar observation might be made about  regular ordinary time rate of pay  in cl   c  and  total ordinary weekly rate  in cl    Nor is there consistency in the approach to the rate of pay for the various types of leave for which the Certified Agreement provides  Clause   does not use the term  ordinary pay  and does not have any other provision as to how the rate of pay for compassionate leave is to be calculated   The choice of incorporation by reference  as the means of providing for long service leave entitlements  itself provides a sufficient reason for ousting the presumption that terminology is used consistently  As I have said  the term  ordinary pay  comes complete with its own definition in the provisions incorporated by reference  It is as if the provisions incorporated by reference contained different terminology consideredModern Buildings Wales Ltd v Limmer and Trinidad Co Ltd     All ER   Counsel for the applicant relied on Modern Buildings Wales Ltd v Limmer and Trinidad Co Ltd     All ER    In that case  there was a question whether a standard form contract  known as the  green form  which contained an arbitration clause  had been incorporated by reference into a building contract  although misdescribed in the terms of the building contract itself  The Court of Appeal  consisting of Buckley and Ormrod LJJ  held that the green form had been incorporated by reference  and that a proceeding brought to enforce the building contract ought to be stayed pending arbitration  in accordance with the    arbitration clause  Buckley LJ dealt with one of the arguments supporting the proposition that the green form had not been incorporated by reference at     as follows       Counsel for the plaintiffs has suggested that the written contract contains insufficient indication how various matters that are left in blank in the green form contract  and in particular in the appendix to the contract  which relates to such matters as the completion period  the retention money and so forth  should be filled in  Where parties by an agreement import the terms of some other document as part of their agreement those terms must be imported in their entirety  in my judgment  but subject to this  that if any of the imported terms in any way conflicts with the expressly agreed terms  the latter must prevail over what would otherwise be imported  Here it is not disputed that the written contract between the parties  consisting of the quotation and the order  contains all the essential terms of the contract  and  in my judgment  the green form of contract must be treated as forming part of the written contract  subject to any modifications that may be necessary to make the clauses in the green form accord in all respects with the express terms agreed between the parties    Emphasis added     Ormrod LJ agreed with Buckley LJ and did not comment specifically on the issue of the gaps in the green form   Counsel for the applicant contended that the principle to be derived from Modern Buildings   as stated by Buckley LJ  was that  when the terms of a document are incorporated by reference into an agreement  the terms are only imported into the agreement to the extent to which they are not inconsistent with the express terms of the agreement  Plainly  the principle cannot be this broad  Buckley LJ was speaking of a term that  conflicts with the expressly agreed terms  not a term that would be inconsistent only in the sense that its application would produce a different result from that produced by the application of the express terms of the agreement  In the absence of conflict between terms  there is no reason why full effect should not be given to the choice of the parties to incorporate provisions by reference  In the present case  there is no conflict between the definition in cl   of the Certified Agreement and the definition of  ordinary pay  in the LSL Act  It is only that the application of the two definitions to the expression  ordinary pay  which happens to be common to both the provisions incorporated by reference and the express terms of the Certified Agreement  might produce different results  Such different results would not involve derogation from the express terms of the Certified Agreement  There is  therefore  no possibility of conflict  There is no reason why the choice of the parties to have entitlements to long service leave determined by the application of the provisions of the LSL Act should not be given full effect citedMerchant Service Guild of Australia v Sydney
