Wilderness Society Inc  v The Hon  Malcolm Turnbull  Minister for the Environment and Water Resources   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAttorney General for the State of New South Wales v Quin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Judicial review of administrative action based on the Wednesbury unreasonable ground must be exercised with considerable restraint  otherwise there will be a blurring between what is judicial review and what is merits review of a decision with which a court disagrees  As Brennan J said in Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Quin   HCA         CLR   at     The repository of administrative power must often balance the interests of the public at large and the interests of minority groups or individuals  The courts are not equipped to evaluate the policy considerations which properly bear on such decisions  nor is the adversary system ideally suited to the doing of administrative justice  interests which are not represented as well as interests which are represented must often be considered  Moreover  if the courts were permitted to review the merits of administrative action whenever interested parties were prepared to risk the costs of litigation  the exercise of administrative power might be skewed in favour of the rich  the powerful  or the simply litigious   I am unable to form the view that  on the entirety of the evidence  the Minister s   assessment approach decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable Minister would have made it   As none of the grounds in TWS s third amended application have been made out  the application must be dismissed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and sixty three   numbered paragraphs are a

approach decision was affected by apprehended bias  They contend that the facts and circumstances of this matter are such as would give rise in the mind of a fair minded and informed member of the public  to a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality on the Minister s part  and to an apprehension that the Minister prejudged the outcome of the decision he was required to make  see Webb

HCA  html  However  that disappointment  anger and suspicion must be seen in the context of these facts      it was Departmental practice to assist proponents with referrals and to meet to discuss them    the planning for assessment on preliminary documentation was based on Mr Early s judgment that it was the correct approach    although timelines were discussed between Gunns and the Department and in some of the material recording these discussions the language of  agreement  is used  I accept Mr Early s evidence that there was no guarantee that the process would be concluded by any particular time  because  the clock  might stop for some reason    although the Australian Government had partly funded the proposal and supported it politically  it must be borne in mind that in making the decision on approval under s   of the EPBC Act  the Minister must consider  economic and social matters  under s  b   As long as the steps required by the EPBC Act are taken by the Minister  the Australian Government is not prevented from having a policy position on the pulp mill project  see Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy   HCA         CLR   at       The critical issue is whether a well informed reasonable observer would consider there was an apprehension of bias in the Minister  The Minister received strong advice from Mr Early  who firmly believed in the preliminary documentation assessment approach  Gunns lobbied him in favour of that approach  That approach also suited the Tasmanian Government and enhanced the chances of synchronisation of approval under the EPBC Act with approval by the Tasmanian Parliament  By   April   the Minister wanted to know if an approval timeline ending in August   was possible because he knew that was what the Tasmanian Government and Gunns were pursuing  However  the Minister did not consider the preliminary documentation assessment approach to the exclusion of all other approaches  Even during the course of making the assessment approach decision  the Minister questioned Mr Early about why another approach was not being recommended  At the time of making his decision  I do not consider that a well informed observer could reasonably form the view that the Minister was biased towards the preliminary documentation assessment approach to the extent that he was not prepared to even consider alternative approaches  because he plainly did   The allegation that the   assessment approach decision is invalid due to apprehended bias is rejected referred toIndustrial Equity Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As Gaudron J said in Industrial Equity Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       An improper purpose will not lightly be inferred and  by application of a presumption of regularity  will only be inferred if the evidence cannot be reconciled with the proper exercise of the power  see Reg  v Inland Revenue Commissioners  Ex parte Rossminster   per Lord Diplock   In this proceeding  the evidence can be reconciled with the proper exercise of power having regard to the Minister s reasons for the   assessment approach decision and the prevailing factual background referred to in the preceding paragraphs of these reasons for judgment relating to improper exercise of power   The final ground to be considered in TWS s application is the allegation that the   assessment approach decision was manifestly unreasonable  This is the least arguable ground raised in the third amended application appliedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Eshetu   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Eshetu   HCA         CLR   at       Someone who disagrees strongly with someone else s process of reasoning on an issue of fact may express such disagreement by describing the reasoning as  illogical  or  unreasonable  or even  so unreasonable that no reasonable person could adopt it   If these are merely emphatic ways of saying that the reasoning is wrong  then they may have no particular legal consequence     Further at   their Honours said    As Mason J pointed out in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd      when the ground of asserted unreasonableness is giving too much or too little weight to one consideration or another  a court should proceed with caution   lest it exceed its supervisory role by reviewing the decision on its merits  appliedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Minister considered that the second referral had been withdrawn on   March   presumably as a consequence of Mr Gay s letter of that date referred to at    On my analysis  the withdrawal occurred late on   March   in the making of the third referral  This means that the notice under reg  B   was premature and referred to an incorrect date of withdrawal  However  this does not affect the validity of the withdrawal  it means that the obligation to publish notice of the withdrawal in accordance with s  C  and the EPBC Regulations remains unfulfilled  The notice itself has been given and the failure to publish that notice is not intended to affect the validity of the withdrawal of the second referral  see Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at      especially at   per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ   There is no indication in s  C that failure to publish notice of the withdrawal in strict compliance with the EPBC Regulations results in the invalidity of the withdrawal   Counsel for TWS contend that on withdrawal of the second referral  the provisions of Ch   of the EPBC Act  including ss     and   ceased to apply to the action  Counsel submit that  as a consequence  the third referral was invalid and not capable of supporting the impugned decisions   Reliance is placed on s  C  which provides     If the referral is withdrawn  the provisions of this Chapter  ss   to  C  that would  apart from this subsection  have applied to the action cease to apply to the action referred toR v Isaac  Ex parte Transport Workers  Union of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Any obligation to the public or persons interested in an action in the context of those decisions is found in the EPBC Act  There is no general obligation to accord procedural fairness  The words  in relation to  in s  AA  are broad  Compare the similar expression  in connection with  which Gibbs CJ held in the context of an eligibility rule of a registered industrial organisation  very considerably widens the scope of the rule    R v Isaac  Ex parte Transport Workers  Union of Australia   HCA         CLR   at     Even if I am wrong in considering that there is no obligation to accord procedural fairness  otherwise than as is set out in the EPBC Act  it would be difficult to establish a denial of procedural fairness in the circumstances  As counsel for the Minister submit  in their written submissions       the scope of the inquiry under the EPBC Act is limited to issues relevant to the  controlling provisions    the inquiry will not consider any and all environmental issues that may arise out of the proposal  For example  issues of general air quality are not relevant  The relatively confined scope of the inquiry bears on the reasonableness of the opportunity to be heard   It is also significant  as counsel for the Minister submit at   of their written submissions  that there is no requirement in the EPBC Act to invite the public to comment on what assessment approach should be adopted for the decision on approval  That tells against a requirement for the Minister to accord procedural fairness in making an assessment approach decision referred toRe MacTiernan  Ex parte Coogee Coastal Action Coalition Incorporated   WASC  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASC  html  In any event  I am not satisfied

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Applicant S      ALR   The   assessment approach decision cannot be said to be  irrational  illogical and not based upon findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds   see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Applicant S      ALR   at   per McHugh and Gummow JJ   The   assessment approach decision was made after the Minister considered an alternative approach  such as an EIS  In all the circumstances  having regard to the advice given to the Minister by Mr Early  and taking into account the demise of the RPDC process  it cannot be said that the   assessment approach decision was manifestly unreasonable citedThompson v The Council of the Municipality of Randwick Corporation
