Felix Resources Pty Ltd  in the matter of Felix Resources Pty Ltd  No     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRe Felix Resources Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlHis Honour s reasons for making those orders are to be found in the reasons for judgment which he gave that day  see Re Felix Resources Pty Ltd   FCA    These reasons for judgment should be read in conjunction with those given by his Honour on   September    The proposed scheme is more particularly described in his Honour s reasons for judgement  I do not  therefore  take time to recite again the nature of the scheme as proposed  Since   September   there has been a further development  The explanatory memorandum  to which I have already referred  has been sent  Section   of the Corporations Act requires  inter alia  that the explanatory memorandum sent to shareholders contain      Any other information that is material to the making of a decision by a member whether or not to agree to the arrangement citedRe Coates Hire  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFelix Resources apprehends  in light of a further development  that it is appropriate to seek court approval for the sending of a supplementary memorandum  There is no doubt that it is a prudent and appropriate course for Felix Resources to have taken to seek such approval  note the criticism voiced in Re Coates Hire  No     FCA   at   in respect of a corporation that sent such material without first obtaining court approval  The original explanatory memorandum disclosed that Felix Resources would be declaring a second   cent dividend  What that memorandum did not disclose was the timing of the dividend and the circumstances relating to the way in which the company would pay that dividend  As it transpires  the directors of Felix Resources propose to fund that dividend with the use of funds borrowed from particular shareholders  It is that development and that proposal which has provided the occasion for the making of this application  On   November   the board of directors of Felix Resources declared a fully franked   cent dividend payable to each share in the company  That dividend is payable on   December    It is on the day after members met to vote on the scheme and the day before the hearing of the application for court approval  The material before me discloses  candidly  that Felix Resources does not presently have sufficient cash resources to meet the second   cent dividend payment on   December   while at the same time complying with financing arrangements which it has with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia  It is against that background that Felix Resources proposes to borrow the full amount needed for the payment of the second dividend from its three largest shareholders  It has entered into loan agreements with each of those shareholders to that end  Pursuant to cl     of an implementation agreement in cl   of the deed poll Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited  Yanzhou  which I note is represented today by leave by its solicitors  and its subsidiary  Austar  have agreed to put in a place a letter of credit from the Bank of China s Sydney branch which will guarantee repayment of amounts outstanding under the shareholder loans to which I have referred
