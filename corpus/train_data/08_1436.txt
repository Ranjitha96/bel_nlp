Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedApplicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Telstra submits that procedural fairness requires a decision maker to disclose to an interested party the substance of material that is significant  relevant  credible and obtained from a source other than that party  citing Kioa v West   HCA         CLR     Kioa v West  and Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR     VEAL    As formulated  the submission is based on the High Court judgment in VEAL at     which refers to the judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West at      Brennan J there referred to adverse information that is credible  relevant and significant which the decision maker possesses and proposes to take into account  VEAL concerned an unsolicited letter from a third party which had been forwarded by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Refugee Review Tribunal   In my respectful opinion neither Kioa v West nor VEAL is of direct relevance to the present case  which is not one of  information  of the kind referred to in them  The relevant information that ACCC  possessed  was that Telstra had implemented a churn process that required the participation of both the losing and gaining access seekers  and that neither Telstra  Bigpond  nor Request were participants in that process  This information came from Telstra or was at least known to Telstra  Furthermore  Telstra knew that ACCC s objective was to avoid disconnection charges in the case of an end user switching service providers  and the information referred to was of obvious relevance to that objective  The procedural fairness issue raised in the present case concerns the solution arrived at and the reasoning process that led to it  This is a different area of discourse from that of information received by a decision maker from a third party citedAustralasian Meat Industry Employees  Union  WA Branch  ex parte Ferguson     ALR   The particular criterion relevant to the present circumstances is whether it is probable to the required degree that the additional evidence will affect the result  There is not a single formulation in the cases as to the degree of probability required  In Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union  WA Branch  ex parte Ferguson     ALR     Toohey J said  at     In situations where a hearing has concluded but judgment has been reserved and not delivered  it has been said that fresh evidence should be admitted only when it is so material that the interests of justice require it  the evidence is believed would most probably affect the result       my emphasis   In Daniel   RD Nicholson J stated  at   that it must be shown that the new evidence  if accepted  would   most certainly affect the result   my emphasis  referred toAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond     CLR   Both parties refer to Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond     CLR     Bond   in which Mason CJ discussed whether a finding of fact can constitute a reviewable decision  and when a finding of fact can constitute an error of law that contributes to a reviewable decision   In respect of both  Mason CJ stated  at         in ordinary circumstances  a finding of fact  including an inference drawn from primary facts  will not constitute a reviewable decision because it will be no more that a step along the way to an ultimate determination  Of course an ultimate determination which depends upon a finding of fact vitiated by error of law or made without evidence is reviewable  see s   f  and  h   of the ADJR Act   In such a case the finding of fact may be challenged as an element in the review of the ultimate determination   His Honour went on to explain when a decision involves an error of law  at   A decision does not  involve  an error of law unless the error is material to the decision in the sense that it contributes to it so that  but for the error  the decision would have been  or might have been  different  The critical question on this aspect of the case is whether  but for the alleged error of law     the decision might have been different by reason of the possibility that the Tribunal would not have made the findings of fact      that  were made   Later in his Honour s reasons  the Chief Justice stated  at   that findings of fact  including inferences  will have involved an error of law where there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the finding  see s  h  of the ADJR Act   His Honour noted  again at   that the question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact  or whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed  is a question of law  and that in the context of judicial review it has been accepted that the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law  After quoting from Menzies J in Reg v District Court  Ex parte White   HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ concluded  at   that according to the Australian authorities  at common law want of logic is not synonymous with error of law  and that so long as an inference is reasonably open  even if drawn as a result of illogical reasoning  there is no place for judicial review for error of law   In oral submissions  senior counsel for Telstra stated that Telstra relied on the  common law no evidence  ground as expressed by Mason CJ in Bond    As mentioned previously  Telstra submits that there was no evidence to support ACCC s finding that Telstra was already fully recovering its line costs   Although Telstra accepts that ACCC had expressed its view that Telstra was recovering its line costs at various times prior to the making of the Final Determination  it contends that it would be unsafe to assume that the support for that view continued to be available at the time of the Final Determination  For example  Telstra notes that the ADC  referred to at   above  had been  discontinued   see ACCC s Final Determination for model price terms and conditions of the PSTN  ULLS and LCS services of October   section     pp      Although at the time of its discontinuance  ACCC concluded that Telstra would still recover its line costs even without the ADC  Telstra s point is that Telstra operates in a  dynamic industry  and that its line costs and sources of recovery may change over time   If I had found that Telstra was denied procedural fairness  or that ACCC had made an error of law  Telstra would still need to show that there was at least a possibility that a different result might have been reached  Bond at   ex parte Aala at   citedBroussard v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   A party liable to be

Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Telstra refers to East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v

framework of a national competition policy   headnote  p    The facts and legislation are complex  Central to the issue for decision was s     of the National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems contained in Schedule   to the Gas Pipelines Access  South Australia  Act    SA   Section     listed in paras  a  to  k  eleven factors that were required to be considered when the initial capital base of certain pipelines was being established by a  Relevant Regulator    The High Court held that the Australian Competition Tribunal had not erred in taking as its starting point  and giving priority to  known valuation methodologies identified in the early paragraphs of paras  a  to  k    The case is not authority for the proposition that para  d  for example  of s  CR  must be accorded priority over the matters identified in the other paragraphs of that subsection  The most that can be said is that the case shows that the correct approach to a list of mandatory relevant

  where the Court stated  at       if the Full Court is properly to be understood as saying no more than that a new trial would probably make no difference to the result  their Honours failed to apply the correct criterion  All that the appellant needed to show was that the denial of natural justice deprived him of the possibility of a successful outcome  In order to negate that possibility  it was  as we have said  necessary for the Full Court to find that a properly conducted trial could not possibly have produced a different result   my emphasis   The  possibility of a different result  was also referred to in the context of alleged failure to accord procedural fairness by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Tribunal  ex parte Aala   FCA         CLR     ex parte Aala   at     and by

Capital Development Commission     FCR     Idonz   the Court refused an application by the respondents to an appeal to reopen the hearing of the appeal to allow them to call fresh evidence  One reason given by Fox J  with whom Everett J agreed  was that the evidence had been available when the appeal was heard  Other reasons given by Woodward J  in relation to the application by the second and third respondents  were that the evidence would be complex  contested and not appropriate for consideration by an appellate court  and that the evidence would have added little probative value to material already before the Court and would have related only to the possible exercise of discretion against the appellant if it were otherwise successful in its appeal   Idonz is both different from and similar to the present case  In the present case  the evidence is sought to be tendered at trial  was not available at the time of hearing  and consists simply of two documents  On the other hand  the evidence relates to the possible exercise of discretion against Telstra if it were otherwise successful on Telstra s Cost Model G rounds  Moreover  as appears below  complex questions as to the probative value of those documents are raised   Telstra submits that Request erroneously states the test as to the circumstances in which relief may be refused on discretionary grounds where a judicial review ground vitiating a decision  relevantly  a failure to take into account a relevant consideration and a denial of procedural fairness  is established  Telstra submits that to ask whether it  would have made any difference  if that ground had not existed involves legal error   Telstra submits that where there is a failure to take into account a relevant consideration  relief will be refused only if that consideration was so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision  I referred to the relevant authorities in relation to a failure to take into account a relevant consideration at   above citedInspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The ultimate

insignificant that it could not have materially affected the decision referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR     Peko Wallsend   Mason J emphasised  at   that it is generally a matter for the decision maker and not for a court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the respective matters that are required to be taken into account in the exercise of a statutory power  His Honour noted that in some circumstances a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance  or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance  but that in such a case the relevant ground of review is not the failure to take into account a relevant consideration or the taking into account of an irrelevant one  but that the decision is  manifestly unreasonable   Telstra does not rely upon a ground of manifest unreasonableness   Section  CR  provides that in making a final determination ACCC must take into account the seven matters listed in paras  a   g  of that subsection and s  CR  provides that ACCC may take into account any other matters that it thinks are relevant  Also  s  AQA  provides that ACCC must have regard to the LSS Pricing Principles if it is required to arbitrate an access dispute  The factor that should be given  fundamental weight  as against the others is the LTIE mentioned in para  a  of s  CR  because s  AB  provides that the object of Part XIC is  to promote the  LTIE         Telstra s cost model  to which Grounds    a  and   refer  is described in an affidavit of Iain Robert Little  Group Manager Economic Analysis for Telstra  as comprising two Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets on a CD which estimate Telstra s top down LSS specific costs and calculate a per unit cost for the LSS  Telstra provided the CD to ACCC  The words and figures on each of the two Spreadsheets constituted only a short vertical column or table  In the hard copy version in evidence  each occupied about half a page   Request points out that Telstra can succeed on the  relevant consideration  ground only if ACCC was bound to take Telstra s cost model into account and that doing so  could  or  might  have had a material impact on the outcome  see Peko Wallsend at      Gibbs CJ       Mason J    Section  CR  allowed ACCC to take into account any matters it thought relevant  In Peko Wallsend at     Mason J stated that where factors to be considered enumerated in a statute are not exhaustive  the Court should turn to the subject matter  scope and purpose of the statute in determining what matters a decision maker is bound to take into account  Telstra submits that in the present case this approach leads to a conclusion that ACCC was bound to take into account Telstra s cost model because it was central to the issues that ACCC was required to determine and to matters that it was expressly obliged to take into account  for example Telstra s  direct cost  of providing access to the LSS  see s  CR d    In its submissions  Telstra did not draw a clear distinction between the course of reasoning by which it contends that s  CR  coupled with general law principles produced the result that ACCC was bound to take into account Telstra s cost model  and the course of reasoning by which it contends that s  CR d  produced that result   I turn now to the duty imposed by s  DB b   Telstra submits that s  DB b   set out at   above  supports its case while Request submits that  if anything  it assists the respondents  Provisions such as s  DB b  are troublesome  It is questionable whether ultimately they have any effect at all in shaping the duty incumbent on a decision maker  The starting point in s  DB b  is a legislative demand for speed  but apparently someone appreciated that speed can come at too great a cost  and so the demand for speed is reduced to a demand that ACCC  must act  only  as speedily as a proper consideration of the dispute allows   In order to make it plain that excessive speed is to be shunned  it is acknowledged that ACCC must inquire into and investigate the dispute  carefully   Apparently it is then thought that too much care may detract from the desideratum of speed  so the words  and quickly  are added after  carefully   Adding to the confusion is the legislature s comprehensive demand that ACCC  inquire into and investigate the dispute and all matters affecting the merits  and fair settlement  of the dispute   my emphasis   The demand is that ACCC inquire into and investigate all matters affecting the merits of the dispute and all matters affecting the fair settlement of the dispute   The relevant test was described by Mason J in Peko Wallsend at   Not every consideration that a decision maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re exercised according to law  A factor might be so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision   More recently  a Full Court of this Court in Martincevic v Commonwealth     FCR   observed  at   that  It is not for the court to guess what view  the decision maker  would have taken of the report and its significance  It is enough that it cannot be said that the failure to have regard to the report was so insignificant that it could not have materially affected the decision   Second  in exercising the discretion under s  DNA b  ACCC must take into account relevant considerations that ACCC is required to take into account in the light of the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act  citing Peko Wallsend at     in support of this proposition   True backdating under s  DNA  is merely adjectival to the making of a final determination under s  CP and ACCC is required to take into account the matters specified in s  CR  both when making the final determination and when exercising its discretion in respect of backdating that determination  According to Telstra  if this were not so  backdating could undermine ACCC s findings and its balancing of the matters identified in s  CR     Resolution  In my opinion  cl  A i  was not merely an exercise of the backdating power to which s  DNA  applied  and s  CR  and s  AQA  did not apply   There is a distinction between the backdating power contained in s  DNA  and the power to decide upon the substantive provisions of a final determination that is recognised in s  CR  and   on the one hand  and s  DNA  on the other  The latter is addressed to substantive provisions which it assumes have been decided upon following the application of the s  CR  and   criteria distinguishedMinister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander

Deane J in Nevistic v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at     generally to the effect that an administrative decision maker must decide each case on its facts and merits  and must not blindly follow a fixed policy  It seems to be inherent in the submission that it should be accepted that ACCC may properly determine different charges for the supply of the  identical  LSS by Telstra to different access seekers  such as Request and Adam citedPrasad v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In so far as Telstra relies on an alleged failure by ACCC to seek further material from Telstra  Request submits that ACCC s decision would be vulnerable to attack under the ADJR Act for a failure in this respect only if the failure was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have failed to make the inquiry  Request cites Prasad v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR   at       Telstra s Ground       To what extent  if at all  did ACCC in fact engage with the Telstra cost model  Request puts its submission that ACCC engaged with Telstra s cost model in two ways  First  it submits that it should be inferred that ACCC did in fact read the Spreadsheets on the CD  but did not appreciate that they were the complete or final version of Telstra s cost model that was referred to in Telstra s submissions  Second  it submits that the FD Statement of Reasons shows that ACCC took into account the essential features of Telstra s cost model that were reflected in the Spreadsheets  even if it did not read the Spreadsheets themselves   Request submits that the passages from the FD Statement of Reasons on which Telstra relies  section       the relevant extracts from which were set out at   and   above  show only that ACCC considered that it had not received from Telstra the complete or full version of Telstra s cost model that it was expecting to receive  Request argues that Telstra ignores the heading s use of the word  Summary  and the simplistic nature of the two Spreadsheets which Telstra now characterises as constituting the cost model citedQueensland Medical Laboratory v Blewett     ALR   Telstra also referred to other authorities such as R v Toohey  ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Queensland Medical Laboratory v Blewett     ALR   and Epic Energy  distinguishedR v Hunt  ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In support of this  fundamental weight  submission  Telstra relies on R v Hunt  ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Sean Investments   which concerned s  AA  of the National Health Act    Cth   That Act provided for the approval of premises as nursing homes  and made approval subject to a condition that the fees charged in respect of nursing home care of a  qualified nursing home patient  would not exceed fees payable in accordance with a scale determined by the Permanent Head of the relevant Department  Section  AA  directed the Permanent Head to  have regard to costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in the nursing home    Mason J held that those words required the Permanent Head to take those costs into account and  to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making his determination   at    His Honour gave two reasons for this conclusion  First  they were the only matter explicitly mentioned as a matter required to be taken into account  and second  the scheme of the provisions was that once premises were approved as a nursing home  the proprietor was bound by the conditions of approval not to exceed the scale of fees fixed  His Honour observed that in many cases it was to be expected that the scale of fees would be fixed by reference to the costs necessarily incurred plus a profit factor  and that in the nature of things the costs necessarily incurred were a fundamental matter for consideration   Sean Investments is distinguishable  It is readily understandable that the fees to be fixed must cover the costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in the particular nursing home  Approval of the particular nursing home would be frustrated if the level of fees permitted to be charged did not cover those costs  In the present case  there are a range of factors that ACCC is required to take into account referred toR v The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  ACCC made submissions only in relation to issues of law of general importance relating to its power and procedures under the Act  and other exceptional matters  ACCC referred to the principles established in R v The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR     Hardiman   at     as the reason for its limited participation  ACCC s submissions related to aspects of Section A  Telstra s Cost Model  Section B  Invalidity of Final Determination  and Section F  Disconnection Charges  Backdating and the  No Charge Period    ACCC also addressed submissions to Telstra s Ground   but  as noted previously  that ground is no longer relevant    Request concedes that the Final Determination is amenable to review under the ADJR Act  No party addressed submissions independently to s  B  of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Judiciary Act   In its written closing submissions  Request for the first time submitted that it was  unlikely  that the Court had jurisdiction under s  B  of the Judiciary Act on the ground that ACCC  as distinct from its Commissioners  was not an  officer of the Commonwealth   Nothing turns on the point  In addition to its jurisdiction under the ADJR Act  the Court has relevant jurisdiction under s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act and s  A of the Act   Within Div   the  Arbitration of access disputes  is the subject matter of Subdiv C  ss  CO  CU  and the  Procedure in arbitrations  is the subject matter of Subdiv D  ss  CV  DMA    Request responds by referring to the limited role permitted to a decision maker such as ACCC in defending its decisions  see Hardiman at      The role of ACCC is one of arbitrating an access dispute between a carrier or carriage service provider and an access seeker   In my opinion  the counsel given to administrative tribunals by the High Court in Hardiman applied to ACCC in that role  As noted at   above  ACCC has led no evidence  and has made submissions only on particular issues that it has perceived to be of general importance in relation to its powers and procedures  ACCC informed Request and Telstra prior to the hearing that it would act in accordance with Hardiman   It was open to Telstra or Request to subpoena ACCC officers to attend to give evidence or to produce documents  The absence of more direct evidence of the course of ACCC s deliberations is not to count against either of them more than it is against the other citedR v Toohey  ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Telstra also referred to other

question arises whether  in the light of my factual conclusions above  ACCC s consideration of Telstra s cost model was sufficient to amount to an  active intellectual process   More specifically  did an  active intellectual process  require ACCC to manipulate or sensitivity test Telstra s cost model  Telstra points to statements made by ACCC in the context of ACCC s consideration of similar cost models in regulatory matters  which Telstra says demonstrate the importance that ACCC places on sensitivity testing in order to gauge the value of cost models  In my view  evidence of this kind shows
