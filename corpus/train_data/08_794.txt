The respondent submits that where notice in terms of s   was required  but not given  in respect to the alleged missed credits and payments  then the bankruptcy notice is nevertheless invalid and a nullity and is not saved by the operation of s   of the Act   This  he submits  is so on two separate grounds  First  the proper completion of item   in the Schedule to bankruptcy notices is a requirement made essential by the Act   Second  in this case  the missed payments and credits not reflected against item   could reasonably mislead a debtor in the position of Mr Cumins as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  The respondent  in this respect  relies upon Adams v Lambert   HCA         CLR   at     He submits that as he had not personally made the garnishee and PAYG payments or done the ATO calculations for credits  he could have no idea of what was or was not comprised in the figure   in Item     In Adams v Lambert  upon which the respondent relies  the bankruptcy notice was said to have been invalid because it referred to the incorrect statutory provision under which interest was claimed  It did not concern any asserted overstatement in the bankruptcy notice of the amount due  Section   had no application  Section   did have application but the case is of no assistance in dealing with the nature of the interrelationship between s   and s     Alternatively  even if relevant notice under s   had been given  s   would have no application  I have found that there was no overstatement of the amount due under the bankruptcy notice  No other formal defect or irregularity is relied upon by the respondent   In the present case  the applicant either obtains  the benefit  of s   because no notice was given  or alternatively  if notice was given she has rebutted the allegations of misstatements in the amount stated to be due under the bankruptcy notice  Section   relieves against the invalidating consequences of mistakes in the preparation of a bankruptcy notice  Adams v Lambert at   and    There were no mistakes in the present bankruptcy notice  The section assumes the existence of a defect or irregularity  This much was

Infomercial Management Group Pty Ltd   VSC   at   the Supreme Court of Victoria held that certain Infomercial schemes were a fraud on the investors  if not on the Australian Taxation Office  These schemes  so claims the respondent  were the ones in which he had invested   Importantly  other than in relation to a very small sum comprised in the   assessment  none of the November   assessments concerned the respondent s investments in the Infomercial Schemes  The assessment for   for     was subject to objections by the respondent  These objections failed  as did a subsequent review before

FCA  html  However  it was not until the respondent s group certificate was lodged by his employer with the applicant on   August   that the applicant was able to identify that the above PAYG instalments had been received on behalf of the respondent  Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at     The respondent submits accordingly that the effective date of payment of   on his behalf was   August   and that this amount relating to the   tax year should have been included in item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  as  payments made    The last two payments were received after the date of the judgment and before the issue of the bankruptcy notice   The general interest charge credits  said to have been omitted from item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  related to seven garnishee payments totalling   for each of the months November   to May   inclusive  Each garnishee payment was in the amount of   and was said to have been mailed by the respondent s employer about the beginning of each month from December   to June   inclusive  to the applicant to an address   GPO Box  SS Melbourne Vic    Each payment  the respondent submits  was  by virtue of s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  deemed to have been received on the fourth working day after posting and thereby  in each case to have been received by the applicant for the purposes of s  AAZM of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth    However  the applicant says that the amount of these seven payments  totalling   was not received until   September   and was then credited to the respondent s account on that date   In any event  the applicant s considered view was that the PAYG payments of   in respect of the   tax year did not give rise to any entitlement in the respondent to have that amount included in item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  That view was vindicated by Siopis J at first instance  Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   and on appeal  Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FACFA   in proceedings in which the respondent sought to have the bankruptcy notice set aside for this very reason   The respondent s further and better particulars of its grounds of opposition assert  in effect  that he did not have  at the times of the hearings at first instance and on appeal  the evidence disclosing the details of the PAYG payments made  This is of no consequence  Both cases dealt with the total amount of    It matters not  in the result  that some payments were received before  and some after  the judgment date   If I am wrong about the reach of para   and it is sufficient to embrace the alleged misstatements relied upon  I  nonetheless  am not persuaded that there were such misstatements in the bankruptcy notice as asserted  As to the   PAYG payments  the respondent submits that an issue estoppel does not arise between these parties in the petition proceedings by reason of the matters decided by Siopis J and the Full Court  It is unnecessary to decide that question  I have considered both cases and respectfully am in agreement with the reasons and conclusions of Siopis J  particularly at   where his Honour said  I reject the applicant s submission  In my view  the question of when the credit in respect of the PAYG deductions accrued to the applicant is to be assessed by reference to s     of Sch   of the TAA  There is no reason not to give effect to that statutory provision  It follows that the applicant only became entitled to the credit once the assessment was made for the tax year in respect of which the PAYG deductions were made  In those circumstances  I find that at the time of the issue of the bankruptcy notice on   March   the sum of   did not comprise an amount in respect of which a deduction should have been recorded in the bankruptcy notice  as either a payment made or a credit due  The bankruptcy notice did not  therefore  overstate the amount due and was not invalid  I decline to set it aside   There was no challenge to this particular finding on appeal  Nonetheless  the Full Court at   noted its agreement with it   The respondent further submits that the proper characterisation of the PAYG instalments in issue for the purposes of item   of the bankruptcy notice is as  payments made   This  he says  avoids the confusion generated by focusing on the phrase  credits allowed  and meshing that with the giving of administrative credits under the TAA when a tax assessment is made citedCumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The respondent also failed in proceedings in this Court by which he had sought to set aside the bankruptcy notice  This culminated in the dismissal of his appeal to the Full Court in December   Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC     On   November   the respondent s solicitors wrote to the AAT requesting it to reinstate the AAT proceedings abandoned by the respondent in    This was shortly after the Court of Appeal dismissed the respondent s appeal against the decision refusing an extension of time within which to appeal  The Tribunal has yet to make a decision whether to reinstate the proceedings  The applicant has opposed the application for reinstatement   Since then the respondent has filed a further application in the AAT  The application is to extend time for lodging an application for review of a decision  It concerns the sum of   which forms a part of the respondent s taxable income for the year ended   June   and which was the subject of the amended tax assessment issued on   November    It is yet to be determined   The amount of   is included in the amount of   contained at item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  That figure also includes two other amounts according to an affidavit sworn by Nola Kathryn Rice  a public service employee with the ATO  Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC   at     The respondent acknowledges this in his affidavit sworn   May    The amounts are set out under para   above  There was no reason  in my view  for the applicant to think that para   was directed to an overcharge of general interest charges related to seven of the garnishee payments totalling   allegedly made prior to the date of judgment   Further  in my opinion  nothing in para   would have alerted the applicant to the matter of the PAYG payments citedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The alleged misstatements  by reason of missed credits and payments in item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  originally fell into the following four categories  The third and fourth of these were the subject of an earlier decision in this matter  Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins  No     FCA    They are not pressed by the respondent  leaving only the first two categories for consideration         a  PAYG payments totalling   received on behalf of the respondent by the applicant effectively on   August        b  general interest charge credits arising from garnishee payments totalling   made by the respondent before the date of judgment but not credited to his account until after the date of judgment  resulting in an unquantified overcharge of general interest charges  The overcharge relates to the periods from the respective dates of receipt  as contended for by the respondent  to the judgment date  The applicant did not claim interest in the bankruptcy notice for the post judgment period     c  missed credits amounting to     and     d  a rounding credit of four cents   PAYG payments were made on the respondent s behalf by his employer for the   tax year as follows    PAYG Period Date Received by the ATO Amount of PAYG Paid   July       August       September       October       November       December       January       February       March       April       May       June       Applying even the most benevolent constitution to the last sentence in para   I do not consider that it provides sufficient information to enable the applicant to identify the asserted misstatements presently relied upon  So far as concerns the alleged misstatements said to arise by reason of missed credits amounting to     as well as rounding credit of four cents I repeat what I said in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins  No     particularly at     The respondent then submits that para   taken as a whole  is sufficient to embrace the misstatements related to the PAYG and garnishee payments  He says that he was at a  severe informational disadvantage  during the period when a s   notice had to be given  I take this to mean  at least  that during the period in which notice was required to be given he did not have a copy of the taxation account maintained in respect to him by the applicant showing amounts received from him or on his behalf from time to time  A copy of this document was before the Court  It is discovered document No   in Part   of Schedule   in the applicant s list of documents made pursuant to orders   and   of District Registrar Jan made on   January   filed on the   February    It is described as the  Original income tax account history for Brian Cumins showing transactions and interest for the period       to       and is dated         If the respondent had had a copy of this document during the period in which notice under s   might have been given by him to the applicant  he would have seen  for example  that  contrary to his understanding  the seven alleged garnishee payments of   each had not been recorded as received by the applicant in each month from December   to June   inclusive  Further  in relation to the   PAYG payments he would have seen that this amount in respect of the financial year ended   June   was not credited to his account until   July    This too would have been contrary to his understanding that it should have been credited to his taxation account in the period between the date of judgment and the date of the bankruptcy notice  He would have had sufficient information to give notice under s   in respect to both of those matters   In this context the respondent submits that where a government body is involved and has the benefit of a statutory regime  the s   notice requirements should not be interpreted strictly or narrowly  There is  in my opinion  no basis to this submission  There is only one proper construction of the section  What will constitute sufficient notice will vary from one case to another  If a debtor does not have the necessary information to enable notice to be given under s   and could not have obtained it by reasonable endeavours  then this may well form a basis for seeking an extension of time under s  c  for giving notice when that information  by whatever means  comes into the hands of the debtor  cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins  No     FCA   at         I decided there that the respondent could  merely by making a request  have obtained a copy of his taxation account from the applicant  I would not revise that conclusion even after considering the content of paras     of the affidavit of Mr Kevin Dundo sworn on   April    I do not accept that the respondent was at any disadvantage in this respect  If he was  it was occasioned by his own inaction   The respondent points to the fact that the sum of   mentioned in para   is a multiple of   which was the amount garnisheed on a monthly basis in the hands of the respondent s employer  This  he submits  should have alerted the applicant to look closely at payments received and credits allowed in respect of the period after judgment and before the bankruptcy notice issued  I do not accept that submission  The onus is upon the respondent to sufficiently articulate the misstatements upon which it relies   Even if para   were thought to have put the applicant on such a train of enquiry  it would have been unproductive  First  the period mentioned in para   concerning payments of   is said to be between May   to   March    However  what is now complained about concerns seven payments of   totalling   alleged to have been made between December   to June    This involves an overlap of but two months across a combined period of   months  Second  according to the applicant s records  the amount of   was received together with one other payment of   a total of   on   September    This amount was included in the figure set out under item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  Paragraph   states that the   was paid to the applicant between May   and   March    Obviously   September falls between those two dates  The applicant did direct its attention to garnishee payments made by the respondent for the purposes of the bankruptcy notice and gave a credit in item   for   which amount includes the    The   comprises the following garnishee payments made according to the applicant s records  between the date of the judgment and the date of the bankruptcy notice   As to the garnishee payments of   it is unnecessary to decide when they were received by the applicant  whether on   September   as the applicant contends  or on various dates between December   and   June   according to the respondent  Accepting for present purposes only that they were received on the dates asserted by the respondent  the resultant overcharge of general interest charges extends only to the date of judgment  The applicant did not claim interest in the bankruptcy notice for the post judgment period  Accordingly  it is the amount of the judgment debt which would  to the extent of those overcharges  be incorrect  Such amounts were not credits or payments required to be included in item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  What I said in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins  No     FCA   at   is apt on this point  The fact of such an overcharge would not operate to render  as a matter of law  the amount due under the bankruptcy notice as incorrect   The respondent  despite an invitation by counsel for the applicant to seek an extension of time under s  c  of the Act for the giving of a notice under s   covering the alleged missed payments or credits  declined to do so  Accordingly  the position of the respondent is  as is evident also from his outline of closing submissions  confined to reliance upon para   of Mr Dundo s affidavit as constituting notice under s   for the purposes of the alleged missed payments and credits   If the respondent had sought such an extension of time  I would have refused to grant it on discretionary grounds as being futile for the same reasons as are set out under paras     above   The respondent further submits that even if it were to be accepted that he is presently facing an unshakeable claim of some     million in respect of the   assessment  that figure raises very different issues in relation to possible payment or compromise of the claim than if he were to face the current   million claim in the bankruptcy notice  The figure of     million is  I infer  a reference to a finding made in an earlier decision that the total amount of the judgment debt which is not related to the AAT applications is in the order of     million  Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins   FCA   at      Mr Kevin Dundo in his   April   affidavit annexed a copy of the Outline of Submissions filed by the respondent in his application to the AAT seeking an extension of time for lodging an application to review the decision of the applicant made in an amended assessment in respect of the   tax year pursuant to s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  as well as his application in that matter for amendment or extension of the grounds of the objection lodged by him in respect of the amended assessment pursuant to s  ZZK a  of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth    There was no argument before me as to the content of these submissions  I earlier refused to adjourn the hearing of this petition despite the currency of the respondent s two applications to the AAT  I was not then satisfied that the respondent had established genuine and arguable grounds in relation to either of his AAT applications  Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins   FCA    That position has not altered  The respondent s submissions on the exercise of discretion are predicated upon his being successful  on the merits  before the AAT  The likelihood of that occurring has not been established citedEmerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I reject this submission  On   May   the judgment debt was varied by the Supreme Court of Western Australia to reduce it by      This reflects the amount of certain payments and credits which  since the date of judgment  the applicant volunteered should be applied to the judgment debt by way of reduction  The bankruptcy notice claimed an amount that is calculated by reference to the amount of the original judgment  It is not to the point that the amount of that judgment has been reduced  Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at    The affidavit of Deborah Jayne Thiele sworn on   May   on behalf of the applicant deposes that the amount of the outstanding debt as at that date was      This is the amount contained in the Amended Creditor s Petition less the amount by which the judgment debt was varied as well as the further amount of   in respect of credits applied after December    It is the amount of the debt on which the applicant relies  This satisfies  as a matter of fact  the requirement under s  c  of the Act  followedHussain v King Investment Solutions   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The respondent submits that this paragraph constitutes notice for the purposes of s   and is wide enough to cover all of the missed credits and payments  alternatively  it is wide enough to cover at least the alleged misstatements related to the PAYG payments and garnishee payments  I am satisfied that notice for the purposes of s   could be given by means of an affidavit served on a creditor  The section is silent as to the method of giving notice and it is not necessary in giving notice to expressly refer to s   Hussain v King Investment Solutions   FCA         FCR   at          Such notice must  by virtue of s   be given by the debtor within the time allowed for payment under the bankruptcy notice  The bankruptcy notice was deemed to have been served on the respondent on   August   pursuant to orders made by Registrar Gilich on   July   in the matter of PEG   of    It was then amended on   July   by a delegate of the Official Receiver such that the respondent was required to comply with the terms of the notice within   days after   August    The affidavit was served on the Commissioner on   August    Accordingly  notice was given within the time allowed   However  in my opinion it does not constitute notice which is wide enough to cover the asserted misstatements in the bankruptcy notice as a whole or alternatively the two related to the PAYG and garnishee payments citedMakhoul v Barnes     FCR   First the respondent submits that  even if the PAYG payments of   did not give rise to an entitlement to a credit for that amount in the bankruptcy notice  I should take into account  as a discretionary consideration  the fact that these payments were made  No issue estoppel arises in this respect  Makhoul v Barnes     FCR   at    However  the fact that payments were received which did not  as a matter of law  give rise to any entitlement to a credit in that amount for a tax debt in respect of which judgment was given  does not commend itself to an exercise of discretion not to make a sequestration order in the overall circumstances of the case  I would not exercise my discretion to that end discussedPedikaris v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The respondent submits that on this point the decision in Pedikaris v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  No     FCA   should be followed  Particular reliance is placed on para    I do not agree  At that paragraph  Graham J was considering the relevance of PAYG payments in the context of recovery proceedings  Furthermore  his Honour  at paras     made findings on the issue of when the Commissioner was obliged to give credits for PAYG payments which are entirely consistent

such as the small mistake in the present case  and that unnecessary and wasteful litigation will eventuate  It is no answer to say that the creditor can ask for particulars  since the debtor would not

Donald   FCA     decided before St George   Lindgren J also considered the application of s    The case concerned a bankruptcy notice  the form of which  as in this case  was that set out in Form   Schedule   prescribed under the Bankruptcy Regulations    Cth  reg     discussedSeovic Civil Engineering Pty Ltd v Groeneveld   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I respectfully consider that the wider construction in Robert Hudson Jnr is to be preferred to the narrow construction in St George   It would appear that the decision in Robert Hudson Jnr was not brought to the attention of the Court in St George   nor does it appear from his Honour s reasons that there was full argument on the question  Accordingly  I would respectfully adopt the reasoning on this point in Robert Hudson Jnr   In doing so  I am conscious that St George was followed by the Federal Magistrates Court in SGRO v Liberty Funding Pty Ltd     ALR    Once again  however  Robert Hudson Jnr was not cited by the parties or considered by the Court  Furthermore  s   in contrast to s   is not expressed in terms of the existence of a  defect  in a bankruptcy notice  Rather  it concerns whether the amount specified in the bankruptcy notice as due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due  Inevitably any overstatement will broadly be for one or two reasons  First  there is an error or errors in one or more of items     set out in column   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  Then  when items     are added up they produce an excessive total at item    Second  there is an arithmetical error in adding up items      Of course there could be errors of both kinds occurring in the one notice  The intent of s   is  in my opinion  to consider the question of whether the amount stated is excessive as well as why that is the case  This approach to its construction is consistent with the observations of the Full Court in Seovic at   to which I have referred concerning the need for the debtor  when giving notice under s   to provide sufficient information to enable the creditor to identify the nature of the misstatement  I apprehend that this was intended to mean that information needs to be provided disclosing not just that the amount stated as due is excessive but the reason s  why that is said to be so   The Full Court in Seovic Civil Engineering

correctness of both Re Charles Murray     ABC   at   upon which the respondent here relies  as well as Re Wilhemsen  Ex parte Gould     FCR   at    It said at   The expression  the misstatement  strongly suggests that the debtor must do more than merely assert that there is a misstatement in the bankruptcy notice  The subsection requires the debtor to provide sufficient information in the notice to enable a creditor to identify what is said to be the alleged misstatement  Only then does the debtor s notice displace the general rule established by s   that the bankruptcy notice is not invalidated only by reason that the sum specified therein as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due   emphasis in original   The Court continued    The point of the notice is to draw to the creditor s attention the misstatement  thereby giving the creditor the opportunity to consider  for example  whether the bankruptcy notice should be withdrawn and a fresh notice  correcting the misstatement  issued  If the creditor is given no hint in the notice as to the nature of the misstatement  there is a considerable risk that the debtor will be able to take unmeritorious advantage of minor errors  such as the small mistake in the present case  and that unnecessary and wasteful litigation will eventuate  It is no answer to say that the creditor can ask for particulars  since the debtor would not be obliged to give any until after litigation had been instituted  Indeed  a debtor wishing to take advantage of the technicalities of the law of bankruptcy might be well advised to say as little as possible for as long as possible about the true nature of the alleged misstatement in the bankruptcy notice   The requirement for some specificity did not  the Full Court considered  extend to require the identification of the misstatement with  complete precision  or that the debtor  specify the exact amount of the alleged excess   A debtor s notice

upon the decision in St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla   FCA         ALR   in which Heerey J concluded that no notice under s   was required to be given  The bankruptcy notice in that case was identified as being defective in two respects  First  credits and payments totalling approximately     million had been omitted from item   of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice  Second  the total amount due exceeded the amount in fact due to the extent of the omitted credits and payments  It was held that the defect in the bankruptcy notice was not   only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due   There was another  albeit related  defect  namely  the omitted credits and payments under item     In Robert Hudson  Junior  v Thomas James Donald   FCA     decided before St George   Lindgren J also considered the application of s    The case concerned a bankruptcy notice  the form of which  as in this case  was that set out

determination of complex accounting issues as between the petitioning creditor and debtor  This is not such a case  No complex accounting issues are present   I would not exercise my discretion under s  b  in favour of the respondent on any of these bases   I am satisfied that the respondent committed the act of bankruptcy alleged in the petition as amended  and that the matters set out in s   of the Act have been proved  I am also satisfied that there has been compliance with the Federal Court  Bankruptcy Rules     Cth  citedWhite Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA

success by him in the proceedings before the AAT to have that matter re opened and the interest deduction for borrowings in respect of the Infomercials allowed  would be that there was  in any event  still at least  part of the assessment  unaffected by the Infomercial interest  standing  If he succeeds in the AAT proceedings  the Commissioner must implement the findings of the AAT and a fresh assessment would have to be issued  s  ZZL of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  and s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   Only if and when that assessment occurs would there be an
