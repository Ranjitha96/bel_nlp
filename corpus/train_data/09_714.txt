Singleton  in the matter of Allcommercial Finance Australia Pty Limited   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toRe ACN       Ltd     ACSR  In Re ACN       Ltd     ACSR   at   Austin J said that    In formulating his or her attitude to a proposed agreement the liquidator must act in good faith and for a proper purpose but  provided he or she does so the court gives the liquidator considerable latitude in exercising his or her commercial judgment referred toRe GA Listing   Maintenance Pty Ltd     ACSR  The principles which govern the exercise of the Court s power under s  B  have been considered in a number of authorities  In Re GA Listing   Maintenance Pty Ltd     ACSR   at   Young J said that    The whole purpose of liquidation is  to borrow a metaphor used by Sir Laurence Street some years ago  to lead the horse back into the stable      Any activity which marks a substantial deviation from the activity of  leading the horse back to the stable  is  generally speaking  outside the power of the liquidator  However  human activity is so diverse that there will be situations where the liquidator cannot lead the horse back to the stable by the direct route  He may have to pause along the way because the path is blocked by some litigation or other impediment referred toRe Spedley Securities Ltd     ACSR  His Honour referred to the observations of Giles J in Re Spedley Securities Ltd     ACSR   at      Giles J there observed that the Court will not ordinarily interfere unless there can be seen to be a lack of good faith  an error or law or principle  or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator s conduct referred toWarne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR  In Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Austin J said that    Generally speaking  the court grants approval under s  B  only where the transaction is for the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company  I am satisfied in the present case on the evidence before me that the liquidators have acted in good faith and for a proper purpose  They have retained the services of  and acted upon the advice of  leading solicitors to advise them in relation to the liquidation of the company  The liquidators have satisfied themselves that The power of attorney which is the subject of the present application is an irrevocable power of attorney and will survive the company s deregistration  Such a power of attorney is authorised by legislation in New South Wales  Victoria  Queensland  Western Australia and the Northern Territory  The relevant legislative provisions are referred to in MFI   and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them  As is observed in MFI   the position is less certain in Tasmania  South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory  however this difficulty is overcome because the proposed deed provides for an assignment of the financial facilities and securities to the trustee as may be required
