SZLGM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedRe Refugee Tribunal Ex Parte H   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Even assuming that that is the basis of challenge it faces the difficulty that there is not a scintilla of evidence of actual bias on the part of the Tribunal and neither is there to be found in the Tribunal s reasons anything which would give rise to the objective possibility of bias  having regard to what was said by the High Court in respect of such a challenge in Re Refugee Tribunal Ex Parte H   HCA         ALJR   at   para    Thus  however one approaches ground   whether from a perspective of a challenge to credibility findings or from the perspective of a repetition of a bias challenge  there is no merit in that ground   Ground   is not  in terms a ground of jurisdictional error  although in fairness and having regard to the reference in the ground to the Magistrate s conclusion at para   of this reasons for judgment  I take that ground to be a repetition of the allegation that the Tribunal breached s   of the Migration Act and that the learned Magistrate erred in not so finding  There was certainly a development of argument in the Appellant s oral submissions that there had been a breach of s     although as was  with respect  correctly submitted on behalf of the Minister  there was an absence of particularity in the basis of challenge as developed in those oral submissions   In the notice of appeal  para   the Appellant alleges  or at least states  that he does not know why the Magistrate  I infer  could not listen to the recording tapes of the Tribunal s hearing  He makes reference to his absence of financial resources and consequent inability to afford the fee in respect of obtaining the transcript of the Tribunal s hearing  It was not  though  for the Magistrate of his own motion to obtain such a transcript citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is worth repeating  lest the Appellant think that I differ from the Federal Magistrate in this regard  that the Tribunal was not obliged to disclose to him under s   its mental processes or to give a running commentary on what it thought about the evidence that he was giving  The authority to which the Federal Magistrate makes reference  SZBEL v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALJR   at   para   binds me as much as it did the Federal Magistrate in this regard   Overall there is undoubtedly a feeling of disappointment on the part of the Appellant that his claimed basis for his protection visa was not upheld  However  and it is a significant  however  as I have already stated it is not the role of a court on a judicial review proceeding to revisit merits and much less is it the role of this Court  The bases of challenge which are set out in the notice of appeal are not  in my opinion  made out  That is so whether one regards the challenge made in ground   as a challenge to credibility findings on the basis of illogicality or irrationality or whether one regards that ground as a repetition of the bias ground that was advanced before the Federal Magistrate   For these reasons  then  the appeal in my opinion must be dismissed     I certify that the preceding twenty   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan    Associate Dated    August   Counsel for the Appellant  The Appellant appeared in person     Solicitor for the Respondents  Australian Government Solicitor   Date of Hearing    August       Date of Judgment    August         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
