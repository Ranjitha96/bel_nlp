that an appeal lies  on a question of law  only and not on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact  see Comcare v Etheridge   FCAFC   at       the issues before me are whether such a question has

Kronen s conception of what is signified by the words  to be negotiated  in s    What is clear is that the level of permissible compromise and of required mutual agreement that this formula might otherwise suggest when used in other contexts  is radically curtailed in this statutory setting  Whether one can say that the ordinary meaning of  negotiate  is what is intended here  albeit what can be negotiated is limited by the Act and its purposes  hence the meaning is a question of fact  Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at    proposition   or that its meaning and hence proper construction is contrived by its legislative settings  hence are questions of law  Pozzolanic      propositions   and   what is clear is that Mr Kronen misapprehends the latitude the Act gives him  Elblematic of this was his presenting Maxima with negotiation procedures which included referral to an independent panel if any terms could not be agreed  If Mr Kronen is to qualify for a newstart allowance  he was required  in the circumstances  enter into an activity agreement  s  e  he was required to undertake one or more activities that the Secretary regarded as suitable for the person  s   the terms of the agreement were to be approved by the Secretary  In this scheme  the  right to negotiate  could be illusory in quite some degree for some purposes and especially when the Secretary  or a delegate  takes decisions or actions in effectuation of the purposes of the Act itself  This is not to say that there was no room for discussion  accommodation and compromise  Rather  it is to recognise that the actual terms of the negotiation itself were something in relation to which the Secretary  acting reasonably and in good faith  could ultimately dictate  approve or disapprove  if there was to be an agreement  The Tribunal clearly understood this was the case  see Reasons      It committed no error of law in construing and hence giving legal effect to the  negotiation expectation  of s   as it did  Further  the Tribunal satisfied itself on the evidence before it that the requirements Maxima sought to impose were reasonable and that those upon which Mr Kronen insisted were unreasonable in the circumstances  These fact findings were open to it and were unimpeachable in this proceeding
