Massih v Esber   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCassegrain v CTK Engineering   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  That process relevantly commenced with the making of an order for the payment of costs by the Supreme Court and the subsequent issue by a costs assessor of a certificate pursuant to s   of the Legal Profession Act   Section   of that Act provides for the finality of such determinations as follows  Determination to be final A costs assessor s determination of an application is binding on all parties to the application and no appeal or other assessment lies in respect of the determination  except as provided by this Division   Provision is made for the review of determinations made  ss     and for an appeal against a decision of a costs assessor   as to a matter of law    s    See  O Brien v Doherty   NSWSC     Cassegrain v CTK Engineering   NSWSC   consideredChesson v Smith     FCR   Some decisions involving the application of s  g  have involved circumstances in which a costs order has been made in an interlocutory application and the question as to whether the   cross claim  set off or cross demand   sought to be relied upon could have been raised in that interlocutory application  Notwithstanding the interlocutory nature of a proceeding  reliance in such cases is placed upon s   of the   Act which relevantly provides as follows  For the purposes of paragraph  g       b  a judgment or order that is enforceable as  or in the same manner as  a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which  or in consequence of which  the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained       One such decision is Re Gould  Ex parte Skinner     FLR    An application had there been made for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of property  That application failed because there was a failure to establish that an undertaking as to damages would have had any substance  The cross claim or set off was there said to be a claim for damages for breach of an obligation as encumbrancee to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of the property  That cross claim or set off  Fitzgerald J held  could not have been set up in the action seeking the interlocutory injunction  His Honour concluded  at     It was not in dispute before me that the order for costs upon the dismissal of the application for an interlocutory injunction in Queensland Supreme Court action No   of   is one which is enforceable as or in the same manner as a final judgment obtained in an action in that Court  The order for costs is therefore deemed by s  b  of the Act to be a  final judgment so obtained  that is  a  final judgment  obtained in an  action   However  s  b  of the Act does not stop there  the  action  is identified  For the purposes of s  g  the statutory fiction effected by the deeming is extended to convert the  proceedings  in which the order was in fact obtained into the  action  in which the notional  final judgment  was obtained  In my opinion  the test in such circumstances called for by s  g  of the Act is to ascertain not whether the cross demand could have been set up in the Supreme Court action No   of   but whether it could have been set up in the deemed action  the proceeding in which the order for costs was made  that is  the application for an interlocutory injunction in that action  The answer is clearly negative       Another comparable decision is Chesson v Smith     FCR    An application had there been filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act    NSW  out of time  The application was dismissed with costs  A certificate of taxation issued and  subsequently  a bankruptcy notice  It was accepted that there was a cross demand which exceeded the debt  But it was not a cross demand which could have been set up in the   proceeding   that   proceeding   either being the application for the interlocutory order for leave or the application for the costs order in that interlocutory application   In the present Application there was a lack of precision in the identification by the Applicant of the   action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained    At the outset of oral submissions it was contended that the   action or proceeding   was to be found in the Supreme Court proceedings and was either   i  the claim for declaratory relief  together with costs  or  more narrowly    ii  the claim for the costs order    An analogy was sought to be drawn between the interlocutory nature of the   proceeding   before Hall J in the Supreme Court and the decisions in Re Gould and Chesson v Smith   The narrower the identification of the   proceeding   the easier the Applicant contended it was to conclude that the claim in respect of losses could not have been set up as an answer  A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that   where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings  that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained  see s b     By the end of oral submissions  however  the Applicant contended that the   action or proceeding   was   iii  the   proceeding   in the District Court whereby judgment was entered for the sum of money assessed in the

Justice Hall of that Court published reasons for his decision that the Plaintiff had an interest in the development property and was entitled to   of the profits on sale  His Honour granted leave to the parties   to bring in short minutes of orders to give effect to the orders proposed   Esber v Massih   NSWSC    That was done by way of orders made on   March   including an order that   there be an account of such profits   and an order that the   Defendant pay the Plaintiff s costs of the proceedings as assessed or agreed     A Certificate of Determination of Costs dated   October

variation of the judgment of Hall J by way of a declaration that   the defendant is entitled to contribution from the plaintiff to half of any losses from the development and sale of the property    An Amended Notice of Motion was resolved by Acting Justice Bryson on   July   when His Honour concluded in relevant part    The order which the trial Judge made on that subject was  obviously in its terms  interlocutory  it is not a final order and could not be the source of any estoppel or res judicata  The order speaks extremely briefly of an account of profits  obviously in contemplation of further detailed directions about the taking of such an account and about what was to be done with the matter ascertained on taking the account        An order for an account of profits  including the order made on   March   which used  such profits  to refer back to the declaration previously made  on its ordinary and natural meaning and without any further exposition is an order for an account of losses if matter accounted for should have generated losses  If the Court had intended anything so strange as an account or enquiry limited only to profits  and to leave ascertainment of losses  if there should be any  to be neglected and not dealt with  there would have been a marked departure from the Court s statutory duty to resolve the whole controversy  If the order of   March   had been intended to effect any  sic  so strange a result I am confident that it would say so in a highly explicit manner   Those provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of immediate relevance to the Application now before this Court are ss  g  and       Section  g  of the   Act provides as follows    Acts of bankruptcy   A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases       g  if a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order  being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed  has served on the debtor in Australia or  by leave of the Court  elsewhere  a bankruptcy notice under this Act and the debtor does not   i  where the notice was served in Australia  within the time specified in the notice  or  ii  where the notice was served elsewhere  within the time fixed for the purpose by the order giving leave to effect the service  comply with the requirements of the notice or satisfy the Court that he or she has a counter claim  set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt or sum payable under the final order  as the case may be  being a counter claim  set off or cross demand that he or she could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained     followedFranks v Warringah Council   FCA       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It is not considered that the   final judgment or final order   could be constituted by the order for costs made by the Supreme Court  either on its own or together with the Certificate of Determination of Costs   Franks v Warringah Council   FCA       FCR    A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor  without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction  is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice  Snelgrove v Roskell   FCA   at       FCR   at   per Jacobson J  In Franks   the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council s costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act    NSW   A bankruptcy notice was served  the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate  Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows    It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s  J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation  The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court  having received the determination of the costs assessor  it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act   The first option  it argued  was the option of filing the certificate issued under s  J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained  The second option  it argued  was the option which it in fact adopted  that is  the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s  J  The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor   Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded    The submissions of the Council identified in   are  in my view  unsustainable  Section  g  does not  as it seems to me  admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt  or perhaps more accurately  sourced from the same obligation  Further  s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution  Re Pannowitz  Ex parte Wilson     FLR   at   per Riley J   I incline to the view that Pt   r   of the Supreme Court Rules  NSW  as presently worded  does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed  It seems to me to be implicit in Pt   r   as presently worded  that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act         I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded  and which is attached to it as required by Form   is not  a final judgment or final order  being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed  within the meaning of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act  followedGuss v Johnstone   HCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  To   satisfy   the Court it is not necessary for the debtor to prove  as on a final hearing  the asserted entitlement to recover as against the creditor  That which is to be established is whether the Court is   satisfied   that the debtor   has a claim deserving to be finally determined   Re Glew  Glew v Harrowell   FCA   at       FCA       ALR   at    Lindgren J there observed    There are authorities suggesting that Glew and Tresidder must satisfy me of the following interrelated and sometimes overlapping matters    that they have a  prima facie case  even if they do not adduce evidence which would be admissible on a final hearing making out that case      that they have  a fair chance of success  or are  fairly entitled to litigate  the claim    and   that they are advancing a  genuine  or  bona fide  claim    It may be that the first and second formulations are intended to cover the same ground  In  Re Brink  Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd     FLR   Lockhart J treated  at ALR     FLR   the reference to a  prima facie case      as a reference to  a fair chance of success    This was subsequently characterised by His Honour as a   relatively low threshold   at    The judgment to be made   involves weighing up considerations as to the legal and factual merit of the claim relied upon by the debtor  and the justice of allowing the bankruptcy proceedings to go ahead or requiring them to await the determination of the claim   Guss v Johnstone   HCA   at       HCA       ALR   at   per Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ consideredIn re A Bankruptcy Notice     Ch   The present Bankruptcy Notice was served on   February   requiring either payment or the making of an   arrangement to the creditor s satisfaction for settlement of the debt   within   days  Annexed to the Bankruptcy Notice was a Certificate of Judgment of the District Court certifying the recovery of judgment in that Court   The Application was filed in this Court on   February    That Application seeks an order setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice   The power of this Court to set aside a bankruptcy notice was not questioned  Re Sterling  Ex parte Esanda Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   per Lockhart J  Dimasi v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Ltd   FCA   at       FCA       ALR   at   per Ryan J   In the present proceeding it is claimed that the Applicant has   a counter claim  set off or cross demand as referred to in s  g    of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Section   of the   Act has the effect that  upon that Application having been filed  the time for compliance with the Notice is deemed to have been extended until the Court determines the Application    The   counter claim  set off or cross demand   relied upon by the present Applicant is his right to set off the losses incurred in respect to the development of the Merrylands property  These losses  it is accepted by the parties  exceed the judgment debt upon which the Bankruptcy Notice is founded   That   counter claim  set off or cross demand   is said by the Applicant to be one that he   could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained   within the meaning of and for the purposes of s  g    The litigation in the Supreme Court dates back to   when an Amended Statement of Claim was apparently filed seeking declaratory relief as to the arrangement between the parties in respect to the development property  To be resolved was whether the nature of any arrangement between the then Plaintiff and Defendant was simply one whereby work was performed in return for remuneration or whether the parties would each be entitled to a   share of profits on sale   In In re Judd  Ex parte Pike  supra  Maughan AJ observed that the word   counter claim   most probably refers to   those claims which might be the subject of a counter claim in equity   the term   set off   was said to refer to   those claims which might be the subject of a set off at common law    And the term   cross demand   was said to be   not a technical term and must     refer to claims other than those which would be comprised in the two expressions  counter claim  and  set off        SR  NSW    at    An   unrestricted meaning   it was said  was to be given to the word   cross demand    at    The meaning of each of these terms was also explored in In re A Bankruptcy Notice     Ch    Declaratory relief sought in the Chancery Division as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property was held not to be a   counter claim  set off or cross demand    Lord Hanworth MR there observed that   set off   was   a word well known and established in its meaning    at    Of the term   cross demand   it was observed  at   I turn  therefore  to what to my mind is the wider word   cross demand   If a cross demand is only to be interpreted as meaning something which could have been introduced into the action by way of counterclaim  it adds nothing to the word  counterclaim    Cross demand  seems to me to be a word introduced in order to give a wider ambit to the meaning of these claims  something that would not be described  certainly  as a set off  something that could not have been brought in the action  something that still lies outside a counterclaim  but is of a nature which can be specified and which is of such a nature that it equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt  I do not desire to say what  cross demand  may include  but it is not difficult to say that it does not include a claim of such uncertain nature as appears in these Chancery proceedings  That claim does not appear to be one which it would be proper to describe as a cross demand  it is a claim of right which may inure ultimately for the benefit of the judgment debtor  Therefore  it appears that there is no sufficient ground for setting aside this bankruptcy notice  the bankruptcy notice stands good and must be complied with   Romer and Maugham LJJ delivered separate judgments but agreed with Lord Hanworth MR   Attached to the Bankruptcy Notice as served upon the Applicant on   February   was the judgment of the District Court  being the Certificate of Judgment signed by the Registrar of that Court  For the purposes of s  g    the   action or proceeding   in which that judgment was obtained was necessarily the District Court proceeding    A proceeding   it may be noted    may mean something as distinct from an action or any step thereunder in which final orders are made for the payment of money  It may also mean a step in an action  in which proceeding a final order is made for the payment of money   Re Black  Ex parte Jeffery     ABC   at   per Lukin J   The judgment entered by that Court was entered as a consequence of the Certificate having been issued in respect to those costs which had been ordered to be paid by the Supreme Court and the subsequent filing of that Certificate by the Respondent with the District Court  There was no suggestion that that judgment had in fact been stayed  The Bankruptcy Notice as served stated that it had not been stayed   The process whereby that judgment came to be entered by the District Court is regulated by the provisions of the Legal Profession Act    NSW  and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules    NSW     The result of the present Application  it is considered  can be stated simply  For the purposes of the present Application   it was accepted that the joint venture agreement as between the Applicant and the Respondent gave rise to losses  those losses being said to be approximately    Those losses obviously exceed the judgment debt of      But  as at the date upon which the Bankruptcy Notice was served in February   no account had been taken    as had been ordered by Hall J in March    Whether an account had or had not been taken  however  those losses could not have been set up during the process whereby the costs assessor made a determination as to costs  Nor could those losses have been set up in opposition to the filing of the Certificate of the costs assessor with the District Court and the judgment thereafter being taken to have been made by reason of s   of the Legal Profession Act    The Application to have the Bankruptcy Notice as served on   February   set aside should thus be allowed   The orders of the Court are     The Application

cross demand   it was observed  at   I turn  therefore  to what to my mind is the wider word   cross demand   If a cross demand is only to be interpreted as meaning something which could have been introduced into the action by way of counterclaim  it adds nothing to the word  counterclaim    Cross demand  seems to me to be a word introduced in order to give a wider ambit to the meaning of these claims  something that would not be described  certainly  as a set off  something that could not have been brought in the action  something that still lies outside a counterclaim  but is of a nature which can be specified and which is of such a nature that it equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt  I do not desire to say what  cross demand  may include  but it is not difficult to say that it does not include a claim of such uncertain nature as appears in these Chancery proceedings  That claim does not appear to be one which it would be proper to describe as a cross demand  it is a claim of right which may inure ultimately for the benefit of the judgment debtor  Therefore  it appears that there is no sufficient ground for setting aside this bankruptcy notice  the bankruptcy

cross claims which may be brought or to determine whether or when costs are payable  Muriniti v Lyons   NSWSC    Albeit addressing the provisions in the Legal Profession Act    NSW  Dunford J there observed    Having regard to the status and powers of Costs Assessors and the ordinary meaning of the word  assessor  I am satisfied that the powers of Costs Assessors are limited to determining the value of the work done or services rendered in circumstances where there is no dispute that costs are payable and the only issue is as to the amount  It is no part of their function to determine whether or when such costs are payable  The matters set out in s  A which they must  and in s  B which they may  take into account are all matters relevant to putting a value on the work done or services rendered and the fairness or justice of the amount claimed  but are not matters which relate to the terms of a costs agreement  particularly if oral  and whether any conditions precedent to payment have been fulfilled  The determination of such questions requires the reception of sworn evidence  which can be tested by cross examination  and an assessment of such evidence  Costs Assessors do not have the power to deal with such matters    For similar reasons it has been held that a Costs Assessor has no power to hear a cross claim by a client against a solicitor based on negligence  nor to award damages  Ryan v Hansen  supra per Kirby J  or to make an assessment when no costs are presently due and payable  Lace v Younan   NSWSC   per Master Harrison  no bill of costs rendered

McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ consideredRe Gould  Ex parte Skinner     FLR   Some decisions involving the application of s  g  have involved circumstances in which a costs order has been made in an interlocutory application and the question as to whether the   cross claim  set off or cross demand   sought to be relied upon could have been raised in that interlocutory application  Notwithstanding the interlocutory nature of a proceeding  reliance in such cases is placed upon s   of the   Act which relevantly provides as follows  For the purposes of paragraph  g       b  a judgment or order that is enforceable as  or in the same manner as  a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which  or in consequence of which  the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained       One such decision is Re Gould  Ex parte Skinner     FLR    An application had there been made for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of property  That application failed because there was a failure to establish that an undertaking as to damages would have had any substance  The cross claim or set off was there said to be a claim for damages for breach of an obligation as encumbrancee to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of the property  That cross claim or set off  Fitzgerald J held  could not have been set up in the action seeking the interlocutory injunction  His Honour concluded  at     It was not in dispute before me that the order for costs upon the dismissal of the application for an interlocutory injunction in Queensland Supreme Court action No   of   is one which is enforceable as or in the same manner as a final judgment obtained in an action in that Court  The order for costs is therefore deemed by s  b  of the Act to be a  final judgment so obtained  that is  a  final judgment  obtained in an  action   However  s  b  of the Act does not stop there  the  action  is identified  For the purposes of s  g  the statutory fiction effected by the deeming is extended to convert the  proceedings  in which the order was in fact obtained into the  action  in which the notional  final judgment  was obtained  In my opinion  the test in such circumstances called for by s  g  of the Act is to ascertain not whether the cross demand could have been set up in the Supreme Court action No   of   but whether it could have been set up in the deemed action  the proceeding in which the order for costs was made  that is  the application for an interlocutory injunction in that action  The answer is clearly negative       Another comparable decision is Chesson v Smith     FCR    An application had there been filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act    NSW  out of time  The application was dismissed with costs  A certificate of taxation issued and  subsequently  a bankruptcy notice  It was accepted that there was a cross demand which exceeded the debt  But it was not a cross demand which could have been set up in the   proceeding   that   proceeding   either being the application for the interlocutory order for leave or the application for the costs order in that interlocutory application   In the present Application there was a lack of precision in the identification by the Applicant of the   action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained    At the outset of oral submissions it was contended that the   action or proceeding   was to be found in the Supreme Court proceedings and was either   i  the claim for declaratory relief  together with costs  or  more narrowly    ii  the claim for the costs order    An analogy was sought to be drawn between the interlocutory nature of the   proceeding   before Hall J in the Supreme Court and the decisions in Re Gould and Chesson v Smith   The narrower the identification of the   proceeding   the easier the Applicant contended it was to conclude that the claim in respect of losses could not have been set up as an answer  A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that   where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings  that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained  see s b     By the end of oral submissions  however  the Applicant contended that the   action or proceeding   was   iii  the   proceeding   in the

case in which judgment was obtained       Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability   In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that  at the time of judgment  the debtor was not the assignee of a debt  which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings  Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim  It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment  At p   Avory J said       I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained  even though he could  if he had chosen  have taken steps which would have rendered the counter claim available to him in the action       I think it means a counter claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action      The judgment debtor was there asserting that  despite his best endeavours  he could not obtain   factual and expert evidence   to establish his counterclaim  That was not sufficient to bring himself within s  g   Fisher J concluded  at   In my opinion these statements of principle    determine the matter against the debtor

to found a bankruptcy notice  Snelgrove v Roskell   FCA   at       FCR   at   per Jacobson J  In Franks   the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council s costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act    NSW   A bankruptcy notice was served  the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate  Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows    It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s  J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation  The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court  having received the determination of the costs assessor  it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act   The first option  it argued  was the option of filing the certificate issued under s  J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained  The second option  it argued  was the option which it in fact adopted  that is  the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s  J  The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor   Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded    The submissions of the Council identified in   are  in my view  unsustainable  Section  g  does not  as it seems to me  admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt  or perhaps more accurately  sourced from the same obligation  Further  s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution  Re Pannowitz  Ex parte Wilson     FLR   at   per Riley J   I incline to the view that Pt   r   of the Supreme Court Rules  NSW  as presently worded  does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed  It seems to me to be implicit in Pt   r   as presently worded  that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act         I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded  and which is attached to it as required by Form   is not  a final judgment or final order  being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed  within the meaning of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act    The   final judgment or final order   in the present proceeding  it was ultimately submitted by the Applicant  was the judgment of the District Court  The form of a bankruptcy notice is that prescribed by reg     of the Bankruptcy Regulations    Cth  and clause   to that form provides as follows  The creditor claims that the debt is due and payable by you  A copy of the judgments or orders relied upon by the creditor is attached  At the time of applying for this Notice  execution of the judgments or orders had not been stayed   If a bankruptcy notice is to satisfy the requirements of s   and   of the Bankruptcy Act as to form  it must correctly identify the source of the bankrupt s liability to make the payment demanded by the notice  Re Gibbs  Ex parte Triscott     FCR       ALR   at   per Drummond J  Only a judgment upon which a creditor is in a position to issue execution
