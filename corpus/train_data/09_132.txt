Corporation of the City of Adelaide v Adelaide City Fines Pty Ltd   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAinsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIf a contravention of s   of the TP Act is made out  the Court clearly has power in appropriate circumstances to grant the injunctive relief which is applicable  and similarly has power under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  to grant the declaratory relief which is  or may be  appropriate  such jurisdiction having been expressly conferred by s   of the TP Act  see eg Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR    See also s  A of the TP Act  Plainly enough  for conduct to contravene s   it must convey a representation which is misleading or deceptive  or is likely to mislead or deceive  Putting aside the issue concerning the ticket machines  the council asserts that each of the ACF Notices conveyed the following representations  that the ACF Notices were issued or authorised by the Council  or that ACF was associated or affiliated with the Council  that the ACF Notices were issued for the recovery of a fine  expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law  that ACF was authorised by law to recover a fine  expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law  and that the claim in the ACF Notice was not in respect of an alleged contractual debt  As the above discussion indicates  the dispute in this case turns upon whether those alleged representations were made  Neither ACF nor Park Fast have contended that the ACF Notices  if they conveyed those representations  were true  The case therefore is whether or not those representations were made referred toParkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhether or not a representation is made  and is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive  is a

expressly state what persons or class of persons should be considered as the possible victims for the purpose of deciding whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive  It seems clear enough that consideration must be given to the class of consumers likely to be affected by the conduct  Although it is true  as has often been said  that ordinarily a class of consumers may include the inexperienced as well as the experienced  and the gullible as well as the astute  the section must in my opinion by  sic  regarded as contemplating the effect of the conduct on reasonable members of the class  The heavy burdens which the section creates cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests

given circumstance  It is necessary to have regard to the personal capacity and experience of different people  acting reasonably  In Campomar at   the High Court said    The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconceptions  or deceptions  alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the classes of

Court said    The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconceptions  or deceptions  alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or

Whilst all persons must be considered  conduct must be tested against ordinary or reasonable members of the class and not those whose approach to the communication is fanciful or extreme  Campomar at      The question is therefore whether there is a class of persons who are likely to have received an ACF Notice  for it was not suggested by the Council that persons who had not received an ACF Notice might be misled by such a notice  and who reasonably understood that it was issued or authorised by the Council  or that ACF was associated or affiliated with the Council  or that the notice was issued for recovery of a fine  expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law  or that ACF was authorised by law to recover a fine  expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law  or finally that the
