Worimi v Minister for Lands for New South Wales   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  If the evidence were to establish unequivocally that Worimi has not been authorised by the native title claim group  the application may be summarily dismissed for failure to comply with s   of the   FCAFC     Act   Bodney v Bropho     FCR   at   per Stone J   However  the application should only be dismissed where the claim as expressed is untenable and on the basis of the evidence most favourable to Worimi   Landers v State of South Australia     FCR   at     Ms Jowett also emphasises that the factual issues  many of which are complex in nature  should not be determined in interlocutory proceedings  The merits of the claim should be determined at trial   Bodney at    She points out  correctly  that there was no cross examination of Worimi  nor has Mr Hillig adduced evidence from his mother Beryl Dates senior or from his sister Debbie Dates  Her explanation for the identification by Worimi of the different claim group in the first application is an assumption on his part that other Worimi people were recipients of the same knowledge as he held  The second application and the identification of the claim group was  according to Ms Jowett  prepared in the knowledge from the first application that some Worimi women and Mr Kelvin Dates  Worimi s brother  denied holding any native title rights over the Land   Mr Jowett submits that  if individuals cease to acknowledge and observe relevant laws and customs  they will cease to possess native title  That provides an explanation why Worimi and his wife and children who continue to observe those laws and customs represent the totality of the claim group  That knowledge was passed to Worimi by his father  his father s brothers and his father s mother  She stresses that the determination of the recipients of the native title rights requires findings of fact to be made which ought not be the subject of inquiry for the purposes of a strike out application   Having made those submissions  Ms Jowett acknowledges that  if the second application does not comply with ss   and   of the Act  it is liable to be struck out   Ms Jowett placed considerable reliance on Bodney   where the Full Court dealt with a claim group analogous to that of the present application and allowed an appeal against an order to strike out the application pursuant to s  C of the Act   Worimi has  unlike Mr Bodney  changed the composition of the claim group from the first to the second applications  cf Bodney at   and has  in these proceedings  sought to explain his reasons for doing so  My consideration of the claim group and authorisation is based only on Worimi s evidence  as relied upon by him in these proceedings  That evidence includes his affidavit in these proceedings which refers to the first application and his affidavits in support of that application  Those affidavits were relied upon by Worimi in his written submissions  That evidence is untested by cross examination  I have accepted that evidence  However  that does not preclude an analysis of that evidence to present a coherent understanding of the asserted claim group and the extent of authorisation   Worimi s evidence is that there are other persons outside his immediate family who  as part of the Garuahgal people or the Worimi nation  would have been entitled to assert native title over the Land  cf Bodney at    His qualification is that he now understands that they do not observe traditional laws and customs and that  accordingly  the persons specified in the claim group are the whole of the group alleged by him to hold the claimed native title rights and interests  In other words  as discussed in Bodney by Branson J at   Worimi relies upon the theoretical possibility that individuals who are Garuahgal or Worimi by descent do not share in all of the native title rights and interests because they have ceased to acknowledge the traditional laws and observe the traditional customs of the community  That is not a question that needs to be determined on this strike out application  I am prepared to accept that possibility  for the purposes of this application   The characteristics of those persons are members of the Garuahgal or Worimi people who presently observe traditional law and custom as described by Worimi or who may claim entitlement through marriage to the eldest son of the family  Worimi is the eldest son  as was his father  As Worimi s wife is included by her marriage to Worimi although there is no suggestion that she observes traditional law and custom  so also is his mother  As his daughters are part of the claim group as members of his family  to whom he has passed laws and customs  so too is his sister Debbie and possibly her children  The claim group of the second application is not comprised of all the persons who  according to traditional law and custom  hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the native title claimed  It follows that it is liable to be struck out for failure to comply with s   of the Act   It is necessary to consider whether Mr Hillig has established that the requirements of authorisation in s  B a  have not been met citedColbung v Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Worimi s case seems to be that  if the persons otherwise possessing native title interests have abandoned them  they are no longer identifiable as members of a community living under the relevant laws and customs  Worimi does not claim that  according to traditional laws and customs  individual rights or family rights  in the sense of Worimi  his wife and daughters  are recognised by traditional law and custom  This is not a case where Worimi claims that his immediate family hold native title rights by virtue of the membership of their family alone  cf Colbung v Western Australia   FCA    He acknowledges that the Land is Worimi land  That is  according to traditional law and custom  the rights are held by Worimi people or the particular clan or group  such as the Garuahgal people  Whatever the precise identity of the people who possess such rights over the Land  see Hillig  No   at     it is a group larger than Worimi and his family  If that is the case the family  by calling itself a native title claim group  does not establish that it is a  native title claim group  for the purposes of Worimi s entitlement to make the second application pursuant to s   of the Act   Risk v National Native Title Tribunal   FCA   at     consideredDe Rose v South Australia  No     FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The reasoning can be said to be as follows  The native title rights are held by the Worimi people  The custodian and protector is the eldest son in a family  although this is not an exclusive right because  for example  women are custodians of the women s site  it is not suggested that Worimi s father s mother was the sole female custodian  There is no evidence of a basis in traditional law and custom as to the restricted class of persons who hold native title rights or individual rights or of the restriction to Worimi and his family  It is Worimi s own deduction that others whom he acknowledges would have such native title rights cannot have them because they fail to acknowledge that such rights exist over the Land  A claim group  however  may exist for the purposes of s   of the Act where only a part of the community have acknowledged and observed traditional laws and customs   De Rose v South Australia  No     FCAFC         FCR   at       In De Rose  No   at   the Full Court said that a claimant group whose members have never acknowledged or observed traditional laws and customs cannot succeed in a claim for native title rights and interests merely because other Aboriginal peoples have acknowledged and observed the relevant traditional laws and customs  even if by those laws and customs observed by others  the claimant group  possessed  native title rights  The Court observed that the position would be similar where a native title claim is made by one or more individuals who do not assert a communal or group claim  Here  on the basis of Worimi s evidence  traditional law and custom identifies Worimi people other than Worimi and his family as  possessing  rights and interests in the Land  not least Worimi women  Worimi s evidence is that at least some of those persons have not been taught about the Land  they do not acknowledge and observe the relevant laws and customs  They do not  by the laws and customs described by Worimi  have a connection with the Land  That would preclude them from succeeding in a claim  s  b  De Rose  No   at     Worimi concludes that those persons who denied native title did not know of the traditional laws and customs that established it  Worimi s assertion is that he and his family hold native title rights within the meaning of s  a  and  b  of the Act  He does not suggest that  by traditional law and custom  native title rights were only  possessed  by his family  s  a  or that they  hold  exclusive to them the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed  s     De Rose  No   discussed the fact that a group that does not fulfil the requirements of s  a  and  b  cannot succeed in a native title claim  This included a group that possessed the rights and interests under traditional laws and customs but did not  by those laws and customs  have a connection with the land  The native title claimant group must establish rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by that community or group  at   original emphasis   Here  Worimi s evidence is that his claim group  himself  his wife and the daughters to whom he has passed the laws and custom  is not the totality of the group which possesses the rights and interests under traditional laws and customs  That group is the Worimi people  or Garuahgal people  the descendents of Mary Mahr  At the least it includes Worimi s mother Beryl Dates senior  his sister Debbie Dates and those of Debbie Dates  children to whom she has imparted knowledge of traditional laws and customs as specified in the first application appliedGeneral Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www

subject to any native title rights or interests  s   of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act    NSW  and wishes to sell the Land  On   August   I struck out a claimant application by Mr Dates  who prefers to be known as Worimi  for a determination that native title exists over the Land  the first application  Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales  No     FCA    Worimi has now filed a further claimant application  the second application   These proceedings concern the second application  Mr Hillig moves the Court for orders that the second application be struck out   In order to deal with Mr Hillig s motion  it is necessary to reiterate some matters considered in Hillig  No    The first application was a claimant application by Worimi on behalf of women who asserted a native title interest in the Land as a sacred site for women  Worimi had sought  by a draft proposed application  the proposed application  to amend the first application to assert a native title interest held by himself and his family  The claim group of the second application is the same as the claim group identified in the proposed application considered in Hillig  No     In Hillig  No   at   I discussed whether s   of the Native Title Act    Cth   the Act  requires the claim group to consist of the whole group of persons who hold native title over an area or whether it can comprise a sub group which is only part of a larger group of native title holders  I concluded that  subject to an exception that is not relevant in this case  where a small family group or sub group is only part of the group who claim to hold native title  the sub group does not hold the common or group rights or interests within s     I determined that the first application should be struck out  at    I did not permit Worimi to amend that application for reasons that I gave  I did  however  give him the opportunity to file a further claimant application  A relevant consideration was the delayed hearing of the Hillig proceedings for a declaration of no native title over the Land   Hillig  No   at    I directed at   that any further application filed by Worimi include  in accordance with the requirements of the Act  the proper identification of and authorisation by the claim group  the connection between the claim group and the relevant traditional laws and customs observed  and the basis for the claim by that claim group from the time of sovereignty   Worimi filed the second application on   September   and in so doing initiated these proceedings  Without objection from Worimi  I made an order that Mr Hillig be joined  Mr Hillig now seeks to strike out the proceedings pursuant to s  C of the Act or to dismiss
