Temple v Powell   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredLeighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   Sections   and   were both located in Chapter   of the BCII Act  Section   of that Act provided that the chapter was to commence on the date of Royal Assent  If  as has been assumed  s   applied to the Second Strike action  it is difficult to see why s   should not also have applied  However the respondents submitted that the decision of Le Miere J in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union     IR   established that s   did not apply to conduct occurring prior to   September   although his Honour appears to have accepted that s   did apply   The applicant accepted that s   had no application for present purposes but asserted that the respondents had admitted the alleged contraventions  and that the precise basis for treating Mr Powell  the CFMEUW and the CFMEU as having contravened s   was not in dispute  The applicant also submitted that the common law concerning accessorial liability would fill any  lacuna  caused by the absence of a provision such as s     The respondents have not sought to withdraw any of the admissions contained in the statement of agreed facts  I propose to dispose of the matter upon the basis of such facts  However  in identifying the seriousness of the conduct alleged against each respondent it will be necessary to say something about accessorial liability  Because the question has been ventilated at length  I will first address the question of whether s   applied to the conduct of the first  second and fourth respondents in connection with the Second Strike action  As the applicant has not relied upon s   it is not necessary to consider its application for present purposes   In Leighton at   Le Miere J set out these passages and observed  In my opinion  convening and conducting a meeting of workers during working hours might  but will not necessarily  constitute a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of building work and hence be building industrial action  Such conduct is capable of constituting a  ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of building work  if its purpose is to prevent or deter or discourage employees from performing building work and it purports to be at least hortatory  if not authoritative and binding  upon the person or persons to whom it is directed   In this way relevant building industrial action may be committed by a person other than an employer or employee   As to the requirement that the relevant conduct was  constitutionally connected action  that term was defined in s   to mean      building industrial action that satisfies at least one of the following conditions         a  the action is taken by an organisation       b  the action is taken by a constitutional corporation  or adversely affects a constitutional corporation in its capacity as a building industry participant       c  the action is taken in connection with an industrial dispute       d  the action relates to work that is regulated by a Commonwealth industrial instrument       e  the action relates to the negotiation  proposed negotiation  or making or proposed making   as relevant  of a collective agreement under Division   of Part   of the Workplace Relations Act        f  the action occurs in a Territory or Commonwealth place   In the present case the applicant claimed that the Second Strike action was constitutionally connected  having been taken by the CFMEU  an organization for the purposes of para  a  of the definition  and it having adversely affected AGC  a constitutional corporation  in its capacity as a building industry participant  However para  a  would only have applied if the relevant action were taken by the CFMEU  I proceed upon the basis that para  b  applied   In para   it is agreed that the strike on   August   was unlawful industrial action  and that Mr Powell  in conducting the meeting and taking the vote   aided the workers to engage in  such unlawful industrial action in contravention of s    Paragraph   seems to assert that the actions referred to in paras   to   were not authorized by AGC  Those actions included the raising of issues at the authorized meeting held on   August    It is not clear to me that such matters were necessarily unlawful  I proceed upon the basis that the relevant unlawful industrial action was the failure to attend for work  or to perform work  on   August   and that Mr Powell  aided  the workers to engage in such action by his conduct at the meeting  It is agreed that he thereby contravened s    It is also agreed that the CFMEU and the CFMEUW engaged in such action and similarly contravened s    Whatever the true state of the law may be with respect to accessorial liability at common law  it is not necessary for me to take that matter further  given these admissions   The applicant identified the following relevant considerations in fixing penalties       a  the nature of the unlawful industrial action found to have occurred       b  the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place  including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act       c  the likely deterrent effect  both specific and general  of any civil penalty imposed       d  the consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of the BCII Act  both in terms of the amount of loss or damage caused  if any  and less tangible effect on the building and construction industry and public generally       e  the period over which the contraventions extended       f  the extent of co operation with regulatory authorities and any acknowledgment of wrong doing       g  the need to give effect to the statutory purposes underpinning the BCII Act and the relevant parts of the WR Act       h  whether the contraventions involved or were directly attributable to the conduct of senior management       i  the Respondents  past record of statutory contraventions and other conduct in industrial relations       j  if the contravention involved an association or organization  the size of that association or organization       k  A building association s corporate culture  and       l  the financial position of each of the Respondents  if the evidence suggests that they will personally pay any penalty that is imposed    I have previously referred to the decision in Leighton  That case involved alleged breaches of s   of the BCII Act  The three respondents were  I understand  the CFMEU  the CFMEUW and Mr McDonald  although this is not entirely clear from the report of the case  Mr McDonald conducted meetings at which industrial action was considered  The relevant industrial action was the holding of the meetings during working hours and subsequent bans and strikes  I note that there were eighteen infringements by the CFMEU and five by the CFMEUW  Mr McDonald committed sixteen infringements  The industrial action extended over a longer period of time than did the presently relevant conduct   The respondents have other industrial  background   The applicant pointed to the decision in Cruse v CFMEU   FMCA    In that case the CFMEU was found to have breached s   in connection with an unlawful strike lasting two and a half days  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v CFMEU   FCA       ATPR     all four of the present respondents were found to have engaged in secondary boycott action by preventing or hindering the supply of concrete to a site by forming a picket line at the gate  Both Mr McDonald and Mr Powell have had their rights of entry revoked or suspended because of their conduct in connection with the exercise of such rights  The applicant asserts that the CFMEU has  on numerous occasions  been found to have contravened other provisions of industrial legislation involving coercive behaviour and false and misleading statements  advising or organising action with intent to coerce an employer and breaching orders  Unfortunately  save in the case of the Leighton matter  I was not told whether this conduct occurred before or after that with which I am present concerned  In Leighton   the relevant conduct occurred in March    Normally  only conduct preceding that in question is taken into account in fixing penalties  In any event  although the respondents have apparently engaged in prior industrial misconduct  I have insufficient information to justify my according great weight to such misconduct   The penalties imposed in Leighton offer a convenient starting point for present purposes  Because of the more extensive misconduct in that case  the penalties in this case should be lower  In Leighton the relevant conduct was all contrary to s   of the BCII Act  For that reason  and because the maximum penalty for such a breach is higher than those for the WR Act infringements  I will commence by considering the penalties for the infringements of s    Mr McDonald was not involved in this aspect of the case   In Leighton the penalty imposed on Mr McDonald was   against a maximum penalty of   for each infringement  The applicant suggested that in this case a penalty of   should be imposed on Mr Powell  The respondents suggested a penalty of   fully suspended for a period of six months  In other words no penalty would be payable in the event that Mr Powell behaved himself for that period  This approach may have been partially motivated by the view that there was really only one course of unlawful conduct  I find it difficult to take such an indulgent view of Mr Powell s conduct  given that he had some previous history of disobedience to industrial law  and that  as I infer  the second strike imposed additional disruption upon AGC  The substantial penalty imposed upon Mr McDonald in Leighton also dictates something more than a merely nominal penalty in this case  The two unions also have previous histories of industrial misconduct  For each of them the maximum penalty is    In Leighton the CFMEUW was treated as being less involved in the contraventions than was the CFMEU  This may have reflected the fact that the CFMEU had acknowledged eighteen contraventions whilst the CFMEUW had acknowledged only five  The Court imposed a penalty of   upon the CFMEUW for those five infringements  In this case  the applicant suggested a penalty of   for each union  The respondents submitted that a penalty of   fully suspended  was appropriate  I do not agree  There was nothing trivial about the misconduct in question  I see no real basis for distinguishing between the CFMEU and the CFMEUW   The applicant s recommendation of a penalty of   for Mr Powell is  in my view  at the lower end of the appropriate range  I adopt it  subject to any adjustment which may be necessary after I have considered the appropriate penalty for him in connection with the First Strike action  The penalties imposed on the CFMEU and CFMEUW should be roughly equivalent to that imposed upon Mr Powell but adjusted  having regard to the higher maximum penalty  I see no reason for treating the two unions as being more or less culpable than was Mr Powell  Subject to the possibility of adjustment for overall effect I fix the penalty at   in each case   I turn to the First Strike action  It led to a two day strike and involved a much larger number of men  serving a wider range of employers  than did the later strike  It was  in that sense  more serious  On the other hand  in the case of Mr McDonald  it was the only action in which he was involved  The maximum penalties under the WR Act are substantially lower than those under the BCII Act  For Messrs Powell and McDonald the maximum penalty for a breach of s  MN is    The maximum for the CFMEU is    In the case of a corporation  the maximum penalty for a breach of s   is    It is important to keep in mind that the conduct constituting the CFMEU s breach of s  MN was the same as that constituting its breach of s     Turning to Messrs Powell and McDonald  the applicant submitted that in Mr Powell s case  the penalty should be   and in Mr McDonald s     The respondents submitted that each should receive a penalty of   of which two thirds should be suspended for a period of six months  The distinction between the treatment of Mr McDonald and that of Mr Powell is presumably based upon Mr McDonald s involvement in the Leighton matter and the rather more serious circumstances surrounding the revocation of his entry permits as compared to those surrounding the suspension of Mr Powell s permits  As I have said  it may be unfair and unwise to place much reliance upon the latter matter  given absence of any knowledge concerning the dates of the relevant misconduct  With regard to the Leighton matter  I must keep in mind the fact that Mr McDonald had not been dealt with for such conduct at the time of the First Strike action  However I am inclined to accept that Mr McDonald has a somewhat worse record than does Mr Powell   I do not accept that Mr Powell s infringement of s  MN  with a maximum penalty of   should attract the same penalty as his infringement of s   of the BCII Act  with a maximum penalty of    It is true that the first strike was more serious than the second  More employers and employees were involved  and the strike was for two days rather than one  On the other hand  Mr Powell engaged in the Second Strike action knowing that he had previously engaged in the First Strike action  and probably intending to aggravate the effects upon AGC of the earlier strike  These considerations will be best reflected by my imposing a penalty of   upon Mr Powell in connection with the First Strike action  In the case of Mr McDonald  a penalty of   is appropriate  Thus  the penalties which I have provisionally fixed are    s  MN s   s   Total Mr Powell   Nil         CFMEUW Nil Nil     Mr McDonald   Nil Nil     CFMEU         Having considered the overall conduct of the various respondents and all other material facts  I see no reason to make any further adjustment to these figures  I also see no reason for suspending any of the penalties consideredIn re A Solicitor s Clerk     WLR   The applicant submitted that s   was intended to apply to conduct occurring between   March and   September    That approach to s   was based upon a series of decisions which commenced with In re A Solicitor s Clerk     WLR    The case concerned legislation which prohibited the continued employment as a solicitor s clerk of a person who had previous convictions for offences of dishonesty  The relevant legislation had  at one stage  applied to a solicitor s clerk who was convicted of larceny  embezzlement  fraudulent conversion or any other criminal offence in respect of money or property belonging to  or held by  the solicitor who employed him or her  or any client of such solicitor  The Act was amended so that it applied to a solicitor s clerk who had been convicted of larceny  embezzlement or fraudulent conversion of any money or property  regardless of who owned or controlled it  The question was whether the amendment applied to a clerk who had been convicted of such an offence prior to the amendment  In the Queen s Bench Division Lord Goddard CJ said  at      Barry and Havers JJ concurring  In all editions of Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes it is stated that it is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute should be construed to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act or arises by a necessary or distinct implication and this passage has received judicial approval by the Court of Appeal       But in my opinion this Act is not in truth retrospective  It enables an order to be made disqualifying a person from acting as a solicitor s clerk in the future and what happened in the past is the cause or reason for the making of the order  but the order has no retrospective effect  It would be retrospective if the Act provided that anything done before the Act came into force or before the order was made should be void or voidable  or if a penalty were inflicted for having acted in this or any other capacity before the Act came into force or before the order was made  This Act simply enables a disqualification to be imposed for the future which in no way affects anything done by the appellant in the past consideredLa Macchia v Minister for Primary Industries     ALR   In La Macchia v Minister for Primary Industries     ALR     the Full Court considered a provision pursuant to which the relevant minister might cancel a fishing licence if the holder were convicted of certain offences  That section took effect from   August    On   June   one joint licence holder was convicted of a relevant offence  On   October   the minister decided to cancel the licence  The question was whether or not the minister was entitled to do so upon the basis of a conviction recorded prior to the commencement of the legislation authorizing such cancellation  At     Toohey J  Bowen CJ concurring  said  There are  I think  only two other matters in the applicant s case that call for comment  The first is the argument that  in relying upon a power in section  A A  which did not exist at the time of the conviction of Mr La Macchia  a penal power was exercised retrospectively  There are two answers to this contention  The first is that the Minister was not exercising a penal power even though cancellation imposed a hardship on the applicants by depriving them for a time of their ability to fish commercially  Cancellation is not part of the penalty a Court of Petty Sessions may impose  It is part of the scheme of the Act which seeks to control commercial fishermen in their fishing activity  Rock lobsters are a valuable common property resource and activities damaging the resources are hard and costly to police  The power of cancellation is an important aspect of the system of control and should be seen in that light  Secondly  while the Minister could not have given notice prior to the sub section coming into operation  he was not constrained thereafter to rely upon a conviction that itself occurred after the sub section came into operation  The commission of an offence  whether before or after   August   is a circumstance warranting the giving of a notice under sub section  A   The order does not have retrospective effect simply because it relies upon conduct that occurred before the power existed      consideredThe Commonwealth v SCI Operations   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Finally  in The Commonwealth v SCI Operations   HCA         CLR     at   McHugh and Gummow JJ referred with apparent approval to an observation by Jordan CJ in Coleman v Shell Company of Australia     SRNSW   at      His Honour said  concerning the retrospective operation of statutes  As to the first question  it is to be noted that there has been some ambiguity in the use of the word  retrospective   In some cases  it has been said that it would give a retrospective operation to a statute to treat it as impairing an existing right or obligation or creating a new right or obligation       On the other hand it was said     that an Act is retrospective if it provides that as at past date the law shall be taken to have been that which it was not  It is not retrospective because it interferes with existing rights  Most Acts do  There is no presumption that interference with existing rights is not intended  but there is a presumption that an Act speaks only as to the future  Similarly it has been said that an amendment of a section in an Act makes it retrospective in its original form but not retrospective so far as it is new       Upon a consideration of the authorities  I think that as regards any matter or transaction  if events have occurred prior to the passing of the Act which have brought into existence particular rights or liabilities in respect of that matter or transaction  it would be giving a retrospective operation to the Act to treat it as intended to alter those rights or liabilities  But it would not be giving it a retrospective operation to treat it as governing the future operation of the matter or transaction as regards the creation of further particular rights or liabilities consideredColeman v Shell

Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant sought to demonstrate accessorial liability by reference to the common law  He relied particularly upon the decision in Giorgianni v The Queen   HCA         CLR   per Gibbs CJ at   and per Mason J at    That case concerned a section of the Crimes Act    NSW  which provided  Any person who aids  abets  counsels or procures the commission of any misdemeanour     may be indicted  convicted and punished as a principal offender   At   Gibbs CJ said  concerning that section  Section   of the Crimes Act is based on section   of the Accessories and Abettors Act    UK  which it has often been said  was only declaratory of the common law on the subject       Although it was said       that there is a difference between the four words  aids  abets  counsels  procures  used in the section  and that each word must be given its ordinary meaning  it is apparent that the ordinary meaning of some at least of those words overlaps and that sometimes the words are used in particular combinations or as a phrase which is to be considered as a whole       When used in relation to felonies  the words  aid and abet  describe the action of a person who was present at the commission of the offence and took some part therein  who was called the principal in the second degree as well as an  aider and abettor  whereas  counsel and procure  described an accessory before the fact who was not present at the commission of the offence       The usage was not always uniform or discriminating  The distinction between principals in the first and second degree and between principals and accessories now generally has no legal importance       No similar distinction was drawn in the case of misdemeanours  and at common law  in cases of misdemeanour  anyone who  in the case of a felony  would have been a principal in the second degree  or an accessory  was a principal offender and was treated as if he had taken the same path as the active perpetrator of the facts constituting the offence       The reason for mentioning those matters  which are now largely of historical interest  is that statements in the authorities regarding the mental state necessary to constitute a person an accessory before the fact in the case of a felony will apply equally to a person who has counselled or procured the commission of a misdemeanour  Further  it will be found that statements which refer to the knowledge and intention necessary to make a person an aider and abettor will often be equally applicable to a person who has counselled or procured the commission of the offence  Russell on Crime   th ed   p   states that  the bare minimum  which is necessary to constitute a person an accessory before the fact is that his conduct should indicate  a  that he knew that the particular deed was contemplated  and  b  that he approved of or assented to it  and  c  that his attitude in respect of it in fact encouraged the principal       There is a strong body of authority which supports the view that knowledge of the facts is necessary before a person can be made liable as a secondary party for the commission of an offence  In Johnson v Youden      Lord Goddard CJ stated the position in relation to aiders and abettors as follows      Before a person can be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of an offence he must at least know the essential matters which constitute that offence  He need not actually know that an offence has been committed  because he may not know that the facts constitute an offence and ignorance of the law is not a defence   At   Mason J said  The terms  aid  abet  counsel or procure  requires some comment  In England the approach has been taken that those terms  as they occur in section   of the Accessories and Abettors Act    UK      should be treated as four separate words and  so far as possible  be given their ordinary meaning       This approach has attracted some criticism       In any case  it has no application to the construction of the same terms as they appear in s    Once it is acknowledged that those terms are merely declaratory of the common law  it is to the common law concept of secondary participation  and not to the ordinary meaning of the words themselves  that regard must be had  In felony at common law the terms  aid  and  abet  are generally used to refer to the conduct of a principal in the second degree  or one who is present at the commission of the offence by the principal offender while the terms  counsel  or  procure  are generally used in relation to the conduct of an accessory before the fact  or one who is absent at the time of the commission of the offence       In substance  however  there appears to be no distinction between a principal in the second degree and an accessory before the fact beyond the question of presence  In misdemeanour  where no attempt has been made to classify the parties to an offence  each of the four terms is employed to refer to the conduct of a secondary participant  But the terms are descriptive of a single concept  In this regard  I would adopt the observation of Cussen ACJ in R v Russell      as being applicable to secondary participation in misdemeanour  Having listed various words  including  aiding  and  abetting  which have been used to refer to the conduct of a principal in the second degree in felony  his Honour observed      All the words mentioned are  I think  instances of one general idea  that the person charged as a principal in the second degree is in some way linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime  and is by his words or conduct doing something to bring about  or rendering more likely  such commission      As R v Russell itself illustrates  there need not exist any agreement or a consensus between the principal in the second degree or secondary participant and the principal offender appliedCredit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department     Lloyd s Rep   I have cited these passages at some length because the applicant assumed that these cases establish that the various statutory provisions relating to parties to offences reflected the position at common law in connection with torts  However  in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department     Lloyd s Rep   the Court of Appeal rejected that proposition  See  in particular  the judgment of Stuart Smith LJ at     and that of Hobhouse LJ at      Hobhouse LJ identified three categories of conduct by a person other than the actual perpetrator which might attract criminal liability  They were    those who solicit or incite another to commit a crime or conspire with another to commit a crime    those who aid another in the commission of a crime  often known as  aiding  abetting  counselling and procuring  and    principals whose agents commit offences citedCredit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department     AC   His Lordship concluded  at   that only conduct which fell into either the first or the third category would constitute a tort at common law  In other words  at common law  aiding  abetting  counselling and procuring was not a basis for tortious liability  On appeal to the House of Lords  reported at     AC   the decision of the Court of Appeal was upheld  although on slightly different grounds  Their Lordships observed that the criminal law might not offer a good guide to accessorial liability in tort  See the speech of Lord Wolfe MR at      Lord Slynn  Lord Steyn  Lord Clyde and Lord Millett agreeing  discussedThompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR

and Toohey JJ said       F or there to be joint tort feasors there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage      T o constitute joint tort feasors two or more persons must act in concern in committing the tort   As with the decision in Credit Lyonnais these propositions were largely based upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in The  Koursk    P    In Thompson at   Gummow J said  concerning the judgments in The  Koursk    Scrutton LJ     there spoke of  two persons who agree on common action  in the course of  and to further which  one of them commits a tort  saying that in such a case there is one tort committed by one of them  in concert with another   Sargant LJ     accepted the proposition that persons are joint tort feasors when their  respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design  so that those who  aid or counsel  direct  or join  in commission of the tort are joint tort feasors      consideredThe  Koursk    P

Energy  Information  Postal  Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Laing     FCR   The conduct identified in paras  a  and  d  would  almost certainly  have been the conduct of employers or employees  However the conduct identified in paras  b  and  c  may have been the conduct of others  In Communications  Electrical  Electronic  Energy  Information  Postal  Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Laing     FCR   at     French J observed  concerning a similar provision in the WR Act  While par  a  of the definition relates to the  performance of work  par  b  is more broadly expressed  It refers to  a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of work  or on the acceptance of or offering for work   The central meaning of the term  ban  in the industrial  as in its ordinary usage  is to  prohibit or interdict  the Macquarie Dictionary  Communication between persons or an organization and persons is essential to a  ban   And while the notion of  limitation  or  restriction  may have a meaning related to manner of actual performance of work  that meaning is picked up in par  a  of the definition  Under par  b  it extends to the communication of a limitation or restriction  Communication picked up under pars  b  and  c  must no doubt purport to be at least hortatory  if not authoritative and binding  upon the person or persons to whom they are directed  In the ordinary course such communication will be verbal whether oral  written or in electronic form  Being intended to affect or affecting the performance of work  it is industrial action because of its instrumental character  Notwithstanding that it is communication it falls within the terms of the definition   At   his Honour continued  So a picket line whose purpose is to prevent or deter or discourage employees from attending on their employer s premises and from carrying out their work could constitute a ban for the purposes of s    followedMinister for Industry  Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   The applicant submitted that in fixing civil penalties  the Court should take account of the views of any relevant regulator as a specialist body  but that such views should not be treated as determinative  As much appears to be established by the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Industry  Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC    Accepting that decision as I must  I observe only that considerable care must be exercised in so doing  particularly where the regulator is a party to the proceedings  Such  views  must be more than bald assertions of the desired outcome in a particular case  or of the regulator s policy  One would expect some factual basis to be demonstrated for the views so advanced  A respondent might expect an opportunity to test the views and the facts upon which they are allegedly based  In other words  it may be necessary for the regulator to provide admissible lay and expert evidence  The Court cannot treat a statement as relevant if it is really only an opinion or statement of preferred outcome  I do not understand this issue to loom large in the present case   The applicant s submissions deal in some detail with the purpose of the WR Act and the BCII Act  pointing to various reasons for treating breaches of industrial legislation as relatively serious  I doubt  however  whether such considerations are of particular relevance in a case such as this where the relevant conduct was limited in scope and effect  All legislation which prescribes penalties  criminal or otherwise  has the purpose of deterring conduct which is deemed to be undesirable  The important point is that the penalty be sufficiently substantial to act as an appropriate deterrent  having regard to matters which may tempt persons to infringe  The penalty must also be proportionate to the infringing conduct   I infer that the First Strike action substantially disrupted work on the Ravensthorpe project  It lasted for   hours and involved about   workers  It may be  however  that little work would have been done at that time in any event  Weather conditions were unfavourable  No attempt was made to negotiate with the employers prior to taking industrial action  Such pre emptive action may be attractive to workers and unions  Minimal notice of industrial action probably maximises disruptive effect  It is said that the contraventions  were in manifest defiance of the law   That may be so  However the statement of agreed facts demonstrates that neither Mr Powell nor Mr McDonald directly instigated any discussion concerning strike action  It may be that they deliberately created a situation from which such action was calculated to emerge  but there is no evidence to that effect consideredCruse v CFMEU   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The respondents have other industrial  background   The applicant pointed to the decision in Cruse v CFMEU   FMCA    In that case the CFMEU was found to have breached s   in connection with an unlawful strike lasting two and a half days  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v CFMEU   FCA       ATPR     all four of the present respondents were found to have engaged in secondary boycott action by preventing or hindering the supply of concrete to a site by forming a picket line at the gate  Both Mr McDonald and Mr Powell have had their rights of entry revoked or suspended because of their conduct in connection with the exercise of such rights  The applicant asserts that the CFMEU has  on numerous occasions  been found to have contravened other provisions of industrial legislation involving coercive behaviour and false and misleading statements  advising or organising action with intent to coerce an employer and breaching orders  Unfortunately  save in the case of the Leighton matter  I was not told whether this conduct occurred before or after that with which I am present concerned  In Leighton   the relevant conduct occurred in March    Normally  only conduct preceding that in question is taken into account in fixing penalties  In any event  although the respondents have apparently engaged in prior industrial misconduct  I have insufficient information to justify my according great weight to such misconduct
