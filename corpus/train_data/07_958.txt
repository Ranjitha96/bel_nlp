Chen v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship Corrigendum dated   July     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMa v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In the reasons that I gave on   May   I indicated that I did not consider that there was any error in the reasons of the Federal Magistrates Court  However  because I had not had the advantage of detailed submissions on the question  I adjourned the application for three weeks  in order to give the applicant the opportunity of obtaining legal advice  filing a further draft notice of appeal and making written submission  Since the earlier hearing  my attention has been drawn to a decision of the Full Court given on   May   concerning the operation of the relevant regulations  Ma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC    The reasons of the Court in that proceeding tend to support views that have been expressed by judges of the Federal Magistrates Court concerning the operation of Amendment No     As I indicated on   May  it is perhaps bad luck for the present applicant that his visa was cancelled only shortly before the Regulations were amended  Under the regime that exists  following the amendment  the decision maker would have a discretion to take into account the circumstances of the applicant that led to his failing to satisfy Condition    However  the language of the transitional provisions is unequivocal  As at the date of the Tribunal s decision  the visa in question had been cancelled  It follows  therefore  that the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court in this proceeding was correct  There is no arguable case that could have been advanced in an amended notice of appeal  There would be no utility in extending the time for filing a notice of appeal  In the circumstances the application must be dismissed with costs   The solicitor for the Minister has asked that I fix the amount of the costs in the sum of    That is somewhat higher than would normally be expected in relation to an application for an extension of time  The Minister s solicitor assures me that the actual costs exceed that sum  The sum is justified by the nature of the claims made by the applicant in his application for extension of time  That is to say  he asserted that there was a denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Tribunal  That required the Minister to make inquiries and to file evidence  including evidence consisting of the transcript of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court
