case of fraud on the purchaser s part but relied only on the contractual qualification upon the purchaser s powers under the general conditions of the underlying contract to demand payment under the letter of credit  It was conceded that the clause referred to constituted a contractual qualification on the purchaser s powers in relation to the security  This is to be contrasted with earlier

Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No      FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlClough s claims against the Banks concern their intention to pay under the performance guarantees where such payment would constitute the Bank s being  directly or indirectly  knowingly concerned in ONGC s contraventions of the TPA  Injunctive relief is available against the Banks under s   of the TPA  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No      FCA   at         Injunctive and other relief would also be available under s  A  of the TPA  The orders  including injunctive orders  previously obtained by Clough against ONGC were obtained on an ex parte basis  and supported by affidavit material which was uncontested  ONGC had not entered an appearance at that time  Only ONGC could contradict Clough s case that Clough was not in breach of the Construction Contract  or where it was in breach  that this was occasioned by ONGC s breach  Accordingly  the claim by Clough  that ONGC was in contravention of s  AA of the TPA  proceeded on the basis of unchallenged fact  namely  that ONGC had called for payment under the performance guarantees when there was no proper foundation for doing so  because Clough was not in breach of the Construction Contract or if it was  then this was as a direct consequence of breaches by ONGC  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No    at   and    It was not necessary  then  to consider the question of whether a call by ONGC under the performance guarantees could be made merely upon the basis of a bona fide claim of breach or whether it required  by admission or by curial or arbitral determination  a demonstrated actual breach  This was because  whatever the proper construction of cl       on the uncontroverted facts  a prima facie case  or serious issue that s  AA had been contravened was made out  Accordingly  I expressly left that question open  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No    at    For the first time in these proceedings  the question of construction requires to be considered  It is fundamental to the disposition of the Motion  In the reasons for judgment in Clough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No     FCA   at         I concluded that the balance of convenience strongly favoured the grant of injunctive relief  As I have said  ONGC  although a party  had not then appeared  This  importantly  meant that there was no party to contradict the existence of serious issues to be tried  as contended for by Clough  I formed the view that to have discharged the injunctions could very well lead to irreparable harm to Clough  its shareholders  employees and third parties  I concluded that damages would not be an adequate remedy   The position has now changed  ONGC has appeared  put on evidence  cross examined and advanced submissions through counsel  Clough s financial circumstances have also changed  The changed position is disclosed by a further affidavit of Mr Simons sworn on   September    The expression  G  contract  as used in this affidavit is a reference to the Construction Contract  It is to the following effect       a  Clough s annual results for the financial year ended   June   reported an audited loss of     million  which   loss directly resulted from provisions taken on the BassGas and G  contracts   such that Clough is materially in default of its secured debt facilities with the Banks              b  each of the Banks want Clough to repay all secured debt facilities and because of Clough s defaults and because of the legal action threatened by ONGC  the Banks will not allow the use of current facilities or extend any further facilities to Clough   until such time as the injunction and the related matters are dissolved or otherwise dispensed with     such that Clough will not have sufficient available debt facilities to fund the encashment of the performance guarantees            c  the announced capital raising   will provide new liquidity to replace the cash that has been utilised in funding the costs on the G  contract which have not been reimbursed or paid to Clough by ONGC              d  Clough has paid creditors of US    million on the G  contract  but has received payments from ONGC of only US    million  a cash short fall of US  million   and Clough still owed some A    million to creditors on the G  contract            e  between   July   and   September   Clough has paid G  contract creditors about A    million  leaving a balance of A    million  which will need to be paid from cash flow            f  the payments to G  contract creditors is causing significant strain            g  to replace Clough s cash deposits that have been depleted by reason of the G  contract  Clough proposes to recapitalise to enable it to make payments to the remaining G  contract creditors and fund its capital expansion            h  the recapitalisation is not directed to funding the encashment of the performance guarantees but is for paying the G  creditors  funding capital expansion and repaying the Banks   and  importantly  if the performance guarantees were paid  Clough would be prevented from some or all of these objectives  with the consequences described in Mr Simons    May   affidavit            i  the proposed recapitalisation will not be completed until the end of December   and is dependent upon shareholder approval      Against that  in cross examination  Mr Simons conceded that Clough s capital expansion program will be secured by the Murray and Roberts funding and the recapitalisation and that there will be no need to retrench staff  This is a very different position to that which existed at the time that I refused the application of the Banks to discharge the injunction  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd  No     FCA   at         There is no evidence to establish specific irreparable damage to Clough  Consequences of the kind that I have referred to are not uncommon in such matters and indeed are often the probable consequences  Certainly  Mr Simons accepted that such consequences  broadly  were in the anticipation of Clough when the performance guarantees were given  I have also considered Clough s claims that payment under the performance guarantees will adversely affect its commercial reputation  As to that I accept the submissions of ONGC which derive their factual foundation from the second affidavit of Mr Simons  his cross examination and various media reports admitted into evidence  The market knows of Clough s dispute with ONGC  and it has been the subject of public disclosure to the ASX by Clough  Clough s Board has told the market that it considers the claims to be  spurious  and uses public relations to protect its position referred toClough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www

Vraca Pty Ltd v Bell Regal Pty Ltd   FCAFC   discussedFletcher Construction Australia Ltd v Varnsdorf Pty Ltd     VR  Secondly  one consideration that might be brought to bear in deciding whether a claimed or asserted entitlement to payment is intended to be sufficient  is where the claimed or asserted entitlement is made in the context of an independent party having first certified that a certain state of affairs exists  Where the parties have entrusted  by agreement  an independent person with the task of being satisfied and certifying that a certain state of affairs exists  and the contract then provides for the payment of money if that state of affairs exists  a claimed entitlement to payment may be inferred to be sufficient  Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd v Varnsdorf Pty Ltd     VR   at    It would be unusual  it was said  for an entitlement  particularly for A  million  to arise on mere assertion of breach  unconnected with some specific independent certification process  subject to one matter  discussed below  Thirdly  another consideration is that if the contract provides  expressly  for a right to deduct certain moneys  i e  a right of self help  it may be inferred that those particular moneys may be payable on an asserted or claimed entitlement  Fletcher v Varnsdorf at    There are  in this contract  specific provisions giving ONGC the right to deduct moneys in the period prior to practical completion  They are found in cll         and        Notwithstanding the absence of a certification provision  and the onerous terms of cl         it may be inferred that the parties intended Clough to pay those amounts on assertion of breach  and for the performance guarantees to be called for that purpose  leaving Clough out of pocket whilst it fought out any dispute about that in an arbitration  Fourthly  in the period after practical completion  a specific provision  similar to cl         also requires Clough to pay moneys to ONGC irrespective  it seems  of any dispute as to the validity of ONGC s claim  This is cl        Again  the provision is onerous in that it purports to require Clough to pay costs associated with reinstatement of the works simply upon a complaint of non conformity by ONGC  Again  that clause gives ONGC a right to deduct moneys  irrespective of the pendency of any unresolved dispute  by arbitration or otherwise  concerning ONGC s claims that the works are non conforming  Again  the guarantees are likely to have been intended by the parties to operate on the strength of a claimed entitlement in this circumstance  Fifthly  cl       is another provision which gives a right to deduct  In the present circumstances  because there has been no agreed extended date for practical completion  it applies where there is an agreement or arbitral or other determination that ONGC has a right to recover liquidated damages  Sixthly  the magnitude of the guarantees  totalling A  million  needs to be considered in the context of a construction which requires that any asserted breach  however trivial  or ephemeral  could see the contractor deprived of A  million working capital  That  it is said  would be a peculiar result  Seventhly  bearing in mind the above considerations  cl       operates to allocate risk to Clough in specified circumstances  and otherwise provides ONGC with substantial security by way of recourse to the Banks  in the event that Clough is slow to  or is unable or unwilling  to pay ONGC  where ONGC has established that Clough has failed to honour its commitments under the contract  Accordingly  the demands in this case are equivalent to the certificate provided by the National Australia Bank  NAB  to HSBC  certifying in effect that the conditions of the letter of credit had been met  Ideas Plus Investments Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd     WAR   at    The Western Australian Court of Appeal held that the certificate  amounted to no more than an implied

Buss JJA agreed  concluded that the NAB was empowered to claim under a letter of credit granted by HSBC so long as it had a bona fide belief that the conditions were satisfied  The certificate by the NAB issued to HSBC certifying in effect that the conditions of the letter of credit had been met was only a representation of such a bona fide belief and perhaps that there were reasonable grounds for such a belief        See also Fletcher Construction v Varsdorf at p    Steytler P with whom McLure JA agreed held that the basis for the payment made by HSBC pursuant to its independent obligation to NAB under the letter of credit was the provision by NAB of a certificate in the required terms  It was  his Honour found  the presentation of that certificate  not the truth of the facts certified  which conditioned HSBC s obligation to pay  The provision of cll             and       do not  in my view  assist the construction contended for by Clough  Those concern the contractual entitlement of ONGC to withhold approval and payment of progress claims  That entitlement provides a form of security to ONGC where there is a dispute because  pending arbitration  it is not required to pay the disputed amounts to Clough  It does not inform the question of the circumstances in which the performance guarantees may be called upon  Nor do I consider that the absence of an independent certification as to the existence of a certain state of affairs to trigger the obligation to make payment advances Clough s argument on construction  That is but one type of mechanism for payment in a contract  Its absence does not assist the construction of this contract  Performance guarantees play a critical part in international commerce and in international construction contracts  in particular  So much has been recognised by the courts on many occasions  the authorities are collected by Steytler P in Ideas Plus Investments at      They were  objectively viewed  of critical importance to ONGC under the Construction Contract  This is manifest in two ways  Under cl       of the Construction Contract  no payments become due and payable to Clough until Clough has furnished the necessary performance guarantees and the Certificate of Insurance to ONGC  This would extend to performance guarantees whose validity was required to be extended under cl        Furthermore  as its option  ONGC was entitled  under cl       where Clough failed to furnish the performance guarantee s  to terminate the Construction Contract  Completion Date of the Works under the Construction Contract was   April    cll       and        The warranty period under the Construction Contract is   months from the date of issue of the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance  cl        Any performance guarantee was to be initially valid up to   June    This was by virtue of the provisions of cl       which provide for the period of validity to extend from the Completion Date  plus the warranty period and a further   days  Each performance guarantee is expressed to be valid until   June    In the event that completion is delayed beyond the Scheduled Completion Date  Clough was

 as Clough contends  it was clear as at     a    April   that Clough was not then prepared to extend the performance guarantees  In a letter to ONGC it advised ONGC that it required the three performance guarantees then held by ONGC to be returned and stated that it was willing to provide a performance bond to the value of   of the remaining work  in the amount of US    million  and      b

whose absence will not affect the constitution of the action  Edge  in the matter of Eco Panels Australasia Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA   at     As a person who would be a proper party if it were in the

Vraca Pty Ltd v Bell Regal Pty Ltd   FCAFC   citedReed Construction Services Pty Ltd v Kheng Seng  Australia  Pty Ltd     BCL  In particular  Clough contends that the delay in its providing the  Christmas Trees  was caused by breach on the part of ONGC relating to the  DHPTT Cards   It also asserts that ONGC was in breach in other respects  such as failing to effect well completion in relation to the deep water work and that ONGC lost the first  Christmas Tree  and certain tools  all of which contributed to delays of the Project  The failure to undertake shallow water works  likewise  Clough says  was occasioned by breaches on the part of ONGC  It is not possible to resolve these factual questions and whether those asserted breaches were occasioned by ONGC s own breaches  This in turn gives rise to a prima facie case or a serious issue to be tried  whether based on those asserted breaches  ONGC acted unconscionably contrary to s  AA of the TPA in calling up the performance guarantees  Reed Construction Services Pty Ltd v Kheng Seng  Australia  Pty Ltd     BCL   at    However  this does not determine the matter  ONGC contends that Clough is indisputably in breach of its contractual obligations in two further important respects  These concern Clough s obligations to extend the validity of the performance guarantees and to provide documentary proof that relevant insurance cover is being maintained by Clough  ONGC submits that these obligations exist  even assuming that the need for the extensions is the result of breach es  on its part  I now turn to consider each of these  Breach of cl       The performance guarantees I have  again  set out cl       below  for ease of reference            In the event completion of Works is delayed beyond the Scheduled Completion Date for any reasons whatsoever  the Contractor shall get the validity of the guarantee suitably extended so as to make it valid for   months plus   days from the actual date of completion of Works  However if the delay is attributable to the Company  Company shall bear the cost of extension of such performance guarantee for such extended period at the normal bank rates as

htmlONGC made demands upon the Banks  HSBC Bank Australia Limited  HSBC  in Perth and upon the Commonwealth Bank of Australia  CBA  and BNP Paribas in Sydney under the performance guarantees  on   June   which was a Perth public holiday  These proceedings were commenced the following day  The Construction Contract was terminated by ONGC by a facsimile letter to Clough of   June    PREVIOUS ORDERS MADE BY THE COURT      a  On   June   an ex parte interlocutory injunction was granted against the Banks restraining each of them from making payment to ONGC under the performance guarantees  This injunction was extended on   June   and on   June   following an inter parties hearing  when an application by the Banks to discharge the injunction was dismissed     b  On   June   an ex parte interim injunction was granted against ONGC restraining it from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment  or renewing such claims or demands  from the Banks under the performance guarantees  The injunction was extended on   and   June       c  On   June   e x parte orders for leave to serve ONGC ex juris were made  Clough has sought to restrain the calling on  or payment under  the performance guarantees for a number of reasons  The first  it submits  is that the Construction Contact  properly construed  prohibits a demand being made in the prevailing circumstances  The second  alternative  basis is that even if the Construction Contract  by its terms  does not preclude making a demand under the guarantees  nevertheless ONGC has caused or contributed to the circumstances leading to the asserted breach of the Construction Contract by Clough  upon which ONGC relies to make a demand  The third is that alternatively  ONGC s demand constituted unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten laws of Australia  in contravention of s  AA of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   TPA   Finally  it is said  that the demand served by ONGC does not conform with the criteria required of a valid demand on the proper construction of the guarantees  The terms of the performance guarantees to be entered into under the Construction Contract are contained in Appendix III  not II  of Annexure A to the Contract  Clause       requires to be construed in the context of the document as a whole  This includes the context of Appendix III of Annexure A  see  for example  Re Media  Entertainment and Arts Alliance  Ex parte the Hoyts Corporation Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at      The performance guarantees prescribed by the Construction Contract accordingly promise payment even where disputes  which could include disputes as to whether or not Clough had failed to honour any of its commitments under the Construction Contract  are pending before a Court or arbitrator  This  in my opinion  is a powerful indicator that a mere claimed breach of contract  which is not fraudulently asserted is sufficient to trigger entitlement to call on the performance guarantee  Clough does not assert that ONGC has made a fraudulent claim  This construction is reinforced by the fact that  under the prescribed terms of the guarantees  the Banks are required to pay  without any demur  reservation  contest or protest and or without any reference to the Contractor   Under the terms of the performance guarantees  each of the Banks was entitled to treat the written demand by ONGC as conclusive and binding as to the amount due and payable  notwithstanding any dispute pending before any Court  Tribunal  Arbitrator or any other authority  Liability under the performance guarantees was absolute and unequivocal citedResort Hotels Management Pty Ltd v Resort Hotels of Australia Pty Ltd     NSWLR  It is also for Clough to establish a case for the continuation

that there is a serious issue s  to be tried  I will firstly deal with the orders sought under paragraph   of the Notice of Motion  This involves a consideration of whether Clough has established anew that it has a prima facie case to maintain the grant of service ex juris on ONGC and whether there are any serious issues to be tried to sustain injunctive relief  either pending a trial of issues in
