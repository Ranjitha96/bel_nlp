Akiba and Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland  No     FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAkiba and Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This is an application for leave to appeal by Mr Pende Gamogab from a decision of French J given on   September   in Akiba and Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland  No     FCA     French J dismissed an application by Mr Gamogab  a Papua New Guinea  PNG  national  to be joined as a party to a native title claim  specifically an application for a determination of native title under s   of the Native Title Act    Cth   the Act  over a large area of sea and seabed in the Torres Strait  His Honour made no order for the costs of the motion by Mr Gamogab seeking to be joined as a party   That native title determination application covers approximately   square kilometres in the Torres Strait and the Coral Sea  being areas of sea  seabed  and inter tidal zone  The application has become known as the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim   Section   of the Act provides the Federal Court with power to join parties to a proceeding      Parties           Joining parties           The Federal Court may at any time join any person as a party to the proceedings  if the Court is satisfied that the person s interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings             French J at par   considered that s   of the Act required the consideration of three elements     Whether the person has an interest     Whether the interest may be affected by a determination in the proceedings  and     Whether  in any event  in the exercise of its discretion the Court should join the person as a party   French J concluded  for the purposes of joinder  that Mr Gamogab had an interest and that interest was an interest that might be affected by a determination in the proceedings  His Honour decided  in the exercise of his discretion  that Mr Gamogab should not be joined as a party  His findings in these respects are as follows  French J said at par      The kind of interest necessary to enliven the discretion under s   can include      a special well established non proprietary connection with land or waters that is of significance to that person   The interest need not be proprietary or legal or equitable in nature  It must not be indirect  remote or lacking in substance  It will not include interests of an emotional  conscientious  ideological or intellectual kind Byron Environment Centre Inc v The Arakwal People     ALR   at      Black CJ  see also at   Merkel J    French J said at   and           It cannot be said that the interests of traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait regional claim area from PNG would be unaffected by a native title determination over the sea  A native title determination recognising native title rights and interests on the part of the applicants could render enforceable and protected at Australian law  rights and interests which accord no recognition to the rights and interests asserted by Mr Gamogab and his community  In so saying  I offer no opinion on the question whether Mr Gamogab s asserted rights and interests as a traditional inhabitant do in truth exist in the claim area         Relevantly to the exercise of the discretion to join Mr Gamogab  it can be said that a consideration of the legitimate traditional rights and interests of PNG nationals who are traditional inhabitants of the claim area would lead to a more accurate definition of the native title rights and interests claimed  The determination could protect the rights and interests of traditional inhabitants from PNG by limiting the scope of the rights and interests of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim applicants and their communities      Emphasis added   In the motion for joinder heard by French J  Mr Gamogab described himself as a subsistence farmer living in the Kupere Village in the South Fly District  This claim  as descrbed by French J  was           He asserted  on behalf of a group he called the Dangaloub Gizra  traditional rights of movement and ownership and use of resources of the Torres Strait region  which is now subject to the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim  He said  inter alia               We claim ourselves to be a party to true traditional inherent land and resource owners and users as original inhabitants of our customary land on the coast and in the sea together with our SIEPAM  TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER  and ABARSEN  MALIG and GUDANG ABORIGINES  relatives             He said that they seek recognition by Australia of their traditional inherent rights of access and movement for traditional purposes in the Torres Strait region and of their usage and ownership of traditionally shared resources in the same or similar manner as Australia has done for their Torres Strait Island and Aboriginal relatives         Mr Gamogab set out some Dangaloub Gizra oral history and what he called the Myth of Origin passed orally from generation to generation  from time in antiquity to the present        Emphasis added   I have emphasised aspects of the reasons of French J above  as they are relevant to what Mr Gamogab is seeking  and the purpose  or one of the purposes  of his application to be joined as a respondent   Mr Gamogab  in his affidavit  referred to a submission prepared in   apparently on behalf of the occupants of the Kupere Village  in support of the Dan Ngaloub clan s participation in the sharing of benefits which might arise from the proposed PNG Australia gas pipeline project   The basis for the exercise of a discretion by French J against ordering the joinder of Mr Gamogab as respondent to the determination application is based on his Honour s consideration on the implication of the   Australia PNG Treaty  the Treaty  Treaty between Australian and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea concerning Sovereignty and Maritime Boundaries in the area between the two Countries  including the area known as Torres Strait  and Related Matters   ATS    The Treaty was made on   December   in Sydney and entered into force on   February     His Honour summarises the nature of the provisions of the Treaty as follows          Article   of the Treaty is an interpretation provision  By Article   PNG recognises Australia s sovereignty over all islands south of a seabed jurisdiction line referred to in Article   of the Treaty  defined in Annex   of the Treaty and shown on a map comprising Annex    PNG also recognised Australia s sovereignty over certain specified islands and cays north of the line  The islands recognised were Aubusi  Boigu  Dauan  Deliverance  Kaumag  Kerr  Moimi  Saibai and Turnagain  Australia recognised PNG s sovereignty over all islands north of the seabed jurisdiction line and three islands south of the line  being Kawa  Mata Kawa and Kussa  The sovereignty reciprocally recognised over the islands includes sovereignty over their territorial seas  the seabed beneath those territorial seas and its subsoil and any islands  rocks or low tide elevation lying within their territorial seas        Article   of the Treaty defines a  Protected Zone  comprising all the land  sea  airspace  seabed and subsoil within an area bounded by a line described in Annex   to the Treaty and shown in a map comprising Annex    The Protected Zone lies both to the north and south of the seabed jurisdiction line in the area between the two mainlands  Article   states       The principal purpose of the Parties in establishing the Protected Zone  and in determining its northern  southern  eastern and western boundaries  is to acknowledge and protect the traditional way of life and livelihood of the traditional inhabitants including their traditional fishing and free movement             Article   provides         Where the traditional inhabitants of one Party enjoy traditional customary rights of access to and usage of areas of land  seabed  seas  estuaries and coastal tidal areas that are in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone and that are under the jurisdiction of the other Party  and those rights are acknowledged by the traditional inhabitants living in or in proximity to those areas to be in accordance with local tradition  the other Party shall permit the continued exercise of those rights on conditions not less favourable than those applying to like rights of its own traditional inhabitants   The term   traditional inhabitants   is defined in Article    m  of the Treaty  and by that definition  in relation to Papua New Guinea  includes persons who         i  live in the Protected Zone or the adjacent coastal area of Papua New Guinea         ii  are citizens of Papua New Guinea  and        iii  maintain traditional customary associations with areas or features in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone in relation to their subsistence or livelihood or social  cultural or religious activities   The term   Protected Zone  means the zone established under Article   of the Treaty  namely     A Protected Zone in the Torres Strait is hereby established comprising all the land  sea  airspace  seabed and subsoil within the area bounded by the line described in Annex   to this Treaty  The line so described is shown on the maps annexed to this Treaty as Annexes   and   and  in part  on the map annexed to this Treaty as Annex         The Parties shall adopt and apply measures in relation to the Protected Zone in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty       The principal purpose of the Parties in establishing the Protected Zone  and in determining its northern  southern  eastern and western boundaries  is to acknowledge and protect the traditional way of life and livelihood of the traditional inhabitants including their traditional fishing and free movement       A further purpose of the Parties in establishing the Protected Zone is to protect and preserve the marine environment and indigenous fauna and flora in and in the vicinity of the Protected Zone   The term   traditional activities   is defined in Article    k  to include  amongst other things    traditional fishing   and   barter and market trade    Article    k  says that    In the application of this definition  except in relation to activities of a commercial nature   traditional  shall be interpreted liberally and in the light of prevailing custom     The effect of the Exchange of Notes between Australia and Papua New Guinea in   on those who were to be traditional inhabitants figures very highly in the reasons for his Honour s discretion  French J said at par      It appears from the applicants  submissions which were  in this respect  undisputed  the definition of  traditional inhabitants  in the Treaty did not lend itself to a straightforward identification of PNG nationals who would benefit from the Treaty  A list of villages whose inhabitants would be regarded as traditional inhabitants for the purposes of the Treaty was agreed by Exchange of Notes between Australia and PNG in    This effectively restricted the definition of the term  traditional inhabitant  to people from one of   listed  Treaty villages   The applicants pointed out that this created two classes of PNG nationals who might seek access to Australian waters  The first are those nationals who are from Treaty villages and who are accepted as beneficiaries of the Treaty  The second consists of nationals who did not have the benefit of the Treaty  I have not been able to sight the Exchange of Notes nor to consider their effect on the Treaty obligations   In this regard  I note that the question of exclusion of a number of villages including Kupere is a matter of concern to the people of Kupere  on whose behalf Mr Gamogab sought joinder   In his reasons  French J said at par    In a petition addressed to the Honourable Sir John Kaputin  former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of PNG  it was said that a number of villages including Kupere have been      excluded from the Treaty since     One of the demands in the petition was that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs endorse      our membership to the Treaty and accordingly inform Canberra    The basis for his Honour s decision against joinder appears from pars   to   of his Honour s reasons          In my opinion it is reasonable arguable that the Commonwealth has an obligation under the Treaty to ensure that the traditional activities of traditional inhabitants in the Torres Strait which are protected by the Treaty are taken into account to the extent that it is proper to do so in the native title determination process  This may extend to the provision of evidence relevant to the existence of limitations on the applicants  native title rights and interests by reference to their traditional acceptance of concurrent use of some of the land and waters within the claim area  The extent to which that obligation is limited by the Exchange of Notes was not debated on the motion before the Court        The question whether a PNG village whose members are not treated as traditional inhabitants by the executive governments of PNG and Australia for the purposes of the Treaty should be so treated for the purpose of these proceedings  is a matter for those executive governments   These proceedings should not be used as a vehicle for advancing the case of particular PNG villages in that respect  It may be that a PNG group dissatisfied with its government s failure to recognise its members as traditional inhabitants for the purposes of the Treaty could bring declaratory proceedings in the National Court of PNG        There is a risk  in my opinion  that the joinder of Mr Gamogab will bring to bear on these proceedings debates between village communities in PNG about their respective interests in the Torres Region Seas Claim area  These are matters best left to the Courts of PNG or to its executive government to resolve by agreement with the Australian government under the Treaty  As a matter of discretion I consider that the joinder of Mr Gamogab  notwithstanding his claimed interest  is undesirable  I consider that attention should also be given to the position of other PNG nationals who have been joined as parties        I do not exclude the possibility that any native title determination which is made pursuant to the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim will be expressed to be subject to the traditional rights and interests of PNG nationals  It is to be hoped that so much could be made a matter of agreement if the positions of the parties allow  The question then of which PNG nationals would be entitled to exercise those traditional rights and interests could be worked out on a case by case basis in the event of a dispute if one arose  It may be  for example  that the applicants would be able to agree that villages recognised as Treaty villages pursuant to the Exchange of Notes made in     could be identified as members of the classes of person entitled to carry out traditional activities in part of the claim area   The list of such communities need not be exhaustive for the purposes of the determination and need not exclude the possibility that other groups might be included      Emphasis added   All the parties in these proceedings have treated the decision of French J declining Mr Gamogab as a respondent to the determination proceedings as an interlocutory decision   It is accepted by the parties that in deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted in this case  the issues are   i  whether  in all the circumstances  the decision of French J is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by a Full Court  and   ii  whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision to be wrong       See D cor Corporation Pty Ltd and another v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at pp         I am  here  concerned only with the question of whether leave should be granted  and not whether the exercise of judicial discretion by French J miscarried  In that regard  I have to consider the tests earlier set out in D cor Corporation Pty Ltd and another v Dart Industries Inc     FCR     Both the Commonwealth of Australia and the applicants in the principal proceedings have submitted that leave should be refused  The State of Queensland has entered a submitting appearance on the application for leave save as to costs   Ms R  Webb QC  counsel for the Commonwealth  pointed out that the Papua Act    Cth  was repealed by an Act which was itself repealed  and the effect of s   of the Papua New Guinea Independence Act    Cth  makes it plain that Mr Gamogab has no rights under the Papua Act    Cth   as Mr Gamogab in one of his affidavits alleges   Further  Ms Webb contends this basis is a matter which was not argued before the primary judge   The Commonwealth  in its submissions before French J  disputed the contentions by the applicant in the principal proceedings about the effect of the   Treaty  and made detailed submissions in respect of each aspect of those contentions  Importantly  however  the primary judge said at par      It is not necessary for present purposes to rule upon the correctness of the Commonwealth s submissions  The nature of the issues they raise however  informs the exercise of the discretion to join or not join Mr Gamogab       Emphasis added   It is arguable that this consideration taints the exercise of the discretion by the primary judge  Further  French J said at par    The question whether a PNG village whose members are not treated as traditional inhabitants by the executive governments of PNG and Australia for the purposes of the Treaty should be so treated for the purpose of these proceedings  is a matter for those executive governments     This also arguably taints the valid exercise of the discretion not to join Mr Gamogab to the claim determination proceedings   In my opinion  it is at least arguable that the fact that the governments of PNG and Australia in the Exchange of Notes seem to evince the view that the villagers of Kupere are not   traditional inhabitants   should not be the basis for denying Mr Gamogab from contending in the principal proceedings that he enjoys rights which qualify the rights of the applicants in the Torres Strait Island sea claim   The submissions on behalf of the Commonwealth acknowledge           There is perhaps an alternative basis upon which Mr Gamogab might be allowed to participate in the Torres Strait Regional Seas claim  which alternative basis need not involve the Court in non justiciable controversies                 This alternative basis has not been expressly relied on by Mr Gamogab                 However  French J alluded to this alternative basis at     when he suggested that Mr Gamogab could seek to mount a defensive action against the Torres Strait islander claimants to try to limit the kinds of native title rights that they might have recognised                 In other words  Mr Gamogab s involvement in the Torres Strait Regional Seas claim need not violate the principles set out earlier in these submissions if that involvement   a  is on the basis that Mr Gamogab is not entitled to rely on or indeed invoke the Treaty  and  b  is strictly confined to being a contradictor to the evidentiary case advanced by the Torres Strait islander native title claimants                  For example  Mr Gamogab might seek to lead evidence relating to the content of the rights and interests possessed for the purposes of the Native Title Act    Cth  under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the Torres Strait islander native title claimants                 In this regard  Mr Gamogab might seek to lead evidence that the rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the Torres Strait islander native title claimants                have never included rights of exclusive possession of the sea or seabed          have never amounted to a right to exclude the Dangaloub Gizra from the claim area or parts of it          always positively included rights of access and use possessed by the Dangaloub Gizra          never covered certain areas  e g  reefs  customarily exploited by the Dangaloub Gizra              E g   purely hypothetically   in the memory of the oldest living inhabitant at Kupere  the people of Kupere have always fished at reef X in the claim area  and nobody has ever tried to stop them  The Torres Strait islanders have always accepted that people from Kupere have right to fish at reef X in the claim area    The claim for Mr Gamogab to be joined  is  in my view  not confined to being a contradictor to the evidentiary case advanced by the claimants  Positive evidence that the people of Kupere have always fished in the claim area  or have always exercised other rights would be relevant in the determination of the extent of the rights that inhere to the Torres Strait Island claimants   The Commonwealth  however  contends that this is not an argument that Mr Gamogab is thus far advancing in this Court   This submission involves  in my view  a misunderstanding of at least one basis of the claim that Mr Gamogab wishes to advance  I have earlier emphasised some of the reasons of French J which bear on this claim  French J held that Mr Gamogab had an interest which would render him eligible for joinder as a party  His Honour said at par    The kind of interest necessary to enliven the discretion under s   can include       a special well established non propriety connection with land or waters that is of significance to that person      And at par   his Honour said       A native title determination recognising native title rights and interests on the part of the applicants could render enforceable and protected at Australian law  rights and interests which accord no recognition to the rights and interests asserted by Mr Gamogab and his community  In so saying  I offer no opinion on the question whether Mr Gamogab s asserted rights and interests as a traditional inhabitant do in truth exist in the claim area   The issues I have canvassed on this leave application involve important questions and it is at least arguable that the exercising of discretion by the primary judge was tainted by having regard to irrelevant considerations  or by a misunderstanding of what the applicant was asserting as a basis for joinder   The fact that the applicant wishes also to have considered the contents of the Exchange of Notes and the correctness of the classification of the villagers  questions which are not relevant to the principal proceedings  with the consequence that those proceedings are not a competent  let alone appropriate  forum for the resolution of those issues  does not mean that Mr Gamogab ought not be allowed to participate in the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim   In the words of the Commonwealth submission  having regard to the interest which Mr Gamogab asserted and which the primary judge regarded as sufficient as providing a sufficient basis to join him as a party  it is arguable that the decision to exclude him as a part was wrong  I emphasise that I am only determining a question of leave to appeal   For the above reasons I grant leave to Pende Gamogab to appeal from the judgment of French J of   September   in proceeding QUD   of     There will be no order as to costs                                  I certify that the preceding sixty six   numbered

leave is sought involved the exercise of judicial discretion  On an appeal from such an exercise  the appeal court is not entitled to try the issue afresh or to substitute its own discretionary

the correctness of the decision the subject of that appeal as explained by Kitto J in Australian Coal and Shale Employees  Federation and another v The Commonwealth and others     CLR   at p      So  too  there are to be found in many of the cases decided upon the wider question as to the proper attitude of a court of appeal to any judgment given in exercise of a discretion  statements appearing to limit the function of the appellate court to correcting errors of principle  Yet in that wider area it is clear that such statements are not exhaustive  I shall not repeat the references I made in Lovell v  Lovell   HCA         CLR   to cases of the highest authority which appear to me to establish that the true principle limiting the manner in which appellate jurisdiction is exercised in respect of decisions involving discretionary judgment is that there is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision appealed from  and that that decision should therefore be affirmed unless the court of appeal is satisfied that it is clearly wrong  A degree of satisfaction sufficient to overcome the strength of the presumption may exist where there has been an error which consists in acting upon a wrong principle  or giving weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters  or failing to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations  or making a mistake as to the facts  Again  the nature of the error may not be discoverable  but even so it is sufficient that the result is so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance  House v  The King   HCA         CLR    citedWilliams and others v Spautz       HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The High Court in Williams and others v Spautz       HCA       CLR   referred at p   to a statement In re Marjory   Ch   by the Lord Evershed   where the Master of the Rolls said        court proceedings may not be used or threatened for the purpose of obtaining for the person so using or threatening them for some collateral advantage to himself  and not for the purpose for which such proceedings are properly designed and exist       Accepting that leave should not be granted so as to enable a determination of whatever treaty rights may or may not exist in Mr Gamogab  nonetheless  it seems to me that the primary judge found that there was a legitimate interest which resided in Mr Gamogab which enabled him to be considered for joinder as a respondent in the native title determination application proceedings   It seems to me that the focus on the Treaty as the basis for the exercise of a discretion against the joinder of Mr Gamogab is  at least arguably  quite misplaced  The focus on the Treaty has to be seen in the context of the submission that was made by the applicants in the principal proceedings  that Australian migration  fisheries  and associated legislation made it unlawful  at least for PNG non Treaty groups  to access the claim area  inconsistent with their continued use of the claim area in accordance with their customary law
