Nguyen v Pascoe   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toRe Bilen  Ex Parte Sistrom   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  By an application filed   November   in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia  the Federal Magistrates Court  the respondent sought relief pursuant to s  b  of the Act in respect of the realisation of the property and the disposition of the proceeds of any sale  In Re Bilen  Ex Parte Sistrom   FCA   Neaves J at   said in relation to an application by the trustee of a bankrupt seeking declarations as to the beneficial ownership of land registered in the names of a bankrupt and his wife as joint tenants and in respect of the disposition of the bankrupt s undivided half share     In my opinion s   of the Bankruptcy Act   is not a provision limiting the Court s jurisdiction  It is a facultative provision giving the Court full power  within the limits of its jurisdiction to be found elsewhere  to make such orders as it considers should be made in order to carry out and give effect to the Act  The words used are not words of limitation but of extension   Later his Honour said at          this Court is not restricted in considering what orders it would be appropriate to make in exercise of the power conferred on it by s   of the Bankruptcy Act   by the kinds of limitations which may be found in the Partition Act     NSW   see also s  G of the Conveyancing Act    NSW  The respondent s application came before the learned Federal Magistrate on   December     January and   February     On   December   the Federal Magistrate ordered the appellant to file and serve a Notice of Appearance by   December   but this did not occur  However  at about     pm on   December   Mr Thanh Tung Vo  a solicitor in the firm known as Australasia Legal   Migration Services  Solicitors attempted to file a Notice of Appearance dated   December   by forwarding same by facsimile to facsimile number     which he believed to be the facsimile number for the Federal Magistrates Court  Whether this Notice of Appearance reached the Court or not is uncertain  It certainly did not reach the relevant Federal Magistrates Court file number SYG   of    The Federal Magistrate also ordered that the Respondent file and serve  a Notice in accordance with Form   stating grounds of opposition and affidavit supporting grounds of opposition  by   December    Once again  this did not occur   Whilst a notice in accordance with Form   stating the appellant s grounds of opposition to the trustee s application was never filed  an attempt was made to prepare an affidavit for the appellant propounding that she had contributed   out of a total purchase price of   paid for the property  that the balance had been funded by an advance from Commonwealth Bank of Australia to the appellant and the bankrupt and that she had paid all the monies due under the mortgage  Page   of the affidavit suggests that it was sworn on   December    This is patently incorrect  but I am satisfied that no deception of the Federal Magistrates Court was intended  Each of the annexure notes in respect of annexures  A   B  and  C  to the affidavit indicate that it was in fact sworn on   February    Mr Vo s evidence is that he was responsible for the insertion of the date   December   which was the date when he set about drafting the affidavit  Due to inadvertence on his behalf he failed to cause the correct date to be inserted on page   of the affidavit when it came to be sworn on   February   in its final form  No attempt was ever made by the appellant to file the affidavit and it was never read  However  on   February   it was handed up to the Federal Magistrate  It was not formally tendered but it seems clear to me that it was intended by Mr Vo that it should become an exhibit on the hearing of an application made by him orally on that day to which reference will be made hereafter  The affidavit included the following         Although my husband and I were registered as proprietors of the Property as joint tenants  I in fact paid all the monies as necessary to purchase the Property in our joint names together with the monies advanced by the original mortgagee  the Commonwealth Bank of Australia  CBA              Annexed and marked  B  is a copy of another payment made by me to my conveyancing solicitor  although the receipt was in joint names         I made the mortgage payment from my monies solely         My husband did not contribute any to the purchase or the mortgage repayment at any time             I having made an informed decision  I oppose the sale of the Property which  is in fact mine and which is the only home of myself  my husband and my three children        appliedBienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order  as made  finally determines the rights of the parties  The test requires the appellate court to look at the consequences of the order itself and to ask whether it finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them  Accordingly  orders refusing to set aside a default judgment or refusing to grant an extension of time are not final judgments because the unsuccessful party could make a further application for the same relief  even though such an application might have very little prospect of success  per McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ in Bienstein v Bienstein   HCA

  at       appliedShocked v Goldschmidt     All ER   The relevant principles in relation to the setting aside of orders made in a party s absence have been conveniently summarised in the judgment of Leggatt LJ in Shocked v Goldschmidt     All ER   at   as follows           Where a party with notice of proceedings has disregarded the opportunity of appearing at and participating in the trial  he will normally be bound by the decision    Where judgment has been given after a trial it is the explanation for the absence of the absent party that is most important  unless the absence was not deliberate but was due to accident or mistake  the court will be unlikely to allow a rehearing    Where the setting aside of judgment would entail a complete retrial on matters of fact which have already been investigated by the court the application will not be granted unless there are very strong reasons for doing so    The court will not consider setting aside judgment regularly obtained unless the party applying enjoys real prospects of success    Delay in applying to set aside is relevant  particularly if during the period of delay the successful party has acted on the judgment  or third parties have acquired rights by reference to it    In considering justice between parties  the conduct of the person applying to set aside the judgment has to be considered  where he has failed to comply with orders of the court  the court will be less ready to exercise its discretion in his favour    A material consideration is whether the successful party would be prejudiced by the judgment being set aside  especially if he cannot be protected against the financial consequences    There is a public interest in there being an end to litigation and in not having the time of the court occupied by two trials  particularly if neither is short      Roch and Morritt LJJ agreed with the reasons for judgment of Leggatt LJ   It seems clear that the appellant did not relevantly disregard the opportunity to appear at and participate in the hearing listed for     am on   February    The arrival of Mr Vo  albeit late  suggests that the appellant s absence was anything but deliberate  It does not appear that there was an extensive trial before the Federal Magistrate on   February   before Mr Vo arrived  There was plainly no relevant delay on the part of the appellant in seeking to set aside the orders made earlier in the day on   February   and there would appear to be no real prejudice to the respondent if the orders made earlier in the day on   February   were to be set aside  The conduct of the appellant in failing to comply with orders of the Federal Magistrate in relation to the provision of particulars of her grounds of opposition to the trustee s application and the filing of affidavits warrants criticism  but does not  in my view  compel a conclusion that the application to set aside the earlier orders should have been refused  It is but one of the matters to which the Federal Magistrate was entitled to have and should have had regard in the exercise of his discretion   The substantial consideration  in the circumstances of this case  seems to me to be whether the appellant would enjoy  real prospects of success  were the orders made in her absence on   February   to be set aside   Whilst the Federal Magistrate appears to have conducted something of a mini trial by reference to the appellant s affidavit of   December   and the corroborative documents upon which she sought to rely being annexures  A   B  and  C  to that affidavit  the fact remains that notwithstanding the Federal Magistrate s findings in respect of the corroborative evidence  her untested evidence as recorded in the affidavit was  as the Federal Magistrate found  to suggest that she had  advanced   of the   purchase price  the balance being a mortgage to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia  which she says she made all the payments for
