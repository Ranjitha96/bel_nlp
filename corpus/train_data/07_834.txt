Christine Wodianicky Heiler as Legal Personal Representative of Anthony Wodianicky Heiler v Repatriation Commission   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedComcare v Etheridge   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The next question is whether there was any error of law by the Tribunal in concluding that the effects  apparently able to be described as  epileptic  in their nature  of the glioma are also able to be comprehended within the delegate s acceptance of  epilepsy  as a war caused disease  so that incapacity from the effects of the glioma should  even if the delegate made a factual mistake  be regarded as war caused  Whatever the correctness of that conclusion  unfortunately for the applicant it does not appear to me to raise a question of law  Whether the Tribunal was factually correct about the distinction between and separateness of the incapacity caused by the glioma and incapacity caused by the accepted disease shortly described by the delegate as epilepsy only raises  in my opinion  a question of fact or  at worst  no more than a mixed question of law and fact  namely  what actually was were the war caused disease s  from which the delegate determined the degree of incapacity of the veteran was over    the first relevant requirement of s    Mixed questions of law and fact have been held by the Full Court not to raise a question of law  Comcare v Etheridge   FCAFC         FCR   at      It was suggested by the applicant that  t he question of law in the present matter is whether the Tribunal had the power to effectively ignore the acceptance of epilepsy as a war caused condition when considering whether the veteran was eligible to be paid pension at the Special Rate given by section   of the Act    Leaving aside the issue as to whether the Tribunal did so  effectively ignore the acceptance of epilepsy  the formulation does not encourage a conclusion that it is a question of law unmixed with fact  Nor  in substance  is it referred toFitzmaurice v Repatriation Commission     ALD   The Tribunal is said to have erred in law by upsetting a finding of fact favourable to the late veteran and the applicant which had allegedly been made by the primary decision maker  In Fitzmaurice v Repatriation Commission     ALD   Wilcox and Foster JJ held that the Tribunal was able to examine both the claim to entitlement and assessment of the rate of pension on a review by the Tribunal of a substituted decision by the Board under s  b   now subs  c  of the Act   However in Re Cotterell   Repatriation Commission     AAR   Blow DP  as Blow J then was  said at    the structure of s    of the Act   makes it abundantly clear that  in assessing the rate of pension payable in respect of a war caused condition  no decision maker at any level has the freedom to reconsider  ignore or reverse the determination that that condition is war caused   The applicant sought to distinguish Fitzmaurice   ALD   arguing that the present was a case not of review of a substituted decision  made by the Tribunal under s  c    but a review of an affirmed decision under s  a   Section   provides        Where a decision made by the Commission has been reviewed by the Board upon a request made under section   and affirmed  varied or set aside  then  subject to section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act     application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review                 c  of the decision made by the Board in substitution for the decision so set aside  The respondent argued that the Tribunal had essentially affirmed the decision under review on the basis that it was not reasonably satisfied  that the  late veteran s loss of earnings on his own account was due to war caused incapacity alone  and this was unquestionably supported by the evidence before the Tribunal  Indeed  the respondent submitted that the Tribunal could not lawfully disregard the diagnosed brain tumour when making an assessment of why the late veteran had been prevented from returning to work  see s  c    In any case  the respondent submitted  the applicant was wrong in contending that the Tribunal could not look behind the acceptance of epilepsy as war caused  because the original decision of the delegate was in fact a decision with respect to whether the late veteran s epilepsy was war caused and the rate of pension which the late veteran was entitled to receive  The respondent relied on Fitzmaurice   ALD   and suggested that the construction of the then s  b  by Wilcox and Foster JJ offers a clear guide to the construction of the present s  a   Adopting this construction  the phrase  the decision of the Commission that was so affirmed  in s  a  of the Act means the decision of the Commission in relation to both entitlement and assessment  It may be noted that the phrase used in the current s  b  is  the decision of the Commission as so varied  but  in the version of the Act considered in Fitzmaurice   ALD   the phrase  the decision made by the Board in substitution for the decision so set aside   which now appears in s  c    appeared in subs  b    The Tribunal gave an ex tempore decision and noted that its  oral reasons may reflect the inelegance  of such a decision  The transcribed reasons for decision should be reviewed respectfully and  to a degree  charitably   It is first necessary to identify what the Tribunal did decide  In my opinion the respondent s suggested answer to this is correct   In saying this  I assume that Blow DP was correct in Cotterell   AAR   in saying  at     The structure of the Act is such that any claim to have a medical condition accepted as war caused must be considered on its merits  free of the fetters of any earlier determination in respect of any related medical condition  whereas the structure of s   makes it abundantly clear that  in assessing the rate of pension payable in respect of a war caused condition  no decision maker at any level has the freedom to reconsider  ignore or reverse the determination that that condition is war caused   I am also prepared to assume that Blow DP s categorisation at   of Fitzmaurice   ALD   as  authority for the proposition that  on a review of a decision by  the  Tribunal  the whole of the decision can be reviewed  is correct and that such a conclusion need not detract from Blow DP s primary point in a case such as the present where all that was at issue was the quantum  and type  of pension payable referred toFlentjar v Repatriation Commission     ALD   Section  c  contains a requirement that incapacity from war caused injury or war caused disease  or both   alone  prevents a veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking  In Flentjar v Repatriation Commission     ALD   at   Branson J  Beaumont and Merkel JJ agreeing  expressed that requirement in the form of a question        is the war caused injury or war caused disease  or both  the only factor or factors preventing the veteran from continuing to undertake that work  Flentjar   ALD   was followed in Repatriation Commission v Hendy     ALD    There  the Full Court held at   that      The language of s  c  of the Act directs attention to the question of whether incapacity from the relevant condition alone prevents a veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work  The provision does not contemplate that other factors are only to be taken into account if they  of themselves  prevent the veteran from working  The decision maker is required to take into account any factor that plays a part or contributes to a veteran s being prevented from continuing to engage in remunerative work      Emphasis in original   The Board found it convenient to deal with the s   issues by answering a series of questions thought in Flentjar   ALD   to be appropriate  One question the Board considered was   i s the veteran  by reason of war caused injury or     disease     prevented from continuing to undertake  remunerative  work  In the course of giving an affirmative answer to this question  the Board said      However the event which precipitated his leaving work was not his post traumatic stress disorder  as was contended by his wife in her evidence to the previous Board  but a  seizure  in April    The following day  on the basis of the history taken from the veteran and his wife  Dr Ell  consultant neurologist considered there had been a  gelastic seizure   In Dr Ell s report the doctor recorded that the veteran was not permitted to drive   On the basis of this diagnosis the Repatriation Commission allowed the veteran s claim for epilepsy which was made on   April     The Board therefore considered the next Flentjar question  was the war caused injury disease  the only factor or factors preventing the veteran from continuing to undertake that work   Emphasis in original   The Board answered that question by saying    The Board came to the view that it was more likely than not that the veteran is prevented from continuing to work by both his post traumatic stress disorder and his brain tumour  It cannot therefore be said that it is his accepted disabilities alone that prevent him from being able to continue to work   In the Tribunal s proceedings  the respondent filed a Statement of Facts and Contentions  This made it clear that the respondent was only asserting that the veteran had not satisfied the two  alone  tests posited by s   approvedRe Cotterell   Repatriation Commission     AAR   The Tribunal is said to have erred in law by upsetting a finding of fact favourable to the late veteran and the applicant which had allegedly been made by the primary decision maker  In Fitzmaurice v Repatriation Commission     ALD   Wilcox and Foster JJ held that the Tribunal was able to examine both the claim to entitlement and assessment of the rate of pension on a review by the Tribunal of a substituted decision by the Board under s  b   now subs  c  of the Act   However in Re Cotterell   Repatriation Commission     AAR   Blow DP  as Blow J then was  said at    the structure of s    of the Act   makes it abundantly clear that  in assessing the rate of pension payable in respect of a war caused condition  no decision maker at any level has the freedom to reconsider  ignore or reverse the determination that that condition is war caused   In the present case the Tribunal said of Re Cotterell   AAR       The learned Deputy President in that matter pointed out that when a matter of assessment is before this Tribunal it is not open to the respondent to challenge any prior decision which has determined that a condition is war caused  That is not to say  however  that that takes away from this Tribunal the responsibility to make its own decision standing in the shoes of the decision maker having regard to such medical reports as have been put before it   The applicant submitted that it was not open to the Tribunal  as a matter of power or jurisdiction  to look behind the acceptance of epilepsy as war caused   According to the applicant  the Tribunal was not at liberty to consider the acceptance of epilepsy afresh  the question of epilepsy being war caused was not part of the  chain of review  before the Board and the Tribunal  All that was under review was the veteran s eligibility for the Special Rate of pension  Had the Tribunal approached the matter in the way suggested by the applicant then it might have concluded that the incapacity suffered by the late veteran could have been characterised as incapacity from war caused injury or disease alone   In saying this  I assume that Blow DP was correct in Cotterell   AAR   in saying  at     The structure of the Act is such that any claim to have a medical condition accepted as war caused must be considered on its merits  free of the fetters
