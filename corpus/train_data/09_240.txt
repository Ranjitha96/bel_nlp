Eric Preston Pty Ltd v Euroz Securities Limited   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCarnell v Mann     FCR  A Full Court of this Court in Carnell v Mann     FCR   at   held that pursuant to ss   and     originals and copies are equally protected subject to the privilege being lost for one of the reasons set out in the succeeding sections of the Act  The second e mail was merely an electronic means of delivering a copy of the first e mail to Mr Anderson  Alternative means could have been employed by EP  A photocopy of the first e mail could have been sent by mail or hand delivered or sent by facsimile transmission  Each method is to the same effect  a copy of the original privileged communication would have been delivered to Mr Anderson  The language of s  a  is directed to prohibiting evidence being adduced that would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between a client and a lawyer  To allow  for example  cross examination of Mr Drummond  by senior counsel for Euroz  utilising the second e mail  would inevitably result in evidence being adduced which would result in the disclosure  in whole or part  of the privileged communication in the first e mail  This reflects the position at common law as noted by the Full Court in Carnell v Mann at   when their Honours observed    In principle  whether copies of original documents are privileged at common law should be determined by asking what was the purpose underlying the creation of those original documents   and not what was the purpose underlying the creation of the copies see Carlton Cranes Ltd v Consolidated Hotels Ltd     NZLR   at   per Tompkins J          The better view  we think  is that  at common law  the mere act of copying a privileged document does not lead to loss of privilege in the copy simply because it was not created for a privileged purpose  In an era where so many documents are routinely copied  it would be peculiar to think that the existence of legal professional privilege in any given copy might depend upon the purpose underlying the making of that specific copy   Emphasis added It cannot be said that there was an express obligation  However  the circumstances  in my opinion  give rise to an implied obligation upon Mr Anderson  viewed objectively  not to disclose the contents of the first e mail contained in the second e mail  It may be seen that such an obligation need not be one which  arises under law  by virtue of s    As the Court said in Carnell v Mann at   the Parliament must have had in mind relationships broader than those of  for example  solicitor client when it enacted the definitions of  confidential communication  and  confidential document  in s    The very content of the first e mail which was copied in the second e mail disclosed on its face  so far as Mr Drummond  objectively  might have considered  that it related to legal proceedings  actual or anticipated involving EP  Mr Bruce Drummond as one of its directors and inferentially Mr Graham Anderson as a potential witness or at least someone who might be in a position to assist in various ways with that litigation  Again  self evidently  the first e mail was addressed to at least one person at Slater   Gordon  a well known Australian legal firm  It included information concerning the private financial affairs of EP  Furthermore  the second e mail in the section directed to Mr Anderson shows the subject as  FW  Addition to witness statement   Accordingly  it was being sent and must be taken to have been received in the context of  at least  anticipated litigation  In my opinion  it is inconceivable that EP and Mr Anderson would have considered the communication of the second e mail to be other than on a strictly confidential basis  Furthermore  I am satisfied that the relationship between EP and Mr Anderson was of a confidential nature  In addition to the other matters which I have mentioned such is the case generally as between a client and the client s accountant  I do not mention these matters with a view to attributing any particular purpose but rather to characterise the confidential nature of the communication  This is not to say that the purpose of the communication may not be relevant to the question whether it was a confidential communication but merely that it is neither necessary to nor determinative of the resolution of the question citedHardie Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v CCD Australia Pty Ltd     FCR  EP instituted proceedings against Euroz on   May    The trial of these proceedings was listed to commence before Siopis J yesterday but by reason of this application did not commence until this morning  The privilege issue was referred to me  on an urgent basis  by Siopis J to be dealt with separately  It would have been preferable if an objection to the production of the second e mail on the ground of privilege had been taken on the return of the subpoena  Hardie Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v CCD Australia Pty Ltd     FCR    At the time that the second e mail was sent proceedings had not been instituted although legal proceedings against Euroz were in contemplation by EP  There were in fact two e mails relevant to this matter which were sent on   April    The first e mail was from Mr Drummond  and was sent on EP s behalf to Ms Carita Kazakoff  a solicitor with Slater   Gordon Solicitors who were acting for EP  It was copied by e mail to one M  Walter  also a solicitor with Slater   Gordon and P G Willis a barrister then retained on behalf of EP  The  Subject  of the first e mail was expressed to be  Addition to witness statement  appliedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs the majority of the High Court said to like effect in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at   the outcome on the question of privilege did not turn upon the manner in which the content of the privileged communications was disclosed  The privilege attaches to the communications  not to the pieces of paper on which they were written  What was shown were copies of privileged communications  The question is whether the disclosure of the communications resulted in the loss of privilege  The principal question in this application is  in my opinion  the same question identified by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at   namely whether the legal professional privilege was lost by a subsequent disclosure of those communications  There is no suggestion here of any express waiver  nor would the evidence justify such a finding  Section   of the Act provides      Subject to subsection   this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the client or party concerned has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence because it would result in a disclosure of a kind referred to in section       or    referred toSpotless Group Ltd v Premier Building and Consulting GroupPty Ltd   VSCA         VR  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  htmlThe second e mail was no more than a re communication of the privileged communication contained in the first e mail  There is no need  in those circumstances  to ask whether the re communication was made for a privileged purpose  That is the position at common law  Spotless Group Ltd v Premier Building and Consulting Group Pty Ltd   VSCA         VR   at       per Chernov JA with whom Warren CJ agreed  It also reflects that the proper approach in this case in under s   and not s
