Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales  No    Corrigendum dated   January     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedApollo Shower Screens Pty Ltd v Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Corporation     NSWLR   The evidentiary burden on a party in Worimi s position in circumstances where the moving party must prove a negative proposition has been described in Apollo Shower Screens Pty Ltd v Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Corporation     NSWLR    at   as similar to   the evidential burden placed upon an accused in a criminal trial who seeks to raise the issue of self defence which the Crown must disprove     All of the evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to produce and in the power of the other to have contradicted   Apollo Shower Screens at    Once the Land Council has established sufficient evidence from which the negative proposition  an absence of native title  may be inferred  Worimi carries an evidential burden to advance evidence of any particular matters going to the existence of native title  It is then for the Land Council to deal with the evidence in the discharge of its overall burden of proof   Apollo Shower Screens at     Worimi submits that the Land Council is in a position to call all of the customary expert evidence and has not done so  The Land Council submits that Worimi is in the position to adduce evidence from other Worimi persons in support of his claim and has not done so  Each party asserts that he or it is under no obligation to provide further evidence   The power of a party to adduce evidence may be relevant to the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented   Apollo Shower Screens at   Blatch v Archer   EngR         Cowp   at   Ho v Powell     NSWLR   at    It may also be relevant to the standard of proof  There is  however  a distinction between the probabilities on limited material available and whether limited material provides an appropriate basis on which to reach a reasonable decision   Ho at     Much has been made in submissions of which party is better able to call evidence and the effect on the proof of a negative proposition  On one hand  the Land Council has not called evidence from all the Worimi people  It has called seven witnesses  some of whom have studied Worimi history and have knowledge of Worimi laws and customs and others from Worimi s family  It has  as I have said  been authorised to bring this application  Worimi asserts that  at least  his family  as part of the Garuahgal clan  has native title rights and interests over the Land  It is Worimi who has the greater means to produce evidence from his family or from other Garuahgal or Worimi people to contradict the proposition of no native title  In particular  if Worimi asserts that Lot   and Kingsley Beach are a women s site of which he cannot have personal knowledge  the absence of any evidence of the laws and customs associated with that site from a woman supporting his assertion is telling  The only evidence in support of Worimi s claims was filed in respect of his claimant applications and was from Worimi s mother  who is Yorta Yorta  and from his wife  sister and daughters  Priscilla Dates changed her evidence in these proceedings  who say little more than that they take their information from Worimi and support his assertions  The failure on Worimi s part to call corroborative evidence lessens the burden of proof on the Land Council to establish the negative proposition   Apollo Shower Screens at    It does not increase the burden on the Land Council   I am satisfied that there has not been the necessary connection with the Land and the observance of the asserted laws and customs  This is not because of Worimi s temporary absence in Western Australia  It is because  on the evidence  I am satisfied that there was no women s site on or near Lot   and that there was no use of a waterhole on or near Lot   associated with the birth of Worimi children  If there were such a site or such use  it has long since ceased to be used  Worimi s attempt to revive such use in the case of his daughter and the birth of his grandson is insufficient to give rise to native title rights and interests in the Land   The group or communal rights that form the basis of Worimi s case are in respect of the claimed women s sight on or near the Land  The characterisation of Worimi s asserted native title rights and interests has changed over time  Worimi also claims rights in respect of his own observance of traditional hunting and gathering customs on the Land  However  Worimi appears to assert that these rights are held by all Worimi people or at least by the Garuahgal clan  There is no sufficient evidence that any such rights  whether individual  group or communal  are possessed under a normative system of traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed by Worimi people or by the Garuahgal clan  Worimi s account of traditional hunting and gathering law and custom has been disputed by the Land Council s witnesses citedBlatch v Archer   EngR         Cowp   The power of a party to adduce evidence may be relevant to the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented   Apollo Shower Screens at   Blatch v Archer   EngR         Cowp   at   Ho v Powell     NSWLR   at    It may also be relevant to the standard of proof  There is  however  a distinction between the probabilities on limited material available and whether limited material provides an appropriate basis on which to reach a reasonable decision   Ho at   referred toBodney v Bennell     FCR   The Land Council relies on Worimi s own evidence to demonstrate a lack of continuity in the practices said to have been carried out on or near the Land  Worimi acknowledges that  whether or not Lot   and the area at Kingsley Beach are women s sites and associated with the birth of children  whether Worimi  Maaiangal or Garuahgal  there has not been a continuous connection with such people and the observance of traditional laws and customs since sovereignty  Accordingly  there has not been the requisite  connection  with the Land as required by s   of the Act   Bodney v Bennell     FCR   at      This is not because of the physical presence or absence on the Land  It is because the practices of his own family  that he says are associated with the Land  were not observed at least from the time of his grandmother until his daughter went onto the Land in    I accept that  at least now  Worimi feels strongly about his Aboriginal heritage  Worimi accepts that he has taken some of the customs observed by the Dunghutti people  as described and observed by his wife Cynthia  in practising with his daughter the customs connected with birth and baptism that he said were carried out on the Land and Kingsley Beach  That could be said to reflect the incorporation  in the ordinary course  of other customs and practices into the traditional forms of the Garuahgal people   As was said in Yorta Yorta at   and repeated in Bodney at   if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty  the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist  The law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society  a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs   Yorta Yorta at   Bodney at      Unless a society has  and acknowledges and observes  laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed  there can be no native title rights whether communal  group or individual     Bodney at    It is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today   Bodney at    This must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted   Bodney at       Where individual native title rights are claimed  they arise out of and depend upon the traditional laws and customs of the community in question   Bodney at    Rights may be communally held or held by a sub group or  indeed  by an individual  depending on the nature of the society said to be the repository of the traditional laws and customs that give rise to the native title rights and interests   Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Warumungu  Wakaya Native Title Claim Group   FCAFC         FCR   at   and    In the present case  the native title rights over a Worimi women s site would be held by Worimi women  They deny such rights for Lot   referred toCommonwealth v Clifton     FCR   A native title determination application may only be made in accordance with the Act   Commonwealth v Clifton     FCR   at     and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Act  As the Full Court noted in Clifton   stringent requirements are placed upon an applicant seeking a determination of native title  If I am not satisfied that native title does not exist  the application should be dismissed   The Act does not provide for a procedure that enables a respondent to obtain a determination of native title which that party could not obtain as an applicant  The Act requires a native title claimant application to be authorised by the relevant native title claim group   Clifton at    Worimi has failed to maintain his filed claimant applications as they were not authorised by his asserted claim group  as described in each claimant application   The beneficial nature of the Act does not mean that a different standard applies to the evidentiary burden and the onus of proof  Worimi has not advanced sufficient reason why the Land Council s application should not be determined on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities  In any event  Worimi appears to have accepted that the applicable standard of proof is the balance of probabilities   In the absence of a claimant application following the giving of notice of the making of the non claimant application in respect of the Land  the Court is entitled to be satisfied that no other claim group or groups assert a claim to hold native title to the Land   Clifton at    At the very least  this supports an inference of an absence of native title over the Land  subject to the matters to be raised by Worimi   It does not follow that the absence of a native title claim means that  without more  there is a declaration of no native title  As was recognised in the joinder of Worimi to these proceedings  Worimi s assertion of native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non claimant application   Worimi   at    Worimi may not be able to establish that native title does exist but his evidence  if accepted  may cast doubt on the Land Council s case   Worimi   at     It does not follow  as Worimi has previously asserted  that his inability to secure a positive native title determination means that there is no evidentiary burden on him to support his contention that there is native title  As in other proceedings  in proceedings seeking a judgment in rem that no native title exists and in proceedings arising under beneficial legislation  the Court will assess the whole of the evidence   In relation to the non claimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the Land  the following seems to me to apply    The Act permits the making of non claimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land     This allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists  The Act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts  s  FA   Section   provides for non claimant applications for native title determinations  There is no indication in the Act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title     The Minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings  The Minister has an interest in these proceedings  namely  to ensure that if the Court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the Land  that the Court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title  The Minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not  and in what way  the Crown s radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests  In any event  the Act does not require the Minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings     These proceedings do not enable Worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists  In order to establish that native title exists  it is necessary to make an application under the Act and to comply with the Act and the requirements for the establishment of native title   Kokatha   Clifton   Worimi         An applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land  That onus applies to a civil standard  The applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist     There is no indication in the NSW Act or the Act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard     A respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicant s case  As I said in Worimi   at   Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council s evidence  Worimi s assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non claimant application   Worimi   at       The decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the Court including evidence adduced by Worimi     The evidence adduced by Worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council s case such that the Land Council does not satisfy the Court that  on the balance of probabilities  no native title exists over the Land     Accordingly  the onus is not on the Land Council to satisfy the Court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title  The Land Council is not required positively to establish the situation pre sovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs  It is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage      Worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title  That necessarily means native title under the Act  The evidence must address the elements of such a claim  in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from pre sovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present  It is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist  If the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title  such as continuous connection with the Land  this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title     The Land Council may call evidence as to the existence or non existence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal  group or individual rights  The Land Council may establish that only one necessary element is missing  such as continuous connection  That would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title     The subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot  Lot    Worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with Lot   without also considering the surrounding land  The Land Council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the Port Stephens area  The evidence needs to concern the Land  However  evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant  The question remains  however  whether there are native title rights and interests over Lot       It is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a non claimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met  In the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the Land  the Land Council would be entitled to the determination it seeks  Both the Land Council and Worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title  It is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the Land Council has established  on the balance of probabilities  that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the Land Council s case referred toDe Rose v State of South Australia   FCAFC         FCR

consideredDerschaw v Sutton     WAR   Derschaw v Sutton     WAR   was a case of defensive native title to a criminal prosecution  That is  the defendants sought to establish the existence of native title as a defence  Justice Franklyn  with whom Murray J agreed  held at   that the defendants had to adduce or direct the Court s attention to evidence of each of the material matters necessary to establish the existence of native title  Despite Worimi s submission that the case has no precedent value  it should  as a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia  be followed unless it is plainly wrong   Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say Dee Pty Ltd     CLR   at    Similar reasoning has been followed in other cases  see  for example  Mason v Tritton     NSWLR   Dillon v Davies     ALR     Lewis v Wanganeen   SASC    Special leave to appeal Derschaw to the High Court was refused  In my respectful opinion  it is not plainly wrong  Justice Franklyn   drawing from Mabo v The State of Queensland  No     HCA         CLR     pointed out that  in the absence of evidence going to each element of native title  there is insufficient foundation for the claim to have legal justification  I agree  with respect  with that analysis  To establish the existence of native title under the Act  the same elements of native title apply whether native title is asserted by an applicant or by a respondent consideredGale v Minister for Land   Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Worimi points to Gale v Minister for Land   Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales   FCA   where it was accepted that at the time of sovereignty  the lands were inhabited by organised communities of Aboriginal people who had rights and interests in the subject lands  sourced in traditional laws and customs  at    The parties accepted the   tenacious persistence of native title   and of traditional Aboriginal culture  Justice Madgwick took account of extensive expert reports of anthropologists and historians  as well as other evidence that had been filed  to conclude that there was no native title over the lands in question  That expert evidence was available in Gale   The fact that no such evidence is available in these proceedings does not prevent a decision being reached as to whether the Land Council has satisfied the burden of establishing the absence of native title  on the basis of the evidence adduced   The Land Council is not required to overcome and negative a presumption that native title exists over Lot     Worimi points to the description of all of the land around Port Stephens as  traditional Worimi country  or in similar terms  The Minister accepts that   it is common ground that the Land falls within traditional Worimi country    However  the Minister does not agree that the use of such an expression or such informal identification of a region with a people  the Worimi nation  entails acceptance that there is and has at all times since   been a native title holding group that is part of a society which has all the attributes that are necessary to sustain native title rights and interests in the Land under the Act   Worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary  In an area where non Aboriginal communities developed  many Aboriginal families lived at Karuah  which is also part of Worimi land  In deciding whether claimants  by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed  have a present connection with land  some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed   Gale at   citing Yorta Yorta and De Rose     In Gale  Madgwick J was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew  One of the respondents  Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council  sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land  Expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council had responded  His Honour considered Yorta Yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles  including     N  ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over Australia  Yorta Yorta at        The rights and interests must be presently  possessed  under traditional laws and customs  This requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed     be a system that has had a  continuous existence and vitality  since sovereignty  Yorta Yorta at        Some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim      The statutory questions  in s   are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests  not their exercise  and to the existence of a relevant  present connection  It follows that the non exercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests     will not inevitably be fatal      The requirement in s  b  for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs  that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty  It is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the Crown s radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title      It is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially  and not entirely  uninterrupted      Nonetheless  it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the pre sovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise  This entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs      Acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty  It is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them  notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society   Justice Madgwick concluded at   that there is a stringent requirement of continuity both of the society which had the rules giving rise to native title rights and interests and of observance of those traditional laws and customs which embodied those rules  At   Madgwick J found that  on the available evidence  the claimants did not constitute  even as the last member    a society that in any presently relevant sense observes traditional laws and customs    Aboriginality by descent and or self identification and acceptance as such is not enough to found a native title claim  It was not shown that there was   a society that has continued to exist since before sovereignty and which was and is united by its acknowledgement of traditional laws and observance of traditional customs  allowing that the laws and customs may have adapted    Those laws and customs were not shown to have had a  continuous existence and vitality  since sovereignty  Justice Madgwick concluded that there was no adequate reason not to make a determination that native title did not exist in relation to the subject land   Worimi asserts laws and customs in connection with the Land which  he acknowledges  are not observed by other Worimi people  That is consistent with the evidence of the other witnesses  As in Gale   Worimi and those of his family who support his claims do not constitute a society that observes traditional laws and customs in respect of the Land  As in Gale   even if the Land was associated with the birth of children of the Garuahgal people  the present observance by Worimi and one of his daughters is   at best an attempted re creation of a society which may well have had native title rights and interests    at   referred toHillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands

For the reasons set out in Worimi     I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings referred toHo v Powell     NSWLR   The power of a party to adduce evidence may be relevant

proof  There is  however  a distinction between the probabilities on limited material available and whether limited material provides an appropriate basis on which to reach a reasonable decision   Ho at   consideredJango v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Worimi says that  because the Land Council asserts that native title does not exist  it is required to prove the absence of each of the elements necessary to establish native title under the Act  On   December   after Worimi had been joined and a hearing date allocated  I directed the filing of Statements of Contentions by the Land Council and by Worimi  better to understand the case being made by each of these parties  While the document that the parties were directed to file was called a Statement of Contentions  it was clearly not a pleading in the sense used in Jango v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR    In that case  the  Points of Claim  filed by the applicant was considered to define the nature of the applicant s claim   Worimi says that the material facts in respect of each of the facts and contentions and in respect of each of the elements necessary to establish native title have not been articulated in the Land Council s Statement of Facts and Contentions  He treats them as equivalent to pleadings  They are not and were not intended by me to be so  nor were they understood by the Land Council as such   Submissions have been made concerning what has been called   the evidential onus   of proof  The Land Council contends that  on establishing the matters necessary to demonstrate that the appropriate notification procedures have occurred and in the absence of a claimant application  the Court should infer that no native title exists over the Land and   the evidential onus   shifts to Worimi  The Land Council and the Minister both say that Worimi has   an onus   regarding his assertion that native title exists over the Land referred toJango v Northern Territory     FCR   Worimi asserts that he and his immediate family may be the only Worimi people who were given native title rights and interests in the Land and  he adds  in the area from Birubi Beach to Boat Harbour  under traditional laws and customs  It follows that Worimi has the means of bringing forward evidence to establish the existence of the native title rights and interests he asserts  It is not for the Court to conduct a roving enquiry as to whether anybody  and if so who  might hold native title over the Land   Jango v Northern Territory     FCR     Jango   at    In considering the evidence adduced by Worimi  it is relevant that he is the person who is able to adduce evidence of the laws and customs that he asserts he and his family practise and observe  On the other hand  he has insufficient resources to present the expert historical and anthropological evidence to substantiate his claims referred toKokatha People v State of South Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The onus of proof is on the Land Council  which must satisfy the legal burden on the balance of probabilities  but there is no reason to conclude that if the Land Council establishes a prima facie case of no native title  there is no onus on Worimi to adduce any evidence in support of his assertion of native title  In dealing with the defensive use of native title in Kokatha People v State of South Australia   FCA     Finn J observed at   that a non applicant native title claimant who is unable to obtain authorisation to make a s   claim stands in no different position than any person who claims native title but is unable to institute proceedings to have that claim established   If the elements of native title are established by a non applicant claimant  it can prevent a determination that native title does not exist  although it cannot secure a positive determination of native title under s   of the Act   Kokatha at   per Finn J   However  Worimi s evidence may be sufficient to raise a doubt as to the non existence of native title without amounting to proof necessary for a claimant application or for a finding that native title exists   In relation to the non claimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the Land  the following seems to me to apply    The Act permits the making of non claimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land     This allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists  The Act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts  s  FA   Section   provides for non claimant applications for native title determinations  There is no indication in the Act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title     The Minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings  The Minister has an interest in these proceedings  namely  to ensure that if the Court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the Land  that the Court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title  The Minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not  and in what way  the Crown s radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests  In any event  the Act does not require the Minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings     These proceedings do not enable Worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists  In order to establish that native title exists  it is necessary to make an application under the Act and to comply with the Act and the requirements for the establishment of native title   Kokatha   Clifton   Worimi         An applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land  That onus applies to a civil standard  The applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist     There is no indication in the NSW Act or the Act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard     A respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicant s case  As I said in Worimi   at   Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council s evidence  Worimi s assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non claimant application   Worimi   at       The decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the Court including evidence adduced by Worimi     The evidence adduced by Worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council s case such that the Land Council does not satisfy the Court that  on the balance of probabilities  no native title exists over the Land     Accordingly  the onus is not on the Land Council to satisfy the Court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title  The Land Council is not required positively to establish the situation pre sovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs  It is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage      Worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title  That necessarily means native title under the Act  The evidence must address the elements of such a claim  in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from pre sovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present  It is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist  If the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title  such as continuous connection with the Land  this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title     The Land Council may call evidence as to the existence or non existence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal  group or individual rights  The Land Council may establish that only one necessary element is missing  such as continuous connection  That would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title     The subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot  Lot    Worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with Lot   without also considering the surrounding land  The Land Council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the Port Stephens area  The evidence needs to concern the Land  However  evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant  The question remains  however  whether there are native title rights and interests over Lot       It is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a non claimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met  In the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the Land  the Land Council would be entitled to the determination it seeks  Both the Land Council and Worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title  It is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the Land Council has established  on the balance of probabilities  that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the Land Council s case consideredMason v Tritton     NSWLR   Derschaw v Sutton     WAR   was a case of defensive native title to a criminal prosecution  That is  the defendants sought to establish the existence of native title as a defence  Justice Franklyn  with whom Murray J agreed  held at   that the defendants had to adduce or direct the Court s attention to evidence of each of the material matters necessary to establish the existence of native title  Despite Worimi s submission that the case has no precedent value  it should  as a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia  be followed unless it is plainly wrong   Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say Dee Pty Ltd     CLR   at    Similar reasoning has been followed in other cases  see  for example  Mason v Tritton     NSWLR   Dillon v Davies     ALR     Lewis v Wanganeen   SASC    Special leave to appeal Derschaw to the High Court was refused  In my respectful opinion  it is not plainly wrong  Justice Franklyn   drawing from Mabo v The State of Queensland  No     HCA         CLR     pointed out that  in the absence of evidence going to each element of native title  there is insufficient foundation for the claim to have legal justification  I agree  with respect  with that analysis  To establish the existence of native title under the Act  the same elements of native title apply whether native title is asserted by an applicant or by a respondent   In Mason v Tritton     NSWLR   Kirby P pointed to the difficulty for Aboriginal people to provide recorded details of  for example  genealogy  At     his Honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from   to a later time  in that case to the  s  Referring to the analysis in Wigmore on Evidence  vol     rd edition at   his Honour said that it is not appropriate

easily drawn in more traditional Aboriginal communities  However  in Mason   there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved  Further  it is hard to see from Yorta Yorta

The Minister submits that a party seeking to resist the making of the orders sought in a non claimant application must adduce or identify at least some credible evidence addressing the following

if extinguishment has occurred  it is to be disregarded  and are not  antithetical to the fundamental tenets of the common law    Worimi does not need to establish that native title exists on the balance of probabilities  It is for the Court to assess the totality of the evidence to determine whether the Land Council has established  on the balance of probabilities  that native title does not exist  Worimi has identified a number of different groups  at various stages of these proceedings  that he says hold native title in the Land  including himself and his immediate family  and all Worimi people  He must also provide evidence that addresses  at the least  the Land Council s evidence that there is no native title within the principles set down in Yorta Yorta   that there is no normative body of laws and customs in connection with the Land  the observance of which has been substantially maintained from the time of sovereignty to the present day  Worimi does not need to prove each element of native title  He is not obliged to establish native title as if it were a positive defence being asserted  He does  however  need to address native title under the Act by reference to those material matters  He must address the necessary elements sufficiently to cast doubt on the Land Council s assertion of no native title  He needs to show that there have existed traditional laws and customs in relation to the Land  the continued observance of those laws and customs and the maintenance of a connection with the Land  If he does not lead evidence as to each of those matters  elements of native title  he will need to adduce evidence  sufficient in scope and weight  as to one or more of those elements to cast doubt on the proposition that native title does not exist   Worimi contends that the evidence required to discharge the Land Council s onus of proof   may not be achieved without strict proof of historical and anthropological facts through use of widely accepted authoritative writings and expert evidence   and   involves consideration of the historical  archaeological  linguistic and anthropological evidence in the light of the direct testimony of Aboriginal witnesses    Worimi says that  in determining the question of the existence or non existence of native title on the balance of probabilities  regard should be had to the ability of the parties to adduce evidence  By this  he seems to be saying that the Court should give more weight to his evidence and discount the evidence of the Land Council  If he is  I do not accept it   Based on the presumption that native title exists over the Land  Worimi contends that    It is common ground that Lot   falls within traditional Worimi country      The Land Council must prove that any connection which Aboriginal people may have had with the Land under traditional laws and customs has not been maintained     In order to succeed  the Land Council must establish that traditional law and custom has ceased to be observed anywhere in  Worimi country      It is incumbent upon the Land Council to adduce evidence from Worimi people positively to assert that no laws and customs have been passed down to them by their forebears and  additionally  there needs to be expert evidence that there were a set of normative rules traditionally adopted and followed and observed by the Worimi people     Following Yorta Yorta   the Land Council must prove that pre existing laws and customs have been substantially interrupted from what they were at sovereignty or no longer exist at all     There must be evidence of the cessation of the acknowledgement of laws and observance of customs sufficient to show that those laws and customs have been abandoned by the whole of Worimi society   Worimi submits that the evidence supports the inference that there was a group of Worimi people and a society of Aboriginal people who inhabited the area around Port Stephens at the time of sovereignty  For the purposes of this application  I accept that to be the case   Worimi submits that  once this is accepted  it follows that this group had some form of normative rules which regulated their society and that  once this is accepted  it follows   as a matter of logic and reason   that  bearing in mind the burden of proof  the Land Council is required to lead sufficient evidence   i  of the nature and existence of pre sovereign native title rights and interests  and   ii  to the effect that these pre sovereign rights and interests are no longer observed before the Court may infer the non existence of native title over Lot     In Mason v Tritton     NSWLR   Kirby P pointed to the difficulty for Aboriginal people to provide recorded details of  for example  genealogy  At     his Honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from   to a later time  in that case to the  s  Referring to the analysis in

from proved use of land in the  s back to the time before    As he noted  it is more easily drawn in more traditional Aboriginal communities  However  in Mason   there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved  Further  it is hard to see from Yorta Yorta how a presumption of native title can be said to apply   The Land Council seeks a determination of the absence of native title  That means native title under the Act  In Yorta Yorta   the High Court emphasised that native title under the Act must be understood in accordance with the definition in s   of the Act  That section provides        The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal  group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters  where             a  the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged  and the traditional customs observed  by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders  and              b  the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders  by those laws and customs  have a connection with the land or waters  and      c  the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia   In Yorta Yorta at   Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ raised the importance of identifying whether the body of traditional law and custom that intersects with the common law for the purposes of s   of the Act is that as existing at the time of sovereignty or that existing today but connected with a body of law and custom that existed at sovereignty  Their Honours reiterated what had been said in Fejo v Northern Territory   HCA         CLR    Native title  with its origin in the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous people who possess the native title is recognised by the common law  Their Honours went on to state that    An application for determination of native title requires the location of that intersection  between native title and the common law  and it requires that it be located by reference to  the Act   In particular it must be located by reference to the definition of native title in s      A determination of the existence of native title is a creature of the Act   Yorta Yorta at    So too is a determination of the absence of native title   A number of principles relevant to the present case were set out in Yorta Yorta      Laws or customs in which native title rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having a normative content and deriving  therefore  from a body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty  at       Observable patterns of behaviour may not amount to rights or interests in relation to land or waters under the Act  at       Upon the Crown acquiring sovereignty  the normative or law making system which then existed could not thereafter validly create new rights  duties or interests  Rights or interests in land created after sovereignty and which owed their origin and continued existence only to a normative system other than that of the new sovereign power are not given effect  at   and       This does not prevent the transmission of rights and interests under traditional laws and traditional customs which existed at sovereignty  Nor does it prevent any alteration to  or development of  that traditional law and custom after sovereignty  Account may at least be taken of developments of a kind contemplated by that traditional law and custom  at        Traditional  law or custom is apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom  In the context of the Act  the term  traditional  conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions  However  in the context of the Act   traditional  laws and customs equate to the normative rules that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown  at    It follows that the mere use of the word  traditional  does not establish the normative rules necessary for the establishment of native title under the Act     The normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed  namely the traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed  must have had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty  If that normative system has not existed throughout that period  the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist  Importantly  any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which right and interest must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title  at       If the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs  the laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality  at     The Land Council relies not only upon the absence of any claimant application over the Land but also on the evidence from Aboriginal people associated with the area who have confirmed that  in their view  the native title rights and interests that Worimi asserts do not exist  The Land Council has established that no Aboriginal person other than Worimi  and some of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications  asserts that native title exists in relation to Lot    All of the Aboriginal witnesses called by the Land Council identified as Worimi people  All are aware of the assertions made by Worimi concerning the existence of native title in the Land and gave evidence generally rejecting those assertions  Some of those witnesses were parties to claimant applications for a determination of the existence of native title in respect of land in the Port Stephens area but none of the witnesses have filed native title claimant applications in relation to the Land or land in the immediate vicinity of Lot     Worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary  In an area where non Aboriginal communities developed  many Aboriginal families lived at Karuah  which is also part of Worimi land  In deciding whether claimants  by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed  have a present connection with land  some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed   Gale at   citing Yorta Yorta and De Rose     As in Yorta Yorta   if there had been a women s site on or near the Land and Kingsley Beach  much has changed since it was used   This baptism of Worimi s grandson by his daughter Beryl and wife Cynthia represents an attempt by Worimi to restore what he says his grandmother told him  as amended by his wife s practices  It does not represent continuity  Worimi has claimed that the site is sacred to all Worimi women  No woman has supported this claim  apart from some members of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications   In Gale  Madgwick J was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew  One of the respondents  Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council  sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land  Expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council had responded  His Honour considered Yorta Yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles  including     N  ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over Australia  Yorta Yorta at        The rights and interests must be presently  possessed  under traditional laws and customs  This requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed     be a system that has had a  continuous existence and vitality  since sovereignty  Yorta Yorta at        Some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim      The statutory questions  in s   are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests  not their exercise  and to the existence of a relevant  present connection  It follows that the non exercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests     will not inevitably be fatal      The requirement in s  b  for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs  that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty  It is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the Crown s radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title      It is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially  and not entirely  uninterrupted      Nonetheless  it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the pre sovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise  This entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs      Acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty  It is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them  notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society   The positive assertion of native title rights and interests requires more than vague assertions of membership of a group of people and of  custodianship  of land  Worimi s facts and contentions comprehensively fail to establish the elements of native title required by s   of the Act  They do not establish native title within the meaning of Yorta Yorta   They do not identify the alleged content of the normative body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the pre sovereignty society nor how those laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted  While Worimi is not required positively to establish native title in order to resist the Land Council s application  he must present evidence which is sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements that the evidence does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist   As the High Court said in Yorta Yorta   the relevant laws and customs must be rules having normative content  Without that quality  there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or interests in relation to land or waters  Rights or interests created after sovereignty are insufficient  although there may be changes in the traditional laws and customs  at least to the extent that such changes and developments were contemplated by traditional laws and customs   As was said in Yorta Yorta at   and repeated in Bodney at   if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty  the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist  The law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society  a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs   Yorta Yorta at   Bodney at      Unless a society has  and acknowledges and observes  laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed  there can be no native title rights whether communal  group or individual     Bodney at    It is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today   Bodney at    This must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted   Bodney at       It follows from Yorta Yorta at     that native title  if it existed pre sovereignty  ceases to exist for the purposes of the Act if the society  being the Worimi people  the Maiaangal clan or the Garuahgal clan  ceased to acknowledge and observe the laws and customs that Worimi describes  The rights and interests to which those laws and customs give rise are not possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed  They ceased to exist and the later adoption of the laws and customs does not give rise to rights and interests rooted in pre sovereignty traditional law and custom   The changes in Worimi s description of the persons who  he says  observe or observed the traditional laws and customs in respect of the Land have not assisted in the analysis of the evidence  As set out in Worimi   and Worimi     he has changed the identification of the persons said to be relevant  As to the identification of family members in the claim group  Worimi has included  variously apart from himself  his wife and children  all his sisters and their daughters and his mother  He was not consistent in his evidence  asserting that he was bringing the claim on behalf of the Garuahgal women  his family and all Worimi people  Irrespective of the group said to hold native title over the Land  the requirements of s   of the Act are not satisfied  While Worimi was not required to establish native title in accordance with s   of the Act in order to resist the Land Council s application  given the time available to Worimi since these proceedings were commenced  he has had ample opportunity to formulate his contentions with reference to s   of the Act in order to cast sufficient doubt on the Land Council s case   The evidence is that the observance of the traditional laws and customs ceased so far as a women s site on the Land is concerned  The evidence is not of adaptation of traditional laws and customs but of substantial interruption  amounting to cessation  of observance citedMunn for and on behalf of the Gunggari People v State of Queensland   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Land Council says that the standard of proof does not change or become more onerous than the civil standard because these proceedings concern native title  It acknowledges that  in considering whether that standard has been satisfied  the Court will have regard to the objects and purposes of the Act   Munn for and on behalf of the Gunggari People v State of Queensland   FCA         FCR   at     and acknowledges that it is required to prove the negative proposition  that there is no native title over Lot    The Land Council does contend  however  that once it adduces evidence which  if accepted  establishes the negative proposition  the evidential onus to adduce evidence to show that the negative proposition is incorrect shifts to Worimi  The Land Council does not accept that it is required to establish the negative proposition by establishing the absence of each of the elements necessary to prove the existence of native title   The Land Council and Worimi appear to agree that the evidential burden shifts to Worimi if the Land Council establishes sufficient evidence from which the negative proposition of no native title may be inferred  The real difference between the parties relates to their submissions regarding what evidence is sufficient to establish the negative proposition citedNorthern Territory of Australia v

given by the other witnesses does not derogate from his evidence  It could well be the case that there were different ways of observing traditions  As was pointed out in Western Australia v Sebastian     ALR   at   a   body of laws and customs   does not require identical practice  nor that each member of a group has precisely the same knowledge or comprehends the laws and customs in precisely the same way   Worimi submits that native title rights and interests may be possessed by individuals or by a group of individuals in circumstances where other members of the same community or society do not possess those or other native title rights and interests in relation to that area  citing De Rose  No   at     and   Sebastian    Whether Worimi can establish native title where other members of
