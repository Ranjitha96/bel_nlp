and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   December   I delivered judgment in relation to the claims brought by the ACCC against the CEPU  except for the claims relating to penalty and costs  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd   FCA    Amongst other relief  I said that I would grant the following declarations in relation to the CEPU s accessorial conduct         Prior to August   the First Respondent was accustomed to acquire goods or services from certain Contractors  and in those circumstances  in August   the Second Respondent     a  aided  abetted  counselled  procured and induced the First Respondent to make  and    b  was knowingly concerned in and party to the First Respondent making    a contract  arrangement or understanding with the Second Respondent which contained a provision that     c  the First Respondent would not engage a Contractor to perform work at the Loy Yang B power station in Victoria unless that Contractor had a current certified agreement with the Second Respondent  and    d  was included in the contract  arrangement or understanding for the purpose of preventing or hindering the First Respondent from acquiring goods or services from Contractors who did not have a current certified agreement with the Second Respondent    with the consequence that the First Respondent thereby contravened s  E  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth          Prior to August   the First Respondent was accustomed to acquire goods or services from certain Contractors  and in those circumstances  in August   the Second Respondent counselled  procured and induced the First Respondent to give effect to the provision of the contract  arrangement or understanding with the Second Respondent referred to in paragraph   of these declarations  with the consequence that the First Respondent thereby contravened s  EA of the Trade Practices Act     I also held that the ACCC was entitled to injunctive relief against the CEPU   For convenience  I will adopt the terms defined in my principal judgment for the purposes of these reasons for judgment   The ACCC sought orders that a pecuniary penalty be imposed on the CEPU pursuant to s   of the TPA and that the CEPU pay the ACCC s costs of the proceedings against the CEPU on an indemnity basis  The CEPU disputes that it should pay the ACCC s costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis  At the request of the parties  I heard submissions on penalty on   December   and deferred the question of costs  I was informed by the parties that this course was necessary because both parties had made Calderbank offers during the course of the proceedings and that it was not possible to address the question of indemnity costs until the Court has determined what penalty should be imposed on the CEPU  These reasons for judgment are therefore confined to the question of penalty followedTrade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR     There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles which govern the imposition of a penalty under

identified six additional factors     i  the size of the contravening company   ii  the degree of its power  evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market   iii  the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended   iv  whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level   v  whether the company had a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the TPA  as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention  and   vi  whether the company has shown a disposition to cooperate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the TPA in relation to the contravention   These factors were approved by Burchett and Kiefel JJ  with whom Carr J agreed  in NW Frozen Foods at     Deterrence is the principal object of the penalties regime  In CSR at   French J said that the principal  and he thought probably the only  object of the penalties imposed by s   is to attempt to put a price on contravention that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the TPA  His Honour also observed that it is conducive to deterrence to adopt an approach under which the greater the scope and impact of the conduct  the heavier the penalty should be  at     In NW Frozen Foods at     Burchett and Kiefel JJ said that the deterrent effect of a penalty  both specific and general  is an important factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty in a particular case  although it must also be borne in mind that the penalty should not be so great as to be oppressive   The ACCC said that the existence of a trade practices compliance program was  possibly relevant  to the determination of penalty  I do not see any need for the qualification added by the ACCC  In my opinion  the introduction of a compliance program in   and its continuing operation  is a relevant factor in determining penalty  see CSR per French J at   and NW Frozen Foods at     per Burchett and Kiefel JJ  In Rural Press at     Mansfield J said       The fact that

Lee and Goldberg JJ  reviewed the authorities  including Stihl   Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd     FCR   at   and Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR        TNT    at   in which the courts attached importance to the deliberateness of the contravening conduct  The Full Court concluded that in fixing penalties under s   it is appropriate and relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the TPA was systematic  deliberate or covert  at     and at      In doing so  the Court does not stray into irrelevant moral considerations   The decision of Mansfield J in Rural Press illustrates the proposition that s   and the totality principle can produce similar results  His Honour said at        The ACCC is correct in stressing that  as I have found  the conduct of the respondents involved two contraventions of s   of the Act  namely the making of an arrangement and separately carrying it into effect  In a practical sense  I consider that the conduct that constituted the first of those contraventions was  part and parcel  of the conduct that constituted the second of those contraventions  see for example J McPhee   Son  Australia  Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   ATPR  P        ALR      McPhee    per Black CJ  Lee and Goldberg JJ at ATPR   FCR      However  although the conduct constituting the contraventions of s   was also closely allied to that conduct  in my view the contraventions of s   are separate and could be dealt with separately  For the reasons proposed by the ACCC  and accepted by the respondents  I will however impose one penalty upon each respondent for the contraventions of the Act by that particular respondent  or in which that particular respondent was involved  In this matter  the level of pecuniary penalty which I impose would not alter whether the s   and s   contraventions had to be treated as part and parcel of the one set of conduct by reason of s   or were capable of being treated as separate contraventions   In McPhee at       the Full Court considered the imposition of penalties for making and giving effect to an arrangement or understanding in contravention of s    The Court concluded that s   applied because the conduct which constituted the second contravention of giving effect to the arrangement was part and parcel of the conduct which constituted the first contravention of making the arrangement       The case presented to his Honour did not distinguish the conduct of McPhee involving the formation of the proscribed arrangement or understanding from the conduct of McPhee said to constitute giving effect to such arrangement or understanding  According to the Commission s case  the delivery by Mr Webb to Mr Jolly of McPhee s rates was an integral part of the conduct that constituted the contravention of s   in making  or arriving at  an understanding or arrangement  That same act was also relied upon by the Commission as the act which constituted the further contravention by McPhee of giving effect to the arrangement or understanding      If the disclosure by McPhee to DFE of the rates charged by McPhee to ACI Florapak could be said to be an act giving effect to an arrangement or understanding already made or arrived at  it was not conduct distinguishable from the conduct of McPhee which constituted the making of such an arrangement or understanding  Pursuant to s   of the Act  if conduct constitutes a contravention of two or more provisions of Pt IV   a proceeding may be instituted in respect of each contravention but a person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty in respect of the same conduct  This was not a case involving repeated conduct concerning discrete events occurring at different times and involving disparate parties  Trade Practices Commission v Simpson Pope Ltd     ALR     FLR   at   per Franki J      We therefore accept the submission that his Honour erred in imposing separate penalties in respect of the ACI Florapak conduct  The conduct which constituted the second contravention was part and parcel of the conduct which constituted the first contravention and s   prescribed that only one penalty could be imposed   Another difficulty with the ACCC s submission is that  as in McPhee   the ACCC conducted the trial without attempting to draw any distinction between the conduct on the part of the CEPU that was relevant to its involvement in Edison s contravention of s  E  and that which was relevant to Edison s contravention of s  EA  Quite the contrary  the ACCC relied on the same conduct for its contention that the CEPU was involved in both contraventions  This is confirmed by paras   and   of the ACCC s amended statement of claim  At trial  senior counsel for the ACCC expressly submitted that the ACCC relied on the same conduct by the CEPU over a relatively short period of time between   August and   August   in connection with both contraventions   The ACCC s submission fails to take into account the full ambit of my findings concerning the contract  arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU  In my principal judgment  I found that prior to   August   Edison and the CEPU made or entered into an arrangement that included a provision that Edison would not engage electrical contractors to perform work at Loy Yang B unless they have a certified agreement with the CEPU prior to commencing work at the site  at    However  I also found that the heads of agreement was entered into on   August   in accordance with  and was controlled by  this broader arrangement  at   and    Even if the heads of agreement were the only relevant arrangement between Edison and the CEPU  I concluded that cl     of the heads of agreement constituted a provision that was included in the heads of agreement for a purpose which infringed s  E  at    When I turned to consider the CEPU s liability as an accessory to Edison s contraventions of ss  E and  EA  I pointed out that the evidence established that the CEPU made demands which instigated  induced and procured Edison to make both the broader arrangement and the heads of agreement  at    In these circumstances  the implementation steps which the CEPU took on   and   August   can be regarded as actions by which the CEPU induced  counselled or procured Edison to sign the heads of agreement  which relevantly formed part of the contravening arrangement  Put another way  there is no reason to conclude that the implementation steps which the CEPU took on   and   August   are relevant only to the contravention of s  EA and not to the contravention of s  E   In my opinion  they are relevant to both  given the findings I have made concerning the heads of agreement and the relationship between the heads of agreement and the broader arrangement that Edison and the CEPU made some days earlier   For the sake of completeness  I note that the ACCC advanced a different argument in its written submissions on penalty  but it did not pursue that argument in its oral submissions  Shortly stated  the argument was that the CEPU s conduct in relation to s  EA included its failure to prevent the continuation of Edison s new practice between August   and November    The ACCC did not advance this argument at the principal hearing and  assuming it was not abandoned during the penalty hearing  it is now too late to raise it  At all relevant times  the ACCC s case was that the CEPU was involved in Edison s contravention of s  EA because the CEPU had counselled  procured or induced Edison to give effect to the offending provision by means of the demands which the CEPU made to Edison in the period leading up to Edison s execution of the heads of agreement on   August    At the principal hearing  senior counsel for the ACCC submitted that the ACCC could not point to anything that the CEPU did after the making of the arrangement on or about   August that made it an accessory to Edison s contravention of s  EA  The ACCC did not mount a case that the CEPU policed or sought to enforce the arrangement after it was entered into in August    The ACCC did not ask any questions of Burns or Sutherland or any other witness to the effect that the CEPU had taken any steps to enforce the arrangement after it was entered into in August     If the CEPU s conduct that is relevant to Edison s contravention of s  EA can be distinguished from its conduct in relation to the s  E  contravention  with the consequence that s   does not apply  I consider that the approach described in Allied Mills   Advance Bank and in McPhee at     should be applied in the circumstances of this case  In substance  the CEPU engaged in a single course of conduct that was related and interlocking and which involved it in both contraventions  To my mind  it would be artificial to distinguish between the conduct that is relevant to the making of the arrangement and that which is relevant to Edison s giving effect to the arrangement  The CEPU s conduct in relation to the two contraventions is so interconnected that the appropriate course is to apply the totality principle to set a penalty for the CEPU s accessorial conduct in respect of one breach and to take the CEPU s involvement in the other breach into account  Adopting that approach  I have concluded that the appropriate penalty would not differ from that which I would impose on the basis that s   applies followedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd

classes of contravention under Pt IV of the TPA to which different considerations may be relevant citedTrade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws  Aust  Pty Ltd   ATPR     Much earlier in the history of the TPA  Smithers J expressed similar views in Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws  Aust  Pty Ltd   ATPR        Stihl    at      The penalty should constitute a real punishment proportionate to the deliberation with which the defendant contravened the provisions of the Act  It should be sufficiently high to have a deterrent quality  and it should be kept in mind that the Act operates in a commercial environment where deterrence of those minded to contravene its provisions is not likely to be achieved by penalties which are not realistic  It should reflect the will of Parliament that the commercial standards laid down in the Act must be observed  but not be so high as to be oppressive   In McPhee   the Full Court  comprising Black CJ  Lee and Goldberg JJ  reviewed

Depending on the circumstances of the case  other principles may also be relevant  Where the relevant conduct gives rises to several contraventions of the TPA  it will be relevant to take into account the totality principle to ensure that the total penalty does not exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct in question  see Trade Practices Commission v Advance Bank Australia Ltd   ATPR        Advance Bank    at   per Gummow J  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd  No       ALR      ABB Transmission    at         TNT at    The parity principle  ie all other things being equal  similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties  will have direct application where penalties are being imposed on several contravening respondents  The principle also draws attention  albeit less directly  to the penalties that have been imposed in past cases  There is  of course  a limit to the usefulness of any comparison with past penalties  the circumstances of particular cases are likely to differ in significant respects and each case must be considered by reference to its own circumstances  see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd   ATPR        George Weston    at     per Goldberg J   The CEPU also advanced a number of alternative submissions  First  it submitted that its conduct should be viewed as a single course of conduct  attracting one penalty only  even if it were possible to draw some distinction between the conduct that was relevant to s  E and that which was relevant to s  EA  In support of this submission  the CEPU relied upon Advance Bank at   per Gummow J  ABB Transmission at       and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd   ATPR        Rural Press    at        Further or alternatively  the CEPU submitted that if this approach could not be adopted  its conduct in relation to the two contraventions was so interconnected that  by the application of the totality principle  the Court ought to arrive at a penalty of the same magnitude as if it were dealing with a single contravention  see Rural Press at     and TNT at     In Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd  No       ALR      Allied Mills    at   Sheppard J was required to assess penalties in relation to price fixing contraventions of s   of the TPA  His Honour said that where more than one breach of s   is alleged and admitted  it would not be appropriate to impose substantive penalties for each breach because each arises out of the one transaction  namely  the arrangement or understanding alleged in the amended statement of claim  In taking this course  Sheppard J followed the approach adopted by Kitto J in imposing penalties for breaches of the Customs Act    Cth  in L Vogel   Son Pty Ltd v Anderson  Minister for Customs    HCA         CLR   at      Sheppard J s approach was followed in TNT at    These cases involved applications of the totality principle rather than s     The Full Court added at     that  if s   did not apply  the totality principle should have been applied because of the interlocking nature of the conduct involved in the two contraventions       If it could be said that the conduct relevant to the two contraventions was not the same conduct for the purpose of s     we would be of the opinion that his Honour s discretion in calculating the appropriate penalty to be imposed miscarried  in that his Honour failed to have regard to the interlocking nature of the conduct involved in the

contrition for its involvement in Edison s contraventions of ss  E  and  EA  As a result  the ACCC submitted that the Court could have no confidence that the CEPU and its senior officers  including Mighell  regret what happened or that they have resolved to ensure that contravening conduct of the kind in question in this case will not happen again  An explicit statement of contrition will ordinarily be associated with an admission of liability  see eg  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard   FCA         FCR   at       Where a respondent contests allegations that it contravened a provision of Pt IV of the TPA  and wishes to preserve its right of appeal  it is hardly to be expected that the respondent will express unreserved contrition at the penalty hearing  Moreover  there may be reasons unknown to the court why a respondent has not been prepared to admit liability prior to the hearing  In general  I consider that an appropriate expression of contrition may warrant a discount on penalty  but the absence of an expression of that kind ought not to elevate the penalty beyond what would otherwise be appropriate  In this context  the inquiry that must be pursued is what level of penalty is required to achieve the objective of specific deterrence  having regard to the factors to which the CEPU points  including its record of non contravention since October   and its ongoing compliance program  and the other circumstances of the case  I have concluded that the absence of an expression of contrition by the CEPU for its contraventions should not elevate the penalty to be imposed on the CEPU beyond what would otherwise be appropriate   The CEPU referred the Court to three cases in which penalties were imposed on unions under the TPA  It contended that these cases supported its submission that the appropriate penalty was in the order of   and that the penalty proposed by the ACCC was excessive   In the PKIU case  the Court held that three unions  including the CEPU  contravened s  D of the TPA by forming and maintaining a picket line over the period from   October   to   October   which prevented the construction of a gas plant  Each of the unions agreed to a penalty of   in circumstances where there was no order for costs against them  The picket line was established in defiance of orders made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission  the Commission  and caused significant losses to the owner of the plant  In his reasons for judgment  Gray J noted that the respondents had reached agreement to pay compensation to the plant owner for its losses  that the respondents were entitled to credit for their co operation with the Commission and for the saving of public money in relation to the litigation  and that it was not suggested that any of the respondents had a record of similar contraventions  at      On the other side of the ledger  Gray J noted several factors that would tend to increase the size of the penalty  the picket continued to be operated despite the orders of the Commission  the delay in the construction of the plant was thus extended  and the unions had not instituted any program or training designed to ensure compliance with the TPA  at      His Honour concluded that the penalties ought to be at the very highest end of the range appropriate for conduct of the kind in question  and on that basis he made orders which imposed penalties at the agreed level of    In the absence of agreement as to that level of penalty  Gray J said that he would have fixed a figure considerably lower than    In expressing this view  Gray J took particular note of the fact that the unions were not profit making enterprises and did not engage in the conduct in question for their own gain  His Honour also noted that the agreed penalties represented a large sum for the unions to pay from their own resources which would ultimately have to come from the pockets of wage earners

federal ct  html  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA     two unions were involved in conduct on two separate occasions  in April   and again in November   in contravention of s  D of the TPA  The April conduct interrupted a concrete pour for several hours and it was followed by a picket which obstructed access to a construction site for a new hotel at the Burswood Casino in Perth  The interruption of a concrete pour and the picket caused significant delays to the project and exposed the builder to losses  The November conduct was another picket at the site which restricted access by construction workers  Each of the unions agreed to pay a pecuniary penalty to the Commonwealth of    Nicholson J concluded that the proposed penalties were appropriate  In doing so  his Honour made particular reference to the fact that the unions had co operated with the ACCC by approaching the Court for the final disposition of the proceeding on a non contested basis  and that neither union had engaged in the conduct for financial gain  at     The facts of these cases are very different from the facts of the case before me  Each case involved an agreement as to the appropriate level of penalty  I accept that the conduct involved in each case had significant adverse commercial or financial consequences  more so than in the case before me  although I note that in the PKIU case the unions agreed to pay compensation to the affected company  In the end  while these three cases provide general guidance  I have derived limited assistance from them because each case turned on its particular facts   Weighing up all of the factors to which I have referred  I consider that the penalty of   proposed by the CEPU does not properly reflect the nature and seriousness of the contravening conduct  It is  moreover  inadequate from the viewpoint of both specific and general deterrence  On the other hand  I consider that the penalty proposed by the ACCC is disproportionate to the size and financial resources of the CEPU and the nature  seriousness  duration and impact of the contravening conduct
