content of s     Sub section   is concerned with whether  the material  raises a reasonable hypothesis that the relevant injury  disease or death was connected with the service of the veteran  It is not concerned with conflicts in the material  whether they be of opinion or fact  The purpose of sub s    as demonstrated by its terms and its history  is to ensure that a claim to which s    applies is not met unless there is some material which raises the relevant causal hypothesis  At   their Honours said    The material will raise a reasonable hypothesis within the meaning of s    if the material points to some fact or facts  the raised facts  which support the hypothesis and if the hypothesis can be regarded as reasonable if the raised facts are true  At   their Honours said    If the material does raise a reasonable hypothesis of a connexion between the service and the injury  disease or death  the claim must be dealt with in accordance with s     That is to say  the commission must determine that the injury  disease or death was war caused  unless it is satisfied  beyond reasonable doubt  that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination  Section   and   are affected by s  A  Section  A applies in respect of claims made under the VE Act on or after   June    Section  A and ss  A to  ZP were introduced in order to establish a more certain basis for the finding of a medical hypothesis and to ensure that   medical opinions supported by little or no medical scientific evidence do not prevail over the carefully developed mass of medical scientific opinion    see Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans  Affairs     Budget Measures  Legislation Amendment Bill      Such changes allow for the creation of a Statement of Principles  SoP  to be determined by the Repatriation Medical Authority  the Authority  which establish the relevant relationship between service and the death claimed by applicants for pensions  Section  A  of the VE Act relevantly provides that a hypothesis connecting  inter alia  the death of the person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is a SoP that upholds the hypothesis  Section  B  authorises the Authority to formulate SoPs for the purpose of the VE Act  Section  B  relevantly provides      If the Authority is of the view that there is sound medical scientific evidence that indicates that a particular kind of    death can be related to     a  operational service rendered by veterans  or        the Authority must determine a Statement of Principles in respect of that kind of    death setting out       d  the factors that must as a minimum exist  and    e  which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person   before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting  a     death of that kind with the circumstances of that service  Believing that there was no applicable SoP  the Tribunal then considered whether there was a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran s death with his service  at     As there is no SoP  we therefore proceed according to the principles outlined in Bushell and Byrne   Section     of the Act provides  inter alia  that  for there to be no sufficient ground for determining Dr Walker s death was war caused  the material before us must not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the service rendered by Dr Walker    The Tribunal concluded that a hypothesis was established  That hypothesis was that the veteran developed a heavy smoking habit during and in consequence of his service which caused IHD and that IHD was one cause of his death  The Tribunal found that such hypothesis was reasonable and that it was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that any element of the hypothesis had been disproved beyond reasonable doubt  Having determined that there was no applicable SoP for heart failure or kidney failure  the Tribunal then applied ss   and   of the VE Act and had regard to the observations of the High Court in Bushell to determine whether there was a reasonable hypothesis that established the veteran s cigarette smoking habit was connected to his death  Having observed that there was evidence that the veteran s tobacco consumption had been between   and   pack years as estimated by Dr Butler  the Tribunal found that the hypothesis raised by the respondent linked the veteran s service with his death from heart failure  In such deliberation the Tribunal noted the evidence of Dr Butler that the requirements of the IHD SoP in respect of the veteran s tobacco consumption would be met  The Tribunal also observed at     Given the terms of s  B we accept that the existence of the SoP for IHD  which includes smoking as a factor  is a relevant matter in respect of this element of the hypothesis  Later in its decision the Tribunal observed  at     As we understand the evidence of Dr Butler and Professor O Rourke  they agreed that there was no evidence of damage as a result of ischaemia within the two weeks before Dr Walker s death  but previous damage could have contributed to heart failure  Further  Dr Butler said that there was   or   per cent likelihood of systolic failure on the basis of IHD  Professor O Rourke also said that there was a less than   per cent probability that IHD played a role in Dr Walker s death  That is evidence from both doctors of a likelihood of a contribution from IHD to Dr Walker s death referred toByrne v

reasonable doubt that there is no sufficient ground for making a determination that an injury was a war caused injury if it is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the veteran  By the use of that statutory direction the legislation fastens upon an opinion that no reasonable hypothesis is available and directs that it satisfy the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt  In these circumstances the claim will be rejected citedByrnes v Repatriation

fourth proposition states    The effect or construction of a term whose meaning or interpretation is established is a question of law  Life Insurance Co of Australia v Phillips     In the present

citedLees v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe Commission submits that the Tribunal was required  when characterising the  kind of death  met by the veteran  to have regard to the characterisation of such death as provided by the IHD SoP  The veteran must have met a death with which that SoP is concerned in order to link such death with his war service  see Lees v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at     The Commission submits that the Tribunal erred in its finding that the  kind of death  sustained by the veteran was heart failure and kidney failure  and that such finding conflates the medical cause of death with the actual death of the veteran  The Commission referred to paragraph   of SoP No    of   which defines   death from  IHD  to include   death from a terminal event or condition that was contributed to by the person s  IHD   As mentioned earlier  this was not the applicable SoP  however  the relevant wording is identical to the SoP that was in force    Terminal event   is defined in the IHD SoP and includes cardiac arrest  The Commission contends that the Tribunal s finding did not consider the cause of heart failure or kidney failure  Instead the Tribunal wrongly made its finding on the  kind of death  based upon the proximate cause or terminal event  The Commission also submits that given that the Tribunal found that IHD was not a  kind of death  it follows that the Tribunal must  as a consequence of that decision  have not been satisfied  on the balance of probabilities  that IHD had contributed to the veteran s death  That is  the Tribunal s hypothesis connecting the veteran s death to his service was erroneous because it was premised on IHD contributing to the veteran s death  Further  by the finding that IHD was not a cause of death of the veteran  but that glomerulonephritis was such cause  the Commission submits that the Tribunal should have concluded that the GN SoP was applicable  However  the application of the GN SoP would not have assisted the respondent because the GN SoP did not include cigarette smoking as a cause of glomerulonephritis  The respondent submits that the determination of the  kind of death  was a question of medical causation and as such comprised a factual finding which could not be the subject of an appeal pursuant to s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    the AAT Act  that the factual finding was open to the Tribunal since there was evidence that heart failure occurred  and that heart failure was a cause of the veteran s death citedRepatriation Commission v Codd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe issue determined before this Court concerns the interpretation by the Tribunal of both statutory provisions and of SoPs  The Tribunal was not referred by the Commission to the GN SoP in respect of which numerous submissions have now been made by the Commission and which were not raised before the Tribunal  The arguments of the Commission involved a degree of complexity  and the errors of the Tribunal have arisen from a misapplication of the law  The position is not dissimilar to that in Repatriation Commission v Codd   FCA   referred toRepatriation Commission v Codd   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn

one or more  SoP  were applicable  then the methodology in Deledio is applicable in relation to those  kinds of death     The application of the statutory provisions to the claim required the Tribunal to consider separate stages  The first step was to determine what the  kind of death  was  As was observed by Selway J in Hancock at   such identification is a critical step in the analysis  Next  the Tribunal was required to determine whether s  A applied  that is whether a SoP existed which addressed the question of the reasonableness of the hypothesis concerning the connection between the  kind of death  and service of the veteran  If a relevant SoP existed  the Tribunal was  pursuant to s  A of the VE Act  required to determine the claim in respect of the death in accordance with the template contained in the SoP  By satisfying the template  a reasonable hypothesis linking the veteran s service with the death would thereby be established  If no relevant SoP existed  s  A  had no application by virtue of s  A   In this event  the Tribunal was required to assess the claim having regard only to s   of the VE Act  In Codd Gordon J said at     The phrase  kind of death met by the person  in s  A  asks a causative question  It is not a question about whether the death was slow  fast or the like  It asks  questions of medical causation  about the cause of death and does so in a particular context the VE Act and  in particular  Pt VIII of the VE Act  see also explanatory memorandum to the Veterans  Affairs     Budget Measures  Legislation Amendment Bill    Cth  pp i ii referred toRepatriation Commission v Hill   FCAFC         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIt follows that where a SoP is in force concerning the  kind of death  unless the decision maker is provided with material which points to a hypothesis which satisfies a template of the relevant SoP  the claim that the death is related to operational service cannot succeed  As was explained by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Hill   FCAFC         ALD   at       The result is that  where it applies  the SoP prescribes the essential content of what is a reasonable hypothesis  for s   purposes  capable of connecting the particular kind of injury  disease or death with the circumstances of a veteran s particular service  In order to satisfy ss   and  A  a hypothesis relied on by a veteran to support a pension claim must be supported by material pointing to each element that the SoP makes essential for the hypothesis to be reasonable  Accordingly  where no relevant SoP exists  an evaluation is to be made under s   to determine whether any hypothesis is reasonable  unaffected by s  A  see s  A  referred toRepatriation Commission v McKenna     ALD  In Repatriation Commission v McKenna     ALD   at   Goldberg J described the operation of an SoP as follows    For the purposes of s  A  of the Act the hypothesis which has to be upheld by a Statement of Principles is the hypothesis which connects the disease suffered by a veteran with the circumstances of his service  So stated  the hypothesis has to point to a connection which starts with the disease in respect of which the application is made and ends with the service  That connection will comprise a number of links or factors each of which must be upheld by a Statement of Principles and  if need be  by more than one Statement of Principles  Section  A  of the VE Act provides that s  A       does not apply   if the Authority has neither determined a Statement of Principles under s B  nor declared that it does not propose to make such a Statement of Principles in respect of    the kind of death met by the person    Accordingly  the first enquiry the Tribunal should have made is whether a SoP had been made in respect of the   particular kind of   death   suffered by the veteran followedRepatriation Commission v Milenz   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe

satisfied on the civil standard of proof  that is  on the balance of probabilities  In Repatriation Commission v Smith     FCR     Beaumont J said at     Even if the Tribunal is not bound by the traditional evidentiary principles  s   constitutes a clear direction to the Tribunal that it must be reasonably satisfied before it makes any decision  In my opinion  this could only have been intended to introduce the standard of proof required in civil litigation  Given that the Tribunal found that IHD was not a  kind of death  it must be assumed that the Tribunal was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that IHD was the  kind of death  met by the veteran  However  failure to satisfy a balance of probabilities test does not lead to the conclusion that IHD cannot have had any contribution whatsoever to the veteran s death  That is  it does not follow that such conclusion has the consequence that IHD could not have contributed to the veteran s death  as the Commission has submitted  The Tribunal s finding only establishes that the contribution has not been sufficient to satisfy the high standard found in s   of the VE Act  In finding that the veteran s  kind of death  was heart failure  erroneously  as has been discussed  the Tribunal found that the possibility of IHD contributing to the veteran s death was sufficient to find that it was a cause of the veteran s  kind of death  and thus ground a reasonable hypothesis under ss   and   of the VE Act  While based on a misapplication of the VE Act regarding the  kind of death  from the Tribunal s perspective it was logical  though again  erroneous  for it to consider the IHD SoP as providing a grounding for a reasonable hypothesis  namely that cigarette smoking caused the veteran s IHD which in turn was a cause of heart failure  The Tribunal has not  subverted the standard of proof prescribed by s   of the VE Act   citedTNT Skypak International  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA

relation to a particular condition  it covers the field in relation to that condition   Accordingly  the Tribunal erred by determining that a reasonable hypothesis existed  pursuant to ss   and   of the VE Act  linking the veteran s service to his death   Standard of proof The evidence provided to the Tribunal established  at its highest  that there was a possibility that IHD was a component in the veteran s death  Dr Butler rated such possibility as a ten or twenty per cent chance and Professor O Rourke assessed such possibility as probably less than ten per cent  This possibility was found by the Tribunal to be sufficient to find that the hypothesis connecting service to the veteran s death was reasonable in assessing the claim under s   of the VE Act    In our view the material before us points relevantly to one cause of Dr Walker s death being IHD
