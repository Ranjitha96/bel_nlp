and Graziers  Life Assurance Co Ltd v Commonwealth Life  Amalgamated  Assurances Ltd   HCA         CLR   the High Court had to consider whether particular circumstances constituted an  amalgamation  of two companies  Dixon J discussed the concept of the amalgamation of two companies at      His Honour said     The union of shareholders  which amalgamation involves  is  of course  not concerned with the members of the combining corporations as persons  It is the reorganization of share capital that matters  The replacement of two separate systems of share capital by one appears to be required before a union of two companies limited by shares can justly be called an amalgamation of the companies  In the process of reorganization  classes or divisions of shares  or amount of share capital  in one or other or both of the old companies may find no representation in the one system of capital which emerges  But the substantial result must be to reduce for practical purposes two or more organizations of capital to one  and two or more incorporated companies to one  The amalgamation to which the clause in the memorandum refers is not a mere combination of businesses separately conducted  but an amalgamation of companies  There is no context to enlarge the meaning of the expression  To accomplish such an amalgamation  it seems necessary  either to consolidate the constituent elements of the old companies into a new one  or to merge in one of the old companies the constituent elements of the other  Possibly a transaction may be an amalgamation although the corporate existence of the consolidating companies  or of the merged company  may be continued for some special and definite purpose  But the continuance of two corporations under separate control  organized with their separate systems of share capital and capable of independent activities  appears to me inconsistent with an amalgamation of more than their existing enterprises   I agree with Mr Oakes that a restrictive interpretation should not be placed on either the term  reconstruction  or the term  amalgamation   I also accept his submission that the approach should be simply to inquire whether the circumstances of a particular case fall within one or the other or both of the words  without first attempting to delineate their respective boundaries of meaning discussedCrimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee   HCA         CLR   the High Court held unanimously that the word  liabilities  in s   of the Stevedoring Industry Acts  Termination  Act    Cth  which provided for a vesting in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee of liabilities of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority  operated to vest in the Committee the liability of the Authority in respect of a breach of its duty of care to safeguard wharf labourers against exposure to asbestos fibres  even though the injury was suffered after the vesting under s   took place  Gleeson CJ observed that depending on the context   liability  can include contingent or potential liability  his Honour cited Walters v Babergh District Council     LGR  Eng     QBD   The Chief Justice noted  at   that the legislation abolished the Authority which no longer had the capacity to meet any claims upon it  and said that there was no good reason to distinguish between complete and inchoate causes of action  where the Authority had committed a breach of a legal duty

expressions  reconstruction  and  amalgamation  were considered in In re South African Supply and Cold Storage Co     Ch     South African Supply    In that case  the words occurred in the memoranda of association of two companies  The questions before the Court related to the rights of preference shareholders and debenture stockholders on the winding up of the two companies  and the issue was whether  in each case  the winding up was  for the purpose of reconstruction or amalgamation    Buckley J observed that neither word had any definite legal meaning  that each was a commercial and not a legal term  and that even as a commercial term neither bore an exact definite meaning  His Lordship said that it was necessary  in each case  to determine whether  in the minds of commercial people  the transaction was comprehended by the term  reconstruction  or  amalgamation   at      I need not relate the facts  His Lordship stated  at        What does  reconstruction  mean  To my mind it means this  An undertaking of some definite kind is being carried on  and the conclusion is arrived at that it is not desirable to kill that undertaking  but that it is desirable to preserve it in some form  and to do so  not by selling it to an outsider who shall carry it on that would be a mere sale but in some altered form to continue the undertaking in such a manner as that the persons now carrying it on will substantially continue to carry it on  It involves  I think  that substantially the same business shall be carried on and substantially the same persons shall carry it on  But it does not involve that all the assets shall pass to the new company or resuscitated company  or that all the shareholders of the old company shall be shareholders in the new company or resuscitated company  Substantially the business and the persons interested must be the same          Now what is an amalgamation  An amalgamation involves  I think  a different idea  There you must have the rolling  somehow or other  of two concerns into one  You must weld two things together and arrive at an amalgam a blending of two undertakings  It does not necessarily follow that the whole of the two undertakings should pass substantially they must pass nor need all the corporators be parties  although substantially all must be parties  The difference between reconstruction and amalgamation is that in the latter is involved the blending of two concerns one with the other  but not merely the continuance of one concern  An amalgamation may take place  it seems to me  either by the transfer of undertakings A and B to a new corporation  C  or by the continuance of A and B by B upon terms that the shareholders of A shall become shareholders in B  It is not necessary that you should have a new company  You may have a continuance of one of the two companies upon the terms that the undertakings of both corporations shall substantially be merged in one corporation only   In my view  the arrangement as proposed is a reconstruction  The whole of the undertaking  property and liabilities of Stork ICM is to be transferred to and vest in Stork FSA  These circumstances fall within Buckley J s description of a  reconstruction  in South African Supply   Although the run off activity of Stork ICM can hardly be called the  carrying on  of an undertaking  that business related activity will be taken over by Stork FSA  and will continue to be  indirectly  an activity of the parent company  Stork NV  as it is at present  It will  however  be an activity distinct from the trading activity of Stork FSA  Stork FSA will receive particulars of claims made by the potential claimants  and will deal with insurers and CMS in relation to them  That is to say  Stork FSA will continue to do what Stork ICM does now  but its activity in this respect will not form part of its trading activity   To my mind  the word  amalgamation  does not so easily lend itself to the proposed arrangement  because there will be no  blending  of the two activities  even though they will both be carried on by Stork FSA   Section   of the Act has its genesis in s   of the Companies Act    UK  which did not come into force  although the provision later appeared as s   of the Companies Act    UK   The present English provision is s   of the Companies Act    UK  citedIn re Star Tea Co Ltd   WN   It is

Landau  a Bankrupt    Ch   Krasner v Dennison   Ch   discussedNokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Limited   AC   In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Limited   AC     Nokes   it was held that the provision applied only to rights and liabilities that were capable of being assigned under the general law  ASIC raised for my consideration the question whether the  no assignment without consent  provision meant that Stork ICM s right of insurance indemnity could not be transferred under s    I discuss this question later  but since Nokes applies to  liabilities  as well as to  property  it is convenient to discuss the case here   In Nokes   approval of a scheme of amalgamation was granted under s   of the Companies Act    UK  and an order was made under s   for the transfer of all the property and liabilities of the companies that were being amalgamated to a new company  The issue was whether a contract of service between an employee and a  transferor  company became  by the operation of the order  a contract of service between the employee and the  transferee  company  By majority  the House of Lords held that it did not  Section   of that Act was  relevantly  similar to s   of the Act  However  the definitions of  property  and  liabilities  in subs   of the English s   were different from the definitions of those expressions now found in subs   of the Australian s    Subsection   of the English s   provided     In this section the expression  property  includes property  rights and powers of every description  and the expression  liabilities  includes duties      Subsection   of the Australian s   was set out at   above   The facts in Nokes were that after the making of the order  Mr Nokes absented himself from work in circumstances that would have made him liable under s   of the Employers and Workmen Act    UK  if he could be regarded as employed under a contract of service with the transferee company  In holding that he could not be  the majority of the House of Lords held that s   applied only to rights and liabilities that were capable of being assigned under the general law  and that the mutual contractual obligations of employer and employee were not  A contract of service can not be bought or sold or given away  Under the general law  a new contract of service would have had to be entered into with the new employer  and s   did not overcome that position  Lord Romer dissented   In Re  L  Hotel Co Ltd   Langham Hotel Co Ltd     All ER   Uthwatt J said  at   that he saw the principle of Nokes as limiting the statutory provision to  only such property as could be transferred by an act inter partes     While s   of the Companies Act    NSW  and s   of the Companies Act    NSW  both defined  property  and  liabilities  in terms in substance indistinguishable from those of the English s   new expanded definitions of those terms were introduced into the Australian legislation in   as part of s   of the Companies Code   and they have remained unchanged since  see   above   They make it clear that  duties that are of a personal character or are incapable under the general law of being performed vicariously  are included in the notion of  liabilities  and that  rights and powers that are of a personal character and are incapable under the general law of being assigned or performed vicariously  are included in the notion of  property   The researches of counsel have not discovered the reason for the expansion of the definitions  but it may have been to overcome the holding in Nokes    The Scheme provides in cl   for Stork ICM s property and liabilities to be transferred to  and to be vested in or become the property and liabilities of  Stork FSA  without the need for any further act or deed  Clause     defines  liabilities  to mean     all liabilities however arising and whether present  unascertained  immediate  future or contingent  including any  liabilities   within the meaning in subsection   of the Corporations Act   and any Future Proceedings      The expression  Future Proceedings  is defined in cl     of the Scheme to mean     legal proceedings which have not commenced  but for which the cause of action has accrued or the events that lead to a cause of action accruing have occurred      However  it was agreed that in any order to be made  this definition should be varied in the interests of the potential claimants so as to read     legal proceedings which have not commenced  but for which the cause of action has accrued or the injury or other event that may lead to a cause of action accruing  including  without limitation  exposure to asbestos dust  has occurred  or will occur in the future   Stork ICM s liability to potential claimants is not a  duty  within s    s inclusory definition of  liabilities   However  in my opinion  it falls within the word  liabilities  in s   according to the ordinary meaning of the term in any event citedOrica Ltd v CGU Insurance Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  If a claimant should wish to sue Stork ICM  and it is contended  for example  that Zurich was the insurer at the relevant time  the claimant will be entitled to apply under s  AH  of the Act for the Court to order that ASIC reinstate the registration of Stork ICM  The Court would make such an order if it was satisfied that it was just to do so  It is true that a claimant in such a case would suffer the disadvantage of having to make such an application  but it seems to me that the likelihood of this eventuating is small  and that it would be very likely indeed that the order would be made  and probably on the basis that Stork FSA or Stork NV or  perhaps after its reinstatement  Stork ICM  pay the potential claimants  costs of the application since its purpose would be to allow the dispute as to the identity of Stork ICM s insurer at the relevant time to be resolved   I agree  incidentally  with senior counsel for ASIC  that s  AG would be of doubtful utility  because that section would operate only in a case where the facts showed that Stork ICM had a liability to the claimant immediately before the deregistration  see Orica Ltd v CGU Insurance Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR     Subject to an amendment in the definition of  Future Proceedings  in the Scheme  the Scheme should be
