Limited   FCA   citedKowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn late   and early   I was also dealing with another proceeding involving the applicant  That proceeding involved an appeal by the applicant under s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   AAT Act  against a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  On   December   the applicant made an application that I disqualify myself from further involvement in that proceeding  I refused the application  Kowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA    The grounds of the application and the reasons I refused it are set out in my reasons  I proceeded to hear his appeal on the substantive proceeding  On   January   Mansfield J refused the applicant s application for leave to appeal from my decision  Kowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA    The applicant claims that when  on   December   I dismissed his first application in this proceeding that I disqualify myself for bias  I made an order for costs against him  even though  the respondent did not seek an order for costs against  him  and by making the order I was assisting a wrongdoer and a party who had committed a criminal offence  The applicant claims that that conduct is indicative of bias  That contention is untenable  I refer to my reasons in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA   at       which deals with the same contention made in that case  The applicant s application by notice of motion dated   August   is dismissed  In the second notice of motion brought by the applicant after I had reserved my decision on the two notices of motion referred to in     above  that being a notice of motion dated   July   the applicant seeks various declarations in the proceeding  The declarations he seeks in the notice of motion are as follows  relevantly  On   October   the respondent agreed to pay the defendant and his wife compensation  in the sum of     for the defendant s December   eye injury  May   middle finger injury  May   back and or left leg injury  August   stress or mental breakdown and December   heart attack   On   October   the defendant entered into Heads of Agreement with the defendant and his wife without the consent of the WorkCover Corporation of South Australia   On   October   the defendant did not make a capital payment to the plaintiff or his wife which had redeemed the defendant s statutory liability to the plaintiff  to make weekly payments of compensation to the plaintiff  compensation under section   of the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    SA   the Act  or a capital payment for the loss of the plaintiff s future earning capacity   On   October   the plaintiff did not receive competent professional advice about the consequences of the plaintiff and his wife entering into the Heads of Agreement with the defendant   On   October   the plaintiff did not receive competent financial advice about the investment or use of the money that he and his wife was going to receive from the defendant as a consequences  sic  of entering into the Heads of Agreement   On   October   before the defendant entered into the Heads of Agreement with the plaintiff and his wife  the defendant did not consult with the WorkCover Corporation about the terms of the Heads of Agreement   On   October   the defendant did not ensure that a recognized medical expert certified that the extent of the plaintiff s incapacity  resulting from his December   eye injury  May   middle finger injury  May   back and or left leg injury  August   stress or mental breakdown and December   heart attack  could be determined with a reasonable degree of confidence  citedKowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

I refused the application  Kowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA    The grounds of the application and the reasons I refused it are set out in my reasons  I proceeded to hear his appeal on the substantive proceeding  On   January   Mansfield J refused the applicant s application for leave to appeal from my decision  Kowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA   citedKowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOn his present motion  the applicant claims that the fact that I proceeded to hear his appeal in the proceeding involving the Repatriation Commission before his application for leave to appeal was determined was proof of bias  That contention is untenable  Having determined that there were no grounds upon which I should disqualify myself  it was appropriate that I proceed to hear and determine the appeal in the substantive proceeding  I have since delivered judgment in that proceeding in which I dismissed the applicant s appeal  Kowalski v Repatriation Commission   FCA    The applicant claims that that is a further ground upon which I should disqualify myself in this proceeding because in dismissing his appeal in the proceeding involving the Repatriation Commission I have  fabricated  my  decision   That contention is also untenable  The two proceedings are quite separate and the issue in the proceeding involving the Repatriation Commission was whether there was a question of law  and error of law  within s   of the AAT Act  The applicant further asserts that I should disqualify myself because I said in my decision on the appeal in that proceeding that I would hear the parties on the question of costs and yet  he claims  I did not hear him  The applicant s submission is untenable  The applicant was given notice of the date and time at which judgment would be handed down  On that date  I announced that I would dismiss the appeal and hear the parties on the question of costs  The applicant was not in attendance  The respondent applied for what was the usual order for costs and I decided that it was appropriate to make such an order citedMitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd v Kowalski   SASC  http www austlii edu au au cases sa SASC  htmlThe reasons of Bleby J for making those orders are set out in Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd v Kowalski   SASC    With that background  I turn to the allegations in the amended statement of claim  I bear in mind that the applicant appeared before me in person and it appears that he prepared the amended application and the amended statement of claim  The first substantive allegation made by the applicant in the amended statement of claim is that under clause     of the Heads of Agreement  the respondent was required  to prepare and execute all documents necessary to bring into effect this agreement and to make such personal attendances as necessary at any Tribunal  Court or Commission   It is alleged that the respondent  deliberately and consciously  failed  and the failure continues  to prepare and execute a notice of settlement under s   of the Health and Other Services  Compensation  Act    Cth   Health and Other Services Act  and a  South Australian Workers Compensation Tribunal Form   Standard Minutes of Order   As to the latter document  the applicant claims  as I understand it  that the respondent was required by the Workers Compensation Tribunal Rules   to lodge such a document  The amended statement of claim then contains quotes from the reasons for judgment of Bleby J  previously referred to  and a letter from Medicare Australia to the applicant dated   August    The quote from the letter dated   August   omits certain small passages and I include those passages in the quote set out below    The reasons of Bleby J       The plaintiff claims that it did not accept  at the time of the mediation  that it had any outstanding liability to the defendant in relation to work related injuries except as follows         damages payable in respect of the eye injury          for non economic loss resulting from a   loss of function of the right middle finger             for medical expenses  Mr Wicks         for medical expenses  Dr Hughes       WCT costs order   December     and       WCAT allocatur for costs   August                        Importantly  the plaintiff denied it had any liability pursuant to the Compensation Act to pay the defendant weekly income maintenance and thus never sought to redeem any such liability via the mediated settlement or indeed at all                      The mediation occurred on   October   and was presided over by an experienced and well respected Queen s Counsel  Ms Layton QC and Mr R B nig represented Mitsubishi at the mediation         The letter from Medicare Australia to the applicant dated   August        At the request of Senator Annette Hurley  Senator for South Australia  Medicare Australia has investigated your claims related to monies you received from Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited in November            Based on the information I have available to me  I can now confirm that the monies you received in November   relating to an ill health benefit and an ex gratia payment for permanent disability  are compensation for the purposes of the Health and Other Services  Compensation  Act             Further  I can confirm that Mitsubishi Motors has provided Medicare Australia with the required information relating to this claim          I will now investigate what further action needs to be taken to recover any monies owed to the Commonwealth relating to your payment  It is then alleged by the applicant that  in a way which is not specified  it should be concluded from the previous pleas that the respondent has contravened ss  AC and   of the Trade Practices Act   s   of the Fair Trading Act and ss       and   of the Misrepresentation Act and has acted in bad faith  fraudulently  in breach of trust and has been guilty of misrepresentation and undue influence  The applicant then alleges that the respondent has committed a criminal offence under the Health and Other Services Act  The thrust of the applicant s allegations under this head seems to be that the Heads of Agreement provided for the payments to be made by the respondent with a denial of liability and  in clause     for an ex gratia payment as compensation for permanent disability impairing the applicant s future earning capacity  As Bleby J s reasons make clear  the respondent s position was that it was not liable to pay compensation to the applicant under the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    SA   Workers Compensation Act  other than some relatively small amounts with respect to an eye injury and a loss of function to the right middle finger  The respondent s position as to the nature of the payments it was making under the Heads of Agreement was to be contrasted with the conclusion reached by Medicare Australia that the payments under the Heads of Agreement were compensation under the Health and Other Services Act  Leaving aside questions of whether the respondent engaged in conduct in  trade or commerce  of whether  for the purposes of s  AC of the Trade Practices Act   the conduct was engaged in in connection with the supply or acquisition of goods or services  of whether it is an essential element of any claim by the applicant that an order be made setting aside the Heads of Agreement including an order that the applicant repay the moneys paid thereunder  and of whether the relief claimed is the proper relief and can be granted by this Court  nothing has been put by the applicant in all the material he has put before the Court to suggest the circumstances I have identified could arguably give rise to a characterisation of conduct of the respondent as unconscionable within s  AC of the Trade Practices Act or misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive within s    The respondent had a belief concerning its liability under the Workers Compensation Act  Even if the decision of Medicare Australia that payments made under the Heads of Agreement were compensation for the purposes of the Health and Other Services Act means that the respondent s belief was wrong a proposition which is by no means clear that does not of itself establish that the respondent s conduct was unconscionable or misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive  The appropriate relief The amended statement of claim does not identify an arguable cause of action which is within the jurisdiction of this Court  As pleaded  the references to s  AC and s   of the Trade Practices Act represent no more than a colourable attempt to engage federal jurisdiction  The difficulty in giving judgment on any of the claims under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  is in discerning precisely what claims are being made  It is very difficult to discern where one  claim  ends and another begins appliedWalton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn my opinion  the appropriate order is an order dismissing the proceeding  There are two possible routes to that conclusion  First  under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules a proceeding may be dismissed if it is an abuse of the process of the Court  A proceeding is an abuse of process where it is foredoomed to fail  Walton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane J and Dawson J  As presently pleaded  the proceeding is doomed to fail  Not only is the proceeding doomed to fail as presently pleaded  but I am satisfied that there is no claim of the type advanced  The applicant has already amended once and he has put forward a number of affidavits and written submissions in respect of his  claims  all of which I have read carefully  There is no suggestion that he has a claim either at all or at least a claim which would engage the jurisdiction of this Court  The other route to the same conclusion is that I have no doubt that the amended statement of claim does not identify an arguable cause of action and is embarrassing under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   It must be struck out  A party faced with such conclusions is often given the opportunity to replead his or her case  However  that opportunity is not always given and ultimately  whether it is given  depends on the circumstances of the case  It is not appropriate to afford such an opportunity in this case  The applicant has had ample opportunity to articulate a case and  in all the material he has put forward  there is nothing to suggest that he has a claim  Conclusion In the circumstances  the amended statement of claim should be struck out and the proceeding dismissed
