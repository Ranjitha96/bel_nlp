of the well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  see Abebe v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   per Gummow and Hayne JJ referred toAl Mehdawi v Secretary of State for the Home Department     AC   In Al Mehdawi v Secretary of State for the Home Department     AC     Al Mehdawi   the House of Lords held that a litigant who had been deprived of the opportunity of having his case heard because of the default of his own advisers had no ground of complaint in law  or that he had been a victim of procedural impropriety  or that natural justice had been denied  Their Lordships also held that the principle applied equally to a case where the issue was one of public law and where the decision was of an administrative character   Dowsett J went on to refer to the observation of Gleeson CJ in Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy   HCA         CLR     Hot Holdings   at   that procedural unfairness can occur without any personal fault on the part of the decision maker  Dowsett J stated at   that the Chief Justice s observations in Hot Holdings and the apparent approval by a Full Court in Barrett v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     ALD     Barrett   at   of an extract from the Court of Appeal decision in Al Mehdawi may suggest that the decision of the House of Lords should be treated with caution  Nevertheless  Dowsett J noted that the decision of the House of Lords is consistent with general principles and good policy discussedApplicant NAHF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Full Court in SCAR gave as an example of the circumstances in which it had been held that the obligations imposed by s   have been breached as those where an invitation was given but the applicant was unable to attend because of ill health  citing Applicant NAHF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR     NAHF      In NAHF at   to   Hely J considered the authorities on the current form of   s    The effect of the authorities he referred to is that the requirements of the section are essentially formal   However  Hely J went on to say at   that the invitation must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture  His Honour said at   that to invite the applicant to a hearing which she was unable to attend because of ill health would have been an empty gesture and a denial of procedural fairness  His Honour found at   that  in the particular circumstances of the case  the failure on the part of the RRT to postpone the applicant s hearing until a date on which she would be available to attend the hearing constituted denial of natural justice   It is clear from Hely J s reasons for judgment in NAHF that his Honour decided the matter upon the basis of a denial of procedural fairness rather than the content of the statutory obligation under s    Thus  it may be that the Full Court in SCAR misconstrued his Honour s decision  see NALQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     However  it is not necessary for me to decide that question  even assuming that it is open to me to do so  Nor is it necessary for me to decide whether the effect of the authorities to which Hely J referred in NAHF establish that the requirements of s   are  as was contended by the appellant  substantive rather than formal   There was nothing in the facts of the present case to enliven an obligation of procedural fairness as was found by Hely J in NAHF   Nor can it be said that the invitation provided anything other than a real and meaningful opportunity to appear  The appellant declined the invitation to attend a hearing without providing any information to the RRT as to his reasons for doing so   The appellant submitted that there are widespread complaints about migration agents but there was nothing to point to any complaint about the appellant s own migration agent referred toB  of   in the matter of an application for a writ of mandamus prohibition and certiorari v Refugee Review Tribunal   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The learned magistrate observed that the appellant cannot complain that his actions  taken in reliance on advice received from the migration agent  led to his being denied procedural fairness  B  of   in the matter of an application for a writ of mandamus prohibition and certiorari v Refugee Review Tribunal   FCA     B    at     The second ground in the application was that the RRT erred in failing to require the appellant to appear and give evidence  pursuant to s   of the Act   The appellant submitted that he made serious allegations of harm and the RRT should have made further enquiries before making its decision   In B  Dowsett J referred at   to two Victorian decisions to the same effect  see SBA Foods Pty Limited v Victorian WorkCover Authority   Anor   VSC   at     per Gillard J  see also Stefanovski v County Court of Victoria   Anor   VSC   at     per Gillard J   Dowsett J s observations in B  as to the approach to be taken in such matters is consistent with the remarks of Sundberg and Hely JJ in VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR     VNAA   at      Their Honours there pointed out that the scheme of Part   of the Act expressly contemplates that in particular circumstances an applicant will not attend a hearing including cases involving no fault of the applicant  They said that  notwithstanding this  the RRT is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant s absence   It seems to me therefore that  subject to the caveat expressed by Dowsett J in B  as to the remarks of the Chief Justice in Hot Holdings  and the remarks of the Full Court in Barrett  the learned Federal Magistrate was correct in holding at   of her reasons that an appellant cannot complain that his actions  taken in reliance upon the advice received from his migration agent  led to his being denied procedural fairness  Indeed  it should be noted that the Chief Justice s observations in Hot Holdings addressed the question of actual or reasonable apprehension of bias resulting from the conduct of persons

maker is responsible for the breach  His Honour observed that this does not mean that the decision maker must be personally at fault before there can be a denial of procedural fairness  He referred to the observation of Gleeson CJ in Hot Holdings   Indeed  in STKB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     Selway J was of the view that Ex parte A does not reflect the law in Australia  His Honour considered that there may be some limited circumstances where it might be arguable that acts by Departmental officers or others could invalidate a Tribunal decision even though the Tribunal was unaware of them  see at   citing  inter alia  Hot Holdings at     per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ   It seems to me therefore that  subject to the caveat expressed by Dowsett J in B  as to the remarks of the Chief Justice in Hot Holdings  and the remarks of the Full Court in Barrett  the learned Federal Magistrate was correct in holding at   of her

role played by those persons referred toKioa v West   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant submitted that refugees are vulnerable people and that this gave rise to a duty of fairness upon the RRT to notify the appellant that the application was doomed to failure if he did not come to a hearing  He relied upon the oft quoted passage from the judgment of Mason J in Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   at   that procedural fairness is a flexible concept which must be adapted to the circumstances of the particular case   However  in my opinion  the notice sent to the appellant on   November   made it plain that the application would not be decided favourably to the appellant  on the papers  citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous

so  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA         ALR     SGLB     The magistrate concluded that the RRT s decision was not affected by jurisdictional error and the application was dismissed   The notice of appeal filed on   September   contains the same grounds as were pursued before the Federal Magistrate in the application for review   In SGLB at   Gummow and Hayne JJ held that  although s   of the Act confers power on the RRT to obtain a medical report  the Act does not impose any duty or obligation to do so  The same principle must apply to the power to summons a person to give evidence under s   discussedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In written submissions in support of the appeal  the appellant relied upon the following statement of principle in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR   FCAFC         FCR     SCAR   at           it is also clear that s   of the Act imposes an objective requirement on the Tribunal  The statutory obligation upon the Tribunal to provide a  real and meaningful  invitation exists whether or not the Tribunal is aware of the actual circumstances which would defeat that obligation   The Full Court in SCAR gave as an example of the circumstances in which it had been held that the obligations imposed by s   have been breached as those where an invitation was given but the applicant was unable to attend because of ill health  citing Applicant NAHF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR     NAHF      It is clear from Hely J s reasons for judgment in NAHF that his Honour decided the matter upon the basis of a denial of procedural fairness rather than the content of the statutory obligation under s    Thus  it may be that the Full Court in SCAR misconstrued his Honour s decision  see NALQ v

that the observations of McHugh J and Kirby J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Miah   HCA         CLR   at   and   support the proposition that it is open to the Court to take into account the fault of an applicant s adviser  However  their Honours were there considering the question of whether the adviser s default should be taken into account in determining whether an applicant s delay was a discretionary bar to the grant of Constitutional writs  Their observations on that question have no bearing on the issues arising in this appeal   This ground of appeal only needs to be stated to be rejected  What the appellant contends is that  notwithstanding his written notification declining the invitation to attend the oral hearing  the RRT should nevertheless have exercised its power to summons him to attend citedRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte S    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

Full Court said in WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     there would be no unfairness when the person affected knew what he was required to prove to the decision maker and was given the opportunity to do so  Their Honours said that an appellant cannot complain if his application is rejected because the decision maker without notice to him has rejected what was put forward  see also the observations of a Full Court in S  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     S    at     which are apt in the present case  I reject the appellant s submission that S  is distinguishable   The appellant also submitted that the RRT was bound to advise him as a matter of procedural fairness that his
