  HCA         CLR     particularly at     per Brennan CJ  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ and in Lockwood Security Products   HCA       ALR         ALJR   at      It is made clear that external evidence cannot be relied upon  The same ground of invalidity was examined in some detail by the Full Court in Merck   Co Inc   FCAFC       FCR   at      cf at first instance Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Merck   Co Inc     ALR         IPR   at      The true scope of this ground of invalidity is difficult to discern in a case such as the present where the claims are for conventional products  albeit defined by chemical formula  and processes for the manufacture of products compared  say  with Merck   Co Inc   FCAFC       FCR   which dealt with a variation of a dosage regime  It is clear that the grounds of novelty and obviousness must be considered as such rather than through this prism   CCOM Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   at        Utility  in this sense  depends upon whether  by following the teaching of the complete specification  the result claimed is produced    Advanced Building Systems   HCA       CLR   at      The result claimed may cover two aspects one is physically producing a result and the other is producing a result that is useful  Useful in this sense does not mean commercially successful  Put another way  Gummow J in Rehm Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems  International  Pty Ltd     ALR   at   approved the following statement of general principle   If an invention does what it is intended by the patentee to do  and the end attained is itself useful  the invention is a useful invention  discussedAktiebolaget H ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicants seek to sidestep this considerable obstacle by relying upon the description of the inventive step in the complete specification which makes it clear that the step was to go from the racemic mixture corresponding to the formula methyl alpha     tetrahydro   c  thieno pyridyl    chlorophenyl  acetate  described as derivative   in the French patent  to the dextro rotatory enantiomer of that racemic mixture  The inventiveness of that step would then be judged according to Australian common general knowledge  It was submitted that this approach is consistent with that of the majority of the High Court in Aktiebolaget H ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and      That was consistent with the way in which that case had been conducted below   Aktiebolaget H ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR   at     and     Aktiebolaget   HCA       CLR   provides a good example  The compound  known as omeprazole  which undoubtedly involved an inventive step  was not easily formulated into a satisfactory pharmaceutical composition  and solving a problem in the administration of the drug by formulation was required  that being the gist of the inventive step claimed in that case  Obviousness was not judged on the basis that omeprazole had not been discovered simply because it had not passed into Australian common general knowledge  By analogy in the present case  the only invention described in the specification is moving from the particular racemic compound to the dextro rotatory enantiomer of that compound  It would be the obviousness  or otherwise  of that step which would be tested  not the obviousness of formulating clopidogrel or any of the other compounds encompassed by the French patent   On this basis  the state of Australian common general knowledge would still have an important part to play in judging inventiveness  It is easy to imagine that there would be technical fields where there is little Australian common general knowledge so that  for example  what may be routine in the laboratories of Switzerland would be inventive by Australian standards  On the other hand  there may be other fields where the relevant Australian knowledge was in advance of the country where the claimed invention took place  leading to the opposite conclusion   The position established in Minnesota Mining   HCA       CLR   was of relatively short duration  Until then  the wider view of Williams J in HPM Industries Pty Ltd v Gerard Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR   had applied  see Graham Hart   Pty Ltd v SW Hart   Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Aickin J at      The   Act widens the prior art base  but does not change the nature of the issue  Leaving aside Aktiebolaget   HCA       CLR     the principal survey of the topic by the High Court since Minnesota Mining   HCA       CLR   was in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd  No     HCA         ALR         ALJR     particularly at      That case did not involve the problem that arises here  It is noteworthy that the Court said of the   provisions  at      As stated above  by enlarging the prior art base through including relevant prior disclosures beyond those disclosures proven to be part of the common general knowledge  these provisions raise the threshold for inventiveness  However  the idea remains that the prior disclosures to be taken into account  even as enlarged by s   are being considered for a particular purpose  That purpose is the purpose of looking forward from the prior art base to see what a person skilled in the relevant art is likely to have done when faced with a similar problem which the patentee claims to have solved with the invention    Emphasis added    cf Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd   HCA         ALR         ALJR   at   as to combination patents   The applicants do not seek to utilise the contents of the prior specification as an admission as to common general knowledge  cf Lockwood Security Products   HCA       ALR       ALJR   at

Lundbeck A S   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The present cases are applications for revocation of a patent pursuant to s   of the Patents Act    Cth   the   Act   The patent claims an enantiomer of a racemate where that racemate was disclosed and claimed by an earlier patent  This has been an issue in relation to other compounds  most recently in two judgments published after the close of evidence and  in one case  after the close of addresses the decision of Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A S   FCA   and the decision of the Full Court in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner Lambert Co LLC   FCAFC   respectively   Counsel for Sanofi Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure  not mere disclosure  is required for anticipation  citing  most recently  Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA   at     and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham  Paroxetine Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC    By way of introduction  it is worth remarking that the phrase  enabling disclosure  was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc   UKHL       RPC         IPR    That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the   United Kingdom Act  based upon the European Patent Convention  but did not concern the question of anticipation  The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was  supported  by the earlier specification  That is a concept similar to  but narrower than  whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law  cf F Hoffman La Roche   Co AG v Commissioner of Patents   HCA         CLR     CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    It may be accepted that  in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula  in order to be valid  the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured  s    The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK s Application   RPC     to which I shall return  The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but  in my opinion  has little  if any  relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula  Indeed  it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter  For a product claim  the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it   May   Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd     RPC   at      By the same token  a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty   Lindgren J dealt with a somewhat similar situation in Alphapharm   FCA   although  in that case  there was no express reference to  or claim to  the enantiomers of the racemate in the alleged anticipation  His Honour had construed the relevant claims of the patent in suit as relating only to the    or dextro rotatory enantiomer of citalopram  having a separate existence  not being an indistinguishable part of the unresolved racemate  His reasoning included the following   Alphapharm   FCA   at      The only context that I take into account in arriving at this conclusion is that it was part of common general knowledge        that racemates contained in equal parts   and     enantiomers    that the enantiomers of a racemate were potentially separable  and it was a possibility that an enantiomer might have a stable existence as a compound distinct from being part of the racemate    that some racemates had in fact been resolved into their separate enantiomers  and    that racemates were commonly represented by the symbol     to indicate the presence of both enantiomers      It is not that the   citalopram compound does not exist when it is part of the racemate  The skilled addressee would understand that it exists whether a part of the racemate or apart from it  and that the purpose of the   symbol is only to distinguish it from the     enantiomer and from its being merely part of the racemate or of some other mixture  The   or     symbol  devoid of any context suggesting otherwise  implies distinctness from the racemate    In Alphapharm   FCA     Professor Martin Banwell was called by the applicant for revocation  as he was in these cases   After referring to the well known passage from General Tire   Rubber Co   RPC   at     and citing various other cases  his Honour said   Alphapharm   FCA   at      What does  enabling disclosure  mean in the context of a product claim  It means that the earlier disclosure must point unmistakeably to the   enantiomer of citalopram  as distinct from the racemate  as a drug desirable to obtain    I take  as distinct from  to mean  separately from  not  instead of  or  as opposed to   This does not include any separate requirement of enablement in accordance with SmithKline Beecham  Paroxetine Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC   and is consistent with my opinion   It was alleged that the product claims of the patent in suit in that case were anticipated by the Australian Citalopram Patent  His Honour rejected the argument on the following basis   Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA   at      The Australian Citalopram Patent did not refer to  enantiomers   It did not expressly or by implication otherwise disclose the individual enantiomers  It disclosed the racemate and enabled the obtaining of it  Whether this anticipated the present invention turns on my construction of the Patent see Section C above  The skilled but non inventive addressee reading the Australian Citalopram Patent would have understood that     citalopram consisted of the   enantiomer of citalopram and the     enantiomer  each as to   and would have been able to identify the formulae for the S and R enantiomers  but would not have known  in the absence of experimentation  which was   and which was      These facts would not  however  point specifically to the independent existence of the enantiomers which is  according to my construction of the Patent specification  of the essence of claim    If I had construed claim   as referring to   citalopram when present in the unresolved racemate  the Australian Citalopram Patent would have been an anticipation  But because of my construction outlined at Section C above  a person taught by the Australian Citalopram Patent  although taught to desire to obtain the racemate  would not be taught to desire to obtain the specific   enantiomer in its own right  Similarly  the Australian Citalopram Patent s citalopram formula did not disclose the independently existing   enantiomer  I note that if In re Adamson     F d   is authority for the proposition that a patent for a racemate necessarily anticipates a claimed invention of either of its enantiomers  I respectfully disagree   A little earlier than the decision in Alphapharm   FCA     Young J had considered a similar issue in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner Lambert Co LLC  No     FCA         IPR    One question was whether the formula in claim   of the relevant patent claimed only the racemate and not the enantiomers separate from the racemate  The patentee  Warner Lambert  called  amongst other witnesses  Professor Christopher Easton and Professor Peter Scammells  who gave evidence for Sanofi Aventis in these cases  The applicant for revocation  Ranbaxy  called  inter alia  Dr Keith Watson  who was called by Apotex  one of the applicants  in these cases  His Honour s findings about common general knowledge  so far as is relevant  were as follows   Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   at           The biological activity of a racemate in a biological system can be quite different from that of a single enantiomer  The physical and biological properties of a racemate differ from that of an individual enantiomer in various respects  for example  there may be differences in solubility between the racemate and its enantiomers and differences in pharmacological properties     The normal expectation is that there would be one enantiomer that is approximately twice as active as the racemate in terms of its operation in the target biological system     Before   May   the skilled team would expect that the R enantiomer was very likely to be the active  or more active  enantiomer  but this could not be known with certainty without isolating and testing the enantiomer     Conversely  it was very likely to be the case that the S enantiomer was inactive  or substantially less active  than the R enantiomer  but this could not be known with certainty until the enantiomers had been isolated and tested     Well before   May   it was common general knowledge amongst medicinal chemists that racemic mixtures could be separated into the individual enantiomers by well known methods of resolution  Indeed  undergraduate chemical students were taught procedures to resolve enantiomers  It was also generally known before May   that enantiomers could be obtained by chiral synthesis     As at   May   it was feasible to use resolution or chiral synthesis to obtain a single enantiomer drug  Pharmaceutical companies had produced single enantiomer synthetic drugs either by way of resolution from the corresponding racemic mixture or by way of chiral synthesis prior to May       As at May   it was known that enantiomers could have different biological properties and that it may be desirable to separate and remove the less active enantiomer   Although the decisions in Alphapharm   FCA   and Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   turned in large measure upon the evidence in each case  a difference in approach can be detected on the question involving the disclosure of enantiomers  with Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   favourable to the applicants on this issue  and Alphapharm   FCA   being neutral  In neither case was there the express reference to enantiomers such as there is in the French and corresponding patents here  The priority dates of the relevant patents are also interesting when compared with the priority dates in issue here  In Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR     the priority date of the broader patent was   May   and that of the enantiomer patent   July    In the case of Alphapharm   FCA   the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of   January   and the enantiomer patent   June    The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here  Naturally  the field of each invention is somewhat different but the principles of stereochemistry as they were understood at the time should not have varied much  There is no suggestion of any crucial and widely known developments during the years in question citedArrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Merck   Co

previously stood in the following way   RPC at    Novelty is a fundamental of patent law  Prior to the Act of   it was settled law in the U K  that  if the prior inventor s publication contains a clear description of  or clear instruction to do or make  something that would infringe that patentee s claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee s patent  that patentee s claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty  see  General Tire v  Firestone   R P C    at p    Accordingly under the Act of   a claim to a chemical compound has been held to be anticipated by a statement

included the words  made available to the public   Counsel in Asahi   RPC   suggested this may have made a difference to the test  Falconer J s reasoning did not appear to depend upon that distinction

Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC   If that view is correct  then the patent in suit is not a selection patent in the ordinary sense as PCR   and each of the enantiomers were expressly disclosed and claimed in the earlier patents and are expressly referred to in the patent in suit  In one sense  the dextro rotatory enantiomer is selected from that sub class  There is authority to suggest that selection can be from a small class  per Buckley LJ in Beecham Group Ltd s  Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC   at   EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   per Lord Wilberforce

present case on that basis if the requirements are met   The phrase in In the matter of Esso Research and Engineering Co s Application  Shell    RPC   at   was  advantages peculiar to themselves  or  as Lord Wilberforce put it in EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   at    unrecognised advantages   Buckley LJ said in Beecham Group Ltd s  Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC   at        the substance must be truly new and the advantage to be gained from its selection must be the inventor s own discovery as opposed to mere verification by him of previous predictions or of what was previously predictable  in other words  it must be unexpected          The specification in question here was  no doubt  drawn with this concept in mind  However  the advantages here are not different in kind from those described and predicted in the earlier patent specifications  Even if such an advantage could be satisfied by a quantum leap in relation to an earlier claimed advantage  the results here are by no means out of the range of results predictable from the tests done on the examples in the earlier specification   The patentee s argument is not easily reconcilable with the existence of Pt VII of the   Act dealing with patents of addition for  improvement in or modification of  the main invention  particularly with s   which was as follows   Objection shall not be taken to an application for a patent of addition  so far as the invention is claimed in any claim of the complete specification  and a patent of addition  so far as the invention is so claimed  is not invalid  on the ground only that the invention  so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification  is obvious and does not involve an inventive step  having regard to       a  the publication of the main invention before the priority date of that claim but after the priority date of the claim of the specification of the main invention defining the invention the improvement in which  or the modification of which  is the subject of the first mentioned claim  or  if there are two or more claims defining that invention  after the priority date of whichever of those claims has the earlier or earliest priority date  or   b  the use of the main invention during that period        A patent of addition expired with the original patent  s    cf Ch   of the   Act   It will be observed that the section protected against invalidity on the ground of obviousness not novelty  and did so regardless of the state of common general knowledge in Australia   For an interesting example of patents of addition in a similar context see Beecham Group Ltd s  Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC     On the other hand  if the starting point or baseline is not known to those in the field in Australia  then the selected compound may be seen as a large advance or inventive step in one leap and may be a valuable contribution to the relevant field  It may  as in this case  provide a useful product for the public  thus justifying patent protection   The applicants  contention cannot be rejected out of hand  particularly in the case of a selection patent where the prior publication is a patent specification published or issued in Australia  If that contention is wrong  then this objection to the validity of claim   fails  I will consider the position if the contention were accepted and on the basis that the starting point for analysis of the inventive step was the racemic compound of PCR   as disclosed in the French patent  The starting point of the invention identified in the complete specification in suit is the racemic mixture of derivative   as described in the French patent application  There is no claim of invention in selecting that racemic mixture out of the others disclosed in the French patent  The invention claimed was ascertaining that only the dextro rotatory enantiomer exhibited platelet aggregation inhibiting activity  the levo rotatory enantiomer being inactive and being the less well tolerated of the two  It is  thus  expressed to be a selection patent only in that limited respect discussedBiogen Inc v Medeva plc   UKHL       RPC         IPR

evidence from the experts related to that question  In my view  that was a red herring as far as novelty is concerned  On any view  it was expressly disclosed as one of the most promising of the compounds  The invention was not limited to the most effective or most promising example  The invention was a broad class  As Lord Hoffmann lucidly explained in Biogen Inc   UKHL       RPC   at       IPR   at    If the invention discloses a principle capable of general application  the claims may be in correspondingly general terms  The patentee need not show that he has proved its application in every individual instance  On the other hand  if the claims include a number of discrete methods or products  the patentee must enable the invention to be performed in respect of each of them  Thus if the patentee has hit upon a new product which has a beneficial effect but cannot demonstrate that there is a common principle by which that effect will be shared by other products of the same class  he will be entitled to a patent for that product but not for the class  even though some may subsequently turn out to have the same beneficial effect  see May   Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd

 Co Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   per Black CJ and Lehane J  That case concerned a method of administration of a naturally occurring drug to a patient  The full passage is as follows   What all those authorities contemplate  in our view  is that a prior publication  if it is to destroy novelty  must give a direction or make a recommendation or suggestion which will result  if the skilled reader follows it  in the claimed invention  A direction  recommendation or suggestion may often  of course  be implicit in what is described and commonly the only question may be whether the publication describes with sufficient clarity the claimed invention or  in the case of a combination  each integer of it   That language is quite conventional in relation to a dose regime  The actual decision in the case was that there was anticipation of the dosage regime claimed in the patent in suit by the earlier publication which included the following   Bristol Myers Squibb Co   FCA       FCR   at

Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC    By way of introduction  it is worth remarking that the phrase  enabling disclosure  was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc   UKHL       RPC         IPR    That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the   United Kingdom Act  based upon the European Patent Convention  but did not concern the question of anticipation  The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was  supported  by the earlier specification  That is a concept similar to  but narrower than  whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law  cf F Hoffman La Roche   Co AG v Commissioner of Patents   HCA         CLR     CCOM Pty Ltd v

formula  in order to be valid  the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured  s    The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK s Application   RPC     to which I shall return  The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but  in my opinion  has little  if any  relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula  Indeed  it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter  For a product claim  the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it   May   Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd     RPC   at      By the same token  a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty   The latter decision

Gummow JJ and in Lockwood Security Products   HCA       ALR         ALJR   at      It is made clear that external evidence cannot be relied upon  The same ground of invalidity was examined in some

invalidity is difficult to discern in a case such as the present where the claims are for conventional products  albeit defined by chemical formula  and processes for the manufacture of products compared  say  with Merck   Co Inc   FCAFC       FCR   which dealt with a variation of a dosage regime  It is clear that the grounds of novelty and obviousness must be considered as such rather than through this prism   CCOM Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   at     citedC Van der Lely NV v Bamfords Ltd   RPC   The qualification is expressed in various places including by Lord Reid in C Van der Lely NV v Bamfords Ltd   RPC   at    But Lord Westbury must have meant experiments with a view to discovering something not disclosed  He cannot have meant to refer to the ordinary methods of trial and error which involve no inventive step and are generally necessary in applying any discovery to produce a practical result    In that case  the question was whether a skilled reader would infer from photographs of a machine in magazine articles that the rake wheels of the alleged anticipating machine were ground driven rather than gear driven  It is interesting that Lord Reid went on to say   RPC   at    The appellants  first argument is that it is not enough that the photograph should disclose a probability that the wheels were ground driven  There cannot be anticipation  they say  unless this is shown clearly and unmistakably  I cannot accept that argument  I would agree that the anticipating material must be as good for practical purposes as the material in the appellants  specification  But I can see no practical difference between a definite statement of fact and material from which the skilled man would clearly infer its existence  So the question is whether the typical skilled man would infer ground drive from the photograph  It would not be enough that a quick witted man would guess that  But in this case I think that it is proved that the ordinary skilled man would have had good grounds for reaching the conclusion that these wheels were ground driven  He could not have been certain  but practical men act on something less than absolute certainty

 CLR     That decision was delivered several months after the decision of another Full Court of the High Court in Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd   HCA       CLR    In that case it was held that the specification did not disclose a patentable invention the headnote succinctly summarises the gist of the decision as follows     It is not an inventive idea for which a monopoly can be claimed to take a substance which is known and used for the making of various articles and make out of it an article for which its known properties make it suitable  although it has not in fact been used to make that article before    In NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   the High Court quoted with approval the following passage from the NRDC Case   HCA       CLR   at     per Dixon CJ  Kitto and Windeyer JJ     the Commissioner may properly reject a claim for a process which is not within the concept of a  manufacture   But the case cited  ie Microcell  shows also that even if the process is within the concept the Commissioner is not bound to accept the allegation of the applicant that it is new  if it is apparent on the face of the specification  when properly construed  that the allegation is unfounded  distinguishedEI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   The most recent reference to the topic in Australia is that by the Full Court in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at      A patent application will overcome a prior publication  as a selection patent  if the following criteria are met        there must be some substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the selected members    the whole of the selected members must possess the advantage in question    the selection must be in respect of a quality of a special character  which can fairly be said to be peculiar to the group  and    the advantage possessed by the selected members must be clearly disclosed in the specification     see Re IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC   at        However  that was said in considering the ground of false suggestion rather than lack of novelty  It is a fair brief summary of the position as it was understood at the time of the   Act based upon the authority to which reference was made Re IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC    This remained the basis of the law in the United Kingdom  at least until the decision of the House of Lords in EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR     It seems to me that it is too late in the day to find that the principles explained by Maugham J in IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC   are not relevant to the question of anticipation under the   Act  and the   Act  for that matter   That is not to recognise a special class of patents the reference to a selection patent is a convenient shorthand to pick up the relevant principles concerning anticipation  I approach the United Kingdom cases from and including EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   with caution  I must also endeavour to keep separate questions of anticipation  on the one hand  and obviousness  on the other  The distinction is not always easy to discern in the authorities on this topic  including the seminal judgment of Maugham J   There is a question as to whether the selection patent principles apply to a compound specifically identified in the early specification as a member of the larger class  eg as an example or derivative  or whether it is restricted to the express identification  for the first time  of a particular member of the larger class with the special characteristic  The latter was conceded by the patentee in EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR    In the Court of Appeal  Buckley LJ had favoured the view that the concession was necessary   but  in the House of Lords  Lord Simon preferred to leave the point open   FSR   at    I favour the view of Buckley LJ as more in accordance with the rationale as explained by Maugham J and with his description of the class as follows   IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC at    The second class comprises patents  the so called selection patents  based on a selection of related compounds such as the homologues and substitution derivatives of the original compounds which presumably have been described in general terms and claimed in the originating patent   If that view is correct  then the patent in suit is not a selection patent in the ordinary sense as PCR   and each of the enantiomers were expressly disclosed and claimed in the earlier patents and are expressly referred to in the patent in suit  In one sense  the dextro rotatory enantiomer is selected from that sub class  There is authority to suggest that selection can be from a small class  per Buckley LJ in Beecham Group Ltd s  Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC   at   EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   per Lord Wilberforce at   but  cf Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants  Application  Re   FSR   at     RPC    I will therefore assume  contrary to my own opinion  that the principle can apply to the present case on that basis if the requirements are met   The phrase in In the matter of Esso Research and Engineering Co s Application  Shell    RPC   at   was  advantages peculiar to themselves  or  as Lord Wilberforce put it in EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   at    unrecognised advantages   Buckley LJ said in Beecham Group Ltd s  Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC   at        the substance must be truly new and the advantage to be gained from its selection must be the inventor s own discovery as opposed to mere verification by him of previous predictions or of what was previously predictable  in other words  it must be unexpected          The specification in question here was  no doubt  drawn with this concept in mind  However  the advantages here are not different in kind from those described and predicted in the earlier patent specifications  Even if such an advantage could be satisfied by a quantum leap in relation to an earlier claimed advantage  the results here are by no means out of the range of results predictable from the tests done on the examples in the earlier specification citedF Hoffman La Roche   Co AG v Commissioner of Patents

in General Tire   Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd   RPC   at        If the prior inventor s publication contains a clear description of  or clear instructions to do or make   something that would infringe the patentee s claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee s patent  the patentee s claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty  that is to say  it will have been anticipated  The prior inventor  however  and the patentee may have approached the same device from different starting points and may for this reason  or it may be for other reasons  have so described their devices that it cannot be immediately discerned from a reading of the language which they have respectively used that they have discovered in truth the same device  but if carrying out the directions contained in the prior inventor s publication will inevitably result in something being made or done which  if the patentee s patent were valid  would constitute an infringement of the patentee s claim  this circumstance demonstrates that the patentee s claim has in fact been anticipated     If  on the other hand  the prior publication contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner which would infringe the patentee s claim  but would be at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not do so  the patentee s claim will not have been anticipated  although it may fail on the ground of obviousness  To anticipate the patentee s claim the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakeable directions to do what the patentee claims to have

at    The issue in General Tire   Rubber Co   RPC     as appears from the general treatment of anticipation from     focussed upon the method or process  The references to a signpost and a flag  which have excited later imaginations  deal with a situation in which the language and the directions given as to process or method were equivocal  The main principle is that  if the prior inventor s publication contains a clear description of something that would infringe the patentee s claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee s patent  the patentee s claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty  Alternatively  if the prior inventor s publication contains clear instructions to do or make something that would infringe the patentee s claim if carried out after the

    De GF   J       LJ Ch         LT       ER     particularly the following  A IPR   at      the antecedent statement must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive  understand  and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention can be made useful  If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the useful application of the discovery  that affords sufficient room for another valid patent      There is not  I think  any other general answer that can be given to this question than this  that the information as to the alleged invention given by the prior publication must  for the purposes of practical utility  be equal to that given by the subsequent patent  The invention must be shewn to have been before made known  Whatever  therefore  is essential to the invention must be read out of the prior publication  If specific details are necessary for the practical working and real utility of the alleged invention  they must be found substantially in the prior publication    None of the reports set out the particulars of the plaintiff s patent  For those details it is necessary to go to the related case of Hills v London Gaslight Co   H and N   referred to by Lord Westbury LC in Hill v Evans    A IPR   at    The description of the invention was  an improved mode of compressing peat and of manufacturing gas and of obtaining certain substances applicable to purifying the same   It consisted of passing gas through a mixture with the object of purifying the gas and then renovating the purifying material  Each of the specifications cited against Hill s patent was also process or method patent  Heard s was a patent for the application of lime in the purification of gas  croll s patent was directed to an improved method of purifying coal gas from ammonia and Laming s patent also dealt with the process of purification of gas  The general statements by Lord Westbury LC need to be understood in the context of the facts of that case  With a qualification to be mentioned  the principle was established that all integers of an invention must be in the prior specification if novelty is to be defeated  In the case of a process or method  that means each integer of the process or method citedHPM Industries

revocation would be those set out in s   of the   Act  That would maintain the status quo and neither advantage nor disadvantage the   Act patentee  However  that approach is not reflected in the authorities and has not been contended for by either party   As I have found that claim   and dependent claims lack novelty  this ground adds nothing to that result  The   Act contemplates revocation

conduct contrary to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and defamation  There is a good deal to commend the approach in this context  There is material in the internal documents of Sanofi Aventis that would provide some support for such a case  However  it was pointed out on behalf of Sanofi Aventis that such a case had not been pleaded or presented by the applicants  Further  that does not appear to be the way in which the issue was approached by the Full Court in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at     where it was considered objectively  The decision of the Full Court in ICI Chemicals   FCA       FCR   may support an objective approach as it was held that a false suggestion or representation may be made in good faith although the false statement in that case could possibly be regarded as a statement of fact not a statement of opinion  see ICI Chemicals   FCA         FCR   at       Even if the statements were false  it must be asked whether the suggestion or representation was  a material inducing factor which led to the grant    ICI Chemicals   FCA         FCR   at   citing Prestige Group  Aust  Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at   per Lockhart J and   per Gummow J

being so  the approach of the Full Court in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   would require a negative answer to the question as to whether the false statements did materially induce the decision  see also ICI

the advantage to be gained from its selection must be the inventor s own discovery as opposed to mere verification by him of previous predictions or of what was previously predictable  in other words  it must be unexpected          The specification in question here was  no doubt  drawn with this concept in mind  However  the advantages here are not different in kind from those described and predicted in the earlier patent specifications  Even if such an advantage could be satisfied by a quantum leap in relation to an earlier claimed advantage  the results here are by no means out of the range of results predictable from the tests done on the examples in the earlier specification referred toInsta Image Pty Ltd v KD Kanopy Australasia Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In my view  the inventive step is not to be judged on the basis that either PCR   or the dextro rotatory enantiomer of it is the starting point  It may seem anomalous that the major compound might be obvious because of the statements in the specification in suit but that salts of it are not  However  the salts are novel without any special consideration as selection patents  To take the specification in suit into account in this way to judge the obviousness of these claims would have to be based upon a general principle  not restricted to selection patents  There is much to be said for the view that a patentee should be held to the advance in the art identified in the specification for the purposes of judging whether there is an inventive step  Put another way  the contents of the specification in suit would be taken into account in identifying the inventive step for the purposes of judging obviousness  However  no authority was cited that directly establishes such a principle  Even application of it to selection patents is doubtful  A similar issue arose in the recent Full Court decision in Insta Image Pty Ltd v KD Kanopy Australasia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   in connection with a mechanical invention under the   Act  To the extent that the decision has any application to these cases  it tends against the applicants  contention as to the use that can be made of statements in the specification in suit as to the inventive step  although the reasoning is not altogether clear  see Insta Image Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at     and      The applicants  contention is a step too far for a single judge  It follows that claims     do represent an inventive step compared with common general knowledge in Australia at the time   If the inventive step were identified as having the single enantiomer of clopidogrel as the starting point  I would have held that each salt claimed was obvious  It was known that a pharmaceutically acceptable salt was useful for administration of an active compound  It was known how to prepare such salts using known mineral or organic acids  The acids chosen here hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid  hydrobromic acid and taurocholic acid were conventional  They were  with the exception of taurocholic acid  the acids utilised in relation to the salts of PCR   in the French patent  Standard methods of preparation of the salts were known   Claim   is the principal process claim  It describes in a general way the process of liberating the dextro rotatory enantiomer from the racemic compound PCR   by means of diastereomeric salt formation  The desire to obtain the dextro rotatory enantiomer of the racemic compound is taken for granted  The claim does not relate to that choice  it relates only to the means of doing so  Novelty lies in the fact that no prior art discloses the use of that process in relation to that particular compound to obtain that particular enantiomer  That method was well known in the field in Australia at the priority date as a classic means of obtaining the enantiomers of a racemic compound  What the specification in suit discloses is that the classic method worked in this case  The patentee sought to establish  principally through Mr Badorc  firstly  that the method did not always work in relation to particular compounds and  secondly  that the application of the method in this case required choices to be made in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of carrying it out that were not standard  and were not obvious  A number of other methods of obtaining the enantiomers of a racemic compound were known at the priority date and it was also contended that the choice of one over the other was not obvious   None of those contentions detract from the fact that claim   represents a classic process being applied to a known compound to produce the desired result  The relevance of Mr Badorc s evidence to the issue is doubtful at least  Even if admissible  in my opinion  the particular application of the method by Mr Badorc did not involve any inventive step  Mr Badorc s evidence of the steps he took by way of diastereomeric salt formation  leading to the successful experiment on   March   was challenged in various respects  principally because of apparent discrepancies between that evidence and the contemporaneous records  His explanations were far from convincing  Even if his evidence is accepted  the steps he took were typical of the trial and error that was necessarily involved with the use of such a technique  Even if there were an inventive step in the particular application by Mr Badorc  claim   is not so limited  Each of the additional integers in claims     and   was well known in the field in Australia at the priority date and were available as part of the ordinary process of trial and error  They do not reflect any particular inventive step identified by Mr Badorc   The fact that a process may not always work in particular circumstances and that there were other available alternatives does not establish that it was inventive to choose to use it  The choice of one known process over other known processes may be inventive in some circumstances perhaps where the received wisdom would point in the other direction or the result was unexpected  There were no such circumstances here  For the sake of completeness  I should say that there was no inventive step involved  or claimed  in ascertaining the pharmacological characteristics of the respective enantiomers referred toInstitut Francais du

class  There is authority to suggest that selection can be from a small class  per Buckley LJ in Beecham Group Ltd s  Amoxycillin  Application  Re   RPC   at   EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s

opinion  that the principle can apply to the present case on that basis if the requirements are met   It is difficult to see how this patent could have been valid without disclosing the starting point

 of that Act by not describing the invention  see Sami S Svendsen Inc v Independent Products Canada Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and      The same applies under the   Act  Hence the necessity to spell

PCR   or derivative   was not unmistakably pointed to as the best of the compounds  There was competing evidence from the experts related to that question  In my view  that was a red herring as far as novelty is concerned  On any view  it was expressly disclosed as one of the most promising of the compounds  The invention was not limited to the most effective or most promising example  The invention was a broad class  As Lord Hoffmann lucidly explained in Biogen Inc   UKHL       RPC   at       IPR   at    If the invention discloses a principle capable of general application  the claims may be in correspondingly general terms  The patentee need not show that he has proved its application in every individual instance  On the other hand  if the claims include a number of discrete methods or products  the patentee must enable the invention to be performed in respect of each of them  Thus if the patentee has hit upon a new product which has a beneficial effect but cannot demonstrate that there is a common principle by which that effect will be shared by other products of the same class  he will be entitled to a patent for that product but not for the class  even though some may subsequently turn out to have the same beneficial effect  see May   Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd   RPC   at    On the other hand  if he has disclosed a beneficial property which is common to the class  he will be entitled to a patent for all products of that class  assuming them to be new  even though he has not himself made more than one or two of them   The first case in

that there was anticipation of the dosage regime claimed in the patent in suit by the earlier publication which included the following   Bristol Myers Squibb Co   FCA       FCR   at      Further

obviousness must be considered as such rather than through this prism   CCOM Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   at       In my opinion  it cannot be said that the patent in suit claims an invention that is not new on the face of the specification without regard to what may be described as external evidence  Indeed  the specification has been drawn in a fashion which is designed to ensure that the claims are new if the contents of the specification are accepted  I do not agree that the French specification is incorporated by reference as a whole and for all purposes into the specification in suit  It is incorporated sufficiently to understand the reference to the racemic compound in the specification in suit  Even if that be wrong  and it is incorporated as a whole  as appeared to be the case with some prior documents in the Full Court decision in Merck   Co Inc   FCAFC       FCR     it would take the matter no further than the decision to which I have come on novelty   The next ground to be considered is that the patent was obtained on a false suggestion or representation   Act  s  k    Act  s  d   The first false and misleading representation alleged was the statement   in an unexpected manner only the dextro rotatory enantiomer Id exhibits a platelet aggregation inhibiting activity  the levo rotatory enantiomer Il being inactive    Emphasis added    It is accepted that the statement as to the relative activity is accurate but it is alleged that it was not  unexpected   This was linked with the following representation   The pharmacological study just presented has demonstrated the interesting inhibitory properties towards platelet aggregation of the compound Id and the absence of any activity of its isomer Il    Emphasis added   Those statements were obviously designed to support the claim to novelty for the dextro rotatory enantiomer to counter any suggestion that this was merely another use for a known substance and  in particular  to support a claim for novelty based upon selection appliedMeyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The phrase in s  g  of the   Act   was not novel in Australia  is similar in substance to the phrase in s   of the   Act  not novel in the light of  various kinds of information  To say that the claim of a patent is not novel in that sense is to say that it adds nothing new to that with which it is compared  In the case of a paper anticipation  it assumes that the product described is made or the process outlined is followed  Each integer of the claimed invention must be disclosed in the prior publication  The reverse infringement test is a practical way of detecting whether that is so in most cases   Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     The patent in suit claims a chemical compound with a specific property namely  the capacity to rotate plane polarised light to the right  That property distinguishes it both from the racemate and from the levo rotatory enantiomer  The dextro rotatory enantiomer is not expressly identified as such in the French patent  Counsel for Sanofi Aventis submits that it is not possible from the face of the earlier specifications to say which enantiomer is the levo rotatory and which is the dextro rotatory the most that can be said is that both are in the racemate  Furthermore  it is said that that difference is significant so far as pharmacological efficacy and toxicity were concerned as disclosed in the complete specification of the patent in suit  Thus  the patentee s contention is that this is something new and different novel in form and in substance   On the other hand  the formula identified as derivative   or example   in the French patent and corresponding patents  PCR   has the identical formula to the enantiomer in suit  I am satisfied that the skilled but not inventive reader of the French and corresponding patents would understand that the derivative in question  in common with all of the derivatives  was the racemate and that all of the technical explanations as to the means of obtaining that  and other  derivatives and as to the testing of them related only to the racemate and not to any individual enantiomer  There is no express suggestion that either enantiomer had in fact been separately obtained or tested for efficacy or toxicity  That said  it was commonly known  and was spelled out in the French patent  that the compound in question was a racemate with one chiral centre and two enantiomers one dextro and the other levo  There were express references to the enantiomers in both the body of the specification and in the claims of the French and corresponding patents  with the detail most clearly spelled out in the Canadian patent  The express references to the enantiomers in the French and corresponding patents  particularly the Canadian patent  plainly carry the claim that the enantiomers are within the compounds disclosed referred toMinnesota Mining   Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf  Aust  Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A threshold question of law arises  It is submitted for the patentee that  once it is accepted that clopidogrel was not part of common general knowledge in Australia  let alone the broader teachings of the French patent  the ground of lack of inventive step is misconceived and has no possibility of success  It is pointed out that the statutory phrase is  what was known or used in Australia  before the priority date  It is well established that that phrase refers to common general knowledge in the relevant field in Australia  that is to say   the background knowledge and experience which is available to all in the trade in considering the making of new products  or the making of improvements in old    Minnesota Mining   Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf  Aust  Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     This submission was described as heretical  I  therefore  carefully reread the analysis of s  e  of the   Act by Aickin J in Minnesota Mining   HCA       CLR     particularly at      That analysis is not directed to the question that arises here  There is no indication in that case that any of the patent specifications relied upon were cited in the patent in suit  that they had any connection with the patentee or that the patentee was aware of

Falconer J appeared to be and  in my opinion  was  a departure from the manner in which the law of anticipation had been understood in the United Kingdom and in Australia up to that time   The specification in suit does not explain in express terms the reason or motivation for separating and testing the enantiomers and comparing the results with those for the racemic mix  It is assumed that the enantiomers might be separated  The reason for that course is not disclosed  There is no statement  for example  of the problems concerning tolerance and toxicity which are now known to have affected the racemic mix and to have led to the search for a better alternative  The inventive step claimed  in relation to the product claim for the dextro rotatory enantiomer  was the unexpected nature of the result  It is as if  in the course of an investigation  an unexpected result occurred  That can be sufficient to provide subject matter  as it used to be called  for an invention in appropriate circumstances  The references to the French patent in the complete specification of the patent in suit are sufficient to permit reference to the French specification but only to understand

Australia Pty Ltd v Warner Lambert Co LLC  No     FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A little earlier than the decision in Alphapharm   FCA     Young J had considered a similar issue in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner Lambert Co LLC  No     FCA         IPR    One question was whether the formula in claim   of the relevant patent claimed only the racemate and not the enantiomers separate from the racemate  The patentee  Warner Lambert  called  amongst other witnesses  Professor Christopher Easton and Professor Peter Scammells  who gave evidence for Sanofi Aventis in these cases  The applicant for revocation  Ranbaxy  called  inter alia  Dr Keith Watson  who was called by Apotex  one of the applicants  in these cases  His Honour s findings about common general knowledge  so far as is relevant  were as follows   Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   at           The biological activity of a racemate in a biological system can be quite different from that of a single enantiomer  The physical and biological properties of a racemate differ from that of an individual enantiomer in various respects  for example  there may be differences in solubility between the racemate and its enantiomers and differences in pharmacological properties     The normal expectation is that there would be one enantiomer that is approximately twice as active as the racemate in terms of its operation in the target biological system     Before   May   the skilled team would expect that the R enantiomer was very likely to be the active  or more active  enantiomer  but this could not be known with certainty without isolating and testing the enantiomer     Conversely  it was very likely to be the case that the S enantiomer was inactive  or substantially less active  than the R enantiomer  but this could not be known with certainty until the enantiomers had been isolated and tested     Well before   May   it was common general knowledge amongst medicinal chemists that racemic mixtures could be separated into the individual enantiomers by well known methods of resolution  Indeed  undergraduate chemical students were taught procedures to resolve enantiomers  It was also generally known before May   that enantiomers could be obtained by chiral synthesis     As at   May   it was feasible to use resolution or chiral synthesis to obtain a single enantiomer drug  Pharmaceutical companies had produced single enantiomer synthetic drugs either by way of resolution from the corresponding racemic mixture or by way of chiral synthesis prior to May       As at May   it was known that enantiomers could have different biological properties and that it may be desirable to separate and remove the less active enantiomer   His Honour found that the formula did include claims for the enantiomers as such  notwithstanding that there was no reference to them  An important part of his reasoning was as follows   Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   at     and        Perhaps the most important background consideration against which the claims of the   Patent must be construed is that the skilled addressee would know that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors  such as the class of compounds referred to in claim   are enantiomeric and that one enantiomer is very likely to be more active than the other  The skilled addressee would also know that the biological activity of a racemate will be different from that of the single enantiomers  and that the active or more active enantiomer will be approximately twice as active as the racemate  In these circumstances  confronted by a structural formula in claim   that shows relative stereochemistry  the skilled reader would consider that the structural formula was intended to claim both enantiomers  as well as racemic mixtures  I do not think that the skilled addressee would read the structural formula as one that was intended to exclude the more active enantiomer  Reading the specification as a whole  the skilled addressee would discern that the patentee had not isolated the individual enantiomers and that the absolute stereochemistry of the more active enantiomer  and that of the less active enantiomer  had not been defined  The skilled addressee would also know that  while it had not yet been done by the patentee  it was a routine step to obtain the individual enantiomers by resolving the racemic mixture  and that it was also possible to make the individual enantiomers by chiral synthesis  In those circumstances  the skilled addressee would expect  in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary  that claim   of the patent was intended to include the more active enantiomer      In these circumstances  in the absence of any clear indication or language to the contrary  the skilled addressee as at May   would read claim   as encompassing both individual enantiomers  as well as mixtures of them  As Warner Lambert submitted  it would make no sense to exclude patent protection for the more active enantiomer  The point was well made by Professor Easton in the course of his affidavit evidence when he said that to confine the subject of the   Patent to racemic mixtures would exclude the thing  the active or more active enantiomer  that he  and any person working in the field as at May   would know to be the key to the useful activity of the compounds disclosed by the patent  It is not in dispute that structural formula I would be construed by the skilled addressee as including a trans racemate of the compounds of the formula  But there is no reason why the skilled reader would construe the formula as meaning only the trans racemate  thereby excluding both the R trans and the S trans enantiomers  In the absence of a clear indication to the contrary  it offends common sense to construe structural formula I in that way    Young J referred to decisions on the same patent in England and the United States which adopted a similar construction   Although the decisions in Alphapharm   FCA   and Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   turned in large measure upon the evidence in each case  a difference in approach can be detected on the question involving the disclosure of enantiomers  with Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   favourable to the applicants on this issue  and Alphapharm   FCA   being neutral  In neither case was there the express reference to enantiomers such as there is in the French and corresponding patents here  The priority dates of the relevant patents are also interesting when compared with the priority dates in issue here  In Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR     the priority date of the broader patent was   May   and that of the enantiomer patent   July    In the case of Alphapharm   FCA   the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of   January   and the enantiomer patent   June    The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here  Naturally  the field of each invention is somewhat different but the principles of stereochemistry as they were understood at the time should not have varied much  There is no suggestion of any crucial and widely known developments during the years in question   Here  there is no suggestion that any of the process claims do not work in that sense and there is no suggestion that the compounds claimed do not usefully inhibit platelet aggregation  Indeed  it has not been contended that the compounds claimed are not better in that respect than the racemate  I do not see that the claims that the properties were  unexpected  or  surprising  have anything to do with that concept  The decision of Young J in Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   must have been based upon the view that the specification there was construed as promising a particular level of result  The correctness of the decision on this point was left open in the Full Court   Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at     followedRanbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner Lambert Co LLC   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The present cases are applications for revocation of a patent pursuant to s   of the Patents Act    Cth   the   Act   The patent claims an enantiomer of a racemate where that racemate was disclosed and claimed by an earlier patent  This has been an issue in relation to other compounds  most recently in two judgments published after the close of evidence and  in one case  after the close of addresses the decision of Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A S   FCA   and the decision of the Full Court in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner Lambert Co LLC   FCAFC   respectively   The Full Court upheld the decision of Young J on the basis that the conclusion was open to the judge on the evidence  although the Full Court did appear to adopt some of the judge s reasoning   Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at       The most recent reference to the topic in Australia is that by the Full Court in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at      A patent application will overcome a prior publication  as a selection patent  if the following criteria are met        there must be some substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the selected members    the whole of the selected members must possess the advantage in question    the selection must be in respect of a quality of a special character  which can fairly be said to be peculiar to the group  and    the advantage possessed by the selected members must be clearly disclosed in the specification     see Re IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC   at        However  that was said in considering the ground of false suggestion rather than lack of novelty  It is a fair brief summary of the position as it was understood at the time of the   Act based upon the authority to which reference was made Re IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC    This remained the basis of the law in the United Kingdom  at least until the decision of the House of Lords in EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR     It is convenient to state once again the summary of those requirements from the Full Court decision in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at           there must be some substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the selected members    the whole of the selected members must possess the advantage in question    the selection must be in respect of a quality of a special character  which can fairly be said to be peculiar to the group  and    the advantage possessed by the selected members must be clearly disclosed in the specification   There is a substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the dextro rotatory enantiomer of PCR   as compared with use of either the racemic mixture or the levo rotatory enantiomer  It is better tolerated or less toxic than either and as effective as the racemate with a lesser concentration  That proved to be the difference between success as a pharmaceutical drug and otherwise  In that sense  the first of the criteria is satisfied  The second and fourth criteria are also  obviously  satisfied   However  is the selection in respect of a quality of a special character  It will be recalled that the complete specification of the French patent  and corresponding patents  described the advantages of the invention as follows   The toxicological and pharmacological investigations reported above demonstrate the low toxicity of the compounds of the invention  as well as their excellent tolerance and their inhibiting properties on blood platelet aggregation  and their anti thrombotic activity  which make them very useful in medical therapeutic applications    The claims were not limited to any particular result  In my opinion  that is a good description of the performance of the dextro rotatory enantiomer of PCR    It was obvious from the specification of the French and corresponding patents that it was not claimed that each compound within the class would have equal qualities indeed  the report of the tests demonstrated that that was not so the advantages were described very generally   It was submitted for the patentee that the descriptions  unexpected  and  interesting  are expressions of opinion and can only be falsified or made misleading by establishing that they were not genuinely held  That distinction is well known in the fields of misrepresentation  misleading conduct contrary to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and defamation  There is a good deal to commend the approach in this context  There is material in the internal documents of Sanofi Aventis that would provide some support for such a case  However  it was pointed out on behalf of Sanofi Aventis that such a case had not been pleaded or presented by the applicants  Further  that does not appear to be the way in which the issue was approached by the Full Court in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   at     where it was considered objectively  The decision of the Full Court in ICI Chemicals   FCA       FCR   may support an objective approach as it was held that a false suggestion or representation may be made in good faith although the false statement in that case could possibly be regarded as a statement of fact not a statement of opinion  see ICI Chemicals   FCA         FCR   at       In Ranbaxy   FCAFC   it was said  at      The ground of false suggestion or misrepresentation must involve some misleading or deception of the Commissioner or the Commissioner s delegate  being the person who makes the grant  To establish the ground  there must be a finding that the Commissioner or the Commissioner s delegate was in some way misled or deceived by the suggestion or representation in question and that being so misled or deceived contributed to or caused the decision to grant the patent  The Commissioner was a party to the proceeding but took no substantive part in the proceeding  The Commissioner may have taken the view that Ranbaxy was prosecuting the alleged grounds of invalidity with sufficient vigour for the Commissioner not to be involved  Ranbaxy adduced no evidence as to the way in which the alleged false suggestions or misrepresentations operated on the decision making process of the Commissioner  Where it is alleged that a patent was obtained on or by false suggestion or misrepresentation  it is relevant  although not decisive  that the Commissioner has made no complaint about being misled or deceived  In the absence of an allegation of fraud  which involves an examination of the state of mind of the patent applicant  it is not sufficient to make out the ground of false suggestion or misrepresentation to prove simply that a false or misleading statement was made and nothing else  That is to say  even if a suggestion or representation is shown to be false or misleading  that  of itself  is not sufficient reason to draw an inference that the suggestion or representation contributed to the decision to grant the patent  In the present case  there was no explicit evidence to the effect that  if there had been no assertion that the effectiveness of the relevant compounds was surprising and unexpected  the Enantiomer Patent would not have been granted  While inferences can be drawn  in the absence of any evidence concerning the Commissioner s decision making process  the inferences must be reasonably cogent    Original emphasis    In that case the examiner had questioned the patentability of the claim to the enantiomer where the racemate had previously been published  The statements which were found to be false were made on behalf of the patentee in order to overcome the examiner s objection  In those circumstances  the Full Court agreed with the conclusion of the primary judge that the necessary element of causation was present   However  in the present case the Patent Office file shows no indication that the examiner was conscious of any potential problem or raised one with the patentee  That being so  the approach of the Full Court in Ranbaxy   FCAFC   would require a negative answer to the question as to whether the false statements did materially induce the decision  see also ICI Chemicals   FCA       FCR   at      In any event  I would be inclined to think that by the time this application was being considered  patent officers would have regarded the description of a finding as  unexpected  or  interesting  in the field of selection patents as likely to be a patent attorney s  puff  rather than a serious statement of fact   Here  there is no suggestion that any of the process claims do not work in that sense and there is no suggestion that the compounds claimed do not usefully inhibit platelet aggregation  Indeed  it has not been contended that the compounds claimed are not better in that respect than the racemate  I do not see that the claims that the properties were  unexpected  or  surprising  have anything to do with that concept  The decision of Young J in Ranbaxy   FCA       IPR   must have been based upon the view that the specification there was construed as promising a

Genentech Inc s  Human Growth Hormone  Patent   RPC   in which it was held that  for a disclosure of a chemical compound in a prior document to anticipate a later claim to that compound  the cited document must contain sufficient directions to enable the compound to be made   RPC at       Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK s Application   RPC   concerned the   United Kingdom Act  Counsel for the Comptroller of Patents neatly  and  in my opinion correctly  summed up the law as it previously stood in the following way   RPC at    Novelty is a fundamental of patent law  Prior to the Act of   it was settled law in the U K  that  if the prior inventor s publication contains a clear description of  or clear instruction to do or make  something that would infringe that patentee s claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee s patent  that patentee s claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty  see  General Tire v  Firestone   R P C    at p    Accordingly under the Act of   a claim to a chemical compound has been held to be anticipated by a statement that it has been prepared  Gyogyszeripari   R P C    or with a method for preparation which does not work  SKF   R P C     The

relevant to the question of anticipation under the   Act  and the   Act  for that matter   That is not to recognise a special class of patents the reference to a selection patent is a convenient shorthand to pick up the relevant principles concerning anticipation  I approach the United Kingdom cases from and including EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR   with caution  I must also endeavour to keep separate questions of anticipation  on the one hand  and obviousness  on the other  The distinction is not always easy to discern in the authorities on this topic  including the seminal judgment of Maugham J   There is a question as to whether the selection patent principles apply to a compound specifically identified in the early specification as a member of the larger class  eg as an example or derivative  or whether it is restricted to the express identification  for the first time  of a particular member of the larger class with the special characteristic  The latter was conceded by the patentee in EI Du Pont De Nemours   Co  Witsiepe s  Application   FSR    In the Court of Appeal  Buckley LJ had favoured the view that the concession was necessary   but  in the House of Lords  Lord Simon preferred to leave the point open   FSR   at    I favour the view of Buckley LJ as more in accordance with the rationale as explained by Maugham J and with his description of the class as follows   IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC at    The second class comprises patents  the so called selection patents  based on a selection of related compounds such as the homologues and substitution derivatives of the original compounds which presumably have been described in general terms and claimed in the originating patent   The third proposition was explained by Maugham J in IG Farbenindustrie AG s Patents     RPC   as follows  at    If there are five thousand possible members of the group  and a hundred have been selected as possessing some new and definite advantage  it is not intended to assert that such a selection patent would be bad if it were shown as the result of further research that there existed another hundred members possessing the same advantage  If  on the other hand  it were to be established that there were a thousand unselected members which possessed the same advantage  I doubt very much whether the patent could be sustained  The quality must be of a special character  It must not be one which those skilled in the art will expect to find in a large number of the members  It would be rash to attempt a closer definition  for the question is ultimately one of appreciation  Returning to the same old fashioned metaphor I would say that the citadel must be defended  and that there is no reward if the gates have been opened at the first blast of the trumpet      I will summarise the conclusion at which I have arrived by saying that in a selection patent the inventive step lies in the selection for a useful and special property or characteristic adequately defined  and this is the proposition which has to be kept in mind in considering the application to amend and the Petition for revocation   It is difficult to see how this patent could have been valid without disclosing the starting point or the master patent in the specification  To do so would have amounted to obtaining the patent on a false suggestion or representation within the meaning of s  k  of the   Act or be in breach of s  a  of that Act by not describing the invention  see Sami S Svendsen Inc v Independent

submitted that enabling disclosure  not mere disclosure  is required for anticipation  citing  most recently  Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd   FCA   at     and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham  Paroxetine Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC    By way of introduction  it is worth remarking that the phrase  enabling disclosure  was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc   UKHL       RPC         IPR    That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the   United Kingdom Act  based upon the European Patent Convention  but did not concern the question of anticipation  The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was  supported  by the earlier specification  That is a concept similar to  but narrower than  whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law  cf F Hoffman La Roche   Co AG v Commissioner of Patents   HCA         CLR     CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    It may be accepted that  in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula  in order to be valid  the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured  s    The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK s Application   RPC     to which I shall return  The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but  in my opinion  has little  if any  relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula  Indeed  it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter  For a product claim  the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it   May   Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd     RPC   at      By the same token  a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty   Lord Hoffman s speech in SmithKline Beecham  Paroxetine Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC   spells out the current United Kingdom position with clarity  Under the   United Kingdom Act  disclosure  and  enablement  are separate concepts and are cumulative requirements for anticipation  although there may be circumstances where disclosure will also satisfy enablement  In my opinion  at least in relation to product claims and claims for chemical compounds by formula  this is a departure from the law of Australia and from English law as it was applied up to    I would respectfully suggest that it creates an anomalous relationship between anticipation and infringement   In the present case  the earlier patent gave Sanofi Aventis a monopoly in relation to the making and using of PCR   and its enantiomers  together or separate  even though there was no description of a method of resolving the enantiomers   I venture the view that the claimed symmetry between the disclosure requirements for validity of the earlier patent and disclosure for anticipation purposes does not exist or is anomalous in the case of a chemical compound described  adequately  by formula   Nonetheless  Lord Hoffman s speech is useful in other respects  So far as the immediate point is concerned  in dealing with disclosure  he said   SmithKline Beecham  Paroxetine Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC   at        Did the Synthon application disclose an invention which  if performed  would infringe the SB patent  Because it covered a class of chemicals defined by reference to a formula  it disclosed a myriad of compounds  each of which may be regarded as an invention  But that does not matter if one of those inventions was the crystalline PMS claimed in the patent  There seems to me no doubt that the application disclosed the existence of PMS crystals of   per cent purity and claimed that they could be made  Whether in fact they could be made is the question of enablement which I shall come to in a moment  But their existence and their advantages for pharmaceutical use were clearly disclosed in the application  And on the basis of the judge s finding of monomorphism  a PMS crystal of   per cent purity must necessarily have all the characteristics of the crystals claimed in the patent  including the IR and XRD spectra    At     he said   It follows that  whether or not it would be apparent to anyone at the time  whenever subject matter described in the prior disclosure is capable of being performed and is such that  if performed  it must result in the patent being infringed  the disclosure condition is satisfied  The flag has been planted  even though the author or maker of the prior art was not aware that he was doing so    Then  at      In the case of disclosure  when the matter relied upon as prior art consists  as in this case  of a written description  the skilled person is taken to be trying to understand what the author of the description meant  His common general knowledge forms the background to an exercise in construction of the kind recently discussed by this House in Kirin Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd   UKHL       R P C     And of course the patent itself must be construed on similar principles  But once the meanings of the prior disclosure and the patent have been determined  the disclosure is either of an invention which  if performed  would infringe the patent  or it is not  The person skilled in the art has no further part to play   The applicants contend that  in any event  the methods of resolving the enantiomers were part of the common knowledge of skilled persons in Australia at the priority date and would be applied as a matter of routine   After referring to the well known passage from General Tire   Rubber Co   RPC   at     and citing various other cases  his Honour said   Alphapharm   FCA   at      What does  enabling disclosure  mean in the context of a product claim  It means that the earlier disclosure must point unmistakeably to the   enantiomer of citalopram  as distinct from the racemate  as a drug desirable to obtain    I take  as distinct from  to mean  separately from  not  instead of  or  as opposed to   This does not include any separate requirement of enablement in accordance with SmithKline Beecham  Paroxetine Methanesulfonate  Patent   RPC   and is consistent with

patents may require special attention  but that is a matter for another day    As I said earlier  the decision of Falconer J appeared to be and  in my opinion  was  a departure from the manner in which the law of anticipation had been understood in the United Kingdom and in Australia up to that time discussedWellcome Foundation Ltd v VR Laboratories  Aust  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  An inventive step does not require any particular process of invention such as a flash of genius  However  there must be a step from one thing to another  In the case of a seminal invention  it may be from very little to something  The same might be said of any original invention  Where an inventor describes the step by reference to the starting point or base line and an end point or result  it is the inventiveness of that step that is to be judged  not  for example  the inventiveness of the base line or starting point  In making that judgment  the standard test is   whether the hypothetical addressee faced with the same problem would have taken as a matter of routine whatever steps might have led from the prior art to the invention  whether they be the steps of the inventor or not     Wellcome Foundation Ltd v VR Laboratories  Aust  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Aickin J at     The applicants submit that it would also be appropriate to inform the skilled addressee of the results of the testing of the formulations of PCR   which had taken place up to November   when the decision was made to attempt to obtain the enantiomers of PCR    In particular  that between   and   there were reports of side effects and  in particular  convulsions and death in some animals  I cannot reconcile that submission with the narrow basis upon which inventive step is being considered  It is also questionable as to whether that would be consistent with the limited use to which evidence of what the inventor knows and does can be put  cf Wellcome Foundation Ltd   HCA       CLR   per Aickin J at      The patentee chose to omit those matters from the specification   The result which might be described as unexpected in the light of the French specification was not so much the characteristics of the dextro rotatory enantiomer  which were within the expected broad range  but rather the characteristics of the levo rotatory enantiomer in particular  that it was inactive  It was common general knowledge among skilled workers in the field in Australia at the priority date that one of the two enantiomers might contain all of the activity  In my opinion  the discovery of that characteristic in this case was not so unexpected as to amount to an inventive step  Therefore  if  contrary to my opinion  claim   was novel and if it is to be considered in the light of the complete specification  then it was obvious and did not involve an inventive step   It then becomes necessary to consider claims     which I do consider novel  The specification in suit refers to the finding of salts among the mineral and organic acid salts of the dextro rotatory enantiomer   which crystallize easily  are not hygroscopic and are sufficiently water soluble as to make their use as active medicinal principals particularly advantageous   Three salts in particular are identified  hydrogen sulfate  the taurocholate and the hydrobromide  The hydrochloride had been identified as of use because it was in powder form  These compounds are the subject of claims       and    The conversion of the pure enantiomer to any of the salts was not suggested to have any particular difficulties that was described as being achieved  in standard manner  and  by means of standard methods   The specification in suit does not claim any inventive step in the method of obtaining the salts once clopidogrel was known the claims rest on the properties of the salts  Again  the critical issue is the correct starting point  If it is only common general knowledge in Australia at the priority date  then the ground of invalidity must fail  as clopidogrel was not part of that common general knowledge  On the other hand  if the starting point is that which is recounted in the specification of the patent in suit  including the racemic mix PCR   disclosed in the French patent and the dextro rotatory enantiomer  then there is at least substance in the contention that each of the claims was obvious
