SZLMZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMinister for Immigration v Eshetu   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to the alleged  harsh approach  it is useful to recall  in my opinion  observations made by Gummow J in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu   HCA         CLR   at   para     The  jurisdictional fact  upon the presence of which jurisdiction is conditioned  need not be a  fact  in the ordinary meaning of that term  The precondition or criterion may consist of various elements and whilst the phrase  jurisdictional fact  is an awkward one in such circumstances it will  for convenience be retained in what follows  In Bankstown Municipal Council v Fripp  Isaacs and Rich JJ pointed out that  with the object of preventing litigation on questions of jurisdictional fact  the legislature may introduce into the criterion elements of opinion or belief by the decision maker  Section   of the Act is an example  The prosecutor was entitled to the grant of a visa only if the Minister were  satisfied  that the prosecutor answered the description in section   citedBuck v Bavone   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  His Honour is there referring to particular sections in the Migration Act   which remain pertinent  Later in that same case  having referred with approval to observations made by Gibbs J  as he then was  in Buck v Bavone   HCA         CLR   as to ways in which satisfaction based decisions might be amenable to judicial review  Gummow J observed at page   para   This passage is consistent with the proposition that  where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ  it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at the decision in question   Those remarks seem to me to be apposite in the circumstances of this case  There were findings of fact  in part  based on questions of credibility  They seem to me to be findings that were reasonably open  That is not to say that another person hearing that same evidence might not have come to a different view  Whilst I can well understand that the Appellant might regard the findings made as indicative of a  harsh approach  in terms of legal principle  if those findings were reasonably open  it was incumbent on the part of the Federal Magistrate and is incumbent upon me to respect those findings and not interfere with them   Ground   in the notice of appeal appears to conflate what might be described as a shorthand description of a test which informs an assessment as to whether a fear of persecution for a Convention reason is  well founded  with a standard of proof that applies in civil proceedings in a court  The Tribunal though was not a court  but rather part of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth charged with reviewing on the merits a decision of another official of the Executive Government  namely the Minister s delegate   In that review and in relation to the engendering of the  satisfaction  for which the statute made provision  it was obviously in the interest of a visa applicant to introduce material  which would engender the requisite  satisfaction   In this case  as it happened  the male Appellant  who was the person who gave evidence before the Tribunal  did not engender through that evidence the requisite satisfaction  That  though  as I have said  was a product of credibility findings that were in my opinion  reasonably open for reasons that were not irrational or illogical on the part of the Tribunal   What followed from the findings of fact that the Tribunal came to make  was an absence of satisfaction that the persecution claimed by the Appellants was for a Convention reason  The consequential finding that there was no entitlement to a protection visa flowed automatically from this finding of a lack of satisfaction   Ground   in the notice of appeal alleges that the Tribunal used particular information without affording opportunity to comment  contrary to s  A of the Migration Act   As was pointed out on behalf of the Minister in submissions  an immediate difficulty with this ground  which was not cured in oral submissions on behalf of the Appellants  was an absence of particularisation of just what the  information  used by the Tribunal was citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In oral submissions in respect of this ground  the male Appellant referred to a finding on the part of the Tribunal to allow him to identify his fear  That though did not amount to a particularisation of the  information  which ought to have been put to him and his wife  In dealing with s  A   the learned Federal Magistrate made reference to what was said by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR   at para    It was there observed that  information   does not encompass the tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes or determinations     nor does it extend to identified gaps  defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps  etc    Regard to that passage and to the Tribunal s reasons shows that there was no occasion for the Tribunal before making its decision to send to the Appellants a notice identifying information so as to comply with s  A   There were other grounds advanced in oral submissions  Reference was made to confusion on the part of the male Appellant in the proceeding before the Tribunal and to translation difficulties  As the Federal Magistrate rightly apprehended s   of the Migration Act required the Tribunal to provide an interpreter when a visa applicant was unable to give evidence without one  The learned Magistrate at para   of his reasons cites authority pertinent in that regard  His Honour also appreciated that an absence of adequate interpretation of proceedings might yield a violation of s   of the Migration Act in that the hearing conducted by the Tribunal would not be  real and meaningful   Again  at para   of his Honour s reasons  pertinent authority for this proposition is cited   As the learned Magistrate rightly apprehended however  to make out such a challenge very particular evidence is needed  None was offered by the Appellants in the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate  And there was nothing before me which would in any way have engendered a consideration of whether fresh evidence on such a subject could  or should  be allowed to be advanced on the hearing of the appeal   There was also reference before me and it seems before the Federal Magistrate  to the nature of the hearing opportunity which was extended to the Appellants by the Tribunal  That opportunity in the end took the form of a hearing via video link from the police station at Griffith  That opportunity had been extended by the Tribunal after the male Appellant had signified to the Tribunal a difficulty based on illness in attending in person at Sydney  The appeal book contains in it a note by an officer of the Tribunal prior to the video link hearing to ask whether the male Appellant was attending the hearing tomorrow  According to the note he confirmed that he would be attending  There is nothing in that note  or in the Tribunal s reasons  to indicate that either when that contact was made  or at the hearing itself  any difficulty in relation to the Appellant s wife s attendance based on a fear of being present at a police station was put forward  Nor  it should be stated  is there any reference in the Tribunal s reasons of any complaint being voiced about the quality of interpretation which was offered at the hearing  Instead  in terms of evidence  one is left to look to the Tribunal s reasons  which do not on their face disclose any difficulty being noted either in respect of the attendance of the female Appellant or in translation  Section   of the Migration Act certainly requires when it is sought the extension to a visa applicant of a real and meaningful hearing  On the evidence  and I emphasise on the evidence  this is what the Tribunal did in this case   In short then  whether one approaches this matter by reference to the formal grounds of appeal or other matters of complaint which emerged in the course of oral and written submissions on behalf of the Appellants  there is no merit in the challenge made to the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  The appeal must therefore be dismissed   The orders that I make formally are     The appeal is dismissed      The Appellants are to pay the First Respondent s costs of and incidental to the appeal which are fixed in the amount of     I certify that the
