AZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAppellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe line between a claim apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal and a claim which depends for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal may not always be easy to detect  However  I think it is clear on which side of the line this case falls because the case now put is quite a different one to the case put to the Tribunal  In my respectful opinion  the words of Gleeson CJ in Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     are apposite     Proceedings before the Tribunal are not adversarial  and issues are not defined by pleadings  or any analogous process  Even so  this Court has insisted that  on judicial review  a decision of the Tribunal must be considered in the light of the basis upon which the application was made  not upon an entirely different basis which may occur to an applicant  or an applicant s lawyers  at some later stage in the process  In applying the relevant principles to the facts  it is worth repeating the facts as to how the appellant has formulated his claims at various stages  In this application for a protection visa  the appellant claimed that he had a well founded fear of persecution because he was a male member of his family and he was at risk of being killed by members of an opposing family  A blood feud had arisen as a result of disputes over land ownership  Before the Tribunal  the appellant claimed that he had a well founded fear of persecution because    he is a member of a particular social group  male Albanian child  and will suffer persecution because of that membership  or    he is a member of a particular social group  Kulak  landowner  family  and he will suffer persecution because of that membership  or    he has an imputed political opinion by reason of his membership of the group referred to in   and he will suffer persecution because of that political opinion   Before the Federal Magistrates Court  the appellant maintained the claims he had made before the Tribunal  In essence  the appellant s submission was that the Tribunal erred in not making findings as to whether there were particular social groups properly described as  male Albanian child  and  Kulak  landowner  family   That submission was rejected  On appeal to this Court  the appellant reformulated his claim  As I understood his submission  he accepts that he is now putting his claim on the ground that he has a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group consisting of his family  and that s  S of the Act must be considered  The appellant also accepts that his well founded fear of persecution arises because of events surrounding the conduct of Uncle Ded on   April    The appellant s argument is put in this way  The relevant family member for the purposes of a consideration of the effect of s  S is Uncle Ded  However  he has a Convention reason for his fear of persecution because he fears persecution for reasons of his membership of a particular social group  being  Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property   The submission is that there was no reason to disregard Uncle Ded s fear of persecution  and no reason to disregard the appellant s fear of persecution  It followed that the appellant s fear of persecution arose because of his membership of a particular social group  being his family  The Tribunal failed to consider this claim and thereby fell into jurisdictional error  There are a number of reasons why the appellant s argument must be rejected  First  the appellant  with legal assistance and the advantage of the Tribunal s decision in relation to his parents  claims  formulated social groups for the purpose of the Tribunal hearing that were quite different from those formulated in this appeal  Namely  they did not relate to his family and the actions of one particular member of the family  The social groups formulated by the appellant avoided altogether  in terms of the formulation of the social group  an examination of the appellant s family and the actions of one particular member of the family  This point is not decisive  but it is a relevant consideration citedApplicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSecondly  the particular social group now formulated by the appellant seems to me to be somewhat artificial and it must be questionable whether it comprises a cognisable group in the community  see Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR    It is artificial because it is very general and because it seems to me it could be formulated in a number of other ways  Clearly  it is not my role to decide these issues  but the fact that they arise is clearly relevant to whether the claim was apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal  They suggest it was not referred toAZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThis is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  AZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    On   November   that Court dismissed an application for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal   The appellant is a male child who was born on   June    He was born in Australia and  by reason of the fact that his parents are Albanian nationals  his nationality is Albanian  Throughout the administrative and legal processes which followed his application for a Protection  Class XA  visa  protection visa  his father has acted on his behalf  The appellant lodged an application for a protection visa on   June    On   July   his application was refused by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  He applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate s decision  In a decision handed down on   December   the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa to the appellant  On the application made by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs  a federal magistrate held that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error  and dismissed the application  The application by the appellant s parents for protection visasdiscussedDranichnikov v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBefore the federal magistrate  the appellant contended that the Tribunal member had made two errors  First  she had not determined at the outset whether the particular social groups advanced by the appellant were particular social groups for the purposes of the Convention and therefore she had not followed the steps laid down in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    This error was not said by the appellant to be fatal of itself  but when combined with other errors it was significant  As I understand the federal magistrate s reasons  he accepted that the Tribunal had not made findings about these matters  but he held that this had not led to jurisdictional error  Secondly  it was submitted that the Tribunal member had erred in not undertaking an examination of whether there was a causative link between the fear and the motive for persecution  The Tribunal had failed to consider the evidence relevant to the objective ascertainment of the motives of those who were responsible for the persecution  In rejecting the appellant s argument  the federal magistrate said     The Tribunal expressly considered the claim that the applicant fears harm as a result of being a child in Albania  It evaluated the evidence presented by the parents on behalf of that claim and examined the country information as well and came to a conclusion that the risks presented to the child stemmed from the blood feud  I can readily conceive of cases where dealing with the subjective element and then the nexus between that and the convention related harm simply upon the basis of an attribution to the child of parental fears would give rise to a jurisdictional error  They would be circumstances where  for example  there was material before the Tribunal providing an objective basis for the fear which is attributed to the child being held for a convention related reason  The only material available to the Tribunal here was either country information that did not relate to convention related persecution or material that indicated that the perceived harm arose from the existence of the blood feud and its consequences     The grounds of appeal to this Court The original notice of appeal contained five grounds of appeal  Shortly prior to the hearing  the appellant forwarded to the Court an amended notice of appeal which raised three further grounds of appeal  The three further grounds of appeal were that the federal magistrate erred in not holding that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error by reason of     e  finding that the  other member  of the family of the Appellant for the purposes of s  S a  of the Migration Act    Uncle Ded  did not suffer fear or persecution for a Convention reason  see Tribunal decision page     AB          Particulars     The Uncle was a member of the particular social group of Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property  He feared persecution for reason of membership of that particular social group  and further feared that he would receive no protection from the Albanian State  and consequently he had a Convention reason for his fear of persecution       f  not determining that State prosecution was not available for those in danger of reprisals  when evidence had been led to that effect       g  not determining that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution  at least hypothetically  for a Convention reason  In essence  the appellant claims that the Tribunal member committed a jurisdictional error by failing to consider whether Uncle Ded had a Convention reason for his fear of persecution  namely  his membership of a particular social group  being  Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property   The Tribunal member had said that Uncle Ded s fear of persecution arose from the shooting incident and was not Convention related  Of course  there are a number of other issues in addition to the question of whether a particular social group exists for the purposes of the Convention  In Dranichnikov   Gummow and Callinan JJ said  at        At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the tribunal involves a number of steps  First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention  That determination in part at least involves a question of law  If that question is answered affirmatively  the next question  one of fact  is whether the applicant is a member of that class  There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear  whether the fear is well founded  and if it is  whether it is for a Convention reason  There is also the issue of State protection  In this case  I do not need to consider the other issues and the issue of State protection because I have reached the conclusion that the Tribunal did not err in not identifying and considering whether Uncle Ded belonged to a particular social group described as  Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property   The claim now made in relation to Uncle Ded was not expressly articulated before the Tribunal and it was not dealt with by the Tribunal  The principles concerning the Tribunal s obligation to deal with claims before it are clear  although their application may give rise to difficulties  I should say that I do not think the principles or their application differ because the claim for membership of a particular social group is made in relation to a third party  Uncle Ded  and not the appellant himself  In Dranichnikov   the Tribunal had not considered a substantial  clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts  that being whether the applicant was a member of a particular social group consisting of entrepreneurs and businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals  at     per Gummow and Callinan JJ   The Tribunal had in fact considered another question which was whether the applicant s membership of a social group being  businessmen in Russia  was a reason for persecution and relevantly nothing more  In taking that approach  the Tribunal had constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction  at     per Gummow and Callinan JJ  at     per Kirby J  at     per Hayne J   The Tribunal s obligation to consider a claim extends beyond those claims which have been clearly articulated  The question of the extent of the Tribunal s obligation to consider a claim not clearly articulated before it was considered in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         FCR    The Full Court of this Court  Black CJ  French and Selway JJ  said  at     and        The review process is

precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal  Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal        Although such a claim might have been seen as arising on the material before the Tribunal it did not represent  in any way   a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts  in the sense in which that term was used in Dranichnikov   A judgment that the Tribunal has failed to

ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe appellant had legal assistance in relation to his application to the Tribunal for review  His legal advisers wrote to the Tribunal on   September    In their letter  they said that the appellant accepted that  as a result of the High Court s decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR     the appellant could not claim refugee status on the basis that he is a member of the particular social groups described as  Albanian citizens who are subject to the customary law  or  the  X  family  which are at risk of persecution because of a blood feud  I use the letter  X  in lieu of the name of the appellant s family  On the appellant s behalf  his legal advisers submitted that he was a refugee on the following grounds  that he is a member of the particular social group being a  male Albanian child  and will suffer persecution because of that membership  that he is a member of the particular social group being a  Kulak  landowner  family  and will suffer persecution because of that membership  or his imputed political opinion as a member of a Kulak family  The appellant s legal advisers submitted that  although Albanian law does not uphold traditional or customary law  the Albanian authorities are unwilling and unable to protect the appellant from the risk of harm which he faces if he returns to that country  The Tribunal member said that the direct cause of the blood feud was the act of Uncle Ded shooting at members of the Lleshi and Biba families and not for any other reason  The fear of harm resulted from the blood feud and the blood feud would not have arisen without the occurrence of the shooting incident  The Tribunal member said that Uncle Ded s fear of reprisals was for the shooting incident and is not Convention related  As the fear held by the appellant s family member was not Convention related  the threshold question in s  S a  was satisfied  The Tribunal member said     Therefore  in accordance with subsection  S b  any fear of persecution on the basis of being a member of the  X  family on the basis of the shooting incident must be disregarded under section  S of the Act      As found by the majority in the High Court in STCB v MIMIA   Anor   HCA   at   in similar circumstances  and acknowledged by the representative  in these circumstances  s  S is fatal to a claim that the applicant fears persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group that consists of his family  The Tribunal member said that she did not need to decide if there were particular social groups of the kind advanced by the appellant  male Albanian child  or  Kulak family  because  in light of her findings of fact  membership of those  groups  could not be the reason for the fear of harm  She said that the shooting incident triggered the blood feud which in turn is the reason for the fear of harm  The Tribunal member concluded that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and she was not satisfied that the appellant came within Article  A  of the Refugees Convention  The federal magistrate s reasons Thirdly  the appellant submitted that Uncle Ded s conduct was clearly not criminal and that a purpose behind the introduction of s  S was to remove the potential for criminal families to otherwise claim refugee status   STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    However  the evidence before the Tribunal was at the very least equivocal as to whether Uncle Ded s conduct constituted a criminal act  It is true that he was not charged by the police over the shooting incident  but the evidence suggests that Uncle Ded shot at members of the Lleshi and Biba families as they were leaving the property  Again  it is clearly not my task to make findings about these issues  Again  they suggest that the claim now made was not apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal  I have considered all the circumstances and I do not think the claim now advanced was apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal  In my opinion  the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error in not considering whether there was a social group of  Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property  and whether Uncle Ded was a member of such a group  Conclusion The appeal must be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding forty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
