that they are advancing a  genuine  or  bona fide  claim   Re Capsanis  Capsanis v The Owners Strata Plan     FCA   at        It may be that the first and second formulations are intended to cover the same ground  In Brink Lockhart J treated  at   the reference to a   prima facie case   in Ebert as a reference to  a fair chance of success   The critical paragraph of the Federal Magistrates Reasons for Judgment is   which stated  As per Glew the essential element that I am required to be satisfied of is that there is a prima facie case  Before that can be established it will be necessary for a final determination as to the validity of the Deed of Assignment as the total claim depends on that effective transfer to Mr Young to enable him to mount his cross claim  If the deed of assignment is found to be defective  Mr Young has not provided a second or alternative basis for a counter claim or set off  If the secondary claim did exist independent of the Deed then the failure to raise that claim in the District Court may be estopped by the principles in the Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    If the Deed is found to be valid and effective then the  Contract Confirmations  annexed to the second affidavit of Mr Young indicates that ICM Agriculture and entities other than AAC or its nominees have breached the licence agreement  As there has been no challenge as to the admissibility of those documents I am satisfied that a claim would exist and that Mr Young has a prima facie case for damages  The Federal Magistrate s reference to  Contract Confirmations  is a reference to seven documents so named by which ICM sold Kabuli Chickpeas to Agrinational Pty Ltd over the period   to   August    The  prima facie  claim for damages referred to is no doubt a claim for damages by AAC for breach by ICM of clauses       and   of the Grower s Licence  referred to at       above  In sum  the Federal Magistrate noted  without attempting to resolve  the issue of the validity of the assignment  and considered that ICM s sale of the chickpeas raised a prima facie case of breach of the Grower s Licence by ICM  If an attempt had been made to read the affidavit as evidence of any facts under the heading  Claim for relief  there would have been an objection and the affidavit would have been rejected  First  the affidavit was nothing more than a statement of Mr Young s  belief  his state of belief was not evidence of any of the primary facts  and was not able to satisfy the test discussed in Glew  set out at   above and   below   Second  and more importantly  if Mr Young had sworn that the allegations of fact in the statement of claim were true  his affidavit would still have been inadmissible because of the nature of the material in the statement of claim  It was an amalgam of conclusions  rather than a statement of facts  Indeed  before the Federal Magistrate Mr Young did attempt to read an affidavit sworn by him on   December   which contained in paragraphs   and   the very material that appeared under the heading  Relief claimed  in the statement of claim  When objection was taken to the two paragraphs  they were not read  Counsel then appearing for Mr Young  not the Counsel who appeared for him on the present appeal  said that the non reading of them was of little consequence at that stage because he proposed to tender the statement of claim which would show the monetary value of the counter claim  Counsel appears to have thought that it sufficed to show how the counter claim was calculated  In Glew   immediately following   and   quoted by the Federal Magistrate and set out at   above  I said  In Brink Lockhart J said  at   that the Court is not required to  undertake a preliminary trial of the counter claim  set off or cross demand   But  clearly  the application of the criteria above requires the Court to make some kind of preliminary assessment  though obviously not to determine the counter claim  set off or cross demand finally  And in Guss v Johnstone   HCA         ALR     Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ stated  at     The state of satisfaction referred to in s  g    and s     involves weighing up considerations as to the legal and factual merit of the claim relied upon by the debtor  and the justice of allowing the bankruptcy proceedings to go ahead or requiring them to await the determination of the claim     Plainly  in order to  satisfy  the Court for the purposes of par  g  the debtor is not required to prove  as on a final hearing  the asserted entitlement to recover from the creditor  Accordingly  evidence tendered on an application to set aside is to be tested for admissibility  not as if the proceeding were one in which the debtor s claim was being finally determined  but by reference to the question whether the Court should be satisfied that the debtor has a claim deserving to be finally determined   Perhaps little more can usefully be said than that a debtor must satisfy the Court that there is sufficient substance to the counter claim  set off or cross demand asserted to make it one which the debtor should  in justice  be permitted to have heard and determined in the usual way  rather than be forced to comply with the bankruptcy notice by payment or to commit an act of bankruptcy    Mr Young s supposed affidavit verifying the material quoted at   above could not even begin properly to satisfy the Federal Magistrates Court that Mr Young had a counter claim against ICM in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of ICM s judgment against him  Mr Young submits that the point raised by the first ground of appeal was not raised before the Federal Magistrate until closing submissions  by which time it was too late for it to be raised  The notice stating grounds of opposition to the application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice stated as a ground that Mr Young did not have a prima facie counter claim  set off or counter demand  sic   within the meaning of s  g  of the  Bankruptcy Act   In order to be within s  g    a counter claim  set off or cross demand must be for an amount that is equal to or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt  Accordingly  there is no substance in Mr Young s argument that the point was raised too late below  ICM s first ground of appeal succeeds  subject to resolution of Mr Young s application to lead evidence on the appeal  see   below   Ground  a  Did the alleged counter claim have insufficient legal or factual merit appliedHadley v Baxendale     Exch   ER  First  even if all of the facts and conclusions referred to in Mr Young s District Court statement of claim were proved  he would have failed because his claim as formulated does not fit within either the first or second limb of Hadley v Baxendale     Exch     ER   see Castle Constructions Pty Ltd v Fekala Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at      The leading of evidence of value on the appeal would not have overcome this problem  A complete reformulation of the alleged counter claim would have been necessary  Second  in so far as AAC s losses are said to relate to  Royalties Due and Payable  in accordance with the Sublicence  those losses could not properly be said to have been caused by a breach of the Grower s Licence by ICM  They were caused by the insolvency of Namoi  It will be recalled that a voluntary administrator was appointed to Namoi on   July   only four days after Mr Young wrote his letter of   July   on the letterhead of Namoi  The creditors of Namoi passed a special resolution for the winding up of the company on   August    For the two reasons last given  Mr Young could not have properly satisfied the Federal Magistrate that ICM was liable to AAC  I acknowledge that the second reason relates to only   of the total counter claim of    The balance of   still exceeds  just  the amount of the Bankruptcy Notice of      Ground  b  the validity of the assignmentfollowedMonk v The

FCR   at     Daley    The circumstances of the present case are analogous to those in Monk in which the assignee s interest was that of obtaining a set off against a judgment debt  In that case  Cohen J said  at     The plaintiff s only apparent interest is in the possibility of his becoming a creditor of the Bank  That is  his interest is in using the debt which might arise from the cause of action for his personal benefit  That no doubt is the interest of any assignee  The using of the debt as a set off against the judgment debt is merely an example of obtaining some personal benefit  In that regard the plaintiff is in no stronger position than he would be if he had obtained an assignment of a cause of action for negligence by a customer of the Bank who claimed to have suffered injuries arising from unsafe premises  In the authorities where the Trendtex test has been applied  the commercial interest has gone beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings and has required an interest by the assignee in the assignor or its business affairs or activities which the assignment may in some way protect     These observations are applicable

Daley   the debtor  Mr Daley was a director and the sole beneficial shareholder of certain companies  and had guaranteed their liability to a bank  The bank had a judgment against Mr Daley on credit

had  allegedly wrongfully  honoured  That company  for a consideration of     assigned  the Debt  to Mr Daley  Daley is distinguishable because  first  Mr Young was not a guarantor of AAC  second  what was assigned in Daley was a debt rather than a bare cause of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract as in the present case  and  third  Mr Daley was the sole shareholder in the assignor  At the date of the assignment  Mr Young held no shares in AAC  As noted at     above  it is agreed that the appeal is to be determined on the basis that at the time of the assignment Young s

cited Re Daley  ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd     FCR   at     Daley   citedTrendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC  I referred to cl   at   above  Clause   was as follows    The Licensor or their agent shall sell the seed or product delivered to it by the grower  or otherwise subject to this agreement  via the payment schedule as per attachment     Clause   appears to be a promise by AAC to ICM that AAC or Namoi will sell seed and product delivered to  it  by ICM  via the payment schedule as per attached   It is common ground that at least the form of the Commercial Crop Contract was attached  There is a sort of payment schedule in cl   of the Commercial Crop Contract  That clause listed  Guaranteed Minimum Prices  promised to ICM as the grower  It appears that either AAC was  through its agent Namoi  a party to the Commercial Crop Contract as a principal whose existence and identity were not disclosed on the face of that document  or at least the agent Namoi entered into the Commercial Crop Contract in its own right but AAC approved of its doing so as the necessary and contemplated means of implementing the Grower s Licence  Even on the latter basis  it is arguable that AAC was bound by Mr Young s conduct on behalf of Namoi in the discussion on   May    The date fixed for completion of the Commercial Crop Contract    June   was not intended to be of the essence of that contract  I mean that ICM was not entitled immediately following   June to terminate the contractual relationship for Namoi s failure to pay on that date  This is demonstrated by the second and last sentences of cl  c   The whole of cl  c  is as follows    Subject to normal seasonal conditions  delivery and payment under this contract is to be completed prior to   June    If due to extraneous circumstances by either party that this contract is not completed by this date then mediation with regards to settlement terms must occur  A suggestion is that if the Grower is deemed to be at fault they would not charge the Licensor carry  storage  from this date and the credit limit in place would be renegotiated  If the Licensor is deemed to be at fault then a negotiated percentage of the balance of the products to be paid at this date  The present case concerns an assignment of a bare cause of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract  not of a property
