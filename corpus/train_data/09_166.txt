two Notices purporting to be notices under this section were given to the Attorneys General of the States  No notice was required to be given to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth because the Minister is a party to the proceedings  see s  B b  and see Inglis v Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia   HCA         CLR   at      The first Notice is not now relied upon  The second Notice is dated   August   and was filed in the Registry of the Court on   August    It was served soon after  Every State  except Victoria  expressly declined to intervene  The State of Victoria has not expressly indicated a position  one way or the other  That State did not  however  seek leave to intervene in or be joined as a party to the proceedings appliedfollowedJohnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn order to deal with the applicant s argument  it is necessary to understand the statutory framework within which the decisions under challenge were made  French J  as he then was  summarised the relevant provisions at   to    pp     in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   as follows  The statutory basis for the Minister s decision is to be found in s   of the Migration Act which provides    The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if     a  the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test  and    b  the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test      This is to be read in conjunction with s   and s    Relevantly  those subsections provide      For the purposes of this section  a person does not pass the character test if     a  the person has a substantial criminal record  as defined by subsection           For the purposes of the character test  a person has a substantial criminal record if           c  the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of   months or more          As the present application raises the question whether or not the applicant was the holder of a  absorbed persons visa  under the Act it is necessary to have regard to the provisions of the Act and Regulations relating to that class of visa  The Migration Act   provided originally for entry into Australia to be regulated by entry permits to be granted by officers of the Department of Immigration  s    Such permits could be cancelled by the Minister  in his absolute discretion   s    The Act also provided for the deportation of aliens and immigrants under various conditions  ss   and    The Migration Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  enacted comprehensive amendments which included new provisions for the control of entry into Australia involving entry permits and visas  That system of control was succeeded by a visa only system introduced by the Migration Reform Act    Cth  which was passed in November    The relevant provisions of that amending legislation came into operation on   September   for a more detailed account of this history see NAAV v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at   to    Under the Act as it stood prior to   September   and by virtue of s     an immigrant who entered Australia without an entry permit became a prohibited immigrant  Section     however  relieved from the operation of those provisions an immigrant entering Australia without an entry permit being   e  A person who    i  is for the time being exempted  by instrument under the hand of the Minister  from the requirements of this Division relating to entry permits  or   ii  is included in a class of persons who are for the time being so exempted not being a person in respect of whom a declaration is in force under the next succeeding subsection    There was an exemption which applied to persons entering Australia from New Zealand who were not required to hold an entry permit  This means that at the time Mr Johnson and his family entered Australia they were not required to hold entry permits and were not prohibited immigrants    The effect of the amendments to the Act which came into operation on   September   was that all non citizens in the migration zone were required to hold a visa  Transitional provisions in relation to New Zealand citizens in Australia were provided for in regulations  Regulation   of the Migration Reform  Transitional Provisions  Regulations   provided    This sub regulation applies to a non citizen who     a  is a New Zealand citizen  and    b  either     i  was in Australia lawfully immediately before   September   or   ii  was  immediately before   September   an illegal entrant because of s   of the old Act  and    c  is not taken to hold     i  a transitional visa under Part   or   or   ii  a Norfolk Island permanent resident visa under regulation   or   iii  a sub class    Diplomatic  Visa under regulation   or   iv  a special purpose visa  or   v  an absorbed person visa  and    d  was not the subject of a deportation order immediately before   September       A non citizen to whom this regulation applies is taken to have been granted a special category visa on   September         Section   of the Migration Act provides    There is a class of permanent visas to remain in  but not re enter Australia  to be known as absorbed person visas      A non citizen in the migration zone who     a  on   April   was in Australia  and    b  before that date had ceased to be an immigrant  and    c  on or after that date  has not left Australia  where left Australia has the meaning it had in this Act before   September   and    d  immediately before   September   was not a person to whom s   of this Act as in force then applied     is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on   September       Subdivisions AA  AB  AC  other than s     AE and AH do not apply in relation to absorbed person visas  I respectfully agree with and adopt his Honour s summary  At the time when the applicant and her mother entered Australia  neither of them was required to hold an entry permit and neither of them was a prohibited immigrant  Further  by reason of the amendments to the Act which came into operation on   September   if the applicant did not thereby become the holder of an absorbed person visa   she was    taken to have been granted a special category visa on   September    Thus  in the case of the applicant  by the operation of the amendments to the Act which came into force on   September   she was either   a  The holder of an absorbed person visa   or   b  The holder of a special category visa   Despite the inconsistent positions adopted by the applicant  if the applicant did not hold an absorbed person visa at all times from   September   then the delegate has purported to cancel a visa of a kind not held by the applicant at the time when the delegate s decision was made  In that event  the delegate will not have exercised the Minister s cancellation power with respect to the visa actually held by the applicant  per French J in Johnson   FCA       FCR   at    pp      Such a purported exercise of that power in those circumstances would involve jurisdictional error because the delegate will not have addressed the actual question which s   of the Act required her to address  A decision infected by jurisdictional error of that kind would be wholly invalid and of no effect  If the hypotheses outlined in   above are correct  then the same reasoning would lead to a conclusion that the Tribunal has also committed jurisdictional error when it made its decision on   December    It is therefore necessary to determine whether the applicant should be taken to have held an absorbed person visa as at   September   and at all times thereafter  In Johnson   FCA       FCR   at   to    pp     French J reviewed a number of authorities which dealt with the statutory criterion      ceased to be an immigrant before   April          s  b  of the Act   At   to    pp     his Honour said  The general statements made about the concept of absorption offer little in the way of practical guidance for determining whether a person has become part of the community  either as an adult or as a minor who comes in with a family unit  In Koon Wing Lau v Calwell   Dixon J said  at        there does not appear to be any general agreement as to the tests for the application of this very vague conception    The word  absorption  is an evaluative metaphor which invites consideration of a variety of factors relevant to its application  It is important to bear in mind also that it is a metaphor used in aid of the resolution of a question of constitutional fact  namely whether the person to whom it is applied has ceased to be an immigrant  The metaphor must not obscure the primary question   Having regard to the primary question  factors relevant to whether a person has become a member of the Australian community in the way that that concept was discussed in Potter v Minahan might be thought to include the following  The time that has elapsed since the person s entry into Australia  The existence and timing of the formation of an intention to settle permanently in Australia  The number and duration of absences  Family or other close personal ties in Australia  The presence of family members in Australia or the commitment of family members to come to Australia to join the person  Employment history  Economic ties including property ownership  Contribution to  and participation in  community activities  Any criminal record   This list of factors is plainly not exhaustive  Rather  it illustrates the multi dimensional character of the judgment involved  It is also necessary in making that judgment to avoid narrow mono cultural assumptions about what constitutes membership of the Australian community  This may not always make the judgment an easy one    see generally D Wood   Deportation  The Immigration Power and Absorption into the Australian Community      Fed Law Rev     In the case of a child coming to Australia as part of a family unit it is necessary to apply the judgment about membership of the community to the child s parents or other adult guardians or carers with whom he or she has come and with whom he or she lives  At the time relevant to the present case Mr Johnson was aged nine years  It is therefore necessary to have regard to the evidence about his parents  migration to  and settlement in  this country and their position in April    I also respectfully agree with these observations made by his Honour and propose to follow the approach taken by his Honour in Johnson   FCA       FCR    This approach was expressly approved by a Full Court of this Court in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR   at   to    pp     and by Branson J in Charlie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR   at   and    A non citizen who has lawfully entered Australia and has been absorbed into the Australian community ceases to be an immigrant and passes beyond the scope of the immigration power  per French J in Johnson   FCA       FCR   at    p    In this sense  the question of absorption involves the determination of a constitutional fact  In the present case  as I have already said  the applicant came to Australia with her mother on   September    By   April   the applicant had resided in Australia continuously for approximately four and a half years  By that date  she was almost six years old  I have already referred to the evidence concerning the question of whether the applicant s parents were living together as at September    as to which see   to   above   However  the applicant made statements  both to the delegate and to the Tribunal  about certain facts  matters and events which she could remember having taken place in the early years after her arrival in Australia  The broad thrust of that general evidence was that her parents were more or less together in the early years after their arrival in    According to the applicant  the applicant  her parents and her siblings lived as a family unit in those years  The applicant also submitted that I should apply what her Counsel called an implied statutory bar of five years before an immigrant is capable of being absorbed into the Australian community  This submission was founded upon some remarks made by Deane J by way of obiter dicta in Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR         FLR     In my view  there is no such implied bar  French J in Johnson   FCA       FCR   did not invoke such a bar  The other members of the Court in Kuswardana   ALR       FLR   itself did not expressly agree with the dictum of Deane J  In my view  the application of such a bar  as an inflexible rule  introduces into the consideration of the criterion found in s  b  of the Act an unnecessary and inappropriate level of rigidity  For example  it would mean that in every case where the relevant non citizen had arrived after   April   a finding would need to be made that  by reason of this fact alone  absorption had not occurred  In my judgment  as a matter of construction of the Act  no implied probationary period is prescribed  Ground    The Lack of Independent Mind Ground citedKuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR         FLR  The applicant also submitted that I should apply what her Counsel

cases cth FCA  htmlThis ground is based upon the reasoning of Emmett J in Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  No       ALD     FCA   especially at   to    I do not think that this ground has been made out  A fair reading of the Tribunal s reasons as a whole demonstrates that it asked itself the right question  that is to say  that it put itself in the position of the primary decision maker and exercised for itself the discretion reposed in it  In my view  it appropriately approached the decision which it was called upon to make as requiring it to decide whether or not to exercise the discretion to cancel  Therefore  in my view  the Tribunal did not fall into error  For these reasons  I am of the view that Ground   has not been made out appliedfollowedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC   FCAFC         FCR    at   a Full Court of this Court held that  for the purposes of s   of the Act  actual notification to an applicant of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal must be accomplished by physical delivery to the applicant personally of a written statement prepared by the Refugee Review Tribunal in accordance with s    The language of s   is relevantly identical to the language of s  A   In the case of the Tribunal  the only statutory prescription for the giving of notification of its decision to a party to the proceedings before it is s  AA  In terms of the reasoning applied by the Full Court in SZKKC   FCAFC       FCR     that provision is a deeming provision  Applying the reasoning of the Full Court in that case  providing notice of the Tribunal s decision by post in accordance with s  AA would be ineffective for the purposes of s   and also for the purposes of s  A  No regulations have been passed which prescribe the manner in which a decision is to be notified for the purposes of s  A  as to which  see s  A   Therefore  what is required in the present case for the notification required by s  A is that a hard copy of the Tribunal s decision must be physically handed to the applicant personally  As I have already said  at   and   above  on the evidence before me  the Minister has failed to prove that a hard copy of the Tribunal s decision was ever handed to the applicant personally  Therefore  the Minister s objection to competency fails appliedfollowedMoore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR  I also respectfully agree with these observations made by his Honour and propose to follow the approach taken by his Honour in Johnson   FCA       FCR    This approach was expressly approved by a Full Court of this Court in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     FCR

decision of the High Court in Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR    In that case  the High Court held that  for the purposes of the Act  the expression      decision made under the  Migration  Act       did not include a decision which was infected by jurisdictional error  In that case  the Court referred to such decisions as      decisions purportedly made under the Act        It may be that the effect of the   amendments to the Act is to deprive s  B of the Judiciary Act of any role to play in the judicial review by this Court of migration decisions and to confine applicants who seek such relief to the remedies provided by s  A of the Act  In the present case  for reasons which I will explain below  I do not need to decide this question and expressly refrain from doing so  I will proceed to deal with the jurisdiction question upon the basis that the remedies potentially available to the applicant are confined to those afforded by s  A of the Act  Section  A is in the following terms     A Time limits on applications to the Federal Court     An application to the Federal Court for a remedy to be granted in exercise of the court s original jurisdiction under paragraph  A b  or  c  in relation to a migration decision must be made to the court within   days of the actual  as opposed to deemed  notification of the decision     The Federal Court may  by order  extend that   day period by up to   days if   a  an application for that order is made within   days of the actual  as opposed to deemed  notification of the decision  and   b  the Federal Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so       Except as provided by subsection   the Federal Court must not make an order allowing  or which has the effect of allowing  an applicant to make an application mentioned in subsection   outside that   day period     The regulations may prescribe the way of notifying a person of a decision for the

of fact as may be required for the purpose of determining whether the applicant s application is competent or not  and for determining the applicant s latest application for leave to amend her originating process  I have found it necessary to read and to consider all of the documents in the Court file  including the transcript of directions hearings and including those documents which evidence communications between Registry staff  on the one hand  and the applicant and persons assisting her  on the other hand   I will make clear in the next section of these Reasons what regard  if any  I have paid to this material  The Procedural History of the Present Proceedings The Tribunal s decision is dated   December   and was handed down on that day  As I have already said  there is no first hand evidence before me as to whether and  if so  when and in what manner that decision was actually notified to the applicant  In particular  there is no evidence from a witness or in the materials before me that the applicant attended before the Tribunal on   December   or that she was handed a physical or hard copy of the Tribunal s decision or reasons on that day or  indeed  at any other time  The evidence before me is silent as to these matters  There are documents in the Court file which provide a basis for drawing certain inferences as to the course of events which have led to the present application before me  However  in my judgment  that material does not provide any reliable foundation for drawing an inference that the applicant was ever handed by anyone by way of physical delivery a copy of the Tribunal s decision or of its reasons  I will now set out my reasons for this conclusion  In WACB   HCA       ALR       ALJR     the High Court held that similar words in s   of the Act  in the form in which it stood before   when applied to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made pursuant to the Act  required the physical delivery to the applicant personally of the written statement  ie a hard copy thereof  which the Refugee Review Tribunal was required to prepare and to give to the parties pursuant to s   of the Act
