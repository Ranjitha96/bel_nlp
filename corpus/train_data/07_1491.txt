Mitchelson v Health Insurance Commission   Ors  No      FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMitchelson v Health Insurance Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Notice of Appeal filed on   May   purports on its face to be an appeal to the court in its original jurisdiction from a decision of either a  Professional Services Review Committee   the PSR Committee  or a  Determining Authority   the Authority  established in accordance with ss   and   of the Health Insurance Act    Cth   the Act  and s  Q of the Act respectively  For the reasons indicated in Mitchelson v Health Insurance Commission   FCA     that document entirely fails as a document originating a proceeding as an appeal from a decision of either body  as no appeal lies to the court from such a decision   However  as noted in the earlier Mitchelson decision  the document seeks to challenge the decision of the Authority on the ground that the Authority erred by failing to take into account relevant considerations in reaching its decision  That contention seems to be an attempt to enliven a ground of challenge that the making of the decision is an improper exercise of the power conferred by the Health Insurance Act    see s  e  and s  b  of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth ADJR Act  and possibly on other grounds   On   August  the court refused leave to amend the Notice of Appeal in terms of the amended application and made a direction that  the applicant in the proceedings file and serve an Application supported by appropriate material for leave to amend the document described as the  Notice of Appeal  filed on   May   so as to properly formulate having regard to identified grounds and particulars of those grounds  an Application for an Order of Review of an identified decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act    Mitchelson    By   August  the second time the question arose    days had elapsed since Dr Mitchelson had received the decision material  Plainly enough  within that time  Dr Mitchelson ought to have been able to formulate precise grounds of challenge to the Authority s decision and the material facts in support of those grounds especially having regard to the statutory stay effected by s  V  of the Act  The Court further directed that the application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal would be listed and heard on Tuesday   September   at     am  When the matter came on for hearing on   September  the applicant relied upon a notice of motion filed on   September which simply sought leave to amend in terms of the same document filed on   August    Dr Mitchelson has made no effort to reformulate the amended application to either identify with any precision the grounds of challenge or the material facts giving content and expression to those grounds  Shortly prior to Tuesday   September  Mr Royds sought approval to appear and argue the application for leave by telephone  Mr Royds then provided a mobile telephone number to the Court as the appropriate contact telephone number  Mr Moloney appeared in Court for the respondents   Although an application in such a manner by a lawyer for a party seeking leave to amend a document such as the inadequate  Notice of Appeal  in the context of a decision of the importance to Dr Mitchelson of the Authority s decision is unsatisfactory  ultimately the matter is one for Mr Royds against the background of the earlier Orders made in the proceeding which have not been met and the perceived strength of the argument for leave  If the material filed in support of the application is clear  precise and compelling  an election to seek and obtain approval to support the application by attendance before the Court by telephone or mobile network telephone attendance  might be thought to be cost efficient since Mr Royds practices in Cairns  However  Mr Royds did not file any reformulation of the earlier amended application and by   September    days had elapsed since Dr Mitchelson had received the decision material with a continuing statutory stay of the Authority s directions   Dr Mitchelson and Mr Royds have had more than enough time beyond the statutory   days prescribed by the ADJR Act to file a proper document citedHealth Insurance Commission and Ors v Grey   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Act and particularly Part VAA has been described as  public protective  legislation which should not be narrowly interpreted as the legislation has as its object the  protection of the public    Health Insurance Commission and Ors v Grey   FCAFC         FCR     and     This is the third occasion on which the applicant s proposal to amend his proceeding has come before the Court  The applicant initially sought to challenge the decision of the Authority by filing the Notice of Appeal of   May    The grounds raised were these            The applicant appeals against the findings of the Determining Authority of   April   on the following grounds          As a matter of law erred in reaching the conclusion that they did in fact make          As a matter of law the conclusions reached was in error by failing to take into account relevant considerations          As a matter of law erred in failing to take into account relevant considerations              As a matter of law the penalty that was imposed was manifestly excessive   Sections  c  and  a  required Dr Mitchelson file an application for an order of review not later than   days after receipt by him of a decision setting out findings on material questions of fact  references to the evidence supporting those findings and reasons for the decision  Dr Mitchelson was served with the decision material on Wednesday   April    by courier delivery to Karen O Mullane  a legal representative from United Medical Protection now known as Avant Mutual Group Limited  Ms O Mullane represented Dr Mitchelson before the PSR Committee  Mr Royds is informed by Dr Mitchelson and swears to a belief that the material was received by Dr Mitchelson on   April    Accordingly  the   days provided for by the ADJR Act expired on either   May   or   May    The Notice of Appeal filed on   May   was within time although entirely devoid of any proper formulation of the grounds of review or any material facts in support of those grounds citedState of Queensland and Anor v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The overwhelming consideration however is whether the amended application as filed throws up  whether obfuscated or not  a basis for challenge to the decision of the Authority which ought fairly and properly to be entertained by the Court in the fulfilment of its ultimate aim of attaining justice between the parties to the controversy   State of Queensland and Anor v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA

Bond   HCA         CLR   at     per Deane J and Plaintiff s   v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ   Mr Royds says that Tisdall v Kelly   FCA   is authority for the proposition that a PSR Committee must include a medical practitioner from a regional area or a practitioner familiar with patients from the class or catchment from which the medical practitioner under review draws his or her patients  It seems to me that Tisdall is not authority for that proposition   There is no contention that the Committee acted beyond power in adopting a sampling methodology nor that in doing so  s  K  does not operate to bring about the result that the person is taken for the purposes of part VAA to have engaged in inappropriate practice in the provision of that proportion of the services in the class from which the sample was chosen  Nor is there a contention that the Committee acted beyond power in relying upon the advise and recommendations of Professor Nicholls  who advised that the sampling methodology adopted by the Committee for item   services is a statistically valid method  s  K   In addition  there is no challenge to reliance by the Committee upon the Health Insurance  Professional Services Review Sampling Methodology  determination    no    in accordance with s  K   In this case  the Committee has relied upon an express statutory power and acted within the limits of the power  Plainly enough  the Committee must act judicially in the sense that it must act in accordance with the requirements of procedural fairness or natural justice and not act arbitrarily  irrationally or unreasonably  It cannot be contended that the Committee has acted arbitrarily  irrationally or unreasonably by expressly acting in conformity with the statutory instrument  No doubt  that is why Deane J observed in Bond that the precise content of an obligation upon a tribunal or statutory body to observe the requirements of natural justice or procedural

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Amended Application seeks review of the decision of the Authority of   April   to make  directions  as a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment for the purposes of the ADJR Act  The Amended Application is in these terms  The applicant is aggrieved by the decision because        That the Applicant was denied natural justice             The Professional Services Review Committee did not properly apply the principles identified in Briginshaw v  Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   in reaching its findings      The grounds of the application are        The Applicant was denied natural justice in that the determining authority acted upon the draft report of a Professional Services Review Committee which was comprised of metropolitan practitioners         The Professional Services Review Committee should have had a regional practitioner experienced in the issues which face regional practitioners  particularly catering for a high number of patients from a lower socio economic group         The Professional Services Review Committee relied upon a sample of   cases out of a total of   cases  This figure represents     of the class size  the Professional Services Review Committee has not applied the Briginshaw principle correctly in that a larger sample should have been assessed         The Professional Services Review Committee acted upon inexact proof         The gravity of the consequences which flowed from the Professional Services Review Committee s findings were such that a higher level of proof was required    The Professional Services Review Committee did not consult with any of the patients the subject of the   cases to ascertain whether they were satisfied with their treatment or whether they disputed the duration of time the applicant claimed to spend with each    That in applying the Briginshaw principles the Professional Services Review Committee should have considered the nature of the client base the applicant was working with and the limited number of Bulk billing practices in regional centres          The background to the decision of the Authority is this     On   December   a request was made under the Act by the Health Insurance Commission  the Commission  of the Director of Professional Services Review to review the provision of services by Dr Mitchelson during the period specified in the request  ss   and   of the Act  and to consider whether Dr Mitchelson s conduct amounted to  inappropriate practice  for the purposes of the Act  On   July   the Director  under Division  A of Part VAA of the Act  s   elected to establish a PSR Committee and make a referral to that committee to investigate whether Dr Mitchelson had engaged in inappropriate practice in providing services described as Item   and Item   services  PSR Committee   was established under s   of the Act  Section   sets out the requirements to be satisfied by the Director in exercising the power conferred by s   and provides      Constitution of Committees         A Committee set up under section   in connection with a referral consists of the following members appointed by the Director         a  a Chairperson who is a Deputy Director  and    b    other Panel member  and            c  if subsection   applies not more than   additional Panel members               A                If the person under review is the practitioner who rendered or initiated all of the referred services the Chairperson  and the other Panel members referred to in paragraph  b  must be practitioners who belong to the profession in which the practitioner was practising when the services were rendered or initiated        If the practitioner was at that time a consultant physician in relation to a particular specialty  the Panel members referred to in paragraph  b  must also be consulting physicians in relation to that specialty        If the practitioner was at that time a specialist in relation to a particular specialty  the other Panel members referred to in paragraph  b  must also be specialists in relation to that specialty        If the practitioner was at that time a general practitioner  the other Panel members referred to in paragraph  b  must also be general practitioners        The Director may appoint an additional Panel member or additional Panel members referred to in paragraph  c  if the Director thinks it is desirable to do so in order to give the Committee a wider range of clinical expertise  having regard to the services specified in the referral        An additional Panel member must be a member of a profession or a specialty relevant to a field of practice of the practitioner  or any of the practitioners  who rendered or initiated the referred services        Any Panel member whom the Director consulted under section   in relation to the referral must not be appointed as a member of the Committee   Dr Mitchelson is said to be aggrieved by the Authority s decision first because he was  denied natural justice  and secondly  the PSR Committee did not apply the principles of Briginshaw v Briginshaw in reaching its findings  Dr Mitchelson is an  aggrieved person  because of the effect upon him of the decision  The above two contentions are a statement of the grounds on which an order of review of the decision is sought  Section  a  of the ADJR Act provides as a ground of challenge that  a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision  and s  f  provides a further ground that  the decision involved an error of law  whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision   Mr Royds says the Briginshaw point is reliant upon the s  f  ground   As to natural justice ground  paragraphs     and   of the  grounds of the application  make two points  First  the Authority relied upon a report of the PSR Committee  That committee was constituted by three doctors who each practice in a metropolitan area The PSR Committee should  it is said  have consisted of a committee one of whom at least was a regional practitioner familiar with the provision of services to patients of a  lower socio economic group   Because it did not  Dr Mitchelson was denied natural justice  Dr Mitchelson does not identify the precise content of the natural justice rule said to be breached  When put to Mr Royds that Dr Mitchelson seems to be relying on the fair hearing rule  Mr Royds agreed   Although it is not put this way  the contention seems to be that Dr Mitchelson was denied  fairness  in a proper assessment of the facts  and the formulation of a fair draft and final report of the Committee was rendered illusory due to the composition of the Committee  which  in turn  poisoned the decision of the Authority   Grounds         and   of the proposed amended application all  in one way or another  rely upon the application of the principle derived from Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR     The content of the Briginshaw point at paragraphs       and   of the amended document is this  The PSR Committee acted on inexact proof  the gravity of the consequences flowing from the PSR Committee s findings required a higher level of proof  the PSR Committee did not consult with any of the patients within the sample group  and the PSR Committee ought to have considered the nature of the client base of Dr Mitchelson and the limited number of bulk billing practices in regional centres   The PSR Committee was established to  investigate whether Dr Mitchelson engaged in appropriate practice in providing the  Referred Services  and whether Dr Mitchelson may have     failed to provide appropriate professional services to his patients    failed to satisfy the requirements of the relevant items in the MBS    failed to provide adequate clinical input into the services    provided services that were not necessary and or not clinically relevant    kept records that were deficient in the essential clinical information     Final report PSR Committee no   Subdivision B of Part VAA of the Act provides for  Proceedings of Committees   The chairperson is to convene meetings of the committee  s    The committee may regulate the proceedings of its meetings as it thinks fit  s    For the purposes of its enquiry  the committee may inform itself in any manner it thinks fit  s    A question arising at a meeting is decided by a majority of votes of members present and voting  s    The committee must hold a hearing if it appears to the committee that the person under review may have engaged in inappropriate practice in providing the referred services  s    The person under review is entitled  subject to any reasonable limitations or restrictions the committee may impose  to attend the hearing  be accompanied by a lawyer or other advisor  call witnesses to give evidence  produce written statements going to character  question persons giving evidence at the hearing  address the committee on questions of law during the hearing  and after the conclusion of the taking of evidence  make a final address to the committee on questions of law  the conduct of the hearing and the merits of the matters to which the hearing relates  s    The committee has power to require the production of relevant documents  s  A    The statutory role of the committee is investigative  It makes findings to be relied upon by the Authority in making draft and final determinations containing one or more of the directions contemplated by s  U which include repayment to the Commonwealth of the whole or part of a medical benefit paid for a service or class of services where inappropriate practice has been found and suspension for a period and or disqualification for a period from the provision of services to which medical benefits relate  The Briginshaw point seems to be that in relying on the composition and size of the sample selected and in failing to consult with patients  the proof of matters going to  inappropriate practice  was inexact and failed to attain the standard of proof a committee acting reasonably in the conduct of its proceedings ought to adopt having regard to the gravity of the possible s  U directions   The statute expressly provides that the committee in discharging its investigative function may  have regard only to a sample of the services  in a class of services where reliance on a sample is for the very purpose of testing  inappropriate practice  leading to findings likely to lead to one or more of the serious s  U directions by the Authority   The sampling methodology adopted by the committee might be that contained in a ministerial determination specifying the content and form of sampling methodologies that may be used  s  K  or a nonspecified methodology  if but only if  shown on advice to the committee to be statistically valid  by an accredited statistician   Since the Committee has acted in conformity with the Act by having regard only to a sample within the statutory constraints upon the methodology to be used  and no contention to the contrary is made  the question is whether any Briginshaw principle is engaged  Should the Committee have selected a method of fact finding other than by sampling the services  The committee must act reasonably   In order to be satisfied that Dr Mitchelson engaged in  inappropriate practice  the committee needs to reach a state of affirmative satisfaction of the foundation factual matters giving rise to that conclusion to a standard of  reasonable satisfaction   A member  acting reasonably  will not be so satisfied  independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved    Briginshaw   per Dixon J at    The seriousness of the allegation or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding must necessarily affect the judgment made by each committee member as to whether the particular issue has been established to that member s reasonable satisfaction  As Sir Owen Dixon observed  reasonable satisfaction should not be reached by  inexact proofs  indefinite testimony or indirect inferences   p     Plainly enough  the nature of the issue before the tribunal  necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained   Dixon J per     The proposed amended application simply asserts a conclusion of reliance upon inexact proof and thus  inferentially  a failure on the part of committee members to be reasonably satisfied of the relevant matters  The difficulty with that bald conclusionary assertion is that the Committee acted in conformity with the Act in circumstances where the sampling methodology was the subject of advice from an expert  Professor Nicholls  of statistical validity  Prima facie the Committee acted reasonably in conducting its investigation  No attempt has been made by Dr Mitchelson to isolate the process of reasoning in respect of any of the various sample services and demonstrate any failure on the part of the Committee  There is no reference to factual material from which  inferences  were drawn incorrectly nor reference to  indefinite testimony  or  inexactness  in any of the analyses of the sample services   As a result  the proposed amended application fails to identify a ground of challenge supported by material facts going to a ground of challenge citedSpotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International services Inc   ATPR     I am satisfied that the claims made by the applicant as formulated by the proposed amended application cannot succeed and are bound to fail in the sense identified by Bennett J in Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Services Inc   ATPR     at      Accordingly  it would be futile to grant leave to amend in terms of the proposed document  I refuse leave to amend and dismiss the applicant s notice of motion filed on   September     I have given consideration to this difficulty  I am not sure whether the failure to formulate a ground of challenge supported by material facts is a function of delay by Mr Royds or for that matter Mr Royds and Dr Mitchelson  I am satisfied that Mr Royds does not appreciate the need to comply with a time limitation contained in the principal legislation nor the need to file and serve a properly
