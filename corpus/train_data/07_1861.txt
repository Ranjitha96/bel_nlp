position within the meaning of s  K c  of the unamended Act citedCommunity and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd     IR   With respect to the submission of the CPSU and Mr McCarron that the announcement of the leave ban constituted a threat of prohibited conduct within the meaning of s   of the Act  the OEA submits that as the ban on leave was not prohibited  its announcement could not have been a threat  Further  the OEA submits that the announcement of the leave ban did not constitute a threat as it did not menace or warn of an intention to inflict harm  The OEA relies upon the observations of Finkelstein J in Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd     IR   consideredCommunity and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Full Court in Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         FCR   considered the equivalent of s  b  in the previous legislation and stated at page     It is sufficient for present purposes to say that if the prejudicial alteration is real and substantial  rather than merely possible or hypothetical  it will answer the description in s  K c    The Court is satisfied that the conduct of imposing the ban did alter the position of Mr McCarron to his prejudice as provided by s  c   The effect of the ban upon Mr McCarron was real and substantial and not merely hypothetical  see Community and Public Sector Union   FCA       FCR    A further question remains  namely was such ban imposed for a prohibited reason within the meaning of s   of the Act  To satisfy section   of the Act conduct prescribed in s   must be carried out  inter alia  because the employee is a member of an industrial association  Mr McCarron was a member of the CPSU and the NDCP was carried out under the auspices of the ACTU with the full support of the CPSU  Ms Skarratt and Mr McIlwain were aware that employees in the OEA were union members and that the NDCP was organised by the ACTU referred toCPSU  The Commonwealth and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The OEA submits that leave was approved for Mr McCarron after orders of the Full Court in CPSU  The Commonwealth and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia   FCAFC    It is submitted that because Mr McCarron attended the NDCP  his position was not altered to his prejudice   As to alleged breaches of the AWA  it is submitted that Clause   of the AWA does not provide an absolute entitlement of flex leave for an employee  Clause  a  stipulated that flex leave was  subject to operational requirements    Clause   of the Policy required  operational requirements and needs of individuals  to be taken into account when an employee and the manager were settling working arrangements  work patterns and flex leave arrangements  Clause   of the Policy required managers and supervisors to    have regard to the operational requirements of the area  the impact of granting the leave on clients and other members of the workgroup and the personal needs of the employee  when approving the use of annual leave  The OEA submits that it had regard to its operational requirements when determining to refuse further flex leave and annual leave for participation in the rally

the ban is also a relevant consideration  In Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal  Administrative Clerical and Services Union   FCA         FCR   the Full Court considered the interpretation of s  K of the unamended Act  the equivalent of s   of the current Act   At   Merkel J observed that s  K was not concerned    with the cause of the prejudicial conduct  Rather  it is concerned with the employer s reason or reasons for engaging in that conduct   emphasis in the original consideredMaritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Court is required to determine whether there is a causal connection between the conduct of the OEA which altered Mr McCarron s position to his prejudice  and the status of Mr McCarron as a union member under s   of the Act  see Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority   FCA         FCR   at       per Nicholson J  An analysis of the authorities establishes that the Courts have interpreted s   of the Act as requiring the dominant or immediate purpose of the conduct to be considered and not the ultimate purpose in determining the motivation for the prohibited conduct  Such approach has been applied in statutory interpretation of other statutes  see for example Wribass Pty Limited v Swallow     FLR   at     and Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Limited v Australasian Meat Industry Employee s Union     FLR   at   which involved the interpretation of s  D of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  consideredMcIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd     IR   The ban affected all employees in the OEA  whether members of the CPSU or otherwise  However this circumstance does not lead to the conclusion that it was therefore not imposed for a  prohibited reason   In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd     IR   at   Greenwood J said    Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee  It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost  The question is whether the conduct  from the standpoint of the individual  notwithstanding others  represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose consideredPatrick Stevedores

Flight Stewards Association of Australia     IR   Ellicott J in Squires v Flight Stewards Association of Australia     IR   at   said of the words prohibiting an employer from injuring an employee in his employment as referred to in s   of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act    Cth    The words  injure in his employment  are in the context of s    words of wide import  I do not regard them as referring only to financial injury or injury involving the deprivation of rights which the employee has under a contract of service  They are  in my view  applicable to any circumstances where an employee in the course of his employment is treated substantially differently to the manner in which he or she is ordinarily treated and where that treatment can be seen to be injurious or prejudicial consideredTasmanian Development and Resources v Martin     IR   Mr McCarron was entitled to have his leave applications properly considered by the OEA pursuant to the terms of his AWA  Pursuant to clause   of the AWA the approval of flex leave is subject to operational requirements  However the existence of operational requirements must be demonstrated and must be genuine and reasonable  The decision of the Full Court in Tasmanian Development and Resources v Martin     IR   at   provides support for a finding that there must be a factual basis for a conclusion that there were operational requirements which necessitated the ban on leave  The reasons advanced for operational requirements as referred to above amount to no more than  at the highest  an apprehension of staff shortages on the NDCP  Such fear was not based upon any enquiries of past experiences  nor any genuine assessment of the real staffing needs on the NDCP  Had enquiries of the relevant managers been made  the decision to impose the ban would at least have had a foundation  Such enquiries however would have revealed that a total ban  based on the experience of the two prior occasions  would not be necessary  Accordingly  the reasons advanced in support of the decision do not constitute a sufficient basis for imposing the ban on leave  It follows that by imposing such ban the OEA breached clause   of Mr McCarron s AWA with the OEA   The CPSU and Mr McCarron also claimed that clause   of the AWA between Mr McCarron and the OEA was breached  The text of clause   is couched as a statement of the role of the relevant manager in ensuring that flex leave arrangements provided by clause   are made available to employees  The OEA made no submissions on this issue  and in view of the Court s finding that clause   has been breached  it is not necessary to determine whether clause   creates a contractual right  and if so  whether it has been breached consideredThe Employment Advocate v National Union of
