Clarkson v Commonwealth of Australia  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedClarkson v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The factual context of  and the general legal issues arising out of  Mr Clarkson s complaints about the failure to investigate the circumstances of his incarceration as a federal offender in a State prison have been outlined in my judgment in Clarkson v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     I have already dismissed his claims against four of the six respondents  Two remain  one relating to the Commonwealth Ombudsman  the other to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  HREOC    The application against the Ombudsman is bought under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   AD JR  Act  and challenges alleged decisions of the Ombudsman not to investigate three matters  These are         The decision made not to investigate the actions taken by Correctional Officers at Junee CC to sabotage the appeals and education of the Applicant        The decision made not to investigate the failure of the Commonwealth to monitor the administration of sentences served by Federal Offenders                 The decision made not to investigate the failure of the Commonwealth to amend the   Commonwealth State NSW Agreement to include terms designed ensure compliance with the ICCPR Protocols and otherwise according to law  citedS v Secretary  Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     In my earlier decision I indicated at par   that I was prepared to accept  for the purposes of this application  that notwithstanding the Arrangement  the Commonwealth may nonetheless retain tutelary responsibilities towards federal offenders in State prisons which might in exceptional circumstances found a claim in tort  cf S v Secretary  Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   or for injunctive or mandatory orders against the Commonwealth   There are several difficulties with the review sought of this decision  It is not apparent that the failure alleged related to a matter of administration being action taken by a department or by a prescribed authority  At best it seems to relate to a residual responsibility formally vested in the Governor General as a party to the Arrangement or else to the Commonwealth acting through the relevant portfolio Minister  In either circumstance the matter does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to investigate   I should add notwithstanding my reference to a residual tutelary responsibility in the Commonwealth  there is nothing in the material that has been filed by Mr Clarkson which  in my view  could properly be said to come near to exciting a duty in the Commonwealth to monitor his circumstances or for that matter the administration of sentences served by federal offenders  I will order that the application as against the third respondent be dismissed
