  FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In my opinion  the appellant was  by the answer given by the Tribunal  denied the chance of establishing those two facts before the Tribunal

hearing and the Tribunal has fallen into jurisdictional error  Not every statement made by the Tribunal to an applicant which is factually incorrect or may mislead will give rise to a finding that the Tribunal has fallen into jurisdictional error  The statement or representation must give rise to unfairness in the sense that the applicant was denied a fair hearing  Re Minister for Immigration and

The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal was entitled to make a finding adverse to the appellant regarding his credibility which he said was a function of the Tribunal  Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Durairajasingham   HCA         ALR   at   per McHugh J   The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant s complaints insofar as the appellant sought a rehearing on the merits   Similar matters are raised in the notice of appeal  The thrust of the appellant s complaints on appeal is that the Tribunal erred in  a  finding that the document was a forgery   b  failing to accord the appellant procedural fairness that it might find the document to be a forgery   c  failing to allow the appellant to present arguments relating to the issues as required under s   of the Act  and  d  failing to investigate the authenticity of the document pursuant to s  d  of the Act  Insofar as the Federal Magistrate rejected those arguments  it is said that

for Immigration   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It was put that the second and third grounds of appeal were not raised before the Federal Magistrate  The respondent objected to the appellant raising these grounds for the first time  especially in circumstances where the appellant has not explained why the matters were not raised on the application before the Federal Magistrate  VAAC v Minister for Immigration   FCAFC         FCR     The third ground of appeal was abandoned  Section   was in different form when the Tribunal undertook its review  It then provided         Where section   does not apply  the Tribunal       a  must give the applicant an opportunity to appear before it to give evidence  and   b  may obtain such other evidence as it considers necessary        Subject to paragraph  a  the Tribunal is not required to allow any person to address it orally about the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   There was not then a statutory obligation to invite an applicant to present arguments relating to the issues  For that reason  that ground was rightly abandoned  Ground   was  I think  raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and could be the subject of an appeal distinguishedWACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant has relied upon WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   where the Court found the Tribunal to be in breach of procedural fairness by failing to allow an applicant an opportunity to respond to its conclusion that documents which were submitted to the Tribunal at the Tribunal s request after the hearing were a forgery   In this case  however  the Tribunal did not find the document to be a forgery  Rather  it refused to accept it as evidence in support of the appellant s credibility  Moreover  in this case  contrary to the facts in WACO   FCAFC       FCR   the Tribunal raised its concerns with the appellant about the status of the document during the hearing
