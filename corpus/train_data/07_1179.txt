been given an expectation by the Minister  as to a procedural step to be taken  which was not taken so that it may be said that a legitimate expectation held was disappointed  see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ    Neither IFT or any of its members or  indeed  The Wilderness Society Inc   can show it or they were misled by the Minister  The subjective expectation held by opponents of the proposed action was generated by the RPDC process  While the Minister s predecessor agreed on assessment through the RPDC jointly with Tasmania  nothing the Minister did contributed to the demise of the RPDC  Further  the number and nature of the environmental matters relevant to the Minister s decision on approval are narrower than those dealt with by the RPDC  Even in that respect  the evidence of IFT is very general  There is no evidence of what precise material would have been put to the Minister had he decided on a longer period for  comment  than   business days  For example  Ms Christina Holmdahl referred to  detailed expert reports  on  flora and fauna and social and economic issues including but not only the impact on tourism    The kind of material which IFT wished to put to the Minister  if there was more time  largely relates to matters which are relevant to Tasmania s assessment process  rather than the Minister s  The same can be said of the matters identified by Mr Paul Oosting at   of his affidavit dated   May   in the TWS proceeding  with the exception of  marine impacts  including environmental impacts and particular species impacts   threatened species  as it relates to the site of the pulp mill   social impacts  and  economic impacts   The limited nature of the matters which could be addressed with respect to the controlling provisions  combined with the limited nature of the evidence that could be put forward in respect of them  does not make it clear that the   business day time limit for comment amounts to a denial of procedural fairness in the circumstances        I certify that the preceding nineteen   numbered paragraphs are a true

au cases cth HCA  html  In the TWS proceeding  I held that s  AA  of the EPBC Act is a complete statement of the Minister s obligation to provide procedural fairness in relation to his decision to approve  for the purposes of a controlling provision  the taking of an action and any conditions attaching to approval  If that is not correct and the obligation is wider  it is one that must be considered in the context of the EPBC Act and in the context of the facts and circumstances before the Minister  see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at       That the EPBC Act has provisions dealing with steps to be taken before a decision on approval is made suggests that the EPBC Act makes careful provision for when  and to what extent  comment from interested persons and or the public is required   Under s   of the EPBC Act  as soon as practicable after receiving a referral of a proposal to take an action  the Minister must cause to be published on the internet the referral and  an invitation for anyone to give the Minister comments within   business days  on whether the action is a controlled action  In making a controlled action decision under s   the Minister is required by s  A  to consider the comments received in response to such an invitation  as long as they are received within the time specified  Under s   the Minister is obliged to make the controlled action decision within   business days after receiving the referral referred toThe Wilderness Society Inc  v The Hon  Malcolm Turnbull  Minister for the Environment and Water Resources   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This proceeding was heard at the same time as The Wilderness Society Inc  v The Hon  Malcolm Turnbull  Minister for the Environment and Water Resources   FCA    TWS proceeding   These reasons for judgment are to be read together with the reasons for judgment published in the TWS proceeding  Terms defined in the reasons for judgment in the TWS proceeding have the same meaning in these reasons for judgment   The grounds of review relied on in this proceeding overlap substantially with the grounds relied on in the TWS proceeding  There is a difference between the grounds in the applications dealing with the allegation that the Minister took into account Gunns  commercial imperatives in making the   assessment approach decision   Ground nine of the grounds of review in this proceeding states that the   assessment approach decision is invalid or is not authorised by the EPBC Act because the Minister took into account an irrelevant consideration  Ground   in the TWS proceeding alleges that the   assessment approach decision involved an improper exercise of power in that it was made for a purpose  or included a purpose  other than that for which the power was conferred  I rejected that submission in the TWS proceeding
