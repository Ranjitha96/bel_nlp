html  There is another complication  Each applicant had discrete claims for relief  The claims by the first applicant were claims for damages  The second applicant brought claims for penalties for breach of the Workplace Relations Act   Neither applicant had any concrete interest in the claims of the other  The respondents objected to joinder  Joinder was permitted   A   L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA         ALR   at      It was noted that the joinder of the causes of action complicated the long standing costs regime reflected in s   of the Workplace Relations Act   In the course of dealing with the question of security for costs which followed the permitting of joinder  the following was said   A   L Silvestri Pty Ltd   FCA       ALR   at      In my opinion  the joinder of applicants with the one set of solicitors and counsel has the consequence that Hadgkiss will be responsible for any order for costs which is made arising out of the proceedings  even if made in the Silvestri proceeding  The joinder is convenient for the applicants and liability for costs is one of the prices to be paid for that    That passage  of course  relates to the liability for costs rather than the entitlement to costs followedBahonko v Sterjov   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first applicant seeks an order for costs of the claims for damages upon which it succeeded pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  against the third to fifth respondents for acting in contravention of s  D of the Trade Practices Act and the first and second respondents for being knowingly concerned in the contravention of s  D  The respondents submit that such an order would be inconsistent with the decision of the Full Court in Goldman Sachs JBWere Services Pty Ltd v Nikolich   FCAFC         FCR   because of the effect of s   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth  as it was applicable to this case  now s   or at least that there is a necessity to  enter the murky waters  of an inconsistency between that decision and Bahonko v Sterjov   FCAFC    I do not agree  Bahonko   FCAFC   establishes that a discrete federal claim is not affected by the restrictions on the award of costs in the Workplace Relations Act   This was a discrete federal claim  cf Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd   FCA    However  full operation must be given to the effect of s   by ensuring that costs in relation to the discrete federal claim would only be awarded where those costs do not overlap with costs incurred in relation to the Workplace Relations Act claim distinguishedGoldman Sachs JBWere Services Pty Ltd v Nikolich   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The first applicant seeks an

full operation must be given to the effect of s   by ensuring that costs in relation to the discrete federal claim would only be awarded where those costs do not overlap with costs incurred in relation to the Workplace Relations Act claim   There is another complication  The s  D claim also overlapped with a claim in tort for inducing breach of contract  However  that claim is properly seen as associated with  or accrued in relation to  the Trade Practices Act claim rather than the Workplace Relations Act claim  Thus  Goldman Sachs JBWere Services Pty Ltd v Nikolich   FCAFC       FCR   is not applicable to it citedInglis v Moore  No       ALR   However  the respondents submit that  as the one set of solicitors and counsel was retained for the several applicants  as had to be the case  it cannot be said that the first applicant incurred any liability for costs in relation to the proceeding  I do not draw that conclusion  I do not know what arrangements existed between the applicants  Even if there were a private arrangement by which one applicant rather than another agreed to bear costs  that would not have any significance   Inglis v Moore  No       ALR    The fact that a third party is involved in funding the costs of a party would not normally have any significance in relation to an entitlement to an order for costs by the party  The fact that one applicant is publicly funded does not alter the situation in principle   Another matter raised by the respondents is the effect of s  DC and s   of the Trade Practices Act   The effect of these provisions was raised late against the first and second respondents  It is submitted that there would need to be an adjustment of costs against the first and second respondents on that account  It was also submitted that the third  fourth and fifth respondents should have the benefit of an order for costs as they are protected by s  DC  from payment of damages for breach of s  D  I do not accept the effect of those arguments  The substance of the case had to be defended  There was only one set of costs involved in doing so  The provisions in question were only relevant to which of the respondents would be liable if the substance of the case was established  as it was  The protection afforded by s  DC  is from the payment of damages only  The finding of breach remains  In my view  the appropriate result is that there be no order either way as to the costs relating to the third  fourth and fifth respondents  I can see no proper basis for relieving the first and second respondents of payment of the costs of the first applicant in relation to the s  D claim   Thus  in my opinion  the first applicant is entitled to an order against the first and second respondents for those costs attributable to the s  D claim  which would not have been incurred in pursuing the Workplace Relations Act claim  In practical terms  these can be identified as being the costs associated with proof of damages  In my opinion  the other elements of the cause of action were inextricably entwined with the Workplace Relations Act substratum of facts  That overlap  after all  was the basis for permitting joinder in the first place  The first applicant should have the costs of the argument as to costs    I certify that the preceding seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the
