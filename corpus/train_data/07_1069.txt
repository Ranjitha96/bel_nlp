the claim  seemingly for damages  under the TP Act which gives this matter its federal character and this Court jurisdiction over it  MMA Super s contention  though  is that the TP Act claim here was made colourably  i e  for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  on colourable claims see Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     FCR   at   and see generally Allsop   Federal Jurisdiction and the Jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia in       Aust Bar Rev   at   ff  In aid of this contention MMA Super seeks comfort in the brief observation made by the Court in Kowalski FC  at   to the effect that in that case no claim within jurisdiction could be made against MMA Super  as  for example  under the Trade Practices Act     The question so raised is not whether a s   claim is doomed to failure  I leave out of consideration the question raised by MMA Super as to whether the s   could be applicable in any event to a superannuation trustee given s  AF of the TP Act and the provisions of Pt   Div   of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth   Rather  it is whether the claim was made in good faith   The substance of the present Statement of Claim first saw light of day in the District Court proceedings to which I have referred  Even then and in that forum a claim was made that MMA Super  had breached the Trade

austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As put the contention of MMA Super is that the TP Act claim discloses no reasonable cause of action  While the same is not said of the allegations of failure by MMA Super to perform its duties  it is said nonetheless that the clear inference is there to be drawn that the proceedings as a whole were issued to avoid the effect of the orders of Justice Bleby and of Mr Kowalski s disagreement with the State Supreme Court over waiver of fees and as such are an abuse of process  It has not been suggested  though  that the trust claims have been determined in another forum on their merits  The contrary was conceded in oral argument  although again some comfort was sought to be derived from what was said by the Court about the trust claims in Kowalski FC   Neither has it been suggested that in the plethora of proceedings brought to date any issue estoppel has arisen  Again it is conceded that  unlike in Lindsey v Philip Morris Ltd   FCA   where an abuse of process was found  the present is not a matter in which Mr Kowalski has been attempting to re litigate despite prior actual decisions on the evidence   I can deal with this contention shortly  While I am satisfied for reasons I give below that the TP Act claim is unarguable  it has not been suggested that the same is the case with the non TP Act or  trust claims  as I will for convenience call them  At best it is said that the pleading is vague  not particularly revealing and  in the case of the claim against MMA Super to be provided with his entitlement  has been brought against the wrong respondent   If the trust claims had been previously determined on the evidence  there would  in my view  be obvious grounds for the submission that Mr Kowalski was abusing the processes of this Court  Such  though  is not the case  While Mr Kowalski has been declared a vexatious litigant in the State Courts  he has in this Court advanced trust claims which MMA Super has not sought to have dismissed as having no reasonable prospects of success  see Federal Court of Australia Act     s  A   In these circumstances  unless I am satisfied that the present proceeding is vexatious  I can see no justification for characterising as an abuse of process Mr Kowalski s invocation of the jurisdiction of this Court citedBremer Vulkan Schiffbau Und Maschinenfabrik v South

cases cth federal ct  html  Having regard to Mr Kowalski s proceedings in this Court and it is their character in this Court that is to be objectively judged  Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich   FCA      albeit regard may properly be had to proceedings in other courts for the light they might throw on that question of characterisation  it is impossible to conclude that he has habitually  persistently and without any reasonable ground instituted a vexatious proceeding against MMA Super in this Court   In relation to O   r   I am not satisfied that the first condition required to be made out i e  Mr Kowalski has instituted a vexatious proceeding in this court is satisfied  I will not repeat what I have said above about the proceeding   I will not make any orders under O   citedEquity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     I will adjourn further consideration of this matter because  as I will indicate below  I intend to dismiss summarily the TP Act claim  but to leave on foot the non TP Act claims  though I will require that at least the Statement of Claim be amended  It is appropriate to leave the question of security until after that process has occurred bearing in mind in particular that in the present proceedings almost no attention has been given to the question whether the trust claims have any reasonable prospect of success  That question arises as a factor to be considered on a security application  see Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   ATPR     and on any possible application made under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act  citedToohey s Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties     SR  NSW    I had deferred consideration of MMA Super s contention that the TP Act claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action  although I have indicated that it ought be summarily dismissed as having no reasonable prospect of success  see Federal Court of Australia Act   s  A   My reasons for this conclusion have been anticipated inferentially in the observations made in Kowalski FC to which I earlier referred  Assuming for present purposes s   of the TP Act  and not Pt   Div   of the ASIC Act  is potentially applicable to MMA Super in the circumstances  the conduct impugned must  to be actionable  have been engaged in   in trade or commerce   The allegations made relate to whether MMA Super  as trustee at the relevant time of the superannuation fund  has properly discharged  if at all  its obligations to Mr Kowalski as a member of the trust in accordance with the provisions of the trust  Whatever may have been the consequences of that conduct for the purposes of the law of trusts the trust seems to have been of a type relatively similar to that considered in Toohey s Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties     SR  NSW    at   it cannot properly be said that conduct itself was  in trade or commerce  citedConcrete Constructions  NSW  Pty Ltd v Nelson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

cases cth FCAFC  html  In this matter it can properly be said that MAAL had its own commercial interests and purposes in mind in having a superannuation fund established for its employees that was to be administered by MAA Super  But what it did in constituting the trust was to facilitate the bringing about of the relationship of trustee and beneficiary between MAA Super and the funds members  That relationship was not intrinsically a commercial relationship nor did the conduct complained of otherwise bear a trading or commercial character  cf Village Building Co Ltd v Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd   FCAFC         ALR   at     This is not to say that  in the management of the fund  MAA Super may not have engaged in conduct that was in trade or commerce as  for example  in the making and management of the trust s investments  The relevant conduct in question here related simply to MAA Super s performance of the obligations it had to Mr Kowalski under the trust  That conduct  in the context of their relationship  was not an aspect of an activity or transaction that bore a trading or commercial character  It related simply to the provision by MAA Super of such entitlements as Mr Kowalski had under the trust instruments by virtue of his membership of the fund to which he had had access in virtue of his employment with MAAL citedUnilan Holdings Pty Ltd v Kerin     FCR   I will order that that part of the proceeding that relates to a claim for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  be dismissed  I should emphasise that my so doing does not

Allsop  at   ff   Finally  let me refer to the trust claims  I have already indicated some of the criticisms that have been made of these and of the relief sought  I will give Mr Kowalski the opportunity to address these also to more clearly and accurately indicate what his claims are and what  in summary  are the material facts on which he relies  The mantra like repetition of alleged wrongdoing hardly illuminates what it is alleged was actually done or omitted to be done that gave rise to his causes of action  My giving this leave should not be interpreted as suggesting that the trust claims have reasonable prospects of success  That matter has not been agitated before me  I can only say  as Mansfield J suggested in Kowalski TJ   there are obvious obstacles confronting their prosecution   I will order that        the proceeding be dismissed insofar as it claims relief under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act    Cth      the orders sought in paras     and   of the
