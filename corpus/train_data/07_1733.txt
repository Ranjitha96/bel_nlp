Anderson v State of Western Australia   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAnderson v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   April   a motion was filed seeking the removal of RY  now deceased  as a named applicant  The motion was purportedly brought on behalf of the applicants  It was heard on   December   and dismissed on   December    That dismissal was based on the inadequacy of the authorisation process in relation to the proposed replacement applicants  Anderson v State of Western Australia   FCA   citedAnderson v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  A subsequent judgment delivered on   October   made detailed directions relating to timetabling for meeting dates and venues and negotiation protocols for the Ballardong application and other south west applications  Anderson v State of Western Australia   FCA   citedAnderson v Western Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   December   the Court decided a motion which sought amendments to the Ballardong application by contracting its boundaries so that the balance of the area covered by it would fall outside the area of the Single Noongar Claim  The contracted application was to be called the Nulla Nulla application  The motion also sought an order replacing the   named applicants  two of whom were then deceased  with four applicants who would be the authorised applicants for the reduced claim  There were then two dissenters within the ranks of the applicants  Serious inadequacies existed in the evidence going to the important question whether the replacement proposal had been authorised by the native title claim group  The motion to amend was dismissed  Anderson v Western Australia   FCA         FCR    Because of the ongoing stalemate a springing order was made which would have dismissed the application on or before   March   unless one of the following events occurred       a  a motion was filed  agreed to by all named applicants  to amend the application or to seek further programming orders in relation to it     b  an application was filed by members of the native title claim group pursuant to s  B of the NT Act seeking replacement of the applicants      The springing order was averted by the filing of a new motion citedBolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   June   the new motion which sought to replace the   named applicants with four new applicants  Reg Hayden  Doug Nelson  Dorcus Pickett and Reg Young  was dismissed  The authority for that change was said to derive from resolutions passed at a meeting held in Quairading in February   Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia   FCA    There were authorisation difficulties associated with the motion and related motions which were designed to have the effect of combining all applications in the south west into one application covering the bulk of the south west area  The process by which it was sought to achieve that result was flawed and the orders sought under s  B for replacement of applicants in the various applications could not be made  The motion was dismissed in relation to the orders sought under that section      Amendments were also sought which would have contracted the Ballardong application so that it did not overlap with the Single Noongar claim  However because of internal difficulties among the applicants and in the absence of evidence of a truly representative meeting  I was not prepared to allow those amendments  I did however make an order for the removal of two deceased applicants  William Riley and Alex Yarran   On   July   a motion was filed seeking orders in the following terms           That Alan Jones  Winnie McHenry  Doug Nelson  Reg Hayden  Saul Yarran  Ricky Nelson  RR  now deceased  Tim Riley  Dianne Taylor  Reg Yarran Jnr  Murray Yarran  Fay Slater and Carol Holmes on behalf of the Ballardong people  the Proposed Applicant  do jointly replace the current Applicant on the grounds that               a  RY Snr is now deceased and therefore can no longer be authorised by the claim group to make the application or deal with matters arising in relation to it       b  Cedric Anderson  Donald Collard  Sylvia Rachel Collard and RY  who died after the filing of the motion  are no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it  and      c  The Proposed Applicant is authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it                 That the applicant as re constituted by order   above be granted leave  to the extent that leave may be required  to amend the application by filing a Form   in the form of annexure  A  to the affidavit of Simon Charles Blackshield sworn   July           Such further or other orders as to the Court seems fit   The proposed amendment referred to in   above involved the insertion  in the application  at the end of   under the heading  Internal boundaries  in Attachment B of the following         j  all areas of land and water which did not fall within the external boundary of native title determination application WAD  of    SNC Area   as at   July        The motion was supported by a number of affidavits filed with it  It is convenient to set out in summary form the substance of these affidavits    The affidavit evidence    i  Jo Anne Jones  affirmed   July
