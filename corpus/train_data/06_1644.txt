cth federal ct  html  The observations of O Connor J in Al Abdullatif Industrial Group Co Ltd v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA   at   are to the same effect  Her Honour pointed out that in many cases  an implied duty to investigate each avenue suggested by an interested party would make the statutory scheme unworkable   It is plain from the passages of the Trade Measures Report which I have set out at       and   that the CEO did investigate the relative significance of price to other factors and that he made findings as to the existence of the necessary causal link   However  Schaefer submitted that the CEO breached the duty to investigate by failing to make further enquiries  in particular to ask further questions as to the relative significance of price to other factors citedApplicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   The CEO is required by s  TEA b  of the Act to provide particulars of the evidence relied on in support of the findings  But it is not necessary for him to refer to every piece of evidence put before him  the Court will infer that matters not mentioned were not considered to be material  see

cases cth HCA  html  The difficulty was illustrated at a practical level because  apart from contending that there was a duty to ask further questions  Dr Flick was unable to formulate the particular questions which Customs ought to have asked  This is hardly surprising  Once it is determined that the decision maker has asked himself herself the correct question  how can the Court determine what particular questions the repository of the power ought to ask to complete the exercise of jurisdiction  To do so may well be to cross the limits of judicial intervention delineated by Brennan J in

and ascertain all relevant facts  it is a duty to investigate within the statutory framework and the CEO is entitled to rely primarily on submissions received from interested parties  see C A Ford Pty Ltd v Comptroller General of Customs     FCR   at   per Davies J   That is not to say that the CEO s duty to investigate is limited entirely to a consideration of the application and the submission of interested parties  Clearly enough  the Act imposes a duty to carry out an investigation  There are numerous references to it  see for example ss  TC e   TDAA  and  TEA    As may be expected  the Act does not direct the CEO as to how to conduct the investigation  It leaves to the CEO Minister the task of reaching the necessary state of satisfaction having regard to the matters he or she may  or in

submitted that this was authority for the proposition that a statement of essential facts which omitted material facts known to the CEO must create a materially inaccurate impression to the Minister which was reviewable under ss  a  and    g  of the ADJR Act    However  Brown s case was decided under a different statutory scheme to that which is now applicable  The observations to which Dr Flick

I do not think it is a question of parsing and analysing these passages to criticise what may be thought to be contestable fact finding  Subject to any questions of unreasonableness or perversity  it was a matter for the CEO as to what weight he was to give to the various considerations to be taken into account  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited   HCA         CLR   at       The findings in Chapters     and   of the Trade Measures Report pave the way for a consideration of the question of causation which is dealt with in Chapter    That chapter opens by stating that it considers whether there is a  causal link  between the dumped MGBs and the injury suffered by the Australian industry and whether the injury is material  This is a further clear statement of the question which the CEO was required to address   The chapter contains findings of material injury including the loss of approximately   units representing   of the total market  as well as price

Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  But that is not to make immune from judicial intervention the CEO s decision as to the existence of a causal link  In my view  what really underlies Dr Flick s attack on the decision is that it was based on findings or inferences of fact that were not supported by probative material or logical grounds  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu   HCA         CLR   at     Re Minister For Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Applicant S      ALR     I do not consider that these findings were so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have arrived at them  see Eshetu at   Buck v Bavone   HCA         CLR   at       The CEO was not bound to accept the contractor s statement  Of course  a different fact finder may have reached a different view  But  as Gummow J said in Eshetu at             where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ  it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at the decision in question  It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies  or  with other matters  goes to establish or to deny  that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way   I do not consider that the evidence was all one way  It was open for the CEO to find that  notwithstanding the contractor s stated views  the position would have been different if the MGBs were offered at undumped prices   Dr Flick submitted that the omission of the confidential material from the SEF  the Report and the public site visit report for Coffs indicated perversity on the part of the CEO  He submitted that s  ZJ  cannot be construed so as to confer upon Customs a power to select from the information which it has been told and to exclude from the public record other information of which it is aware citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In order to make out a finding of actual bias  an applicant must demonstrate that the decision maker was guilty of pre judgment  He or she must be committed to a conclusion  and not open to a contrary view  whatever arguments or evidence may be presented  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR   at         SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at    followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section  TEA  of the Act is in similar terms to s  c  and  d  of the Migration Act    Cth   Thus  the CEO is only required to set out in the report to the Minister the findings which he did make  he is not required to set out findings additional to those which he actually made  What is required is the material findings of fact which the CEO actually made and upon which he based his recommendation  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR   at          The CEO is required by s  TEA b  of the Act to provide particulars of the evidence relied on in support of the findings  But it is not necessary for him to refer to every piece of evidence put before him  the Court will infer that matters not mentioned were not considered to be material  see Yusuf at   see also Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   at     However  Schaefer s approach to construction is contrary to that which is laid down by the High Court in Yusuf   The Report contains the findings the CEO did make on these facts  He is not required to go further  He is required only to make recommendations and set out his material findings on which the recommendations were based  He is not required to provide the Minister with competing interpretations of the evidence so as to allow the Minister to make the ultimate decision   That is not the scheme of Part XVB  What is required is the CEO s recommendation and findings  The Minister is not bound to accept the recommendation  He or she is required to reach the state of satisfaction as to whether dumping caused material injury as provided in s  TG   The effect of this ground  as argued by Schaefer  is that the finding of causation cannot be supported because the CEO did not disclose material facts known to him as to the reasons why the tenders were successful  Alternatively  it was submitted that  in light of the primary materials  the CEO s findings as to the importance of price were stated in a misleading way citedMinister for Small Business

way in which the case was apparently put was that the finding of causation was so much against the weight of evidence as to be arbitrary  perverse or capricious  NADH of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at       There are two separate strands to the argument  The first is that the information provided by some of the councils  eg Canterbury  pointed to price and non price factors without differentiating between the relative importance of those factors  Thus  it was said to be irrational  perverse or unreasonable to make a finding of causation without knowing more about those factors   The second strand is that for a number of the councils  most notably Eurobodalla and Coffs Coast  there was material in the site visit reports which clearly stated the contractor s view that price was not determinative  I will deal with this strand of the argument first citedN V  Beaulieu Real v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCA  http www austlii edu

for Justice and Customs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Act provides for a multi staged fact finding and decision making process which is intended to treat all interested parties fairly  giving them an opportunity to comment on facts proposed to be relied upon by the CEO as the basis for his or her recommendation to the Minister  Pilkington  Australia  Ltd v Minister of State for Justice and Customs   FCAFC         FCR   at      One of the steps in the process is for the CEO to place on public record a statement of essential facts  usually described by the acronym  SEF   The SEF is to contain a statement of the facts on which the CEO proposes to base a recommendation to the Minister as to whether or not to impose duties  see s  TDAA   A further step in the process is for the CEO  after holding an investigation into the application  to report to the Minister  The report is to recommend  amongst other things  whether the Minister ought to be satisfied as to the necessary matters before publishing a dumping notice  s  TEA   The provisions of Part XVB were fully explained in Pilkington at      I will not repeat what was said but I will endeavour to summarise or set out the provisions salient to these proceedings  Amendments made to the Act since   are not material for present purposes   Divisions     and   of Part XVB deal with the preliminary and procedural matters leading to a decision by the Minister whether to publish a dumping duty notice  s  SM    An investigation about dumping may be initiated by an application lodged with Customs under s  TB   The Act lays down tight time frames within which the process prescribed in Divs   and   of Part XVB is to move forward  Pilkington at     Within   days after Customs receives an application under s  TB  the CEO must examine it and must reject it if not satisfied of the matters stated in s  TC  and     If the CEO decides not to reject an application within that period  he or she must give public notice of acceptance of the application  s  TC    Section  ZJ of the Act gives effect to Australia s obligations under agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT   The agreements provided for a formalisation and expansion of the public file system to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on information available to investigating authorities  Pilkington at    Section  ZJ provides  relevantly        Section  ZJ CEO to maintain public record for certain purposes             The CEO must  in relation to each application received under section  TB that leads to an investigation  each application or request under section  ZA that leads to a review and each application under section  ZHB that leads to an inquiry           a  maintain a public record of the investigation  review or inquiry conducted for the purposes of the application or request  containing  subject to subsection   a copy of all submissions from interested parties  the statement of essential facts compiled in respect of that investigation  review or inquiry  and a copy of all relevant correspondence between the CEO and other persons  and    b  draw the attention of all interested parties to the existence of the public record  and to their entitlement to inspect that record  and    c  at the request of an interested party  make the record available to that party for inspection            To the extent that information given to the CEO by a person is claimed to be confidential or to be information whose publication would adversely affect a person s business or commercial interests  the person giving that information must ensure that a summary of that information           a  that contains sufficient detail to allow a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information  but    b  that does not breach that confidentiality or adversely affect those interests          is given to the CEO for inclusion in the public record      A person is not required to give the CEO a summary of information under subsection   for inclusion in the public record if the person satisfies the CEO that there is no way such a summary can be given to allow a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information      If oral information is given to the CEO by a person  the CEO must not take that information into account unless it is subsequently put in writing by the person or by the CEO and thereby becomes available  subject to considerations of confidentiality and to the need to protect business and commercial interests  as a part of the public record                The purpose  background and proper approach to construction of Part XVB were explained in Pilkington at      I will summarise the essential points   Part XVB reflects  in substance  amendments to the Act made by legislation passed in   and    I will not repeat the titles of those enactments  Pilkington at     The provisions of the implementation agreement negotiated in the Uruguay Round of the GATT were summarised in Pilkington at    Article VI of that Agreement appears to be the genesis of s  ZJ of the Act  It provides  inter alia   that  subject to the requirement to protect confidential information  evidence presented in writing by an interested party should be made available promptly to other interested parties   Article VI also provides that oral information is to be taken into account by the authorities only insofar as it is subsequently reproduced in writing and made available to other interested parties   The Second Reading Speech of the Bill  which became the   Act  included a statement set out in Pilkington at    This was that   throughout an investigation all interested parties must have a full opportunity to see all relevant information  to acquaint themselves with opposing views and to offer rebuttal arguments    The provisions of Part XVB are to be interpreted and applied  as far as the language permits  in accordance with Australia s international obligations  Pilkington at     A broad approach to construction is to be adopted  Pilkington at       Over a period of about   months ending in July   Schaefer won five large Australian contracts for the supply of MGBs  These were with local councils or their contractors as follows          Ku ring gai Collex Pty Limited    Canterbury City Council    Bega Valley Watts Waste    Eurobodalla Staples Waste Removals Pty Limited     Coffs Coast SMS Municipal Services Pty Limited  which uses Handybin Waste Services  Coffs Harbour  Pty Limited  a related company  to supply waste services  On   September   Nylex Limited and Sulo MGB Australia Pty Limited lodged an application under s  TB  of the Act requesting the Minister to publish a dumping notice   Two things underlie the legislative scheme  The first is a high level of transparency  with opportunities for interested parties to comment and tender evidence at each relevant stage of the process  see Pilkington at    The second is the formalisation and expansion of the public file system which was intended to make available to interested parties the material which would enable them to defend their interests  see Pilkington at       These objectives are reflected in particular in ss  TC   TDAA   TEA  and  ZJ      Moreover  s  TDAA  makes it plain that the statement of essential facts is not a report to the Minister upon which the Minister is to make his or her decision  Rather  it is a document which the CEO must place on the public record for the benefit of interested parties   It is true that the apparent purpose of s  ZJ is to give effect to the policy of transparency which underlies the statutory scheme in Part XVB of the Act  Thus  the CEO s recommendation should ordinarily to be made only by reference to that which is available on the public record  This enables interested parties to defend their interests  see Article VI of the Implementation Agreement for the Uruguay Round of GATT  see also Pilkington at     and     However  I do not accept Dr Flick s submission as to the proper construction of s  ZJ   The flaw in his argument is that it fails to take into account the provisions of s  ZJ  and   which make special provision for the inclusion of some details of the confidential information to be placed on the public record   Section  ZJ  provides that a person giving information to the CEO that is claimed to be confidential must ensure that a summary of that information is given to the CEO for inclusion in the public record  The summary must contain sufficient detail to allow a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information and is to be given in a way that does not breach confidentiality   I agree with the submission of the respondents that most of the changes between the SEF and the Trade Measures Report were as a result of considering and responding to the applicant s post SEF submissions  There is no obligation on the Minister to provide a copy of the Trade Measures Report before making any decision to impose dumping duties  nor to consider any material outside the Report  see Pilkington at   followedPrasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   The issues may be summarised as follows          Whether  upon the proper construction and application of s  TDAA of the Act  the SEF was required to contain a statement of all material facts known to Customs at the time of preparation     Whether the CEO made an error of law  or asked himself the wrong question  by failing to consider whether the Minister ought to be satisfied of a causal link between the price of the goods and material injury to an Australian industry  see s   TEA d  s  TG      Whether the Trade Measures Report contravened s  TEA  by failing to include a statement of the CEO s reasons for his recommendation that set out the material findings of fact and particulars of the evidence relied on to support the findings     Whether Schaefer was deprived of the statutory opportunity to respond to the SEF by reason of the non disclosure of material facts known to the CEO  These facts are said to be the statements by the purchasers of the MGBs of factors  other than price  which influenced their decisions     Whether the CEO failed to conduct an investigation in accordance with Div   of Part XVB  by failing to make any further enquiry of the purchasers as to whether price was the causative factor  Schaefer relies upon the principle stated by Wilcox J in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   to enliven a duty to make further enquiries in the present case     Whether the SEF or the Trade Measures Report was perverse or affected by Wednesbury unreasonableness in light of the factual material contained in the site visit reports     In addition to   whether the SEF or the Trade Measures Report was affected by bias     Whether the power of the Minister to make a declaration pursuant to s  TG was vitiated by an error in the SEF placed on the public record  or an error in the Trade Measures Report provided to the Minister  or otherwise involved a denial of procedural fairness     Whether  in any event  relief ought to be declined on discretionary grounds  This issue arises because Schaefer has sought merits review of the Minister s decision from the Trade Measures Review Officer in accordance with Div   of Part XVB   The authorities confine the duty to investigate to rare and exceptional circumstances  It is limited to cases where it is obvious that material is readily available that is centrally relevant to the decision  see Prasad at     Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh     FCR   at       Luu v Renevier     ALR   at   Azzi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at          Given that the CEO did investigate the central question  the duty which Schaefer seeks to impose  namely a duty to ask further questions  does not fit neatly within the formulation expressed in Prasad and the other cases citedR v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration

extent that Dr Flick s submissions rested upon the proposition that the CEO is required to expose his or her reasoning in advance of the provision of the report to the Minister under s  TEA  this

apprehension of bias in curial proceedings is whether a  fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question  that is to be decided  see Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte H   HCA         ALR   at     See also Antoun v The Queen   HCA         ALR   at     Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR   at      For administrative proceedings  the test is expressed by reference to a hypothetical fair minded lay person  properly informed of the nature of the proceeding  the matters that are in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to the claimed apprehension of bias  se Ex parte H at     The substance of Schaefer s claim of bias was that the five councils gave central information to Customs  which slipped off the table  and did not find its way into the SEF or Trade Measures Report   Dr Flick pointed in particular to the statements made by the contractor for Coffs that whilst price was an issue  quality was the determining factor and there was a breakdown in the relationship with the relevant Australian supplier followedSCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In order to make out a finding of actual bias  an applicant must demonstrate that the decision maker was guilty of pre judgment  He or she must be committed to a conclusion  and not open to a contrary view  whatever arguments or evidence may be presented  see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR   at         SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at      An applicant bears a heavy onus  it will rarely be discharged by pointing solely to the reasons of the decision maker or adverse fact finding  see SCAA at       As von Doussa J said in SCAA at   even where it is possible to show that findings are contrary to evidence  or unreasonable  or that the reasoning process is hopelessly flawed  that  without more  is unlikely to demonstrate pre judgment amounting to bias  Here  the most that can be said is that the findings of fact are highly contestable   I dealt  under Issue   with the question of compliance with the EN  standard in the Coffs contract  Customs considered and dealt with Schaefer s submission  It seems to me that the way in which it addressed that question shows that its decision was not affected by actual or apprehended bias   There was nothing in the other matters recorded in Schaefer s written submissions which could make good the claim of bias  They are all complaints about fact finding followedSwan Portland Cement Limited Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs     FCR   The test for causation of material injury was said by Lockhart J in Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs     FCR   at   to be  essentially a practical exercise   His Honour said that its purpose is to achieve the objective of determining whether  viewed as a whole  the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from the dumping   Moreover  the authorities referred to in the previous paragraphs establish that the determination is one of fact and degree  see eg Mullins at   Swan at     These findings seem to me to reflect the practical exercise in decision making contemplated by the test stated by Lockhart J in Swan which I referred to at   above  Whilst different minds may have come to different views on the preliminary findings as to the relevance of non price factors  the determination is  as I have said  one of fact for the decision maker  In making this determination  the CEO proceeded on the basis that factors other than price were given different prominence by different councils but that tenders were to be evaluated within a narrow price band  That was a question of fact for the CEO   The balance of Chapter   consists largely of a consideration of Schaefer s submissions  in particular customer preferences  I have set out the findings of the Report at   above  That passage and the conclusions which I have set out at   again show the necessary application of the test of causation   In my opinion  this ground of review fails citedWyeth Australia Pty Ltd v Minister for Health and Aged Care     ALD   The Court has a
