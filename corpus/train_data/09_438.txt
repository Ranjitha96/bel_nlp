Stacey Brothers Plumbing Pty Ltd v Waterco Limited   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toDuke of Bedford v Ellis   AC  Order   r   provides as follows    Where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding the proceeding may be commenced  and  unless the Court otherwise orders  continued  by or against any one or more of them as representing all or as representing all except one or more of them       Therefore  before O   r   can be invoked  there must be  numerous persons  having  the same interest in  the  proceeding   This requirement must be satisfied at the time the proceeding is commenced  The interest in question is an interest in the proceeding  to be judged by reference to the effect of the matters at issue on the rights and obligations of the representing respondent and the represented persons  A representative proceeding will not necessarily be defeated because some members  or even the representing party  have separate interests additional to a common interest  providing there is a common interest  compare Duke of Bedford v Ellis   AC   at   per Lord Macnaghten  Thus  on the respondents  motion  the basic question is whether  at the time the proceeding commenced  it could be said that numerous persons had the same interest in the proceeding as between themselves and Swimart Balwyn  For the reasons stated below  I would answer this question in the negative  In order to understand my reasons for ruling against Stacey Brothers  it is necessary to refer to the case law on the operation of O   r   and provisions like it  Whether there are sufficient persons to constitute  numerous  persons has been said to depend on whether  the parties were so numerous that you could never  come at justice      if everybody interested was made a party  see Duke of Bedford v Ellis   AC at   per Lord Macnaghten  Today  the question may be put a little differently whether the representative proceeding can be regarded as an efficient and just way to proceed  having regard to the likely costs  the issues involved and the capacity of the Court to manage the proceeding suitably  In view of my conclusion as to lack of commonality of interest  it is unnecessary to explore this question further  It is also unnecessary to consider the effect on this issue of Mr Sloan s third affidavit  as to which see below referred

at   per Toohey and Gaudron JJ and     per McHugh J  Some care needs to be taken  however  with regard to Carnie and Campbells Cash since both concerned plaintiff representative actions  not defendant representative actions  Thus  in Carnie   CLR at   Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ said that the purpose of the representative procedure was  to facilitate the administration of justice by enabling parties having the same interest to secure a determination in one action rather than in separate actions   In Campbells Cash   CLR at     Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ made much the same point  saying    A central objective of the representative procedures for which Pt   r   provided was the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings and the efficient determination  once and for all  of controversies in which parties have the same interest  An important indication of the nature of the interest that numerous persons must have in proceedings instituted under Pt   r   was given by Pt   r    A judgment entered or order made in the proceedings  shall be binding on all the persons as representing whom the plaintiffs sue   What the rules were intended to achieve was a single determination of common issues in a way that binds those who were interested in those issues  As Carnie and Campbells Cash show  though simply expressed  the requirement of  same interest  has presented difficulties  In Carnie the High Court held that persons having separate causes of action in contract and tort might have the same interest in a proceeding for the purposes of the representative proceeding rules as they then stood in the NSW Supreme Court  The fact that the represented persons  claims arose under separate contracts was held insufficient to defeat the requirement that there be numerous persons having the same interest  In Carnie   CLR at   Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ held that  in the circumstances of that case  numerous persons had  the requisite commonality of interest  to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of the rule  Toohey and Gaudron JJ reached a similar conclusion  holding that the onus was on the named plaintiffs  to identify the class with sufficient particularity  without necessarily identifying every member  and that they had done so  noting that  t he class is not open ended  it is limited to those persons who have credit sale or loan contracts with the respondent which have been varied in circumstances where the variation has been executed in such a way as to be inconsistent with the  Credit  Act  see Carnie   CLR at    In discussing Carnie in

in Carnie thus    McHugh J suggested  at   that a plaintiff and the represented persons would have  the same interest  in legal proceedings when they have a community of interest in the determination of any substantial question of law or fact that arises in the proceedings  Brennan J  at   agreed with this test  Toohey and Gaudron JJ said  at   that persons would have the same interest in proceedings if there was a significant question common to all members of the class and they stood to be equally affected by the  declaratory  relief sought by the appellants in the instant proceedings  Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ thought  at   that the  same interest  requirement  may      extend  to a significant common interest in the resolution of any question of law or fact arising in the proceedings   Carnie also showed that  even if the jurisdictional requirements of O   r   are satisfied  the Court may nonetheless consider  as a matter of discretion  that the proceeding ought not continue as a representative proceeding  Various factors might be relevant to this determination  including whether alterations to the group description can be allowed  notice requirements for group members  and the practicalities of settlement or discontinuance of the proceeding  As Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ said in Carnie at   determining the importance of such matters in the context of the particular case is not necessarily straightforward  especially in the context of a defendant representative proceeding  Again  having regard to the conclusion I have reached on the lack of commonality of interest  it is strictly unnecessary to explore these discretionary considerations further  Since  however  Stacey Brothers specifically sought to amend the definition of the group  in order  so it said  better to  capture  the group  I discuss briefly whether the amendment might be made referred toCampbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au

 NSWLR  Amos Removals   Storage Pty Ltd v Small     NSWLR   is illustrative of this history  The plaintiffs  who were members of the New South Wales Road Transport Association  sued   members of the Committee of Management of the Shipping Section of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia  NSW Branch  as representing the Section  or at least those members of the Section that attended a meeting at which certain resolutions were passed  The plaintiffs relied on the representative procedure of the NSW Supreme Court  which  as we have seen  was then equivalent to O   r    In giving reasons for judgment in the case  Hunt J identified three requirements for a defendant representative procedure  first  that the persons to be represented formed an identifiable group or class  secondly  that the person selected as a representative must be in management of the group or class and have control of its funds  and thirdly  that those selected to be represented must have a common interest or a community of interest with all other members  see Amos Removals     NSWLR   at      Hunt J held that this last element was satisfied in Amos Removals because  the liability as alleged against the members     was     enlarged to become one of conspiracy  based upon what is said to be the history of concerted action by those members and the resolution  at the meeting  Amos Removals     NSWLR   at    The respondents in this case made much of the  management  issue  Subsequent cases indicate  however  that  management  is neither a sufficient nor a necessary requirement  although there must be something that binds the group together so as to give rise to a commonality of interest and render a representative proceeding appropriate  In truth  in Amos Removals   Hunt J s first two  requirements  are to be understood as factors that were strongly indicative of a commonality of interest  In other circumstances  respondent representative orders have been made where there has been no management and control  although there has been some other factor linking the group  For example  a respondent representative order was made in an action involving breach of trademark to support an ex parte interlocutory injunction against the members of the represented group where the evidence indicated that there was in fact a group of persons acting in a co ordinated way  see Tony Blain Pty Ltd trading as Acme Merchandising v Jamison     FCR    See also EMI Records Ltd v Kudhail   FSR    In these cases  there were factors other than mere management and control that supported the representative order  such as knowledge within the group of the group s members  co ordinated action  and common purpose referred toGeelong Wool Combing Ltd v Textile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlEven against unincorporated associations and unions  a representative proceeding is not properly brought where the essential inquiries concern the individual circumstances of the members  For example  in Geelong Wool Combing Ltd v Textile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia   FCA         FCR   at       Finkelstein J held that the representative procedure of this Court was unavailable and that the union could not represent its members participating in a picket  First  the evidence did not establish that the members of the group were acting with a common purpose and  secondly  the proceeding was one to recover penalties  As his Honour said  the applicant had to establish that each respondent had contravened the legislation  which involved an inquiry into each respondent s conduct and purpose and  if the contravention were established  separate consideration of the amount of the penalty  There was  therefore   no community of interest  amongst the members of the group citedTony Blain Pty Ltd trading as Acme Merchandising v Jamison     FCR  The respondents in this case made much of the

insurers being sued via representative orders in Irish Shipping Ltd v Commercial Union Assurance Co Plc     QB     where a shipowners  contractual claim  which all insurers had an interest in resisting  disclosed a community of interest amongst the insurers  even though there was a possibility that some foreign insurers might have a defence not available to all insurers  see     QB at   per Staughton LJ      per Sir John Megaw  and   per Purchas LJ  An argument that the representative order might work injustice because a represented insurer might wish to contend lack of authority  fraud or misrepresentation was put aside on the basis that there was  no suggestion  that any such contention would be made  and appropriate steps could be taken if there were  see     QB at   referred toMercantile Marine Service Association v Toms     KB  In other circumstances  however  the availability of different defences has precluded a finding of community of interest  Thus  in Mercantile Marine Service Association v Toms     KB     the members of an unincorporated association were to be represented on the defendant s side in a libel action against them  Swinfen Eady LJ noted  at   that the various members of the association might be  in a wholly different position  saying    If the members of the management committee were sued  and if in fact they had authorized the publication of the libel they could raise such defences as might be open to them  It might be that their defence would be that the words complained of were not capable of the meaning alleged or of any defamatory meaning  or that the words did not refer to the plaintiffs  The other members of the association  if sued  might say that  however defamatory the words complained of might be  they did not authorize their publication  that they were on the high seas and knew nothing about the matter referred toRoche v Sherrington     All ER  Similarly  in Roche v Sherrington     All ER     a proceeding to set aside gifts on the grounds of undue influence against defendants representing the present members of Opus Dei  an organisation within the Roman Catholic Church  failed for lack of common interest amongst the represented defendants  Slade J held that the representative proceeding rule was not available against the defendants because members of the group were likely to have separate defences  His Honour said that  where separate defences may be opened to some members of the class in question  there can be no common interest within the rule  see     All ER at   citedHardie   Lane

 the amendment that Stacey Brothers seeks by its motion would expand the group of represented persons in the sense that the group would henceforth include persons who were not Waterco franchisees  In SZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         ALR     at   Lehane J held that O   r   did not allow an amendment that would expand the group of person on whose behalf an applicant had commenced a proceeding  The case might be distinguished on the basis that it concerned an applicant representative proceeding  as opposed to a respondent representative proceeding  I do not  however  consider that this approach would withstand scrutiny  because his Honour s reasoning is applicable in both kinds of representative proceedings  Further  there is no reason to doubt his Honour s reasoning  In this proceeding  if there were to be an amendment to expand the persons sought to be bound  the amendment would need to take place under O   r   governing the joinder of parties  This is not an amendment of a kind that might be made under O   r    Having regard to the terms of O   r   Stacey Brothers would be obliged to seek leave to amend pursuant to O   r  b   There is power under O   r  b  to join additional parties after the commencement of the proceeding  It is  however  a discretionary power  Stacey Brothers did not apply for leave under O   r   in respect of any particular respondent  Nor did it advance submissions in support of any discretionary exercise of the power in its favour in respect of any respondent  It is therefore inappropriate to say anything more about the possible application of O   r    It should be borne in mind that any amendment under O   r   would require amendment of the terms in which the substantive relief claimed in the proceeding is framed  This and other matters would fall for consideration in an application under O   r  b  to join additional parties referred toBright v Femcare Ltd   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlStacey Brothers relied on passages in Bright v Femcare Ltd   FCAFC         ALR   at     and     per Lindgren J  in support of its argument that the respondents  challenge to the representative character of the proceeding was premature  I observe that this was a case under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act   and that his Honours  comments were clearly directed to this legislation  Different considerations apply in a case such as this  where it is apparent even at this early stage that the putative group is not held together by the same interest  so as to satisfy O   r   of the Rules  For the reasons stated  I would dismiss Stacey Brothers  motion  with costs  I would order that the application and the statement of claim be struck out in so far as each refers to  the Represented persons  and in particular the following paragraphs be struck out   a  in the application paragraph    in its entirety  and paragraphs   to   and    in so far as these paragraphs refer to  the Represented persons  and    b  in the statement of claim paragraphs       and Schedule    in their entirety  and paragraphs                             and    in so far as these paragraphs refer to  the Represented persons      Stacey Brothers will have seven days to file and serve an amended statement of claim in conformity with this order  Since the respondents have succeeded on their motion  they should also have their costs  At the commencement of these reasons  I noted that  after the hearing  the respondents sought leave to file a third affidavit by Mr Sloan  This affidavit concerned various matters  chiefly the printing and distribution of the Posters  and the information obtained as a result of inquiries made of Swimart franchisees  In a letter dated   March   the respondents  solicitor wrote    The Respondents  position is that the content of the affidavit does not     impact on the majority of the arguments raised by the Respondents and  subject to the stance taken by the Applicant  the Respondents propose that the Court decide on the Notices of Motion and arguments already advanced  If the Applicant wishes to be heard on matters arising from the affidavit then we propose that they be given the opportunity to file supplementary written submissions limited to those issues
