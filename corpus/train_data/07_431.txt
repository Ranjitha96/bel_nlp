au cases cth HCA  html  The other matter to observe is that the relevant time for the assessment of whether a person is the prescribed fit and proper person  is at the time of the relevant determination  This is made clear by the Act itself  for it is in considering the application that the Board needs to be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person  I note the Act specifically uses the present tense  There is no express or implied legislative indication which provides for the assessment of the facts at any other particular date  I refer also to A Solicitor v Council of the Law Society  NSW    HCA         CLR   at     In view of s   of the AAT Act  where the matter comes before the Tribunal  the Tribunal must be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person at the time of the Tribunal s determination  In reaching its decision  the Tribunal should consider for itself  as though it was performing the function of the relevant decision maker  whether the applicant has satisfied the Tribunal he or she was the prescribed fit and proper person   In my view  reading the Tribunal s reasons as a whole and fairly  the Tribunal did not approach the matter by directing itself to the ultimate issue it needed to resolve  namely whether the applicant was the prescribed fit and proper person appliedCollector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   The approach to be taken on an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal was outlined by the Full Court in Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd     FCR   at       The limitation of the jurisdiction to the resolution of questions of law imposes a significant constraint upon the role of the Court in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal  The appealable error of law must arise on the facts as found by the Tribunal or must vitiate the findings made or must have led the Tribunal to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make  A wrong finding of fact is not sufficient to demonstrate error of law  Waterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at      Where the decision of the Tribunal involves matters of fact and degree  then provided it applies correct principles of law  no appeal will lie  Commissioner of Taxation v Brixius     FCR   at        The limits within which the jurisdiction is conferred require that it be exercised with restraint  Only in exceptional circumstances should the decision of the Tribunal not be the final decision  Blackwood Hodge  Australia  Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs  NSW      FLR   at    Fisher J  Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v Cainero     ATC    Foster J    As the Full Court said in Repatriation Commission v Thompson     AAR   at               the nature of the task of this Court is clear  It is to leave to the tribunal of fact decisions as to the facts and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law           This translates to a practical as well as principled restraint  The Court will not be concerned with looseness in the language of the Tribunal nor with unhappy phrasing of the Tribunal s thoughts  Lennell v Repatriation Commission     ALN N

read sensibly  not seeking to perceive error  but concentrating on the task of the Court which is to interfere only when the identified error is one of law  It is permissible to analyse both the language and structure of the reasons of the Tribunal to determine whether a legally erroneous approach has been adopted  or whether the Tribunal has failed to properly appreciate the matter it was bound to consider  see Sinclair v Maryborough Mining Warden   HCA         CLR   at    Barwick CJ  and Wu Shan Liang at    Kirby J  citedRe Beadle and Director General of Social Security     ALD   The Tribunal  after considering a number of matters  stated at   as follows      I am prepared to find that the applicant s health  the circumstances within his practice and the tension within his marriage  most of which were at their peak in the  s  occurred during the same periods of time that income tax returns for himself and family entities were outstanding  But on the evidence of the applicant s doctors  and himself at the hearing  all medication ceased at February   and he was regarded then as enjoying improved health  I would have thought that there would have been greater diligence on his part to immediately set about preparing returns and having them lodged  It is noted from other evidence that at or about this time the applicant s accountancy practice stabilized and another employee accountant of considerable expertise was engaged  However the applicant s outstanding personal returns were not lodged until October   and the returns for other entities were not lodged until April  May or June of the following year  That is  some eight months after the applicant s health had been restored and medication had ceased and after his practice had stabilized he first lodged his outstanding personal returns but the other returns were not lodged until a period of between   and   months later  Set against a background of two prior Magistrates  Court appearances and a suspension from practice it would have been incumbent on the applicant to show a degree of  good fame  integrity and character  if his prior omissions should in the special circumstances that he asserted  be disregarded    emphasis added   The Tribunal then proceeded to state at     Following the analysis of the concept of special circumstances in both Beadle  Groth and Chamberlain   I cannot find the applicant s circumstances of ill health and vulnerability to an unstable rural economy whilst in regional practice  marriage instability and workplace stress  no less in self employment  are alone  or in combination  to be  unusual  uncommon or exceptional  nor could I find in the application of the relevant legislation that to decide to refuse re registration would cause an outcome which was  unfair  unintended  unjust  or  inappropriate     Then finally at   and   the Tribunal decided    Mr Moore acknowledged that the applicant had not ever been convicted of  a serious taxation offence  or at all  refer s  BC  and he was not automatically disqualified from registration  It was also submitted that if special circumstances are found not to exist  the only decision open to the Board  upon an application for re registration is refusal to register  No other option exists  for example  to suspend  or admonish  I agree with those submissions  The Tribunal is required to consider  in the circumstance of the case under review  to determine whether if special circumstances do exist whether to disregard the  omission  of an applicant  If the decision to refuse re registration is affirmed  it is open to an applicant to apply  without any period of prohibition  to the Board for registration  If that course is followed  the applicant  at the time of such an application will have the opportunity to demonstrate that he is fit and proper  Section  K appears to apply only where an agent has been suspended or where his registration has been cancelled  In the present case it was the applicant s application for re registration that was declined      The applicant s history  Court appearances  previous suspension  subsequent default and neglect and the magnitude of it and its duration dictates that it would be inappropriate to decide other than to affirm the decision under review   Whilst the references in   could be said to relate to the enquiry going to the affirmation of the decision under review  they are not sufficient to show  in light of the previous reasoning of the Tribunal  that the Tribunal considered for itself the ultimate issue   In my view  the Tribunal failed to appreciate the matter it was bound to consider and failed to address the ultimate issue for consideration  and in so doing made an error of law   The term  special circumstances  is not defined in the Act  It is used according to its ordinary meaning  As was said in Re Beadle and Director General of Social Security     ALD   at     An expression such as  special circumstances  is by its very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition  The qualifying adjective looks to circumstances that are unusual  uncommon or exceptional  Whether circumstances answer any of these descriptions must depend upon the context in which they occur  For it is the context which allows one to say that the circumstances in one case are markedly different from the usual run of cases  This is not to say that the circumstances must be unique but they must have a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special   Whether there were  special circumstances  was a question of fact for the Tribunal to decide  The Tribunal s conclusion that there were no special circumstances was a conclusion on a question of fact  It was a conclusion open to it on the facts as found   Another complaint made by the applicant was that the Tribunal incorrectly took into account the charges against the applicant before the Magistrates  Court in   for failing to lodge his   return  I do not accept the Tribunal fell into error in this regard  There was nothing in the Act that bound the Tribunal to not take account of the applicant s appearance in the Magistrates  Court in    In any event  the applicant raised the matter in his witness statement  as follows    In   I was prosecuted for an offence of failing to file a tax return for the year ended   June   contrary to section  C of the Taxation Administration Act     At the hearing of that charge before the Magistrates  Court at Ballarat I pleaded guilty and was fined      Enquiries of the Magistrates  Court confirmed no recording of any conviction in regard to that charge and the imposition of that fine  This is consistent with no conviction being entered in the Court record notwithstanding the plea of guilty and the imposition of a fine  I believe I disclosed a conviction in relation to this matter in error when completing applications for re registration as a Tax Agent in   and   lodged with the Respondent on   February   and   March   respectively   T      T      He was cross examined about the matter without objection citedSinclair v Maryborough Mining Warden
