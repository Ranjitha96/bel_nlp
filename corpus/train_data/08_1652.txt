a receipt has come home the enquiry is focused upon the general understanding among practical business people as to whether the receipt has come home for the separate use  benefit and disposal of the taxpayer  Arthur Murray at   Montgomery at     A receipt will not come home where the amount received is affected by a legal or equitable restriction affecting the separate use  benefit or enjoyment

Accounting   Law Book Company  Sydney   at      For example  where the receipt is affected by a constructive trust  see  MacFarlane v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   or where the recipient

or contractual obligations to the taxpayer  see Prior at   or   b  it would be unsound from a business or legal perspective  to recognise the receipt as income because the receipt did not give a  substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer s true income  see Carden at   Arthur Murray at   Ballarat Brewing Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       The consequence is that BARM derived income represented by the management fees payable pursuant to the Syndicate Deeds  subject to the operation of the   Arthur Murray principle  discussed below  at the time at which the management fees became due to it by Participants  so understood  neither the time at which the payment obligation was discharged  nor the mode by which the payment obligation was discharged  were matters which affected the derivation by BARM of the income represented by the management fees   The present state of authority recognises only a very limited class of cases in that payments may be actually received by a taxpayer  but only derived as income at later points in time  The relevant class of cases are those coming within the principle recognised in Arthur Murray    It is not disputed here that  to the extent that BARM received management fees in one year that related in part to the provision by it of management services in the next year  the principle recognised in Arthur Murray would apply to defer the derivation of that part of the management fees until the later year  when the services in connection with those management fees were actually performed  Indeed  that is how it returned the income represented by the management fees   The present case is  however  an attempt by BARM in reliance on Arthur Murray   to advance a broader proposition  namely  that notwithstanding   i  the incurring by Participants of debts in favour of BARM in respect of management fees  and   ii  the discharge of those debts by delivery of the bills to BARM   there was no derivation of income by BARM in respect of the management fees   Unlike Arthur Murray   the foundation for this broader proposition does not relate to the time of performance by BARM of the management services  Rather  it rests on the following circumstances   a  BARM s conduct in entering into commercial transactions  i e  loans  that were distinct and separate from the provision of the management services   b  the utilisation of the consideration received by BARM from Participants in respect of management fees in making those loans to PGF  and   c  the circumstance that  by agreement with the borrower  PGF  BARM had limited or restricted its ability to enforce repayment of the loans   The Commissioner submitted that the flaw in BARM s argument is that it attempts to conflate  for taxation purposes  the consequences of distinct and separate transactions being   i  the arrangement under which BARM provided management services to the Participants  and   ii  the arrangement under which BARM made loans to PGF   The first of those arrangements resulted in BARM agreeing to perform management activities which constituted the provision of services in the ordinary course of the business that it carried on and that resulted in the Participants discharging their payment obligations to it   The argument underlying alternative   involves the deferral of derivation of income represented by the management fees to the time BARM receives payments of interest and repayments of principal on the deposit with PGF  For an accruals basis taxpayer  the point of derivation of such income would normally be  as the Commissioner contended  when the management fees fell due  subject of course to the principle that comes out of Arthur Murray that  even if received  there will be no derivation until the receipt is earned  As indicated in   above  that latter principle was observed in the way in which BARM returned the income represented by the management fees   The argument for deferral to the time BARM receives payments of interest and repayments of principal on the deposit with PGF is said to      look to realities  to use the words of Rich J in Prior at    What it effectively asserts is that BARM should be treated as a cash basis taxpayer in respect of such income and then only for the amount of money received  Reliance for this argument is placed on the process of reasoning in Arthur Murray   albeit for a very different principle  Prior and Barratt   I deal with each of these cases below   Whatever else it might support  nothing was said in Arthur Murray which supports the argument underlying alternative    Arthur Murray was a case stated by Barwick CJ in five pending appeals from decisions of the Board of Review  The facts relevant to the only question that had to be formally answered were few and simple  They are recited in the judgment of the Court in the following terms at    In the relevant years the company carried on a business of giving courses of tuition in dancing for fees of varying amounts per hour  What the case describes as basic courses of tuition available consisted of     or   hours of private tuition to be taken by appointment within a year  though some students contracted for a course of   hours  tuition to be taken at any time during the student s lifetime  Payment for a course of lessons was often made in advance  either in the form of a lump sum or by instalments  a variable discount being allowed for immediate payment  For example  the fee for a lifetime course of   hours was  sterling  reducible to  sterling  for immediate payment  The student was given no contractual right to a refund in the event of his not completing the course  indeed the form of contract in general use denied any such right  though in practice refunds were sometimes given  In the company s books  fees were credited immediately upon their being received to an account styled  Unearned deposits  Untaught Lessons Account  and from that account amounts corresponding with lessons taught were periodically transferred to the credit of an account styled  Earned Tuition Account   The company made up its income tax returns on the footing that fees received in advance of tuition formed no part of its assessable income at the moment of receipt  but became such as and when earned by the giving of the lessons  The Commissioner  on the other hand  made the relevant assessments upon the view that fees received in advance of tuition possessed the character of assessable income in the company s hands from the moment of receipt  so that in respect of a given year of income there was no need to distinguish between fees for which lessons had been given during the year and fees for which at the end of the year the lessons still remained to be given  The question to be decided is  in effect  whether on the facts as stated it is open to the Justice hearing the appeals to uphold the Commissioner s view   The Court answered that question  no  by declaring that on the facts appearing in the case stated the conclusion is not open that a receipt of fees for a specified number of dancing lessons to be given over a period subsequent to the receipt is a derivation of assessable income  In the course of their reasons  the Court said at    Nothing in the Act is contradicted or ignored when a receipt of money as a prepayment under a contract for future services is said not to constitute by itself a derivation of assessable income  On the contrary  if the statement accords with ordinary business concepts in the community  and we are bound by the case stated to accept that it does  it applies the provisions of the Act according to their true meaning   Earlier in their reasons  the Court had said at    As Dixon J  observed in Carden s Case   Speaking generally  in the assessment of income the object is to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realized or immediately realizable form   The word  gains  is not here used in the sense of the net profits of the business  for the topic under discussion is assessable income  that is to say gross income  But neither is it synonymous with  receipts   It refers to amounts which have not only been received but have  come home  to the taxpayer  and that must surely involve  if the word  income  is to convey the notion it expresses in the practical affairs of business life  not only that the amounts received are unaffected by legal restrictions  as by reason of a trust or charge in favour of the payer  not only that they have been received beneficially  but that the situation has been reached in which they may properly be counted as gains completely made  so that there is neither legal nor business unsoundness in regarding them without qualification as income derived   In my view  there is no process of reasoning in  or principle coming out of  Arthur Murray which supports the argument underlying alternative    And this would be the case whether BARM is an accruals basis or cash basis taxpayer  assuming of course that the principle coming out of Arthur Murray applies equally to both  While Arthur Murray concerned an accruals basis taxpayer  there seems to be no reason why the principle does not equally apply to a cash basis taxpayer   Prior concerned a cash basis taxpayer who  during his lifetime  was a member of a partnership which was dissolved by a deed  His sole co partner had borrowed money from him on his private account and the deceased had lent money to the partnership  An account was made up of the dealings between them on the dissolution and the result was shown as leaving the co partner indebted to the deceased in the sum of  sterling  which included a sum of  sterling  made up of two amounts     sterling  interest  said to be owing at   August   by the co partner on his personal account      sterling  interest  said to be the deceased s half share of the interest owing to him by the partnership at the time    By the deed  he undertook a personal liability to the deceased for the amount and secured it over a certain property already mortgaged  for part of the sum  The property was actually worth only  sterling  and by reason of his financial position the co partner was unable to pay even the arrears of interest included in the sum and no payment had ever been made in respect of the sum   The Commissioner contended that the interest referred to represented interest derived by the deceased during the account period ended   June   but capitalised by means of the deed dated the   August   affecting the dissolution of the partnership  Under the deed  the interest had been carried to the capital account   In conclusion  my view is that  consistent with BARM being an accruals basis taxpayer  the income represented by the management fees was derived by BARM when those fees fell due  or  in the case of fees which related to the provision of services in a year of income after the year in which the fees fell due  consistent with the principle that comes out of Arthur Murray   in the year of income in which those services were provided  That is  as I understand the evidence  how BARM returned the income represented by the management fees  Even if BARM were to be taxed on the management fee income as a cash basis taxpayer  and as indicated in   above  I do not think such a basis is appropriate  that would only defer derivation to the date of delivery of the bills of exchange or  in the case of fees which related to the provision of services in a year of income after the year in which the fees were received  consistent with the principle that comes out of Arthur Murray   in the year of income in which these services were provided   Moreover  in the absence of evidence that the money value of the bills at the time of delivery to BARM was less than their face value  no deferral would also result in a reduction in the quantum of the amount derived   BARM s position in relation to Issue   cannot be sustained  and it follows that its position in relation to Issue   must also fail citedBallarat Brewing Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Further  even where there is no legal or equitable restriction affecting the receipt  the receipt may not come home where     a  the practical  realities  prevent the taxpayer from the separate use  benefit or enjoyment of a gain because the obligor cannot meet their legal or contractual obligations to the taxpayer  see Prior at   or   b  it would be unsound from a business or legal perspective  to recognise the receipt as income because the receipt did not give a  substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer s true income  see Carden at   Arthur Murray at   Ballarat Brewing Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       This is illustrated by the approach to income recognition in the area of insurance  It is accepted that  in an appropriate case  the aggregate of insurance premiums received by an insurer in a year of income does not give a substantially correct reflex of that insurer s income because of the contingencies affecting those premiums  see Sun Insurance Office v Clark   AC   at       and     approved in Ballarat Brewing and Carden  citedBarclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd v

Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at       The Commissioner submitted that it is a fundamental defect in BARM s argument that it impermissibly seeks to make derivation of the income amount  the debt payment in respect of management services  dependent upon the capacity to recover the capital asset arising from investment of the income  the debt owing by PGF   Apart from the illogicality of the contended dependence  it is relevant to note that even if there had been an impediment to recovery of the debt on income account  that would not lead to the result that it would not have been derived as income  In Barratt at   Gummow J  Northrop and Drummond JJ agreeing  drew attention to the distinction between   a  the situation where a debt has not come into existence  with the result that income will not have been derived  an example of which was Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Gas Light Co     FLR   and    b  the situation where a debt has come into existence  but there is an impediment to recovery  Accordingly  statutory prohibitions against recovery of fees for medical services pursuant to s   of the Medical Practitioners Act    NSW  were only impediments to enforcement that did not lead to the result that taxpayers assessable on an accruals basis had not derived the fees as income   The argument for deferral to the time BARM receives payments of interest and repayments of principal on the deposit with PGF is said to      look to realities  to use the words of Rich J in Prior at    What it effectively asserts is that BARM should be treated as a cash basis taxpayer in respect of such income and then only for the amount of money received  Reliance for this argument is placed on the process of reasoning in Arthur Murray   albeit for a very different principle  Prior and Barratt   I deal with each of these cases below   Barratt was concerned with whether an accruals basis of tax accounting was appropriate for a partnership of medical practitioners carrying on a pathology practice where the partnership required the use of large and expensive equipment and laboratory  courier and clerical services which were provided by service entities associated with the partners  A Full Court of this Court held that it was and dismissed the taxpayer s appeal  The principal judgment was given by Gummow J with whom Northrop and Drummond JJ agreed but  with respect  it does not shine any light on the appropriateness of the principle put forward by BARM that is alternative   citedBrogden v Metropolitan Railway     AC   The authorities support the proposition that an agreement may be implied from the acts and conduct of the parties even where the strictures of offer and acceptance cannot be strictly proven  see Brogden v Metropolitan Railway     AC   at             Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp  Aust  Pty Ltd     B P R   at   Pobjie Agencies v Vinidex Tubemakers   Aust Contract R     at     see also Vroon v Foster s Brewing Group Ltd     VR   at   referred toCommissioner of Taxation v Dunn     ALR   Expert accounting evidence was called by BARM in support of the argument underlying alternative   from Professor Robert Walker  the Professor of Accounting in the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Sydney  The Commissioner relied on expert accounting evidence from Mr Wayne Lonergan to deny the appropriateness of any financial accounting treatment consistent with the argument underlying alternative    With respect to both experts  I did not find their evidence provided me with any constructive assistance in resolving the issues raised by BARM s arguments  In any event  as Davies J observed in Commissioner of Taxation v Dunn     ALR   at        ordinary accounting principles and practices are not determinative of the issue  they are relevant and may be influential  as Dixon J in Carden s case  at   and Barwick CJ  Kitto and Taylor

that it is a fundamental defect in BARM s argument that it impermissibly seeks to make derivation of the income amount  the debt payment in respect of management services  dependent upon the capacity to recover the capital asset arising from investment of the income  the debt owing by PGF   Apart from the illogicality of the contended dependence  it is relevant to note that even if there had been an impediment to recovery of the debt on income account  that would not lead to the result that it would not have been derived as income  In Barratt at   Gummow J  Northrop and Drummond JJ agreeing  drew attention to the distinction between   a  the situation where a debt has not come into existence  with the result that income will not have been derived  an example of which was Federal

by it of income represented by the management fees  see G P  International Pipecoaters    The High Court noted in G P  International Pipecoaters at      The question in this appeal is the character of the establishment costs as receipts in the hands of the taxpayer  Whether or not a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient  Scott v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR     per Windeyer J  The relevant question is not the character of the expenditure by SECWA A receipt may be income in the hands of a payee whether or not it is expenditure of a capital nature by the payer  Nor is the relevant question the nature of the expenditure made by the taxpayer in the construction of the plant  A taxpayer may apply income in the acquisition of a capital asset or  conversely  apply a capital receipt to discharge a liability of a non capital nature  As Cozens Hardy MR observed in Hudson s Bay Co v Stevens       if the money is otherwise liable to income tax it cannot escape taxation by reason of its being applied to a capital purpose   And thus a receipt may be income although the recipient is bound to apply it for the purpose of discharging a capital liability  Mersey Docks v Lucas     App Cas   at       Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Corporation of London  as Conservators of Epping Forest      TC   at    The Commissioner and the taxpayer both treated the cost of constructing the plant as capital expenditure  but the question is not whether that was an expenditure of capital nor whether the plant was used for the purpose of producing assessable income so that depreciation of the plant was deductible under s   of the Act  The relevant question is whether the receipt of the establishment costs was income in the taxpayer s hands  It is necessary to keep that question steadily in mind and not to confuse the character of the receipt with the nature of the asset acquired by application of the moneys received  The appellant s argument was  in substance  that the plant was a capital asset  that the moneys expended in its construction were an expenditure of a capital nature by the taxpayer and that  as those moneys were received for the purpose of expenditure on the construction of the plant  their receipt was a receipt of capital  The first two steps may be accepted but the final step assumes that  when money is received for the purpose of its being expended by the recipient  the  character of the receipt is necessarily determined by the character of its proposed expenditure by the recipient  That assumption is erroneous and  even if the establishment costs were received for the purpose of expenditure on the construction of the plant  it does not necessarily follow that their receipt was a receipt of capital  Before turning to the character of the receipt  it is desirable first to consider the means by which the character of expenditure may be determined    emphasis added  The taxation consequences of the loans to PGF must be addressed independently of the taxation consequences of the provision of management services  The loans to PGF were transactions that   a  had to be evaluated separately as coming within the capital gains regimes under the ITAA   and the ITAA   and   b  represented a use of the consideration received from Participants in respect of management fees  by way of investment for income earning purposes   c  had the result that BARM incurred capital losses to the extent that there existed limited recourse provisions which had the consequences that loans to PGF were not repaid in full citedHenderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In respect of an accruals basis taxpayer  the time of derivation will normally be the time when a recoverable debt arises  Barratt at     Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at     referred toHowland Rose and Ors v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In the course of its submission  BARM noted that in Howland Rose and Ors v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR     Conti J dealt with the tax position of four participants in BPS  in what amounted to a test case for BPS and the subsequent Budplans  His Honour held that the participants were not entitled to allowable deductions under s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   ITAA       in respect of the  management fees  or  research fees  paid by them  A review of his Honour s reasons does not indicate than any issue arose in that case as to the quantum of the outgoings claimed to be incurred  only their characterisation in terms of the section of the statute   BPS was established by a prospectus dated   December    Prospectus  and a trust deed dated the same date between BARM  ATTORI  ARG and each participant  the Trust Deed  once he or she signed the  Principal Deed  referred to below   Participants in BPS executed the following documents    an application form that is found at page   of the Prospectus  Application Form    the Principal Deed that is found at

Commissioner s primary submission is that the mode of discharge of payment of the management fees is irrelevant to the issue of derivation by BARM  the mode of discharge adopted  utilising bills of exchange  had the consequence that payments in the amounts shown on the bills of exchange  i e  full payment of the management fees instalments  are to be taken as having been made to BARM on the dates on which the bills of exchange were delivered to it  Howland Rose at     Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     referred toIntegrated Computer Services Pty

cth HCA  html  On the other hand  contrary to the submission in   and   above  BARM s alternative   does require a disregard of the legal relationships created by the relevant instruments  it requires a conflation of separate transactions  albeit financially dependent separate transactions  and taxation by reference to the end economic result of that conflation  That is equally impermissible  While not directly in point  it has a resonance with the alternative argument that was put to the High Court in Investment Merchant Finance Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   where the assessment in question was sought to be upheld on the footing that the transaction  as a whole   was the carrying out of a profit making scheme for the purposes of s  a  of the ITAA   and that  in determining the profit derived from the scheme  the dividend received should be brought into account rather than being treated as itself  assessable income in accordance with s   of the ITAA   in particular  see Menzies J at    That alternative argument was rejected by all members of the Court   Of course  there will be cases where the Parliament mandates such treatment  The example that comes most readily to mind is the consolidation regime in Part III   of the ITAA     Alternative   rather than avoiding a  blinkered  view of the transaction as submitted by BARM  does just that by requiring a  closing of the eyes  to the separate transactions that took place  Contentions that alternative   recognises the reality of the transaction  as a whole  elides what that involves conflation of separate  albeit financially dependent  transactions  and taxation by reference to the end economic result  Like taxation by reference to economic equivalence  it must be rejected
