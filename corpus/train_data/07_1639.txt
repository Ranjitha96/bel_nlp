HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Although the phrase  carries on a business  appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s  B  it is not defined in the Act  However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case  They are as follows      Business  in the context of s  B is normally a  wide and general  word  Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   McHugh ACJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power   CLR at    Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s   since  business  includes  a business not carried on for profit  NT Power   CLR at        The phrase  carries on a business  should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s  B and related legislation  which was to ensure that  with state and territory application legislation  the prohibitions against anti competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia    Australia  House of Representatives  Parliamentary Debates  Hansard    June   p        Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses  in the context of the TPA   carrying on a business  is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern  GEC Marconi Systems Pty

However  activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes  carrying on a business   Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty

 Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business  further  although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions  JS McMillan   FCR at   GEC Marconi Systems   FCR at   Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA   at    consideredAdamson v West Perth Football Club     ALR   Although the term  competitor  has received no judicial attention that I can identify  the word  competition  has  in the context of Pt IV TPA  So in Adamson v West Perth Football Club     ALR   at   Northrop J said     When used in s   of the Act  the word is used in a commercial or economic sense  Thus in order to have competition in a market  there must be substitution between one product and another and between one source of supply and another in response to changing prices or the quality of the product being supplied   I have already expressed the view that the respondent is not  carrying on a business  within the meaning of s  B TPA in relation to its supply of data in response to individual searches  which forms the primary activity of the respondent in the Retail Market  If the respondent is not carrying on a business  the question immediately arises whether the respondent is capable of being a  competitor  of the applicant in the Retail Market for the purposes of s  a  in respect of this particular conduct of the respondent  In my opinion  the obvious answer in this case is that the respondent is not the respondent is fulfilling a statutory function in supplying that data  and is subject to legislative control in respect of prices charged and product quality  There are  however  some elements of  competition  as between the applicant and the respondent as submitted by the applicant  particularly in relation to issues of product substitution  In the event that I am in error in relation to whether the respondent is carrying on a business in relation to its supply of data  then as I have done elsewhere in this judgment I propose to continue to consider whether  within the meaning of s  a  the applicant is a  competitor  of the respondent in the Retail Market   Further  I have also said that the evidence before me does not support a finding that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  Irrespective whether the respondent has any power in the Retail Market flowing from its power in the Wholesale Market as a monopoly supplier  this does not equate to the respondent being a  competitor  of the applicant in the Retail Market   To date the activities of the applicant and the respondent have been at different points on an economic continuum  with different product offerings  different levels of sophistication of products  different client bases  and apparently minimal overlap  The value added products of the applicant appear to have little in common with such products of the respondent as SmartMap  or the raw data supplied in response to statutory searches  The applicant and the respondent have not been  rivals  in the Retail Market in the sense of being entities who strive to outdo each other  see discussion by Professor Stephen Corones Competition Law in Australia  th ed  Lawbook Co    at    Nor  as the respondent submitted with reference to statements of Mr Catelan and the applicant in its Information Memorandum  does the applicant perceive the respondent as its competitor in the Retail Market   Nonetheless there is commonality in the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market in that both supply data sourced from the respondent  and it appears that the Excluded Data at present can be obtained by customers of the applicant from either the applicant or the respondent  In that sense there is presently the potential of substitution between one source of supply and another of that data as contemplated in Adamson   Although the competition appears in the present environment to be minimal  leaving aside for the moment issues arising out of s  B TPA  I am prepared to assume that the applicant is a  competitor  of the respondent in the Retail Market   Can the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging the applicant as a competitor in the Retail Market be inferred  However  irrespective whether applicant and the respondent are competitors in the Retail Market  in my view the alleged purpose of the respondent as claimed by the applicant is neither demonstrated by the evidence  nor can it be inferred from the respondent s conduct  In fact  the evidence demonstrates unambiguously that the purpose claimed by the respondent in engaging in the conduct the subject of complaint was in truth its purpose  This is so on any view of the meaning of the word  purpose  and regardless whether the interpretation submitted by the applicant or the respondent as to the meaning of  purpose  in s   is accepted  The object in view or sought to be achieved by the conduct of the respondent was clearly to ensure that Collected Data could not be used by anyone for the purpose of direct marketing to consumers  It was for this reason  and this reason alone  that the respondent took advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market  This purpose is not a proscribed purpose within the meaning of s  a  TPA  The respondent did not engage in the relevant conduct for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging the applicant as a competitor in the Retail Market   I form this view for the following reasons  taking into consideration relevant submissions of the applicant in relation to this claim citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd     ALR   Section   is found in Pt IV TPA  However the extended application only operates if the Crown in right of the relevant State or Territory is carrying on a business  either directly or by an authority of the State of Territory  As is clear from such cases as NT Power   CLR  particularly at   and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd     ALR    particularly at     this condition is strictly applied   Section  c  must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA  As pointed out by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway   CLR at        Section   aims to promote competition  not the private interests of particular persons or corporations    cf Boral   CLR   per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at   Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   McHugh J at     Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare   ALR at   Rural Press   FCAFC   at     Universal Music   FCR at   and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp      It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market  Like s  a  the breadth of application of s  c  is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant  cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd  t as Auto Fashions Australia  v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Toohey J in Ross Payne   Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported  Federal Court of Australia    August   Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd     ALR   at    Accordingly  it is within the scope of s  c  that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s  c  because  inter alia   its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market   First  while I accept that  as a result of the respondent s proposal  the applicant will not be able to continue to provide services to its customers which include the Excluded Data  and that this may impact upon the business of the applicant as claimed in para  b  of the amended statement of claim  the applicant must demonstrate more than this effect to show that the purpose of the respondent s conduct was in breach of s  c   As pointed out by Lee J in NT Power Generation v Power   Water Authority   FCAFC   at     although the effect of conduct may  in some circumstances  explain or reveal the purpose of the conduct  the inference may be negated by other material relevant to the issue of purpose  cf Photo Continental Pty Ltd v Sony  Australia  Pty Ltd   ATPR     at      It is the purposeful conduct of the contravening corporation that attracts the operation of s  c  Baxter Healthcare   ALR at   appliedAustralian

Melway   CLR at    take advantage of  does not mean anything materially different from  use  and does not require conduct which is predatory or morally blameworthy  per Mason CJ and Wilson J at   Deane J at   Dawson J at   Toohey J at      cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC   at      In terms of s   it does  however  entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment  and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s    So  as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd     ALR    at   subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser   HCA       CLR    at      If the impugned conduct has a business rationale  that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power  If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment  it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power   So  to paraphrase Heerey J in ACCC v Boral   ALR   as adopted by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser   HCA       CLR   was the conduct of the respondent taking advantage of its market power in withdrawing the supply of the Excluded Data  such that an entity with no substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market would not  as a matter of commercial judgment  engage in that conduct citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  However  notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant  I am not persuaded that the purpose of the respondent was to deter or prevent the applicant from engaging in conduct which was competitive with the conduct of the respondent when it discharged its statutory function of providing names and addresses in response to statutory searches in the Retail Market  Similarly  it cannot be said that the proposal of the respondent had the purpose of deterring or preventing the applicant from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market to the benefit of other licensees the proposal to exclude the Excluded Data from the data supplied by the respondent was identical in respect of all licensees  So  for example  in my view the purpose of the respondent in this case was not to gain a competitive advantage in the Retail Market over the applicant in relation to the Excluded Data or to deter the applicant from discounting prices of its product to competitors of the respondent  cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at      I form this view for the following reasons citedAustralian Gas Light Company  ACN       v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  However  with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  In particular  I note the following    In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement  the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that  because of the respondent s substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market   it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market   The respondent points out however  that the experts do not say that the respondent has a  substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market  This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent s substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market  Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market  TS p   ll     and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  TS p   ll         Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a  downstream  retail market is a relatively common phenomenon  and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court  for example  in the context of claims of alleged anti competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA   Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA     in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA   Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal   FCAFC     and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition   Australian Gas Light Company  ACN       v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission  No     FCA    However  the ability of an entity to  substantially influence patterns of competition  in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market  as agreed by the experts  is not  in my view  necessarily tantamount to  a substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market or even  as submitted by the respondent   market power  within the meaning of the s   TPA     As I have already noted  the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different  supplying different services to different customers  It is not in contention before me that there is  a  Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information  However  whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product  it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base  namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant s services  as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter  It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market  RP Data Information Memorandum Document   pp     evidence of Mr Catelan TS p   ll      In this respect  the  market power  of the respondent in the Retail Market  viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market  is not obvious  Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end users  it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd     FCR       I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  Further  I note that  notwithstanding para   of the amended statement of claim  Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant s case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  note TS p   ll         I also note that      o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement  TS p   ll     p   ll     Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  o Mr Jackson QC  in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market  confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts  and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market      I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement  I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market     As pointed out in Queensland Wire   the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing  barriers to entry  market share  However in this case I note  for example  that      a  no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent  b  although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent  there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers  c  no evidence is lead as to market share  if any  in the Retail Market held by the respondent consideredAustralasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Ceridale Pty Ltd     ALR   A number of submissions were made the respondent in relation to these claims  In particular     The respondent s proposal to withdraw the Excluded Data from the Collected Data supplied to licensees does not prevent real estate agents from engaging in direct marketing  The proposal merely prevents persons  including real estate agents  from using data collected by the Department being used for purposes other than those contemplated by ss   and  A  VL Act   There is no deterrence on real estate agents and others direct marketing by  for example  newsletter drops  newsletters and so on      Evidence of witnesses of the respondent was that the purpose of the respondent was to try and stop direct marketing using the Department s data sets rather than stop direct marketing activities of real estate agents per se   So  for example  at the hearing  evidence of Mr Rush was as follows       And specifically  you wanted to stop direct marketing by real estate agents     I wanted to stop direct marketing using government sourced information         Similarly  Mr Fry gave evidence as follows   TS p   ll            But how do you know that it s going to stop direct marketing by simply taking it out of the hands of the six licensees who you ve licensed to obtain bulk data     We re not saying we are trying to stop direct marketing in total  We are saying we are trying to stop direct marketing using this data set from our Department    TS p   l        On the evidence there appears to be no prohibition on anyone using information obtained directly from either the respondent or a third party  for example  local government authorities  in direct marketing activities  The effect of the prohibition is that a person cannot use for direct marketing purposes information obtained through a distributor such as the applicant      A distinction needs to be made between the purpose of the proposal of the respondent and the effect of it if implemented  The sole purpose of the Department is the prevention of the misuse of the Excluded Data and the protection of privacy of individuals and businesses that have provided  compulsorily  information to the respondent  The proposal  if implemented  may have the effect of preventing or deterring certain competitive conduct such as direct marketing  by closing off one source of names and addresses  but that the proposal might have that effect is irrelevant if the purpose for its implementation was not to deter or prevent competition  which is the case here      This case is no different to that encountered by the Full Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Ceridale Pty Ltd     ALR        The respondent supplies a product  the QVAS database  which is compiled for purposes which do not include direct marketing  The respondent is entitled to prevent the misuse of its information for a purpose for which the information was not collected      The licence agreement emphasises that data supplied may only be used for certain purposes  Clause     of the   Licence states       It s a non exclusive  non transferable licence to use the licence data for the purposes specified in the agreement  subject to the terms and conditions     Further  cl       provides   The agreement does not confer on the licensee any rights of ownership in the licensed data  and all intellectual property rights  including copyright in the licensed data  are unaffected by this agreement   No evidence was produced at the trial demonstrating that real estate agents who are customers of the applicant and who engage in direct marketing activities utilise data sourced from the respondent  Indeed it would be difficult to produce such evidence it is clear from the terms of the   Licence Agreement that the applicant is contractually obliged to ensure that its customers  including real estate agents  do not use the information for such purposes  and presumably any direct marketing activity engaged in by real estate agents who are customers of the applicant would be in breach of their own agreement with the applicant   In my view the following issues are clear   Third  while in the absence of evidence to the contrary I accept that the most likely persons affected in their direct marketing activities by the withdrawal of the Excluded Data would be real estate agents  I accept the respondent s submission that this is an effect rather than the purpose of the respondent s conduct  I also consider that principles articulated by the Full Court in Ceridale   ALR   are relevant here   In Ceridale   ALR   the Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd  APRA  owned copyright of public performances in nearly all current popular copyright music  and the respondents were all persons associated with premises within which the subject works had been performed without the licence of APRA  APRA would grant  inter alia   licences in respect of premises to play recorded music  the use of a background music system  and live performances with respect to works over which APRA held copyright  The respondents were persons associated with premises within which works over which APRA held copyright had been performed  The licence held by the first respondent was terminated by APRA on account of non payment of outstanding licence fees  Further dispute between the parties led to APRA filing a notice of motion seeking summary judgment with injunctive relief  In relation to s     his Honour said that APRA had the monopoly control over the market concerning the supply of the performing rights of music played to patrons in nightclubs and discotheques  and the refusal to grant a customer such as the defendants a licence which would enable the customer to obtain that commodity was plainly an exercise of market power  at      His Honour also found that it was no answer to a complaint of a contravention of s   that the corporation was only taking advantage of a legal right  at   and in this case the proper characterisation of APRA s actions was that it was taking advantage of its powers in the market to prevent the defendants from engaging in competitive conduct in another market simply in order to collect a disputed debt  at    The trial judge refused to grant an injunction  the object and effect of which was to force a business to pay a debt which was subject to a genuine dispute   Wilcox  Spender and Pincus JJ allowed the appeal of APRA  In particular at     their Honours said     There is no doubt  in the present case  that APRA enjoys a substantial degree of power amounting indeed to dominance in the market for music rights  It would seem that  in practical terms  it would be impossible for a nightclub or discotheque to survive without using music of the appellant  Accordingly  APRA is a corporation to which section   applies  But we are unable to agree that  upon the facts of this case  APRA has been guilty of any of the proscribed acts  The only suggested conduct was a contravention of para  c  that is that APRA had denied licences  for the purpose of deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market  the relevant  person  being each of the respondents and the relevant  other market  being the nightclub or discotheque market  We agree that the granting of an injunction might have the effect of preventing the respondents from competing in those markets  But there is no basis for saying that this was APRA s purpose  APRA had nothing to gain by putting the respondents out of business  On the contrary  it was in the interests of APRA to maximise the number of users of its material  so long as they paid licence fees  APRA s purpose was merely to prevent unauthorised use of its material and the integrity of its licensing system     emphasis added  In my view the comments of their Honours I have italicised are of particular relevance in this case before me  The evidence is overwhelming that the purpose of the respondent was to prevent misuse of its database  in circumstances where legislatively supported contractual provisions in the licence agreements appear not to have been successful in preventing that misuse  Indeed  in my view it is fair to say that as a general proposition  provided they did not misuse Departmental data  the respondent had nothing to gain by deterring or preventing the participants in the Real Estate Agents  Services Markets from engaging in competitive conduct in those markets   Fourth  irrespective whether during the  s the Department may have had no qualms concerning its database being used for direct marketing purposes by real estate agents as claimed by Mr Catelan  TS p   ll     and conceded by Mr Witt  TS p   ll     and p   ll     it appears that by October   the Department was concerned about misuse of the data for direct marketing as a general proposition  for example  evidence of Mr Fry TS p   ll      This concern is reflected in the enactment of s  A  VL Act   introduced into the VL Act in May   which specifically required the inclusion in any contract for the supply of information a provision allowing the chief executive of the respondent to exclude particulars of valuation roll information if satisfied  on reasonable grounds  that inclusion of the particulars may result in the particulars being inappropriately disclosed or used  The clear purpose in the conduct of the respondent has been to ensure that the respondent s database should not be misused  by anyone   While real estate agents may be the most affected group  in my view this does not mean that the purpose of the respondent is to deter real estate agents engaging in competitive conduct in the relevant market   A threshold issue in these proceedings was whether the respondent was bound at all by s   TPA  because it is not a  corporation  as required by that section  I formed the view early in this judgment that   a  conduct of the respondent in the Wholesale Market in supplying Collected Data to the applicants and others did constitute the carrying on of a business by the respondent for the purposes of s  B TPA  with the result that the respondent was bound by s   in respect of this conduct  but   b  the supply by the respondent of data in response to individual searches in the Retail Market was not subject to s   TPA because  in so doing  the respondent was not  carrying on a business  as contemplated by s  B   Although the respondent clearly has a substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market  and it did take advantage of that power  in my view it did not take advantage of that power for purposes proscribed by s   TPA   Accordingly  the claim of the applicant fails  and is dismissed with costs   THE COURT ORDERS THAT         The application filed   March   is dismissed      The applicant pay the respondent s costs of and incidental to the application  to be taxed if not otherwise agreed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and eighty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

The necessity for competition to exist before a  market  is constituted was emphasised in Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR    As Gleeson CJ and Callinan J observed     A market is an area of close competition  a field of rivalry  As the passage from Re Queensland Co Operative Milling Association Ltd quoted above indicates  and as s   recognises  both the supply side and the demand side are relevant to an assessment of the market  It does not solve  but merely re states  the problem to speak of sub markets  There may be a wider  and a narrower  area of rivalry  but  if the narrowest area itself constitutes a market  then it is power and conduct in that area that must be examined    at      cf Deane J in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   However as was pointed by the High Court in Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   and subsequently reiterated by the majority

and Wilson J at   Deane J at   Dawson J at   Toohey J at      cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC   at      In terms of s   it does  however  entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment  and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s    So  as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd     ALR    at   subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser   HCA       CLR    at      If the impugned conduct has a business rationale  that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power  If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment  it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power   So  to paraphrase Heerey J in ACCC v Boral   ALR   as adopted by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser   HCA       CLR   was the conduct of the respondent taking advantage of its market power in withdrawing the supply of the Excluded Data  such that an entity with no substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market would not  as a matter of commercial judgment  engage in that conduct  In relation to identifying the  purpose  of the respondent  as illustrated by the cases listed in Miller s Annotated Trade Practices Act  th edition para       the weight of authority indicates that the relevant purpose is to be identified on the basis of a subjective test rather than objectively  although purpose may be established by inference from the conduct of the respondent  s    As Toohey J observed in Queensland Wire   CLR  the reference to  for the purpose of  carries with it the notion of an intent to achieve the result spoken of in each of the paragraphs in s    at

Dalgety Australia Ltd     FCR   The notion of  market power  in the sense of capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors has been the subject of frequent judicial consideration  The leading case in this context is Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR    Usefully  Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd     FCR   at   summarised from the judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J in Queensland Wire   CLR at     the following factors as relevant in defining and identifying market power     a   the ability of a firm to raise prices above the supply cost without rivals taking away customers in due time  supply cost being the minimum cost an efficient firm would incur in producing the product   b   the extent to which the conduct of  any of the respondents  in that market is constrained by the conduct of   competitors or potential competitors      s    c  market share of each respondent must be examined but this alone is generally not determinative of market power as  the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed   Mason CJ and Wilson J adopted the language of Reed J in United States v Columbia Steel Co     US   at    d  the presence of vertical integration is another factor  but its presence does not necessarily mean that a substantial degree of power exists  and   e  to what extent is it rational or possible for new entrants to enter the relevant market  That is to say  what are the barriers to entry  It is this factor which must be taken as the primary consideration in determining market power  See also the judgment of the Full Court of this court in Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission at FCR       The respondent relied on comments of Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety   FCR at   where his Honour said that  purpose  in s    is not concerned directly with the effect of conduct  but with the purpose in the sense of motivation and reason  though  as mentioned earlier  purpose may be inferred from conduct    The applicant in para   of the amended statement of claim alleges that the respondent has so acted for the following purposes     a  for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging RP Data in the Market or the Retail Market   b  for the purpose of deterring or preventing RP Data from engaging in competitive conduct in the Market or the Retail Market  Particulars        i  The fact that the Department has this purpose is to be inferred from             A  the effect of the proposal as set out in paragraphs   and   hereof   B  the Department  through Colin Witt  has evinced an intention to harm and prevent RP Data competing in the market place by           I  offering Infopac favourable terms in order to compete with RP Data   II  informing John Edwards of Residex that the Department had an intention to reduce the cost of the Collected Data so as to break RP Data s monopoly          C  Wayne Fry and Geoff Oakley on   February   stating to Jane Woodward of RP Data that if RP Data did not agree to the new licence conditions that they would not receive any Collected Data in the future             ii  The purpose is that of the persons set out in paragraph   above   iii  The competitive conduct of RP Data which it is the Department s purpose to deter or prevent RP Data from engaging in is the provision electronically of the Collected Data including the Excluded Data             A  in competition with the Department   B  in competition with other licensees          ba  for the purpose of deterring or preventing real estate agents from direct marketing to owners of real property using the Excluded Data   bb  for the purpose of deterring or preventing real estate agents thereby from engaging in competitive conduct in the Real Estate Agents  Services Markets   The respondent in its amended defence denied that it has acted in the manner alleged by the applicant  and states in para   that its purpose in proposing to exclude the Excluded Data from the Collected Data available under future licences is to ensure that such information in bulk data form is not available for direct marketing purposes citedEastern Express Pty Ltd v General Newspapers Pty Ltd     FCR   The reference in s   to a  substantial degree  of market power was considered by the Full Court in Eastern Express Pty Ltd v General Newspapers Pty Ltd     FCR   at   where Lockhart and Gummow JJ said     For a corporation to have a substantial degree of market power it must have a considerable or large degree of such power  The difficulty lies not in defining the word  substantial  but in applying the concept of a substantial degree of market power to the circumstances of each case and in identifying whether the requisite degree of market power exists  This is a relative concept    cf Wilcox  French and Gyles JJ in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at       Finally  as was explained in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill   Explanatory Memorandum     Market power  is a recognised economic concept which has been subject to considerable analysis in economic literature  at       The use of the word  degree  in the expression  degree of power in a market  reflects the fact that  market power  is a relative concept  All participants in a market possess a degree of market power which may range from negligible to very great  at       The circumstances which give rise to absence of competitive constraint upon a corporation are diverse  They are not confined to size or market share in relation to competitors  or to those matters combined with technical knowledge  raw materials or capital  Other matters such as easier access to supplies or government controls on the market are relevant if they bear upon the extent to which the corporation can act without being constrained by competition  at     In the Wholesale Market in the case before me  it is not in contention that the respondent has not only market power  but a substantial degree of market power  Both the applicant and the respondent  and their respective experts  are in agreement on this point  I accept that the respondent has a substantial degree of market power in this market  It is therefore appropriate to consider the claim of the applicant that the respondent has taken advantage of that power for a purpose proscribed by s   TPA citedEastman Kodak Co v Image Technical Services Inc     US   So for example  in Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   Deane J held that the identification of the proscribed purpose in that case led directly to the conclusion that BHP was taking advantage of its market power  because the nature of the purpose was such that  in the circumstances of that case  it could not have been achieved by the conduct impugned had it not been for the existence of the market power   Queensland Wire   CLR at     Melway   CLR at

Callinan JJ in Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and   where their Honours said     As Dawson J explained  in Queensland Wire   market power means capacity to behave in a certain way  which might include setting prices  granting or refusing supply  arranging systems of distribution  persistently  free from the constraints of competition      at   The notion of  taking advantage of  in s   is closely related to the proscribed purpose in the section   Melway   CLR at      As the majority observed in Melway      The TPA  requires  not merely the co existence of market power  conduct and proscribed purpose  but a connection such that the firm whose conduct is in question can be said to be taking advantage of its power  at     So for example  in Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   Deane J held that the identification of the proscribed purpose in that case led directly to the conclusion that BHP was taking advantage of its market power  because the nature of the purpose was such that  in the circumstances of that case  it could not have been achieved by the conduct impugned had it not been for the existence of the market power   Queensland Wire   CLR at     Melway   CLR at    The majority in Melway at   also noted comments of Scalia J in the Supreme Court of the United States when his Honour said     Where a defendant maintains

take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist     Eastman Kodak Co v Image Technical Services Inc     US   at   However as was pointed by the High Court in Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   and subsequently reiterated by the majority of the High Court in Melway   CLR at    take advantage of  does not mean anything materially different from  use  and does not require conduct which is predatory or morally blameworthy  per Mason CJ and Wilson J at   Deane J at   Dawson J at   Toohey J at      cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC   at      In terms of s   it does  however  entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment  and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s    So  as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd     ALR    at   subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser   HCA       CLR    at      If the impugned conduct has a business rationale  that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power  If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment  it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power   In this case it is clear that  in the Wholesale Market  the respondent is a monopoly supplier  Although there was some discussion throughout the hearing as to local government authorities in Queensland being a source of data  it is clear that they are not a source of Bulk Data  It is also not in contention that the reason for this monopoly is because of the statutory function of the respondent  which  as stated by Mr Rush in his affidavit  is the point of truth source for sales data  However as pointed out by the majority in Melway   CLR at      Freedom from competitive constraint might make it possible  or easier  to refuse supply and  if it does  refusal to supply would constitute taking advantage of market power  But it does not follow that because a firm in fact enjoys freedom from competitive constraint  and in fact refuses to supply a particular person  there is a relevant connection between the freedom and the refusal  Presence of competitive constraint might be compatible with a similar refusal  especially if it is done to secure business advantages which would exist in a competitive environment   Third  I am not persuaded by the submissions of the respondent  or the evidence of Mr Norling  that the removal of names and addresses from the Bulk Data would be conduct expected to occur within a  hypothetical  competitive wholesale market because suppliers other than the respondent in such a wholesale market would be subject to the Privacy Act    Cth   To paraphrase comments of the majority in Melway   CLR at   in a similar context  the evidentiary basis for that conclusion is not entirely clear  and not everyone would agree that  as a proposition of fact  it is self evidently correct  Irrespective whether the information supplied by the respondent was as a matter of law a generally available publication and not subject to the Privacy Act as was submitted  in my view correctly  by the applicant    the assumption that the Privacy Act would compel suppliers in the hypothetical Wholesale Market from withholding the Excluded Data was not proven    there is no basis in fact or in law made out for assuming that the QVAS data and the supply thereof by a hypothetical competitor in the Wholesale Market is something that would be subject to the Privacy Act   and    depending on the identity of such hypothetical competitors they might or might not be organisations subject to the Privacy Act with the result that it was questionable whether the Privacy Act would have any application in any event   Fourth  I do not accept as material the distinction drawn by the respondent between the facts of this case and other refusal to supply cases such as Melway   HCA       CLR   and Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   in that in those cases there was a refusal to supply one of several acquirers of goods and services  Whether or not all licensees were being treated equally in this case is not germane to the issue of whether the respondent  for reasons of its own  was taking advantage of its market power   Whether it is relevant to purpose is a different question  which I shall consider shortly   In  for example  a hypothetical situation where a wholesale supplier formulated a strategy of itself entering the retail market and as part of that strategy informed its customers who were retailers in that retail market of its decision to henceforth refuse supply of its products  the fact that all retailers were equally disadvantaged does not mean that the wholesale supplier has not taken advantage of its market power   Irrespective whether the respondent has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market  as a matter of law it will only be in breach of s   if it has done so for a purpose proscribed by s    That this is so is demonstrated by the unambiguous terms of s     and decisions in Australia at the highest level confirming this principle  for example Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   Melway   CLR at     Section  c  must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA  As pointed out by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway   CLR at        Section   aims to promote competition  not the private interests of particular persons or corporations    cf Boral   CLR   per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at   Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   McHugh J at     Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare   ALR at   Rural Press   FCAFC   at     Universal Music   FCR at   and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp      It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market  Like s  a  the breadth of application of s  c  is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant  cf Merkel J in Robert

information required s        The supply by the respondent of s   data does not form any part of its business relationship with the licensees  who receive bulk data from the respondent     Obligations of the respondent in relation to valuation of land throughout Queensland  the collection of data  the maintenance of valuation records and the supply of the data are mandated by the VL Act   As Mr Hinson SC for the respondent submitted  the Department is required by s   VL Act to supply a certified copy of the particulars of a valuation entered on a valuation roll  to a person who pays the prescribed fee  I note the prescribed fee is found in the Valuation of Land Regulation    Qld   Indeed  I note that the long title of the VL Act is  An Act to make better provision for determining the valuation of land for rating and taxing purposes  and for matters incidental thereto or consequent thereon   I accept the evidence of Mr Rush that the QVAS data is the point of truth source for sales data  that is  how much a property was sold for at a particular date  Rush affidavit para    In my view  the supply of data by the respondent in respect of individual searches is an act of government and carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty  similar to the provision of a certificate by the municipal council in Mid Density Development Pty Ltd   FCR       In light of the foregoing  the fact that the Department would undoubtedly enter into many transactions of this nature does not mean that the Department is  carrying on a business  of supplying data in response to individual searches     Although the respondent has submitted that local governments and the applicant can supply data in response to individual searches  in my view this does not derogate from the fact that the activities of the respondent in this regard constitute a function of government in the performance of its statutory duty rather than  carrying on a business   Indeed in this respect I note that      o the provision of valuation information by local government is required by s   Local Government Act    Qld  to be given to parties contemplated by that section  and is itself information which the chief executive is required to give local governments pursuant to s  f  VL Act   o unlike the statutory obligation of the respondent  individual search data provided by the applicant is only to its customers  in a  commercially user friendly format   Catelan affidavit para   appliedNT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority   HCA         CLR  http www

JJ in NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority   HCA         CLR   at       while the conduct proscribed by the TPA  if it is to fall within s  B  must be engaged in in the course of the entity carrying on a business  the conduct need not itself be the actual business engaged in    had s  B not been enacted  the impugned conduct would not be examinable in circumstances where the entity is the Crown in right of a State or Territory    rather than examining specific conduct and then examining whether that contravention can be described as carrying on a business  as was unsuccessfully argued in NT Power   HCA       CLR   the correct approach is to first ascertain whether the entity  carries on a business   As the majority explained in NT Power   HCA       CLR   it is necessary to do this because       this removes the governmental obstacle to curial examination of its conduct in order to see whether section   has been contravened    at   As was also observed by the majority in NT Power   HCA       CLR   it is also important not to substitute the question of defining markets for the question of whether a business is being carried on  at    Their Honours pointed out     However  the words  market  and  business  have distinct meanings  Nothing in the Act limits the meaning of  business  by reference to the criteria for market definition  Businesses often operate across the boundaries of separate markets    All these considerations militate against any approach to the question of  carrying on a business  by reference to competition in a market    The only question is  what business was  the entity  carrying on  So far as it was carrying on a business  s   applied to it     CLR at   Prima facie   s   applies only to corporations  defined by s   TPA to mean bodies corporate that are   a  foreign corporations   b  trading corporations formed within the limits of Australia or are financial corporations so formed   c  incorporated in a Territory or   d  are holding companies of bodies corporate of a kind referred to in paras  a   b  or  c    Clearly the respondent is not a corporation  However Pt   TPA makes provision for the extended application of certain parts of the Act  Of particular relevance in these proceedings is s  B TPA  This section provides    The following provisions of this Act bind the Crown in right of each of the States  of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory  so far as the Crown carries on a business  either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory       a  Part IV   aa  Part VB   b  Part XIB            c  the other provisions of this Act so far as they relate to the above provisions        Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in right of a State or Territory liable to a pecuniary penalty or to be prosecuted for an offence     The protection in subsection   does not apply to an authority of a State or Territory   Section   is found in Pt IV TPA  However the extended application only operates if the Crown in right of the relevant State or Territory is carrying on a business  either directly or by an authority of the State of Territory  As is clear from such cases as NT Power   CLR  particularly at   and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd     ALR    particularly at     this condition is strictly applied

contemplates circumstances where an entity  through its substantial degree of market power in a market  takes advantage of that power for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging another entity which is its competitor in another market  This is plain from the terms of the section itself  and follows  for example  from observations of McHugh ACJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power at   CLR at        Accordingly  the respondent would have acted in breach of s  a  TPA if it took advantage of its power in the Wholesale Market for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging the applicant in the Retail Market  if the applicant was a competitor of the respondent in that Retail Market   The applicant conceded that there was no direct evidence that the respondent s purpose was to substantially damage the applicant in the Retail Market  The applicant invited the court to draw the inference that this was the purpose of the respondent  and referred in particular to the change in the products to be offered by removal of the Excluded Data  and the simultaneous change in pricing under the proposed fees structure  In summary  the applicant contended    The applicant has substantial market share in the Retail Market     The respondent is a competitor of the applicant in the Retail Market     The removal of the Excluded Data will make the applicant s products less attractive to its existing customers in comparison to the existing offerings of the applicant     The result of a proposed licence fee incorporating a royalty would result in a licence fee payable by the applicant to the respondent in excess of   million in contrast with the current flat fee  which proposal has not been adequately explained  The respondent did not produce one document evidencing the way in which the pricing for either the access fee or the royalty fee was worked up for these particular products     The removal of the Excluded Data was allegedly precipitated by complaints concerning direct marketing activities by real estate agents  but this does not explain the basis of the particular pricing provisions     In any event  the respondent s witnesses exaggerated the number and account of complaints concerning direct marketing activities by real estate agents  and in fact the number of complaints received was minor  a total of   written complaints discovered between   and   which would not justify substantial overhaul to contractual arrangements in place since     In summary the respondent submitted    The evidence is overwhelming that the only purpose of the respondent in implementing its proposals concerning the Excluded Data and the pricing structure was to prevent the misuse of the Excluded Data for direct marketing     There is no evidence that

reduced its fees to allow that to occur  The unchallenged evidence is that all licensees were treated equally     Mr Fry deposed that he had told the applicant that if it did not agree to the new licence conditions and refused to enter into a licence agreement  it would not be able to receive licensed data after   June   and deposed further that this would also apply to the other seven

FCA  Finally  in my view the power used by the respondent in withdrawing the Excluded Data from supply was not regulatory power  but market power  I have already found that  although the collection of data by the respondent was pursuant to statutory obligations  the supply of Collected Data by the respondent to the applicant and the other licensees was in the course of carrying on a business by the respondent  In my view this case is distinguishable from Stirling Harbour   FCA   and Plume v Federal Airports Corporation     FCA where the Court found that relevant entity was exercising regulatory authority rather than market power    In Stirling Harbour   FCA     the function of the port authority under the relevant statute was to arrange for port services to be provided  including towage  and did so by tender  The Full Court in that case was satisfied that the port authority had assumed the role of a market regulator     Similarly in Plume     FCA  the court was satisfied that the conduct of the Federal Airports Corporation was properly characterised as use of a regulatory power designed for the benefit of the members of the public who had occasion to use the facilities of the airport

by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway   CLR at        Section   aims to promote competition  not the private interests of particular persons or corporations    cf Boral   CLR   per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at   Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   McHugh J at     Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare   ALR at   Rural Press   FCAFC   at     Universal Music   FCR at   and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp      It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market  Like s  a  the breadth of application of s  c  is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant  cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd  t as Auto Fashions Australia  v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Toohey J in Ross Payne   Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported  Federal Court of Australia    August   Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd     ALR   at    Accordingly  it is within the scope of s  c  that a corporation or entity with a

market  is constituted was emphasised in Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR    As Gleeson CJ and Callinan J observed     A market is an area of close competition  a field of rivalry  As the passage from Re Queensland Co Operative Milling Association Ltd quoted above indicates  and as s   recognises  both the supply side and the demand side are relevant to an assessment of the market  It does not solve  but merely re states  the problem to speak of sub markets  There may be a wider  and a narrower  area of rivalry  but  if the narrowest area itself constitutes a market  then it is power and conduct in that area that must be examined    at      cf Deane J in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   The notion of  market power  in the sense of capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors has been the subject of frequent judicial consideration  The leading case in this context is Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR    Usefully  Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd     FCR   at   summarised from the judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J in Queensland Wire   CLR at     the following factors as relevant in defining and identifying market power     a   the ability of a firm to raise prices above the supply cost without rivals taking away customers in due time  supply cost being the minimum cost an efficient firm would incur in producing the product   b   the extent to which the conduct of  any of the respondents  in that market is constrained by the conduct of   competitors or potential competitors      s    c  market share of each respondent must be examined but this alone is generally not determinative of market power as  the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed   Mason CJ and Wilson J adopted the language of Reed J in United States v Columbia Steel Co     US   at    d  the presence of vertical integration is another factor  but its presence does not necessarily mean that a substantial degree of power exists  and   e  to what extent is it rational or possible for new entrants to enter the relevant market  That is to say  what are the barriers to entry  It is this factor which must be taken as the primary consideration in determining market power  See also the judgment of the Full Court of this court in Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission at FCR       Further in Queensland Wire   CLR at   Dawson J observed     The term  market power  is ordinarily taken to be a reference to the power to raise price by restricting output in a sustainable manner    But market power has aspects other than influence upon the market price  It may be manifested by practices directed at excluding competition such as exclusive dealing  tying arrangements  predatory pricing or refusal to deal    The ability to engage persistently in these practices may be as indicative of market power as the ability to influence prices  Thus Kaysen and Turner define market power as follows         A firm possesses market power when it can behave persistently in a manner different from the behaviour that a competitive market would enforce on a firm facing otherwise similar cost and demand conditions    Kaysen and Turner  Antitrust Policy   p             Market power is thus the advantage which flows from monopoly or near monopoly     The comments of his Honour were adopted by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and   where their Honours said     As Dawson J explained  in Queensland Wire   market power means capacity to behave in a certain way  which might include setting prices  granting or refusing supply  arranging systems of distribution  persistently  free from the constraints of competition      at   However  with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  In particular  I note the following    In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement  the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that  because of the respondent s substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market   it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market   The respondent points out however  that the experts do not say that the respondent has a  substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market  This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent s substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market  Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market  TS p   ll     and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  TS p   ll         Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a  downstream  retail market is a relatively common phenomenon  and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court  for example  in the context of claims of alleged anti competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA   Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA     in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA   Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal   FCAFC     and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition   Australian Gas Light Company  ACN       v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission  No     FCA    However  the ability of an entity to  substantially influence patterns of competition  in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market  as agreed by the experts  is not  in my view  necessarily tantamount to  a substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market or even  as submitted by the respondent   market power  within the meaning of the s   TPA     As I have already noted  the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different  supplying different services to different customers  It is not in contention before me that there is  a  Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information  However  whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product  it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base  namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant s services  as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter  It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market  RP Data Information Memorandum Document   pp     evidence of Mr Catelan TS p   ll      In this respect  the  market power  of the respondent in the Retail Market  viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market  is not obvious  Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end users  it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd     FCR       I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  Further  I note that  notwithstanding para   of the amended statement of claim  Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant s case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  note TS p   ll         I also note that      o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement  TS p   ll     p   ll     Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  o Mr Jackson QC  in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market  confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts  and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market      I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement  I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market     As pointed out in Queensland Wire   the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing  barriers to entry  market share  However in this case I note  for example  that      a  no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent  b  although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent  there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers  c  no evidence is lead as to market share  if any  in the Retail Market held by the respondent   So for example  in Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   Deane J held that the identification of the proscribed purpose in that case led directly to the conclusion that BHP was taking advantage of its market power  because the nature of the purpose was such that  in the circumstances of that case  it could not have been achieved by the conduct impugned had it not been for the existence of the market power   Queensland Wire   CLR at     Melway   CLR at    The majority in Melway at   also noted comments of Scalia J in the Supreme Court of the United States when his Honour said     Where a defendant maintains substantial market power  his activities are examined through a special lens  Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws or that might even be viewed as procompetitive can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist     Eastman Kodak Co v Image Technical Services Inc     US   at

environment  and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s    So  as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd     ALR    at   subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser   HCA       CLR    at      If the impugned conduct has a business rationale  that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power  If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment  it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power   Fourth  I do not accept as material the distinction drawn by the respondent between the facts of this case and other refusal to supply cases such as Melway   HCA       CLR   and Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   in that in those cases there was a refusal to supply one of several acquirers of goods and services  Whether or not all licensees were being treated equally in this case is not germane to the issue of whether the respondent  for reasons of its own  was taking advantage of its market power   Whether it is relevant to purpose is a different question  which I shall consider shortly   In  for example  a hypothetical situation where a wholesale supplier formulated a strategy of itself entering the retail market and as part of that strategy informed its customers who were retailers in that retail market of its decision to henceforth refuse supply of its products  the fact that all retailers were equally disadvantaged does not mean that the wholesale supplier has not taken advantage of its market power   Irrespective whether the respondent has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market  as a matter of law it will only be in breach of s   if it has done so for a purpose proscribed by s    That this is so is demonstrated by the unambiguous terms of s     and decisions in Australia at the highest level confirming this principle  for example Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   Melway   CLR at     In relation to identifying the  purpose  of the respondent  as illustrated by the cases listed in Miller s Annotated Trade Practices Act  th edition para       the weight of authority indicates that the relevant purpose is to be identified on the basis of a subjective test rather than objectively  although purpose may be established by inference from the conduct of the respondent  s    As Toohey J observed in Queensland Wire   CLR  the reference to  for the purpose of  carries with it the notion of an intent to achieve the result spoken of in each of the paragraphs in s    at CLR    I note that the subjective nature of the relevant intent was also endorsed by the High Court in Boral Besser   CLR at     Second  in my view the  purpose  of the respondent  which as Toohey J observed in Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR   carries with it the notion of an intent to achieve a certain result  was to prevent the Excluded Data being used for direct marketing  The clear inference which can be drawn from the conduct of the respondent is that  despite publicly expressed concerns of the respondent concerning usage of its data for direct marketing  and although the licensees were required by the licence agreement between themselves and the respondent to ensure that end users had agreed not to use the data or data products supplied by the licensees for direct marketing  nonetheless end users  primarily some real estate agents  were engaging in direct marketing using data sourced originally from the respondent  I note that the possibility of the Excluded Data being withdrawn because of inappropriate use by end users had been anticipated by cl     of the   licence agreement which provided     The Licensor reserves the right to exclude future supply of certain particulars forming part of the Licensed Data if the Chief Executive of the Licensor is satisfied on reasonable grounds  that inclusion of the data may result in inappropriate use or disclosure  Furthermore the Licensor may prohibit or limit distribution of certain particulars forming part of the Licensed Data   It is because of the respondent s view that Excluded Data was being misused for direct marketing that the respondent formulated its proposal to exclude the Excluded Data from the Collected Data it supplied the applicant and the other licensees  Excluded Data could still be obtained from the respondent  because the respondent was statutorily obliged to supply it  One obvious result of end users obtaining Excluded Data on the basis of individual searches is that the cost and process of so obtaining that information is a clear disincentive to direct marketing activities  which is compatible with the stated purpose of the respondent   Third  the applicant made a number of claims in the amended statement of claim concerning the alleged intention of the respondent to harm the applicant  I make the following observations    In relation to the claim of the applicant that the respondent had an intention to harm and prevent the applicant competing in the market place by offering another party  Infopac  favourable terms in order to compete with the applicant  amended statement of claim para  b i B I  no evidence is produced other than that of Mr Catelan in his affidavit  referring to alleged statements of Mr Witt in    I note that these statements were allegedly made almost   years ago  and appear to bear little relationship to the complaint before me  Further  I note that Mr Witt was not cross examined in relation to these statements  nor did any other person who could give direct evidence as to such an offer give evidence  I also note Mr Oakley was cross examined in relation to a letter from Infopac received by him in    pp     however there was no substantiation that the respondent had sought to cause harm to the applicant in connection with an contractual relationship between the respondent and Infopac  I therefore give no weight to this aspect of the claim     Similarly Mr Witt was not cross examined concerning the allegations of the applicant with respect to Mr Edwards and Residex  amended statement of claim para  b i B II   No evidence was given by Mr Edwards  and Mr Edwards did not appear as a witness in these proceedings  I also give no weight to this aspect of the claim     In relation to the claim of the applicant that on   February   Mr Fry and Mr Oakley said to Ms Jane Woodward of the applicant that if the applicant did not agree to the new licence conditions the applicant would not receive any Collected Data in the future  I note that      o Mr Fry stated in para   of his affidavit that what occurred was that  I said that if RP Data did not agree to the new licence conditions and refused to enter into a licence agreement then RP Data would not be able to receive licensed data after   June    This would apply to the other seven licensees   Mr Fry was not cross examined with respect to this statement   o Ms Woodward gave no evidence in these proceedings   o It is clear from the evidence of Mr Fry that all licensees were being treated in the same way  and this evidence does not establish a breach of s   as alleged

can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  In particular  I note the following    In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement  the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that  because of the respondent s substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market   it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market   The respondent points out however  that the experts do not say that the respondent has a  substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market  This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent s substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market  Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market  TS p   ll     and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  TS p   ll         Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a  downstream  retail market is a relatively common phenomenon  and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court  for example  in the context of

Australian Gas Light Company  ACN       v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission  No     FCA    However  the ability of an entity to  substantially influence patterns of competition  in a retail

as submitted by the respondent   market power  within the meaning of the s   TPA     As I have already noted  the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different  supplying different services to different customers  It is not in contention before me that there is  a  Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information  However  whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product  it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base  namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant s services  as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter  It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market  RP Data Information Memorandum Document   pp     evidence of Mr Catelan TS p   ll      In this respect  the  market power  of the respondent in the Retail Market  viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market  is not obvious  Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end users  it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd     FCR       I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  Further  I note that  notwithstanding para   of the amended statement of claim  Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant s case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  note TS p   ll         I also note that      o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement  TS p   ll     p   ll     Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial

the experts  and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market      I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement  I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market     As pointed out in Queensland

the Excluded Data from supply was not regulatory power  but market power  I have already found that  although the collection of data by the respondent was pursuant to statutory obligations  the supply of Collected Data by the respondent to the applicant and the other licensees was in the course of carrying on a business by the respondent  In my view this case is distinguishable from Stirling Harbour   FCA   and Plume v Federal Airports Corporation     FCA where the Court found that relevant entity was exercising regulatory authority rather than market power    In Stirling Harbour   FCA     the function of the port authority under the relevant statute was to arrange for port services to be provided  including towage  and did so by tender  The Full Court in that case was satisfied that the port authority had assumed the role of a market regulator     Similarly in Plume     FCA  the court was satisfied that the conduct of the Federal Airports Corporation was properly characterised as use of a regulatory power designed for the benefit of the members of the public who had occasion to use the facilities of the airport at Alice Springs   The role of the port authority in Stirling Harbour   FCA  and the Federal Airports Corporation in Plume     FCA can be contrasted with the role of the respondent in its supply of Collected Data to the applicant and the other licensees  namely that of a wholesaler of information on commercial terms dictated by the respondent  in an environment where the respondent was also a supplier of data in the Retail Market  While the regulatory power of the respondent to collect data and enter licence agreements clearly assisted its commercial position in entering such agreements  cf comments of the majority in NT Power   CLR at   the conduct of

specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market      I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement  I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market     As pointed out in Queensland Wire   the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing  barriers to entry  market share  However in this case I note  for example  that      a  no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent  b  although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent  there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers  c  no evidence is lead as to market share  if any  in the Retail Market held by the respondent citedTelecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd v Clear Communications Ltd     NZLR   Similarly  the Privy Council in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd v Clear Communications Ltd     NZLR   at   observed that use and purpose  though separate requirements  will not be easily separated   While in some cases where an entity has used its dominant position it may  as the Privy Council said in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd     NZLR at   be hard to imagine a case in which it would have done so otherwise than for the purpose of producing an anti competitive effect  and it will legitimate for a court to infer from the respondent s use of its dominant position that its purpose was to produce the effect in fact produced  the respondent in this case is a government department under the direction of a State government Minister which  while engaged in supply of data for revenue  is also required to take into account broader community interests  In my view it is not difficult to accept that the public interest to ensure that its data base is not misused for direct marketing purposes is what has motivated the respondent to act in this case   Third  from the consistent evidence of the respondent s witnesses it could not be inferred that changes to the respondent s pricing structure were implemented for the purpose of eliminating or damaging the applicant as a competitor  The respondent s proposal was implemented in relation to all licensees  not only the applicant and in accordance with a Department wide approach  One possible explanation for this development is that the respondent was seeking to eliminate all possible competition in the Retail Market  including that posed by the applicant  However it is inconsistent with a deliberate attack on the applicant specifically as a competitor   Fourth  according to evidence of Mr Witt  the current licence fees are considerably lower than they were in the late  s when the applicant paid   upfront plus   per month for five years for its licence  affidavit of Mr Witt para    The applicant currently pays   per annum in licence fees  and under the proposed new licence the applicant would pay a maximum of   comprising licence fees and a capped royalty fee  Witt affidavit para   Oakley affidavit para    The proposal of the respondent meant  at least in the foreseeable future  that the licensees would not pay more under the proposed licence than they were paying under the current arrangement  oral evidence of Mr Oakley TS p   ll     although clearly without receiving the Excluded Data  which is a key aspect of the applicant s complaint citedTelstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  However  with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  In particular  I note the following    In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement  the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that  because of the respondent s substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market   it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market   The respondent points out however  that the experts do not say that the respondent has a  substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market  This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent s substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market  Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market  TS p   ll     and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  TS p   ll         Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a  downstream  retail market is a relatively common phenomenon  and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court  for example  in the context of claims of alleged anti competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA   Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA     in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA   Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal   FCAFC     and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition   Australian Gas Light Company  ACN       v Australian Competition   Consumer Commission  No     FCA    However  the ability of an entity to  substantially influence patterns of competition  in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market  as agreed by the experts  is not  in my view  necessarily tantamount to  a substantial degree of market power  in the Retail Market or even  as submitted by the respondent   market power  within the meaning of the s   TPA     As I have already noted  the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different  supplying different services to different customers  It is not in contention before me that there is  a  Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information  However  whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product  it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base  namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant s services  as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter  It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market  RP Data Information Memorandum Document   pp     evidence of Mr Catelan TS p   ll      In this respect  the  market power  of the respondent in the Retail Market  viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market  is not obvious  Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end users  it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd     FCR       I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market  Further  I note that  notwithstanding para   of the amended statement of claim  Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant s case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  note TS p   ll         I also note that      o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement  TS p   ll     p   ll     Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market  o Mr Jackson QC  in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market  confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts  and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market      I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement  I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market     As pointed out in Queensland Wire   the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing  barriers to entry  market share  However in this case I note  for example  that      a  no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent  b  although the entry of

retailers  c  no evidence is lead as to market share  if any  in the Retail Market held by the respondent citedUnited States v Columbia Steel Co     US   The notion of  market power  in the sense of capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors has been the subject of frequent judicial consideration  The leading case in this context is Queensland Wire   HCA       CLR    Usefully  Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd     FCR   at   summarised from the judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J in Queensland Wire   CLR at     the following factors as relevant in defining and identifying market power     a   the ability of a firm to raise prices above the supply cost without rivals taking away customers in due time  supply cost being the minimum cost an efficient firm would incur in producing the product   b   the extent to which the conduct of  any of the respondents  in that market is constrained by the conduct of   competitors or potential competitors      s    c  market share of each respondent must be examined but this alone is generally not determinative of market power as  the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed   Mason CJ and Wilson J adopted the language of Reed J in United States v Columbia Steel Co     US   at    d  the presence of vertical integration is another factor  but its presence does not necessarily mean that a substantial degree of power exists  and   e  to what extent is it rational or possible for new entrants to enter the relevant market  That is to say  what are the barriers to entry  It is this factor which must be taken as the primary consideration in determining market power  See also the judgment of the Full Court of this court in

html  Although the phrase  carries on a business  appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s  B  it is not defined in the Act  However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case  They are as follows      Business  in the context of s  B is normally a  wide and general  word  Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   McHugh ACJ  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power   CLR at    Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s   since  business  includes  a business not carried on for profit  NT Power   CLR at        The phrase  carries on a business  should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s  B and related legislation  which was to ensure that  with state and territory application legislation  the prohibitions against anti competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia    Australia  House of Representatives  Parliamentary Debates  Hansard    June   p        Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses  in the context of the TPA   carrying on a business  is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern  GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth   FCA         FCR   at        An act of government  whether directly or through an authority  which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty  is unlikely to be characterised as  carrying on a business  Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited  No     FCA   at     So  for example  the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act    NSW  was not  carrying on a business    Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council     FCR   nor was operating a detention centre   Corrections Corporation of Australia   FCA       FCR   nor were

reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds  State of New South Wales v RT   YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR    However  activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes  carrying on a business   Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales   FCA   where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied  for reward  ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training  and JS McMillan v Commonwealth     FCR   where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services  dispatch and distribution services  graphic design services and editorial services      Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business  further  although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions  JS McMillan   FCR at   GEC Marconi Systems   FCR at   Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA   at
