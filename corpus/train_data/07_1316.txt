Charter Hall Limited  in the matter of Charter Hall Limited   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedRe Australian Wealth Management Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIt should also be noted that all relevant parties  save for any purchasers from placees  appear to me to have been served with notice of the proceeding  although not in a formal sense of being made parties  It seems to me that would be going too far to directly involve such possible purchasers  The notice which is going to be given to ASIC  the Australian Stock Exchange and to the persons who would have sold to those purchasers does seem to me to give a reasonable possibility of the word getting out to any purchasers substantial enough to be interested in pursuing any remedies  I referred earlier to a proviso  That proviso appears in a decision of Hely J in Re Australian Wealth Management Pty Ltd   FCA    It gives liberty for a party  who claims to have suffered substantial injustice by reason of the orders  to apply to vary or discharge them within a limited period  That is a prudent proviso in matters dealt with ex parte and there are no other parties albeit that many of the people concerned have notice of the proceeding  I will simply make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order which I have initialled and placed with the papers    I certify that the preceding twelve   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    August   Counsel for the
