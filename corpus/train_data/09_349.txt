Ltd   NSWCA   at   and     Barrett J considered a number of authorities which have dealt with the question of the time to be extended for convening the meeting  particularly bearing in mind administrations of some complexity  The authorities to which his Honour referred indicate that in certain cases  an extension of up to five months has been granted  I am mindful of what Barrett J said in AFG Insurances at    His Honour emphasised that that was a special case with complications and difficulties which one would not expect to be encountered in the normal course and that every case must be approached on its merits without any particular reliance on what has happened in other cases  Nevertheless  this case does have some similarities to the considerations which arose in AFG Insurances   In particular  as I said earlier  BBL has no employees  no leases and no secured creditors  In substance the only substantial creditor of BBL is the   noteholders for whom the trustee has been appointed  Accordingly  the question which often arises in these applications is not present here  That is to say  there appear to be no persons affected by the statutory moratorium who might wish to complain about the extension of time which is sought  I also  of course  take into account the fact that no objection was voiced at the first meeting of creditors  albeit that only approximately   noteholders were present and that not all of the   noteholders attended that meeting  I also take into account that the trustee has not objected  There are  it appears  some other very minor creditors of BBL  but on the evidence before me these creditors appear to amount in value to approximately   referred toRe Brash Holdings Ltd     ACSR  There are a substantial number of

FCA  htmlThe orders which are proposed take into account the form of the order made by Lindgren J in Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         ACSR    His Honour there observed that it is desirable that there be an order permitting the meeting to be held before the end of the extended convening period  so that in this case  the administrators will have the ability to convene the meeting earlier than   August   if they see the need to do so  Moreover  liberty to apply is granted to any person who can demonstrate sufficient interest to modify or discharge the orders that I will make today  upon appropriate notice being given to the administrators  For those reasons I propose to grant the extension which is sought  However  I would add this  Bearing in mind the careful consideration which has been given to the period of the extension  without of course wishing to fetter the discretion of a judge who may be called upon to do so  I would have some doubts as to whether it may be appropriate for any further extension to be granted  It seems to me that careful consideration has thus far been given to the required period of the extension  but there is always the need to balance the considerations which have been referred to in the authorities of the need to strike the appropriate balance between the speed of the administration and the ability of creditors and shareholders to maximise their return   I certify that the preceding thirty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson      Associate     Dated
