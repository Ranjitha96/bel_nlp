Seven Network Limited v News Limited  No     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Optus accepts that its disclosure of the Alchemy Paper in unmasked form to the applicants waived any client legal privilege that otherwise would have existed in respect of the communication contained in the Alchemy Paper itself  However  Optus says that    the waiver is limited to that particular communication and does not extend to the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper  in respect of which privilege has been specifically claimed    the test to apply in determining whether privilege in the legal advice has been waived is that stated in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at   as follows          What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of fairness  perceive  between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large         the fact that the  gist  of the legal advice was disclosed to the applicants  as Mr Bannon SC  on behalf of Optus  concedes  is not determinative of the question of waiver  because considerations of fairness need to be taken into account  and     since Optus has not sought to rely upon the legal advice in the proceedings in any way  there is no unfairness in seeking to maintain privilege in that advice   Mr Bannon argued energetically that the common law test of waiver applies in the circumstances of this case  notwithstanding the provisions of s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   I am content to deal with the application to set aside the notice to produce on the basis that  as Optus contends  common law principles apply   On that basis  however  it seems to me that Optus has waived privilege in the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper  The waiver has come about because Optus has voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice recorded in the document identified in the Alchemy Paper   Gyles J noted that the primary Judge in Bennett v CEO had correctly identified the decision in Mann v Carnell as providing guidance as to the law to be applied  However  Gyles J considered that the test had been misunderstood  at least in part  His Honour said this  at       The test looks to inconsistency between the disclosure that has been made by the client on the one hand and the purpose of confidentiality that underpins legal professional privilege on the other  It is not a matter simply of applying general notions of fairness as assessed by the individual judge  The authorities to which I have referred show that it is well established that for a client to deploy the substance or effect of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that attracts legal professional privilege    Mr Bannon submitted that the comments made by Gyles J in the last sentence of the passage extracted in par   above  should be regarded as qualifying the scope of the principle applied by his Honour  However  Gyles J specifically stated that Mann v Carnell had not implicitly overruled the line of authority upon which he relied in reaching the conclusion expressed in   of his judgment  see par   above   His Honour pointed out that the question in Mann v Carnell was whether a particular kind of limited disclosure had waived client legal privilege  He considered that the reasoning in that case cast no doubt on the principles to be applied where disclosure is made by one party to a dispute to the other party  in the absence of any special arrangements as to confidence  at   followedBennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR   legal representatives of the Australian Customs Service  Customs  stated that they had given advice to Customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit all public comment by an officer on matters of public administration  Gyles J  with whom Tamberlin J agreed  considered that the primary Judge had erred in drawing a distinction between the conclusion expressed in legal advice  on the one hand  and the reasons for that conclusion  on the other  This distinction had led the primary judge to the incorrect holding that disclosure of the conclusion did not involve disclosure of the reasons  at     Gyles J referred to a number of authorities supporting the proposition that a party who expresses a particular legal conclusion and asserts that it has received legal advice endorsing that view  will be taken to have waived privilege in the legal advice  Gyles J expressed agreement with this reasoning  at       The voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion  The primary judge was in error in drawing a distinction between conclusion and reasoning in the context of such a disclosure    In agreeing with the analysis of Gyles J  Tamberlin J observed  at   that the position in the case before the Full Court may have been different if the legal advisors to Customs had simply asserted that the client had taken legal advice and had adopted a particular position having considered that advice  Tamberlin J pointed out that in these circumstances  the substance of the advice is not disclosed  but only the fact that some advice had been given and had been considered  His Honour went on     However  once the conclusion in the advice is stated  together with the effect of it  then in my view  there is imputed waiver of the privilege  The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion    Later in the judgment  his Honour observed  at       Disclosure of one conclusion but not others in an advice does not necessarily amount to waiver in respect of the non disclosed conclusions  However  if the conclusions and reasoning are so interconnected that they cannot be separated or isolated  then it may be that the whole of the advice on which all those conclusions are based  must be considered to have been waived   citedRio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   The principle stated in Bennett v CEO  was applied by Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR    In that case  the Commissioner produced  in response to an application under the Freedom of Information Act    Cth  an audit report  The audit report stated that the Commissioner would be relying upon certain specific grounds  supported by     opinions obtained from counsel   Sundberg J held  at   that     The conduct of the  Commissioner  in twice providing to the applicant an Audit Report that discloses the  gist  or  substance  of the privileged Audit Report documents is inconsistent with the maintenance of legal professional privilege over those documents and thus effects a waiver of the privilege    I should add that I have not been invited to examine the legal advice in order to determine whether it deals with discrete issues  other than those in respect of which the Alchemy Paper records the conclusion reached  Mr Sheahan SC  on behalf of the applicants  accepted that if Optus claims that privilege in parts of the legal advice has not been waived because those parts relate to discrete issues  it may be appropriate for Optus to have an opportunity to test that claim  However  in that event  given my role in the substantive proceedings  it will be necessary for another Judge to inspect the legal advice in order to rule on Optus  claims   For the reasons I have given   subject to what is said in the previous paragraph  I consider that any privilege in the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper has been waived by Optus  The waiver  in my view  extends to legal advice on any of the issues identified in par   above  Accordingly  Optus  motion must be dismissed
