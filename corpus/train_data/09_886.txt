austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR     Teoh   the High Court held  McHugh J dissenting  that procedural fairness required that if a relevant decision maker proposed to make a decision inconsistent with Article   of the Convention  procedural fairness required the decision maker to inform the person affected and provide to that person the opportunity of presenting a case against the taking of such a course  The reason was that ratification by Australia of an international convention engendered a  legitimate expectation  that administrative decision makers would act in conformity with that convention  Mr Karp has drawn attention to the fact that the expression has perhaps fallen into disuse since Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR     see especially at     and     per McHugh and Gummow JJ    per Hayne J    per Callinan J  In view of the way in which the present case was argued  I need say no more of this  Quite apart from Teoh   the Direction provided a basis for a legitimate expectation that the Minister would treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration when deciding whether to cancel Mr Rinka s visa  This expectation was created by the fact that the letter of   February   notifying Mr Rinka of the Minister s intention to consider cancelling his visa stated that the decision maker would have regard to the Direction in coming to a decision  I will first address the question whether the best interests of Mr Rinka s children were in fact treated as a primary consideration by the Minister  Briefing Paper The briefing paper to the Minister  headed  Issues for Consideration of Possible Cancellation of a Visa under s   of the Migration Act     was structured by reference to the Direction  Since it was plain that Mr Rinka failed to pass the character test  there was little discussion of that matter  The Minister s  Discretion  was considered under the headings  Primary Considerations   Other Considerations  and  Other International Obligations   Three Primary Considerations were discussed

FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlMr Rinka submits that the Minister failed to identify what the best interests of the children indicated she should decide with respect to the cancellation of Mr Rinka s visa  and that the Minister therefore did not treat the best interests of the children as a primary consideration in reaching her decision  In making these submission  Mr Rinka relies on Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR     Wan    see  particularly         Mr Rinka submits that the concept of the best interests of the children involved consideration of their relationship with Mr Rinka  He submits that the Minister had before her the older son s letter saying that he misses his father and speaking of his exploits at soccer  yet she did not refer to this material in her statement of reasons  Counsel for Mr Rinka accepts that this alone does not show jurisdictional error  but submits that  in combination with the  speculative  comments made by the Minister in para   of her statement of reasons  it does suggest that she did not give proper  genuine and realistic consideration to the material that was before her  If she did not  it would follow that the best interests of the children also could not have been given proper  genuine and realistic consideration  Consideration Wan   on which Mr Rinka relied  concerned an appeal to the Court from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  AAT  affirming a decision of the Minister to refuse to grant a permanent residence  general spouse  visa on character grounds  It was also a  best interests of the child  case  There were provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  governing the procedure of the AAT that have no relevance in the circumstances of the present case  Nonetheless  the Full Court s holding in Wan that in order to treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration  a decision maker must identify what those interests indicate the decision should be  is applicable  The Full Court held that the AAT did not do so  An alternative ground for the Full Court s decision was that the conclusion was inescapable that the AAT had not treated the best interests of the child as  a primary consideration   As indicated earlier  although the Minister s statement of reasons does not say in terms that  the best interests  of Mr Rinka s children dictated that his visa not be cancelled  that is the effect of para    Moreover  the Minister did say that she was treating the best interests of Mr Rinka s children as a primary consideration  and it is not shown that her statement to that effect should not be accepted  In the result  in my opinion the Minister s statement of reasons shows that the Minister treated the best interests of Mr Rinka s two children as a primary consideration  as she said she did in the first sentence of para
