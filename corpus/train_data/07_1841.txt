for Immigration   FMCA    The appellants relied on a number of grounds including a claim of bias on the part of the Tribunal and a failure to comply with s  A of the Act   Federal Magistrate Scarlett rejected the appellants  claim that the Tribunal had made its finding with bias  at    His Honour noted that the basis of that claim was that the Tribunal had completely ignored independent evidence submitted to it but observed that this does not constitute bias  at    His Honour noted that it was open to the Tribunal to prefer the evidence of the expert to the evidence of the first appellant  at     In dealing with an alleged failure by the Tribunal to comply with its obligations under s  A of the Act  the Federal Magistrate concluded that s  A had been complied with and that that ground

were not saying that the Tribunal had failed to consider a claim that had been made to it but rather that the Tribunal did not believe what the first appellant had said  A decision on credibility is a matter for the Tribunal  This ground of appeal does not succeed   The appellants did not point to any matter which the Tribunal ignored other than to assert that the Tribunal preferred the evidence of the expert  which it should not have done because the expert was not familiar with grapes in China  The first appellant also asserted that  while in the response to the s  A letter the appellants were unable to provide further information about the grape type that they said that they had grown  this information could easily have been found on the internet  The appellants complained that the
