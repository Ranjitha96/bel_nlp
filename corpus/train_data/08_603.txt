mortgage to secure a loan of     After the ATO terminated his employment Mr Gordon advised Westpac accordingly  Because he then failed the bank s income test the loan application was refused  An

www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Anti discrimination legislation is to be given a  fair  large and liberal  interpretation rather than one which is  literal or technical  IW v City of Perth   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ and McHugh J  From   April   Mr Gordon was an  employee  of the respondent  however conditional the terms under which he was employed  He attended at the ATO Launceston office  carried out such duties as were required of him  there is nothing to suggest the contrary  and received  or became entitled to receive  a wage or salary as long as he so attended  During the period he was at the office the respondent would have owed him the common law and statutory obligations which employers owe to their employees  The respondent would have been liable to any third parties for torts committed by Mr Gordon in the course of his employment  Withdrawing an employment offer  in circumstances where Mr Gordon had already started work  and would have continued to work but for Mr Godden telling him to leave the premises that day  was within the concept of  dismissing  in s  c    Since s   make it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the grounds of disability in  determining who should be offered employment   par  b  or  in the terms or conditions on which employment is offered   par  c  it would be strange if someone like Mr Gordon who had actually started work would be in a weaker position and would have no protection against discrimination   I reject the respondent s submission that Mr Gordon  commenced his employment under false pretences   The medical evaluation form     above  made it clear that the doctor was not to decide whether Mr Gordon got the job  The form was quite encouraging in holding out the prospect that  if any medical problems existed  their effect on employment could quite possibly be resolved to the satisfaction of the employee  Mr Gordon was aware that Dr Payne would talk to the ATO  Mr Gordon was not to know when this would happen  In the meantime  according to Mr Godden  Mr Gordon s commencing work was somewhat accelerated  apparently on the ATO s initiative  because the training program was about to commence referred toMarch v Stramare  E   MH  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  However  I do not think any amount in relation to the house purchase is properly allowable as damages by way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered because of the conduct of the respondent  s  PO d  of the HREOC Act  There is no suggestion that the ATO was aware of  let alone encouraged  this purchase  Any loss  either by way of out of pocket expenses or loss of a chance to make a profitable investment  arose from Mr Gordon s rather precipitate decision to purchase and cannot  as a matter of commonsense  be attributed to the discriminatory conduct of the ATO  cf March v Stramare  E   MH  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     At the time of his termination Mr

probability win    per cent probability lose  Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    Nevertheless  the circumstances in the present case make it extremely unlikely that Mr Gordon  had it not been for the termination in May   would have pursued a successful career with the ATO until retirement  let alone at the level he suggests   First  without wishing to be hurtful to Mr Gordon  the inescapable fact is that  for whatever reason  he is not a high achiever  On paper his qualifications are considerable  He has an honours economics degree and an MBA from good universities  He is a qualified accountant  He has almost finished financial planning qualifications  Yet the positions he has occupied up until now could be characterised as occupying a rank and salary towards the lower end of mid level clerical professional jobs  Professional men or women in their mid forties should be at or approaching their peak in terms of earnings and professional status  If they haven t got very far by this stage  things are unlikely to improve to any significant extent   Secondly  in the past Mr Gordon has not displayed any particular enthusiasm for a career in taxation  He did not persist with the ATO in his earlier career  see   above   Perhaps more importantly  in his recent job applications  both in the public and private sectors   above  only one was tax related  The rest appear to have been for employment in the funds management industry followedPower v Aboriginal Hostels Limited   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Power v Aboriginal Hostels Limited   FCA         FCR   Selway J held that it is the imputed disability which is relevant  His Honour said at       The next question is whether the appellant is unable to perform those duties  because of his disability   That question was not addressed by the learned Federal Magistrate  In my view the failure to address that question was an appealable error  If the question had been addressed then there are two possibilities  The first is that the  imputed disorder  of depression is the relevant disability  Alternatively  his actual condition of an adjustment disorder  from which he seems to have recovered  is the relevant disability    The appellant s submissions assumed that the relevant disability was the actual condition of the appellant at the time of his termination  On that basis the appellant submitted that he could perform the inherent requirements of the position   indeed  he was doing so for the four weeks before his employment was terminated  Consequently  he argued  s   of the DDA had no application    On the other hand the respondent s submissions assumed that the relevant disability was the imputed disorder of depression  notwithstanding that the appellant was not suffering from that disability  On this basis the respondent argued that in light of the report of Dr Ducrou the appellant was unable to comply with the inherent duties of the position    So far as my research reveals  there is no authority directly on point  The definition of  disability  in s   of the DDA purports to be an exhaustive definition   unless the contrary intention appears   There is no obvious contrary intention disclosed by s    Nor is there any obvious reason to imply one  The DDA is principally directed to the elimination as far as possible of  discrimination against persons on the ground of disability  in relevant areas  s   DDA   It is not directed at achieving  fair outcomes  as such  Consequently what is prohibited is discriminatory behaviour based upon disability   Imputed  disability is sufficient for this purpose  What the DDA prohibited in this case was not the dismissal of the appellant for a reason which was wrong  but the dismissal of the appellant who had a disability  albeit an imputed one  in circumstances where a person without a disability would not have been dismissed  When it is understood that the DDA is directed at the ground of discrimination  which includes imputed disability  and not  fair outcomes  then there seems no reason to imply that  disability  appearing in s   of the DDA does not include imputed disability   Additionally to his Honour s observations  it can be said that it is likely that the word  disability  wherever it appears in s   is referring to the same thing  Where first appearing   disability  is obviously referring to the discrimination alleged against the employer seeking to rely on the defence  If that discrimination was on the ground of imputed disability  then  disability  means imputed disability and the later expression  his or her disability  refers to the disability imputed to the employee alleging discrimination   Since s   as a whole is setting up a norm of conduct  it is to be read as addressed to employers as at the time they are contemplating potentially discriminatory conduct  Subsections   and   tell employers what they must not do  Subsections   and   tell them in what circumstances they may lawfully do what would otherwise amount to unlawful discrimination  This suggests that what subs   is concerned with are circumstances known to the employer at the time  However  consistently with the philosophy of anti discrimination legislation  see   above  the criterion is an objective one as is indicated by the reference to  all other factors that it is reasonable to take into account   The relevant circumstances include the nature of the imputed disability in the light of such medical investigation as may be reasonable and the availability of reasonable treatment appliedPurvis v New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As already mentioned  hypertension is a disability  The respondent  on the advice of Dr Payne  imputed this disability to Mr Gordon  The comparator for the purposes of s   is a hypothetical person who does not have hypertension but has Mr Gordon s qualifications and experience and is applying for the position of a GST Field Officer in the Launceston office of the ATO  There can be no doubt that such a person would have got the job and would not have had the employment offer withdrawn  By withdrawing the offer of employment the respondent has treated Mr Gordon less favourably than it would have treated such a hypothetical person  It did so because of the imputed condition of hypertension  which  it considered  made him unfit for the requirements of the particular position  The respondent thus discriminated against Mr Gordon  within the meaning of s   Purvis v New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at      I do not accept the respondent s argument that the offer was withdrawn  not because of Mr Gordon s hypertension  but because he failed to meet one of the pre employment conditions  viz  that he be certified fit for the duties of the position  One cannot divorce the factual base from its legal characterisation  Even if regard is had to the three other medical conditions mentioned by Dr Payne  there would still be discrimination because they are equally  disabilities  which would not be suffered by the comparator  But viewed in a practical way  the inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the real and operative reason for withdrawing the offer was Mr Gordon s imputed hypertension   The respondent contended that it did not dismiss Mr Gordon  rather that it withdrew a conditional offer of employment when the condition was not satisfied citedWaters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I conclude therefore that Mr Gordon has made out a prima facie case of discrimination  Before passing to the s   defence I should note that the Act does not require an intention or motive to discriminate  cf Waters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ and Gaudron J  with whom Deane J at   agreed  a case under comparable Victorian legislation  There is nothing to suggest that Dr Payne  or Mr Godden and the other ATO officers  acted otherwise than in good faith appliedX v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Whether something is an  inherent requirement  of a particular employment depends on whether it is an essential element  The inherent requirements include at least the ability to carry out the physical tasks encompassed by the particular employment but also matters such as having regard for the safety of other employees  the general public and the employee himself  X v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at       per McHugh J   The requirements of the particular employment in question in the present case were described by Mr Godden  In   GST Field Staff were organised into six teams  three each in Hobart and Launceston  The Launceston teams were based at an ATO office in that city  The office was purely a GST Field Site  No other ATO functions were performed at that site and there were no facilities for public contact  When a taxpayer had to be seen  the officers would go out to the taxpayer s place of business   Launceston teams were expected to deal with clients in the North of the State down to Ross  on the North West Coast and in the North East down to Bicheno   All Launceston staff were involved in field work in    The work was a mixture of audit and advisory visits  The latter would be in response to a taxpayer s request for a visit  The Commissioner had given a public undertaking that the Office would contact the taxpayer within   hours of the initial request and complete the visit within   days   Management was trying to maximise field time with an aim of officers spending   per cent of their time in the field  As it turned out  in   officers in Launceston spent about   to   per cent of their time in the field  the remainder being taken up with training  team meetings  leave etc  New APS   staff such as Mr Gordon would have to spend more time in the field than the average because their work would have required them to spend more time doing advisory visits than audits
