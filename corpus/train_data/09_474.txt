Tran v The Commonwealth   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAutodesk Inc  and Another v Dyason and Others  No      HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlBefore considering the substance of the applicant s claims  it is to be observed that ordinarily the Court cannot revisit its findings  In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others   HCA         CLR   at   Mason ACJ  Wilson and Brennan JJ said        the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare  The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution  Generally speaking  it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard     Similarly  Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc  and Another v Dyason and Others  No      HCA         CLR   at   said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of   re agitating arguments already considered by the Court   nor   because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put    While such authority refers to a basis for reviewing an earlier decision where the Court  still possessing jurisdiction in a proceeding  later considers its decision to be erroneous  this Court considers that the principle referred to in Autodesk and McMullin applies generally and should guide this Court in the present circumstances  Is forfeiture dependent upon conviction or commission of a criminal offence referred toCoco v R     CLR  The applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty  Ltd v Stocker and Stocker     SASR   in which the Court at     considered the meaning of the word  contravention   Additionally  the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies  see Coco v R     CLR   at      The applicant also relied upon the rule of construction that dispossession of a valuable property right without compensation cannot be imputed to Parliament unless expressed in unequivocal terms incapable of any other meaning  see Coco v R at      The applicant submits that the word  contravention  used in s  A of the Migration Act should be construed narrowly and confined  in accordance with the Second Reading speech of the Act inserting s  A into the Migration Act   to those cases where forfeiture of the vessel occurs as a penalty in relation to  people smuggling  criminal offences and not in respect of those instances where persons seek asylum referred toCustoms and Excise Commissioners v  Air Canada     QB  In answer to the applicant s submissions lie the words used in s  A of the Migration Act   The words providing for the forfeiture are clear and unequivocal  The principles relied upon by the Commonwealth concerning forfeiture of property are not in contest  and the concept is clearly recognised  see for example Customs and Excise Commissioners v  Air Canada     QB    In that decision the Court upheld the validity of a forfeiture of an aircraft which was involved in the carriage of cannabis resin  even though the owners of the aircraft were unaware of that fact  Whilst the law providing for forfeiture may appear harsh  that is the necessary consequence of its operation regarding property rights  In the present circumstances forfeiture occurred when the vessel was used or involved in a   contravention of this Act    Such contravention occurred by the bringing in or coming into Australia of one or more persons who were or became unlawful non citizens  contrary to s   of the Migration Act   The text of s  A of the Migration Act is unambiguous  In these circumstances the authorities relied upon by the applicant have no scope for application  The Refugee ConventionappliedDimella Constructions Pty  Ltd v Stocker and Stocker     SASR  The applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty  Ltd v Stocker and Stocker     SASR   in which the Court at     considered the meaning of the word  contravention   Additionally  the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies  see Coco v R     CLR   at      The applicant relies upon the decision of Dimella Constructions   in which the Court was asked whether s   of the Builder s Licensing Act    SA  would apply to a builder even if a charge under ss   or   could be defended by the common law defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact  Section   stated that    Where a person has carried out or undertaken  or submitted a bid or tender  to carry out any building work in contravention of this section  he shall not be entitled to claim  or recover in any court  the amount of any fee or charge for any building work     Section   imposed a penalty on a person who held himself or herself out as having a building licence without having a licence and s   imposed a penalty for constructing a building for a fee without a licence  The conduct of the charged party satisfied the descriptions of such offences  but the Court found that he was adequately protected by the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact because he believed himself to be licensed  Bray CJ  with other judges agreeing  found at page   that    I think a man does not transgress a law if he is legally innocent of breaking it and entitled to acquittal if charged with a breach of it  nor  in such circumstances  does he go counter to it or come into conflict with it  At   Bray CJ concluded    If it is a characteristic of any contravention that it could result in a penalty after conviction for a punishable offence  then e converso when there can be no penalty  because there can be no convention because there is no punishable offence  there is no contravention  The meaning of the word  contravention  is critical for the present proceedings  The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean   a failure to obey a statutory command   by doing something that a statute says must not be done   see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd     ALR   at   per Barrett J    an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm   see Re Venice Nominees at   per Miles CJ    infringe  law   of things  conflict with  per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd  Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington     ACSR   at   and   an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences   per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others     ACSR   at    The word has been defined in various UK statues as   failure to comply   see  for example  ss   and   Misuse of Drugs Act    UK  s   Food and Safety Act    UK   In view of the applicant s further submissions  the decision in Dimella Constructions and the preceding discussion  the Court finds itself unable to ignore the judicial findings which have had the result that all those charged with offences under the Migration Act have been acquitted  Contravention may not always equate to a criminal offence  However  due to the structure of the Criminal Code it must follow that a failure to find criminal responsibility must also lead to finding that a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Migration Act creating offences does not exist  The defence upon which the acquittals or discontinuances of the charges against the applicant and others was based  namely sudden or extraordinary emergency as provided by s     of the Criminal Code   applies equally to any offence with which the applicant or any other person on board the ship could be charged  As has been stated  the relevant question is whether the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that a contravention of the Migration Act has occurred  The Court can no longer be so satisfied that contraventions have occurred in respect of any offences

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt was submitted by the applicant that by virtue of Australia being a signatory to the Refugee Convention and following from the judgment of Kirby J in NAGV and NAGW of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another   HCA         CLR   at     the Court ought to read s  A in a way which conforms with Australia s international obligations and should not be read to punish refugees  There are two primary problems with this submission  As the Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ found  at   in NAGV        the Convention is an example of a treaty which qualifies what under classical international law theory was the freedom of States in the treatment of their nationals  but the Convention does not have the effect of conferring upon the refugees to which it applies international legal personality with capacity to act outside municipal legal systems   footnotes omitted     Crucially  their Honours said at          Gibbs CJ and Brennan J in Mayer and Stephen J in Simsek v Macphee pointed out that the determination of the status of refugee is a function left by the Convention to the competent authorities of the Contracting States which may select such procedures as they see fit for that purpose   footnotes omitted   It follows that the legal concept of  refugee  is a status which is not conferred upon a person merely by the existence of circumstances sufficient to support such a claim  This status must positively be found  and it must be found according to the standards set by the particular state  in this case  Australia  Such concept is consistent with international law only having effect within Australia by virtue of its positive adoption into municipal law  Accordingly  the passengers on the ship were not refugees until such time as they were granted that status from the Australian authorities pursuant to s   of the Migration Act  dealing with protection visas  and that was not until well after the facts giving rise to the contravention had occurred  At their time of entry into Australia  and thus the time when the forfeiture occurred  the ship s passengers were no more than unlawful non citizens by force of s   of the Migration Act   Therefore it could not be said that forfeiture of the ship would punish the applicant as a refugee  because at the relevant time he was not a refugee  and nor was anyone else on the ship  After the fact events such as the granting of refugee status cannot affect the validity of the forfeiture  Secondly  the passage relied upon by the applicants at   of NAGV states    where the words of a statute are susceptible to an interpretation that is consistent with international law  that construction should prevail over one that is not    The key word is   susceptible    Section   is clearly intended to operate subsequently to s  A because s  A will occur automatically the moment a vessel enters Australia  There is nothing in s  A that suggests that it should be limited in its operation by s   of the Migration Act so that it has no application to people to whom s   applies  Whether s   applies to an unlawful non citizen may not be known until years after a vessel s entry in Australia  and s  A is phrased as to operate instantaneously  Reading s  A in the way the applicant submits completely ignores the wording of the section  It must therefore be concluded that it is not a provision which can be said to be   susceptible   in the manner discussed by Kirby J  Compensationreferred toNewcrest Mining  WA  Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another   HCA         CLR  http

  FCR   at   French J  referring to s  A of the Fisheries Management Act    Cth   the FMA  addressed the question whether a conviction for an offence was necessary before forfeiture could occur under the provisions of that section  Such section provides for the forfeiture to the Commonwealth of boats  traps and other things used in offences against various provisions of that Act  His Honour said at     It was contended for the applicants that before s  A could operate to effect forfeiture of a boat or its equipment or catch it was necessary that there be a conviction for one or more of the offences upon which such forfeiture was said to arise  As a matter of construction this proposition cannot be sustained  Where there has been a conviction for an offence forfeiture can be ordered by the convicting court under s    Section  A does not require any judicial determination to give effect to the forfeiture for which it provides albeit a judicial determination may be made if the occurrence of the forfeiture is contested in later proceedings  In such proceedings a civil court may make a finding whether the boat has been used in one of the specified offences  Absent the institution of such proceedings within   days of a notice of seizure under s  C the asserted forfeiture will be put beyond question by operation of s  E  That process requires no conviction to have been recorded  I reject the contention that s  A depends for its application upon a conviction for one or more of the offences mentioned in it distinguishedPerpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Valuer General

evidence had been led and where the assumptions upon which the preliminary questions were argued were later found to be erroneous referred toR v Ampi Hungan   NTSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nt NTSC  htmlDespite this conclusion  the Migration Act has nevertheless been contravened by the applicant because of a breach of s   of the Migration Act   as was found in Tran No    at    In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa     FLR   Angel J said at     They intended to so enter without a visa  Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act   not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s   relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act  The Sri Lankans did not in fact commit any offence created by the Act  nor did they intend to commit any offence created by the Act  They nonetheless intended to contravene the Act in the sense I have mentioned  that is  to enter in disregard of the visa requirements of the Act   Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan   NTSC     however  that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes  His Honour s finding in relation to s   is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J  As has been stated  s  A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur  All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s  A a   Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s   of the Migration Act   and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s  A a   Pursuant to the text

contravention of the law has occurred without an offence having been committed  However  facts may exist to satisfy a court that conduct constitutes not only a contravention  but simultaneously an offence  The text of the relevant statute must be considered in order to decide whether contravention means merely a breach of its provisions or commission of an offence  The applicant invites the Court to find that because the word  offences  is used in the heading of s  A  the conclusion must be reached that the word  contravention  used in s  A should be limited only to a contravention of

applicant because of a breach of s   of the Migration Act   as was found in Tran No    at    In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa     FLR   Angel J said at     They intended to so enter without a visa  Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act   not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s   relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act  The Sri Lankans did not in fact commit any offence created by the Act  nor did they intend to commit any offence created by the Act  They nonetheless intended to contravene the Act in the sense I have mentioned  that is  to enter in disregard of the visa requirements of the Act   Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan   NTSC     however  that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes  His Honour s finding in relation to s   is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J  As has been stated  s  A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur  All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s  A a   Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s   of the Migration Act   and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s  A a   Pursuant to the text of s  A of the Migration Act the defences under the Criminal Code only apply to offences under the Migration Act   and thus cannot apply to a contravention of s   which is not framed as an offence followedSilk Bros  Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlDifferent considerations apply to the heading of Division  A of Part   of the Migration Act which also contains the word  offences   Pursuant to s   of the Acts Interpretation Act a heading of a Division is part of the Act  In Silk Bros  Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria   HCA         CLR     Latham CJ said at     The headings in a statute   can be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of a provision where that provision is ambiguous  and may sometimes be of service in determining the scope of a provision     But where the enacting words are clear and unambiguous  the title  or headings  must give way  and the full effect must be given to the enactment    Bennett v  Minister for Public Works  N S W     HCA         C L R    at     The Court finds that there is no ambiguity in the text of s  A  The section speaks of the contravention of the Migration Act as a whole  Ambiguity might arise when that section is read with the heading to the Division  but as observed by Latham CJ  the headings may provide guidance only when the provision itself is ambiguous  Following from the finding that the provision is unambiguous the text of the heading must give way  It may be assumed that if Parliament had intended automatic forfeiture to occur only where  offences  existed  it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have so provided  taking into consideration the choice of the word  offences  in the heading of Division  A of Part    It follows that the operation of the automatic forfeiture provision in s  A of the Migration Act is not limited only to contraventions of the offence provisions of that Act nor is it dependent upon a conviction for an offence  The Court reiterates its finding at   of Tran No     Has there been a contravention of the Migration Act  As has been outlined in     of this judgment  ordinarily the Court cannot revisit a previous judgment that it has made  In Tran No    at   the Court found that the Migration Act had been contravened by the applicant  However  a reading of that paragraph also records that the Court provided such answer within the context of a submission by the applicant that  contravention  in s  A should be made to be equated with  offence  in order to enliven an automatic forfeiture  This Court  as stated at   of this judgment  finds that the word  contravention  in s  A means contravention of the Migration Act generally and not only of the offence provisions  and that contravention is not to be interpreted as being confined to conviction for an offence  The applicant has made a different submission at the subsequent hearing  The applicant now submits that  as a consequence of the acquittals or discontinuance of actions against the applicant  Mr Lai and Mr Nguyen  the automatic forfeiture never took place because the facts giving rise to automatic forfeiture under s  A   namely contravention of the Migration Act   were never present  Such a submission does not depend on contravention being equated to an offence  nor to conviction of an offence  As was stated at     of Tran No      following the decision of French J in Olbers   for the automatic forfeiture to arise the Court   must be satisfied to a high degree of probability   that contraventions of the Migration Act exist  In Tran No    the Court stated that it was so satisfied but only in the narrow context of that which was submitted relating to the meaning of the word contravention  The new submissions justify the Court considering the new submissions separately to the decision already made even though a different interpretation of the same facts may result in a conclusion

pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules  Cth  see Tran v The Commonwealth   FCA         ALD     Tran No       Since the facts and legislation are set out in that decision  the present decision should be read in conjunction with Tran No      In Tran No    the Court found that s  A of the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   operated to effect an automatic forfeiture of the ship Hao Kiet BL TS  the ship  on or about   July   when the ship entered Australia carrying persons who held no valid Australian visas  To answer the specific questions the Court was provided with an agreed statement of facts  The determination of such questions did not finally resolve the rights of the parties since an automatic forfeiture brought about by s  A of the Migration Act remains contestable  see Tran No    at    The continuation of the hearing in respect of which this judgment is now delivered provided the applicant with the opportunity to provide any evidence upon which he relied to dispute that forfeiture of the ship had occurred  In Tran No    the Court referred to the automatic forfeiture as   the purported forfeiture    at   only as a means of indicating that in these proceedings the applicant could challenge the forfeiture under the mechanism explained in that decision  that is  through the condemnation process  On   September   the applicant filed a Further Amended Application seeking a declaration that the ship is not forfeited  or  in the alternative  a declaration that any forfeiture   including under s  A of the Migration Act   is revoked   and further declarations relating to the right of the applicant to possession of the ship  The Further Amended Application also seeks declarations relating to claims for damages arising from the alleged unauthorised destruction and or loss of possession of the ship  A Further Amended Statement of Claim was also filed on   September    The Further Amended Statement of Claim raised the following claim  at     At all material times the Applicant was responding to a sudden and extraordinary emergency and believed that each of the Vietnamese citizens who so fled from Vietnam to Australia were entitled to receive protection from Australia by virtue of the   Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the   Protocol relating to the Status of Refugee  the Refugee Convention    For these reasons the applicant submits that there is no relevant contravention of the Migration Act   and that in the absence thereof there has been no forfeiture and accordingly the Court should not confirm the automatic forfeiture  The applicant invites the Court to revisit its findings in Tran No    in light of its further submissions  The applicant claims that there has been a trespass to his property or intentional or negligent interference with his property and that just terms are payable under the Customs Act    Cth  in respect of the loss of the ship  The claim for damages is itemised

claims  it is to be observed that ordinarily the Court cannot revisit its findings  In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others   HCA         CLR   at   Mason ACJ  Wilson and Brennan JJ said        the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare  The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution  Generally speaking  it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard     Similarly  Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc  and Another v Dyason and Others  No      HCA         CLR   at   said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of   re agitating arguments already considered by the Court   nor   because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions  Vict     HCA         CLR   Wilson  Dawson and Toohey JJ discussed the origins of the modern law of self defence  They observed that such defence arose out of a context in which two kinds of defence to homicide  a defence of  justification  and one of  excuse  were available  The consequences of each defence were distinct  as their Honours considered at       Justifiable homicide carried with it commendation rather than blame and accordingly entitled the accused to total acquittal  entailing no forfeiture and requiring no pardon    Excusable homicide  on the other hand  was not entirely without blame and merely excused rather than acquitted  requiring  at first  a pardon and involving  for a somewhat longer period  forfeiture   Such distinctions no longer exist  but this context led their honours to find  at   that self defence    as we now know it  was essentially exculpatory in origin    The difference between the defences considered above demonstrates that  at the common law at least  one might be said to a have contravened the law even if a defence to a charge were available  There can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law  For example  the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder  see R v Dudley and Stephens     QBD    However  the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences  The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach   NSWCCA         NSWLR    Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code  at     Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt      General Principles of Criminal Responsibility  and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt      Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility   This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as  defences  for example  self defence is  exculpatory     Zecevic  at       Emphasis added   In an article published in Judicial Review entitled   The Commonwealth Criminal Code   An Introduction to the General Principle s  the author Ian Leader Elliot wrote      Proof of the necessary physical and fault elements does not  of itself  establish guilt  Though all elements of an offence are established against a defendant  guilt may be defeated by reliance on a defence  Chapter    of the Criminal Code   adopts a binary structure in which  responsibility  is a compound resulting from proof of all elements of the offence  combined with disproof or failure of all defences that are open on the evidence    There are  it should be said  significant departures from the common law in the articulation of a number of offences      Judicial Review   at    On such analysis  if the requirements of s     are satisfied it must follow that there can be no criminal responsibility and therefore no offence
