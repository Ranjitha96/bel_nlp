World  Victoria  Pty Ltd   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  On   November   in an action for breach of trust  and misleading or deceptive conduct  McInnis FM found for Internet Centre of Excellence   Pty Ltd  ICE     FMCA    ICE   was the applicant below and is the respondent to this appeal  His Honour ordered Computer World  Victoria  Pty Ltd  Computer World  the appellant  to pay an amount of just over   by way of damages  together with costs fixed in the sum of    He dismissed a cross claim filed on behalf of Computer World   The trial occupied several days  It was conducted without pleadings  The facts were essentially quite simple  ICE   conducted a retail computer sales outlet on behalf of the Computer World until approximately April    Computer World permitted ICE   to use its signage  and supplied it with stock  ICE   would account to Computer World in relation to sales of stock  and receive commissions from it   As part of the arrangement between the parties  ICE   deposited an amount of   with Computer World pursuant to what was described as  a credit facility  dated   December    It is unnecessary to set out the terms of that document in their entirety  However  the relevant parts are as follows           Re credit facility      We  the undersigned  Computer World  Vic  Pty Ltd  agree to grant you credit facility for the purchase of computers and associated goods  goods  on the following terms and conditions         That you deposit an amount of    security amount   the receipt of which is acknowledged  into a separate interest bearing account to be opened in the name of Computer World  Vic  Pty Ltd and titled Internet Centre of Excellence   Pty Ltd Trust Account       The security amount can only be drawn upon by Computer World  Vic  Pty Ltd in the event the Internet Centre of Excellence   Pty Ltd fails to pay for goods purchased within the trading terms  citedCDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Computer World relies upon s   of the Federal Court Act    Cth  as the basis for the receipt by this Court of this further evidence  Pursuant to that section  the power of the Court to receive further evidence on appeal is discretionary  The discretion is a wide one  but must be exercised judicially  CDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR   at    Factors such as finality  discoverability of the evidence and its likely effect on the orders made are usually relevant to the exercise of the discretion referred toJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  His Honour regarded the evidence presented by both parties as unsatisfactory  He noted that ICE   had not called Mr Hasturk as a witness  There was some hearsay evidence from Ms Anne Gardner  on behalf of ICE   to the effect that Mr Hasturk had  since returned to his homeland of Turkey  and that his whereabouts at the time of the trial were unknown  In these circumstances  his Honour declined to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference against ICE     After judgment in this matter was delivered  Computer World discovered that Mr Hasturk had not in fact gone to Turkey  but had at all material times been in Melbourne and available to give evidence  Moreover  he was easily capable of being contacted by ICE   because he retained the same mobile telephone number that he had used when employed by that company   By notice of motion dated   April   Computer World sought leave to lead further evidence on the appeal to this Court  Essentially  that further evidence is contained in an affidavit sworn by Mr Hasturk in which he deposed to his understanding of the arrangement he had entered into with Mr Yuvarajah at the time that the credit facility was signed   Computer World submits that had the evidence of Mr Hasturk been led before his Honour  it may well have caused him to accept the evidence of Mr Yuvarajah  rather than rejecting that evidence  That in turn might have led his Honour to find that there was a collateral agreement of the type alleged by Computer World  rather than a trust  as his Honour ultimately found  Computer World also submits that  had his Honour been aware that Mr Hasturk was available to give evidence  but had not been called by ICE   he may well have been prepared to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference against ICE   rather than refusing to do so   Ground three contends that his Honour erred in failing to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference in relation to the non appearance of Mr Hasturk  and also of Ms Serif Memis  who was another employee of ICE   at the relevant time  For the reasons set out above in relation to the further evidence ground  a Jones v Dunkel inference in relation to Mr Hasturk could not have assisted Computer World  Such an inference would not overcome the legal impediment to its claim created by the High Court s decision in Equuscorp    As part of ground three  Computer World claims that his Honour erred in drawing a Jones v Dunkel inference against it in relation to a particular witness who prepared the spreadsheets exhibited to Mr Yuvarajah s affidavits  but was not called  Pinky   However   Pinky  seems to have played a more central role in preparing the accounting documents that were tendered on Computer World s behalf  It was open to his Honour to distinguish between  Pinky  and Ms Memis in that regard   Ground six complains that his Honour misconstrued the nature of the evidence by equating  stock transfers  with  invoices  when these are in fact different concepts  His Honour dealt with this issue at   of his reasons for judgment  Regardless of whether stock was transferred from Computer World to ICE   for on sale to customers  or for display purposes  the transaction and transfer of stock was evidenced by Computer World s  stock transfer  documents  These stock transfers were at times referred to as  invoices  which is effectively what they were  but the debate is somewhat sterile  and merely involves semantics  There is nothing to suggest any error of the kind alleged in his Honour s reasons   Ground seven complains that his Honour misunderstood the nature of the evidence in that ICE   was the only party in a position to generate invoices and associated documentation  and not Computer World  Once again  there is nothing in this point  His Honour was plainly aware of the distinction between Computer World s  stock transfer  documents  and the tax invoices generated by ICE   for sales to customers   Ground eight asserts that his Honour erred in finding for ICE   on its claim pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   In particular  it alleges that even assuming that Computer World engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by representing that the security amount would be kept in a separate trust account in favour of ICE   there was no evidence that ICE   relied upon any such representation when Mr Hasturk handed over the cheque for     There is some substance in this ground  Without Mr Hasturk s evidence  his Honour must have inferred reliance  There was little  if any  evidence upon which such an inference could be based  Mr Hasturk s evidence  if it were to be received  would tend to negate reliance because as he put it  he regarded the credit facility as nothing more than a formality   The difficulty confronting Computer World in relation to ground eight is that it leads nowhere  His Honour found in favour of ICE   primarily on the basis of breach of trust  No issue of reliance arises in relation to that cause of action  Any findings that he made in relation to the alternative claim under s   of the Trade Practices Act were dicta  as his Honour specifically noted at   of his reasons for judgment  The relief to which ICE   was entitled in relation to its claim for breach of trust was exactly the same as the damages that might have been awarded under s    It follows that  irrespective of whether his Honour fell into error on this point  no appealable error is demonstrated   Ground nine complains that his Honour erred in finding contrary to the evidence that Ms Gardner was at all material times the managing director of ICE    Ms Gardner was the managing director from at least   April   and possibly earlier  through to February    By the time of the trial  she was a consultant  If his Honour erred in the manner alleged in this ground  it was an error of a minor kind  It did not infect his overall reasons for judgment with appealable error  and did not lead to an incorrect result   Finally  ground ten complains that his Honour acted upon hearsay  particularly hearsay derived from the various affidavits of Ms Gardner  No objection was taken to those affidavits at the time that they were read  Subsequently  during cross examination of Ms Gardner  counsel for Computer World purported to object to her affidavit evidence except for her analysis of business records which was conceded to be appropriate and unobjectionable  The hearsay objection was never properly particularised  and the matter was never thereafter pursued  This ground cannot succeed   It follows that the application for leave to rely upon further evidence will be refused  and the appeal itself dismissed  The appellant must pay the respondent s costs     I certify that the preceding thirty

Hasturk s evidence would have to overcome the difficult legal hurdle created by the High Court s judgment in Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at         In that case  the respondents alleged that the  operative agreement  was not contained in a written loan agreement  but was reached earlier  and was wholly oral  Yet it was not said that the written agreement should be rectified  Nor was it said that a defence of non est factum was available  or that the agreement was executed by mistake  or that its execution was procured by misrepresentation   The High Court explained why the law does not permit reliance upon a collateral agreement of the type alleged in circumstances where a written agreement has been executed  First  this ensures that the legal rights and obligations of the parties turn upon what their words and conduct would reasonably be understood to convey  and not upon actual beliefs or intentions  Secondly  in the nature of things  oral agreements will often be disputable  Resolving such disputes can be difficult  time consuming  expensive and problematic  As a consequence  where parties enter into a written agreement  courts will generally hold them to the obligations which they have assumed by that agreement  The obligations of written agreements between parties cannot simply be ignored or brushed aside   The High Court went on to state some general principles  It noted that some contracts are alleged to have been partly oral  and partly written  In such cases  evidence as to the oral terms can be given  but not if those terms contradict the terms of the written agreement   Turning back to the present case  it is far from clear just how Computer World put its case at first instance  On one view  it submitted that the credit facility was nothing more than an acknowledgement of a loan  akin to a receipt  Unfortunately for Computer World  the credit facility simply does not read that way  Indeed  Mr Hasturk regarded it as a contract  albeit  a formality   Nor does the credit facility read as though it contains the terms of a contract that is intended to be partly written and partly oral  Even if it did  the supposed oral agreement between Mr Yuvarajah and Mr Hasturk would directly contradict the written term in paragraph one of the document that the security amount be deposited on trust for ICE    I am unable to accept Computer World s submission that  in some way  it impliedly sought rectification of the written agreement before McInnis FM  Mr Yuvarajah s reference to a  mistake  does not  in context  suggest that any such application was being made  In accordance with the principles so clearly enunciated in Equuscorp  and also stated in earlier cases such as Hoyts v Spencer   HCA         CLR   and BP Refinery v Hastings   HCA         CLR   contradiction of a written term  absent rectification  cannot be permitted   Ground three contends that his Honour erred in failing to draw a Jones
