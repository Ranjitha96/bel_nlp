Sherzad v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedElliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The applicant asserts that this is supported by the construction of the provision given by RD Nicholson J  at first instance  in Elliott v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   and    cited at   and   of the applicant s submissions   The Minister noted that Elliott did not concern the issue raised in the present case  The Minister submits that the excerpts cited by the applicant do not support the applicant s submission  the applicant has omitted the final sentence of   which would  in part  serve to undermine the construction proffered  RD Nicholson J said at    The question which the Tribunal was required to answer in relation to subreg    c ii  was whether the applicant had an overseas near relative with whom he had not had contact within a reasonable period before making the application  In the case of the applicant  the question was referrable to his mother and or half siblings    Emphasis added  In Elliott   the applicant had claimed that he had not had contact with any of his relatives  The Tribunal was not satisfied of this  Viewed in this light  this would suggest  as the Minister contends  that the same question needed to be asked of each of the applicant s overseas near relatives  This construction is borne out by what RD Nicholson J goes on to say at    Approaching the reasons of the Tribunal in accordance with the injunction of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shang Liang   HCA         CLR   at     not to construe such reasons too finely  it is a fact that the Tribunal stated the following in the course of its reasons       In order to satisfy subregulation    c ii  the visa applicant must not have had any contact with an overseas near relative within a reasonable period before making the application      The visa applicant has claimed that he did not have any contact with either his mother or half siblings in the United Kingdom within a reasonable period before making his application on   October          Based on the evidence before it  the Tribunal is not satisfied that  on the balance of probabilities  the visa applicant had not had any social contact with his mother or half siblings within a reasonable period before making his visa application       On the face of these statements they support a conclusion that the Tribunal understood the question posed by subreg    c ii   In themselves they belie the contention of the applicant that the Tribunal applied the policy with disregard to the requirements of the Act   Moreover  the Minister submits that the Tribunal does not ask the correct question by asking itself whether there is an overseas near relative among the relevant three with whom the applicant has not had contact  According to the Minister  the correct question is whether the applicant has had contact with an overseas near relative  the same question must be asked of each overseas near relative  Therefore  the Minister submits  the contact the applicant had with the mother and sister both residing in Afghanistan prevented the applicant from meeting the criteria for the visa   This construction  the Minister submits  is supported by the operation of s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth    Contra  applicant s submissions at   which provides   In any Act  unless the contrary intention appears   a                 b  words in the singular number include the plural and words in the plural number include the singular  citedElliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Minister submits that the Tribunal may refer to the Procedures Advice Manual   noting the observations of the Full Court in Elliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at        Although not directly referred to by the Tribunal in this instance  Procedures Advice Manual   provides with regard to the effect of reg    c ii   CONTACT WITH ONRS IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY  INC  AUSTRALIA      Ineligibility In regards to regulations    c ii  an applicant is ineligible if they or their spouse  if applicable  has had contact with their ONR within a reasonable period before making the visa application  The regulation is worded so that it is up to the applicant to show that they and their spouse have not had any contact with their ONR s    Emphasis in original  This  the Minister submits  in particular the last line of the excerpt  would seem to support this construction   The proposition that the requirement in reg    c ii  is satisfied  in the case of an applicant who has two or three overseas near relatives  if the applicant has not had any contact with one of them within the relevant period  even if he has had regular contact with the other or others during that period  would  in my view  undermine the whole basis of the  remaining relative  concept for a Subclass   visa  Read in context  that is  read in the context of reg     as a whole  the basis of the concept is that the visa applicant must not have more than three overseas near relatives even if he had not had contact with any of them during the relevant period  reg    d  or if he has three or a lesser number of overseas near relatives  he only satisfies the requirement of reg    c ii  if he has not had contact with any of them within the relevant period citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As to the second contention  at   of his submissions  the applicant contends that the evidential burden on the applicant and the absence of language intending disqualification  mean that the matters at reg    a   e  take on qualifying factors  To support this proposition the applicant cited French J  with whom Finn and Hely JJ agreed  in Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v Hidalgo   FCAFC         FCR   at     In Hidalgo   the Court was construing reg    c i  which provides that remaining relative visas were only available to those applicants who  usually resided in a country  not being Australia  that was different from a country in which their overseas near relative lived  French J said at    In my opinion  reg    c i  is intended to apply to the circumstance in which an applicant for the relevant visa has an overseas relative in another country  It is concerned with their geographical relationship when they both reside outside Australia  It is not a regulation which is intended to bring in  by a sidewind  a disqualifying criterion for the grant of such a visa based upon the circumstance that the applicant happens to have her only usual residence in Australia  In the event that the applicant usually resides in Australia only  then the criterion under reg    c i  simply does not apply because the circumstances to which it is intended to apply do not arise    Emphasis added  The Minister submits that the above passage makes clear that the applicant s contention that French J s remarks are of wholesale application to the regulation per se is untenable  First  French J was referring to reg    c i  and secondly  the Minister submits that his Honour s observations are limited to the facts of the case to be decided
