Affairs  No     FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Referring to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         FCR   the applicant submitted that although it is not the duty of the decision maker to make out a case for the applicant  the Tribunal is obliged to correctly apply the law to the issues raised by the evidence and consider the claims expressly made  such as the claim in relation to superior orders  The applicant submitted that the failure by the applicant to raise the issue of the defence of superior orders based on the law existing prior to the coming in to force of the convention could have in no way prejudiced the respondent  The applicant also submitted that  as in Kuswardana   the consequences of not correcting the error of the Tribunal would be exceptionally serious to the applicant   The respondent submitted that this was not a matter of retrospective application of criminal laws  Criminal responsibility was not being created pursuant to the Rome Statute  The respondent submitted that non retroactivity ratione personae  Art   of the Rome Statute  is properly a matter that relates to the exercise of jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court  The respondent submitted that the issue was the appropriate source of the definition of the crimes listed in Art  F a  of the Refugees Convention and noted that the Full Court had held that the Rome Statute was one of the international instruments from which crimes mentioned in Art  F a  could be characterised   The respondent submitted that the availability or otherwise of any conceivable defence was not an  essential statutory precondition  for the application of Art   or Art   so as to invoke the Kuswardana principle  Further  the Full Court held that what was required under Art  F a  included the availability of a defence under the Rome Statute only if it was relied on by the person  at    The respondent submitted that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to consider a defence that was not relied upon by the applicant and that this situation was a fortiori in relation to defences said to exist not under the Rome Statute  The respondent submitted  relying on NABE  No   that a determination that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is not to be lightly made referred toR v Finta     SCR   The applicant relied on the Canadian decision of R v Finta     SCR   as authority for the proposition that the defence predated the Rome Statute and was available  The applicant submitted that the limited defence of superior orders which existed before the entry into force of the Rome Statute  required the consideration of the nature of the orders  whatever the crime and did not draw a distinction between orders to commit genocide  or crimes against humanity as distinct from other international crimes such as war crimes  as Art   of the Rome Statute does   The applicant submitted that  in accordance with Art   and Art   of the Rome Statute and in order not to give Art   a detrimental retrospective effect  any other defence that was available prior to the coming into force of the Rome Statute must be considered  Art   would preserve any defence which was available prior to the coming into force of the Rome Statute which was consistent with Art   of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that no one will be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time it was committed   Specifically  the applicant submitted that once the Tribunal  determined to make a finding  under Art   rather than Art   it was obliged to consider whether Art   would preserve the defence acknowledged in R v Finta   He submitted that under the   United Nations General Assembly  Art   no one was to be  held guilty  of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence under national or international law at the time it was committed   At the hearing an issue was raised about the effect of the applicant s failure to make a submission in the proceeding before the Tribunal about whether the defence of superior orders existed before the Rome Statute came into force  Specifically  the issue was whether jurisdictional error can be established when a Tribunal fails to address a matter that was not raised before it or  as a matter of discretion  whether the applicant is now precluded from raising it   The respondent noted that the Art   of the Rome Statute departed from provisions made in previous instruments where  superior orders  were not recognised as a defence  but rather a matter to be pleaded in mitigation of punishment  The respondent submitted that the applicant had not established that prior to the entry into force of the Rome Statute  there existed a defence of superior orders to a charge of crimes against humanity  The respondent submitted that the decision in Finta concerned what may be viewed as a complementary defence of compulsion or duress  The respondent submitted the applicant did not seek to bring himself within the duress defence in Art  d   The respondent submitted that even if Finta did stand for the proposition that the defence of superior orders was available  that decision alone would  not go so far as to crystallise customary international law on the point   The respondent submitted that it was not necessary to discern a clear rule of customary international law with regard to the defence of superior orders for the purpose of determining the application of the defence in Art   to crimes against humanity  pursuant to Article  F a  of the Refugees Convention   The respondent submitted that as the existence of a defence under customary international law had not been raised before the Tribunal  it had been under no obligation to consider it  It was not a matter squarely raised on the material before the Tribunal   In relation to the question of whether the Tribunal erred in failing to consider the definition in Art  e  of the Rome Statute  there is no inconsistency between the content of Art   and the definition of torture in Art  e  and the latter does not raise any additional consideration which should be addressed when considering whether the crime of torture had been committed  The definition refers to the  intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental   Clearly  Art  a  which refers to the intent to engage in conduct  encompasses the conduct of  inflicting  pain or suffering and Art  b  which refers to the intent to cause a consequence  picks up the consequences of  severe pain or suffering   It was open to the Tribunal to determine whether the applicant had intended to commit the crime defined in Art  e  by reference to the test concerning the mental element articulated in Art  a   It did so  Ground  a  is not made out referred toSRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  This decision of the delegate was previously the subject of an unsuccessful application for review to the Tribunal  see SRYYY and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   AATA    In an appeal to this Court against the Tribunal s decision  Lindgren J found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application as incompetent  see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA    An appeal from that judgment was successful and the Full Court remitted the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law  see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR     Under s  a  of the Migration Act    Cth  a criterion for a protection visa is that the Minister is satisfied that the visa applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  Under Art  F of that Convention    The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that         a  he has committed a crime against peace  a war crime  or a crime against humanity   as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes       b  he has committed a serious non political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee       c  he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations   emphasis added  One means of ascertaining the meaning of a crime against humanity is to refer to the International Criminal Court Act    Cth   Section   of the Act provides that the principal object of the Act is to facilitate compliance with Australia s obligations under the Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on   July    the Rome Statute  which is Schedule   to that Act  The Rome Statute is an international instrument of the type referred to in Art  F a  see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     Relevantly  the Rome Statute provides  Article     Crimes against humanity        For the purpose of this Statute   crime against humanity  means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population  with knowledge of the attack           a                     f  Torture               For the purpose of paragraph            a   Attack directed against any civilian population  means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph   against any civilian population  pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack           e   Torture  means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering  whether physical or mental  upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused  except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from  inherent in or incidental to  lawful sanctions                    Article     Elements of Crimes          Elements of Crimes shall assist the Court in the interpretation and application of articles     and    They shall be adopted by a two thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States Parties         Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by       a  Any State Party     b  The judges acting by an absolute majority     c  The Prosecutor      Such amendments shall be adopted by a two thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States Parties           The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute              Article     Nullum crimen sine lege          A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes  at the time it takes place  a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court       The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy  In case of ambiguity  the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated  prosecuted or convicted       This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law independently of this Statute                Article     Non retroactivity ratione personae        No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the Statute       In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement  the law more favourable to the person being investigated  prosecuted or convicted shall apply      Article     Individual criminal responsibility                         In accordance with this Statute  a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person     a  Commits such a crime  whether as an individual  jointly with another or through another person  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible     b  Orders  solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted                Article     Mental element        Unless otherwise provided  a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge         For the purposes of this article  a person has intent where     a  In relation to conduct  that person means to engage in the conduct     b  In relation to a consequence  that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events           For the purposes of this article   knowledge  means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events   Know  and  knowingly  shall be construed accordingly            Article     Superior orders and prescription of law        The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior  whether military or civilian  shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless     a  The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question     b  The person did not know that the order was unlawful  and    c  The order was not manifestly unlawful       For the purposes of this article  orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful   The Tribunal had to determine whether the applicant was subject to the exclusionary provisions in Art  F of the Refugees Convention  That is  it had to determine whether it was satisfied that  there are serious reasons for considering  that the applicant had committed a war crime or a crime against humanity   The Tribunal set out the applicant s evidence at length  It was from a number of sources  including departmental interviews and a transcript of oral evidence given at the previous tribunal hearing  and spanned the years   to    The applicant joined the Sri Lankan Army in May   as an ordinary soldier  At that time there was a civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  LTTE   After a year or so on the frontline in Trincomalee and then another year at Elephant Pass the applicant requested a transfer because he disliked witnessing innocent civilians and fellow soldiers being killed and injured  He was posted to Jaffna where he was assigned to a unit responsible for questioning suspects  This sometimes involved threatening and harming detainees   The applicant submitted  in relation to ground   that because the Rome Statute was not in force at the time the applicant was alleged to have committed the crimes alleged  he ought not to be precluded from reliance on the defence of superior orders  He noted that the Full Court decision in SRYYY questioned whether Art   accurately reflected customary international law  The applicant submitted that to the extent that Art   excluded the defence of superior orders in relation to crimes against humanity  it ought not to be given retrospective effect
