austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In the notice of appeal filed on   September   the appellant contended that his Honour erred by      holding that the decision of the Third Tribunal was not affected by jurisdictional error    failing to hold that the appellant was not provided with a real opportunity to give evidence and present arguments at the hearing before the Third Tribunal on   November   contrary to s   of the Act    refusing to receive oral evidence at the hearing below from Ms Peterson concerning the physical actions of the Third Tribunal Member at the hearing  which evidence would have been relevant to the issues before the Court and in circumstances where the absence if such evidence formed a basis for his Honour s dismissal of the application    failing to find that the Third Tribunal s decision was affected by apprehended bias  and    failing to find that the Third Tribunal s approach to issues of credibility involved jurisdictional error  The Third Tribunal  by adopting a procedure based on the assumption that the purpose of the hearing was to discover whether the applicant was a truthful person  breached s   of the Act and failed to exercise jurisdiction to determine the claims before it  In this regard  it was contended that his Honour failed to apply the reasoning of this Court in Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration   FCA         FCR   at     In written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant  contentions were made in support of the grounds in the notice of appeal  as well as leave being sought to raise a new ground of appeal   In light of those contentions  it is necessary to say something more of the previous history of the delegate s decision and the three Tribunal hearings   Finally  the appellant claims that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find that the Tribunal s approach to issues of credibility involved jurisdictional error  see Kopalapillai   FCA       FCR   at     The Federal Magistrate rejected the submission that  by entirely focusing on the appellant s credibility  the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error   His Honour correctly noted that  at the end of the Third Tribunal hearing  which is not recorded in the transcript  the Member identified that the assessment of the appellant s status turned on the appellant s credibility   In Kopalapillai   FCA       FCR   at   the Full Court of this Court  O Connor  Branson and Marshall JJ  said  Were we satisfied that the RRT had reached its decision in this case by adopting a procedure which placed on the appellant an onus of establishing that he was truthful  or even a procedure based on the assumption that the purpose of the hearing before it was to discover whether the appellant was a truthful person  we would be satisfied that the procedures adopted by the RRT contravened s   of the Act   I do not regard his Honour s approach to be at odds with the approach taken by the Full Court in Kopalapillai   FCA       FCR    All the Tribunal was doing  at the end of the hearing  was stressing the important issue of credibility  It was not elevating such an issue to that hypothesised in Kopalapillai   I agree with the approach taken by the Federal Magistrate   The appeal should be allowed   The matter should be remitted to a differently constituted Federal Magistrates Court for a re hearing and reconsideration

any indication that the Third Tribunal s decision was affected by an apprehension of bias against the appellant  His Honour noted that the test for apprehended bias  as set out by the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte H   HCA         ALR     was  whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided   at   and suggested that  in view of its administrative and inquisitorial nature  the test might be formulated  by reference to a hypothetical fair minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings  the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias   at     His Honour had the advantage of listening to the sound recording of the Third Tribunal hearing conducted by Mr Short  and specifically addressed the appellant s written submissions  in which the appellant alleged that     i  Mr Short  came to the hearing with a closed mind  because  he was only interested in determining that I was not a credible witness    ii  Throughout the hearing Mr Short  had extremely long pauses  which  only added to my nervousness    iii  Mr Short was  very aggressive  in exchanges with Ms Stotz at one point of the hearing concerning the  appellant s  evidence given at earlier hearings about the official position he held in the Awami League  He spoke to Ms Stotz  in a very rude  dismissive voice   He  became distracted by his dislike of Ms Stotz  rather than focusing on my case itself   The  appellant  was ignored  when Mr Short  shouted  at Ms Stotz and criticised her preparation for the hearing   iv  At a later point  Mr Short  shouted  at the  appellant  when drawing his attention to a document to which he referred   v  A lay person would have felt that Mr Short s questioning of the  appellant  about the  appellant s  knowledge of the Awami League s official objectives and its flag was  unfair and intimidatory  because  the Member would have known that I only participated in Awami League politics at a village level    vi  At a later point  Mr Short again  began berating my representative  and asked her questions  in a very menacing tone of voice    vii       Mr Short  left his chair and proceeded towards Ms Stotz  shaking his forefinger at her  It appeared that he was going to strike her  My witnesses and I were very worried and frightened    viii  Mr Short listened to the applicant s two witnesses  but did not ask questions of them  so that  it appeared that he was not really interested in what they had to say  or how their evidence was significant to my case    ix  The  Third  Tribunal did not take into account that the  appellant  came from a different social and cultural environment and might experience bewilderment and anxiety  Nor did it take into account that the  appellant s  educational  social and cultural background might affect the manner in which he provided his evidence   His Honour noted that while the Third Tribunal arrived at an adverse conclusion on credibility in its ultimate decision  with reference to logical and supported reasons which had previously been put to the appellant  this did not suggest that there was any predetermination of that outcome  The Federal Magistrate could not find anything in Mr Short s questioning of the appellant at the hearing  nor in the subsequent s  A invitation for comments  nor in his ultimate statement of reasons  which indicated that he prematurely closed his mind to a proper assessment of the appellant s refugee claims  Accordingly  his Honour did not consider that a fair minded lay observer might have formed any reasonable apprehension about this  taking into account the Tribunal s usual inquisitorial procedures which were referred to by the High Court in Ex parte H   HCA       ALR     Further  his Honour did not accept that there was any behaviour by Mr Short towards Ms Stotz in the course of this exchange which should be characterised as  very aggressive  nor as unreasonably  rude  or  dismissive   Further  his Honour did not accept that Mr Short s concern about Ms Stotz s competence as a migration agent became a distraction to Mr Short at this point  or any other point  such that it prevented him from properly conducting the hearing   In relation to the appellant s submission that  Mr Short  left his chair and proceeded towards Ms Stotz  shaking his forefinger at her  It appeared that he was going to strike her  My witnesses and I were very worried and frightened  his Honour noted that there was no evidence before the court to support this accusation  His Honour held that as the accusation was not foreshadowed prior to the hearing  and the respondents were unable to respond to it without adequate prior notification  His Honour refused to allow evidence from a Ms Peterson to be adduced in support of that submission citedSali v SPC Ltd

 ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A general admonition that the truthfulness of the appellant s account is in question is not sufficient to discharge the obligation under s   to identify particular issues in circumstances where there would a departure from accepted findings by the Delegate in favour of the appellant  see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR         at       The obligation is to give the appellant an opportunity to give evidence or make submissions on a determinative issue   However  as the High Court said in SZBEL   HCA       ALR       at   First  there may well be cases  perhaps many cases  where either the delegate s decision  or the tribunal s statements or questions during a hearing  sufficiently indicate to an applicant that everything he or she says in support of the application is in issue  That indication may be given in many ways  It is not necessary  and often would be inappropriate  for the tribunal to put to an applicant  in so many words  that he or she is lying  that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth  or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that is given of certain events  The proceedings are not adversarial and the tribunal is not  and is not to adopt the position of  a contradictor  But where  as here  there are specific aspects of an applicant s account  that the tribunal considers may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt  the tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and ask the applicant to explain why the account should be accepted   This is one of those cases alluded to by the High Court   The Third Tribunal stated that it did raise the question of his membership of AL as an issue  It said  I foreshadowed that I would be writing to the applicant in accordance with section  A of the Act  The applicant s representative asked if I accepted that the applicant was a member of Awami League  I noted that this was clearly an issue in the review  The applicant s representative referred to Ms Petersen s evidence and stressed that the applicant had only been involved at the village level  She submitted that although his title had been  Publicity Secretary  his role had not been that of a Publicity Secretary in Australia  I noted that the applicant s role as Publications Secretary had been discussed at the previous hearings and that at the hearing before the second Tribunal in October   he had said that he had spoken at meetings so many times that he could not remember  The applicant said that as Publications Secretary he had organised meetings  He said that when he had referred to speaking at meetings he had meant that he had been the MC at meetings citedSZEUI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Therefore  whether or not the appellant was put on notice by the Second Tribunal decision or not  see SZEUI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     the Third Tribunal certainly did raise in a timely and appropriate way the issue of his membership of AL   Accordingly  the Third Tribunal did not fail to comply with s   of the Act in this respect   As to the other basis for breach of s   of the Act  I do not consider the Federal Magistrate fell into error citedSZITH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The appellant was questioned about matters going to the extent of his involvement in the AL  the sophistication of his knowledge about the AL s stated policy platforms  and the nature of the electoral system in Bangladesh  SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FMCA   at   and    All of those matters clearly related to the issues that had arisen from the delegate s decision  and  in the First Tribunal hearing  about the level of his political profile   The questions did not raise  nor challenge  as an issue his claimed membership of the AL over many years  or his desire to continue to be a member of the AL upon his return to Bangladesh   On   November   the Second Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Delegate of the Minister   In the judicial review proceedings from the Second Tribunal  Driver FM found  in SZITH   FMCA   at            The real issue  however  is whether the  appellant  was given an opportunity to deal with the issue of whether he was a member of the Awami League as he had claimed  He was clearly on notice from the decisions of the delegate and the first Tribunal that the issue of the particular offices that he held  and the degree and duration of his involvement in the Party  were live issues  Both the delegate and the first Tribunal had  however  accepted that the  appellant  was a member of the Awami League as he had claimed  The presiding member  at the hearing conducted by the second Tribunal  did say that he would be  undertaking a completely new examination of  the  application   It is also true that at the hearing conducted by the second Tribunal the  appellant  was questioned at length about his asserted activities as a member of the Awami League  At no stage  however  was the appellant put on notice that his very Party membership  which had previously been accepted  was in issue     Neither did the letter sent to the  appellant  pursuant to s  A of the Migration Act   put the  appellant  on notice that his membership of the Awami League was in issue  Rather  it would have had the reverse effect  The  information  relied upon by the Tribunal to find that the  appellant  was not a member of the Awami League was disclosed in that letter on the basis that the information might indicate  that your claims to have been an active campaigner on behalf of the Awami League in the   election were not accurate   Thus  the  appellant  was given to understand that his inability to name his local Parliamentary constituency accurately might be used for a limited adverse purpose  whereas it was ultimately used for a much more fundamental adverse purpose     It follows  and I find  that the Tribunal fell into the same jurisdictional error as was identified by the High Court in SZBEL  In order for the  appellant  to be given an effective hearing opportunity pursuant to s     he needed to be able to deal with the proposition  not only that he did not hold the offices in the Party that he claimed and was not actively involved as he claimed but also that he was never a member of the Awami League at all as he had claimed  The second Tribunal made a far more fundamental adverse credibility finding against the appellant than had the first Tribunal and the delegate  The second Tribunal needed to put the appellant on notice that that more fundamental adverse credibility finding was in prospect in order for the hearing opportunity afforded the  appellant  to be a real one   A similar argument is now sought to be raised in relation to the process undertaken by the Third Tribunal  Although the application before the Federal Magistrate claimed that a breach of s   occurred  this focused only on the failure to provide the appellant with an opportunity during the hearing to listen to parts of the tapes of the previous hearings concerning the particular issues which the appellant was being questioned in the Third Tribunal hearing   Leave is now sought to have this Court consider the additional aspect of breach of s   of the Act as found by Driver FM in the Second Tribunal hearing   I accept that there was no identification of this issue in any of the invitations to hearing issued to the appellant following the remittal by the Federal Magistrate s Court  Again  the s  A letter which was issued after the hearing suffered from the same deficiencies identified by Driver FM in SZITH FMCA   at   in that it did not specifically identify the mere membership of AL as a separate issue citedSZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Allegations of bias impact on the integrity of the Tribunal  and should be carefully and fully considered  Undoubtedly an adjournment would have been necessary if the evidence was accepted  However  while the Federal Magistrates Court has an exceptionally busy case load  there was no indication by his Honour of case management issues impacting

HCA         CLR         and SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at    citedSZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I do not consider it was incumbent upon the Third Tribunal to accede to the appellant s request for a transcript of previous Tribunal hearings  even if they were available  see generally SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at       per Flick J   However  the real question is whether  in circumstances where the appellant had the tapes in his possession  the Third Tribunal was required  as suggested by the appellant  to play that part of the tape of the appellant s evidence on each point the Third Tribunal wished to consider  or possibly contest  because of inconsistencies in the evidence  I do not regard this as necessary in the circumstances of this case  The issue of credibility arose because of inconsistencies in the prior evidence given by the appellant  Accepting the information conveyed by the appellant on the tapes  and not the way the evidence was adduced  gave rise to credibility issues  the important matter was to bring to the appellant s attention such issues  This the Third Tribunal did  How it did this was a matter for the Third Tribunal  It is to be recalled that the appellant had the tapes and the issue of credibility was an issue going to the appellant s very own evidence in the previous hearings  of which he was either familiar with or could re familiarise himself with by himself playing the tapes prior to the hearing   In my view  the Federal Magistrate s observations on this matter were correct  and provide a proper basis for rejecting this ground of appeal  Fairness did not require  in the circumstances before the Third Tribunal  the playing of the tapes and the identification therein of the parts considered relevant by the Third Tribunal  at the hearing itself  The important requirement  as I have said  was to bring appropriately and fairly the point of contest to the attention of the appellant  so the appellant could respond  This the Tribunal did  and in my view  the procedure suggested by the appellant was unnecessary to achieve fairness citedSZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It has been held on a number of occasions
