T ben v Jones   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedJeffers v The Queen   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe factors which are relevant to the discretion to extend time within which to appeal are well known  It is unnecessary for me to discuss the cases in detail  The leading authorities are Jess v Scott     FCR     Jeffers v The Queen   HCA         ALJR       ALR     Parker v The Queen   FCAFC    The fifth factor which may be considered is the strength of the proposed appeal  If a proposed appellant is unable to demonstrate any prospect of success in the appeal then that will be a reason to refuse an extension of time  Jeffers v The Queen   HCA         ALJR       ALR   at     per Deane  Dawson and Toohey JJ  In this case  the respondent submits that the proposed appeal has no prospects of success and that  despite the other circumstances suggesting an extension of time should be granted  this factor is of sufficient weight to justify a refusal of the application for an extension of time  The precise formulation of this factor and its application sometimes proves difficult  If it is clear that the proposed appeal has no prospects of success then  no doubt  an application for an extension of time will be refused  However  care must be exercised and that conclusion should not be reached too readily because  as in the situation before me  the Court has not had the benefit of the full submissions which would be made on the appeal  A conclusion which goes no further than that the grounds of appeal appear weak or unlikely to succeed will not ordinarily lead to a refusal to extend the time within which to appeal where the other factors suggest an extension of time should be granted  I have read the primary judge s reasons for finding the applicant guilty of contempt  the proposed grounds of appeal and the outline of submissions filed by the respondent  In the outline  the respondent advances submissions as to why he contends each ground of appeal is doomed to fail  I have also had the benefit of oral submissions from both parties  I do not propose to traverse each ground of appeal and the respondent s submissions in relation to each ground  Certainly  I am satisfied that the proposed grounds of appeal appear weak and indeed some of the grounds appear to be without merit  However  I cannot reach the conclusion that the proposed appeal has no prospect of success without hearing a good deal more from the parties  and any further hearing would approximate the hearing of the appeal itself  It is not appropriate that I undertake such an exercise  In my opinion  an extension of time should be granted and the order of the Court is as follows   The time within which the applicant may file and serve a notice of appeal appealing against the declarations made by Lander J on   April    order number   and containing the   grounds of appeal identified in exhibit  GFT B  to the applicant s affidavit sworn on   May   be extended to   June   referred toJess v Scott     FCR  The factors which are relevant to the discretion to extend time within which to appeal are well known  It is unnecessary for me to discuss the cases in detail  The leading authorities are Jess v Scott     FCR     Jeffers v The Queen   HCA         ALJR       ALR     Parker v The Queen   FCAFC   referred toJones v Toben   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe respondent brought a notice of motion seeking the punishment of the applicant for contempt of court  in disobeying orders of this Court and failing to honour undertakings given to the Court  The notice of motion was heard by a judge of this Court  the primary judge  who made a number of orders on   April    The application for an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal relates to the seventh order made on   April   which is a declaration in the following terms     The respondent has been guilty of wilful and contumacious contempt of court on          December   and      December   and      April   and      May   and      June   and      June   and      June       by publishing on the World Wide Web to the public material   a  in disobedience of the September   orders  and   b  in breach of the undertaking given to Justice Moore on   November        The September   orders were orders made by Branson J on   September    see Jones v Toben   FCA    On   May   the primary judge made orders as to penalty and those orders included an order that the applicant be imprisoned for a period of three months  Orders have been made from time to time that the warrant for the arrest and imprisonment of the applicant lie in the Registry of the Court  On   May   the applicant filed and served a notice of appeal against the orders made on   May   and  if pursued  that appeal will in due course be heard and determined by the Full Court of this Court  The applicant also wishes to appeal against the primary judge s declaration made on   April   but he needs an extension of time to do that because he did not file and serve a notice of appeal within the   day period prescribed by O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   The   day period expired on   May   referred toJones v Toben   FCA  I do not propose to set out any further details of the factual background of this matter  It is

time within which to appeal are well known  It is unnecessary for me to discuss the cases in detail  The leading authorities are Jess v Scott     FCR     Jeffers v The Queen   HCA         ALJR       ALR     Parker v The Queen   FCAFC   referred toReal Tech Systems Integration Pty Ltd v Meuross     FCR  The respondent filed an outline of submissions before the hearing and in that outline he submitted that the primary judge s orders made on   April   and  indeed those made on   May   were interlocutory orders  One submission he made was the primary judge s orders were interlocutory orders because they were made in the main proceeding  being an action brought under the Racial Discrimination Act    Cth  not in a separate proceeding  It was necessary to adjourn the hearing for a short time at an early stage and  before doing so  I referred counsel to the decision of Lehane J in Real Tech Systems Integration Pty Ltd v Meuross     FCR    When the hearing resumed  counsel for the respondent advised the Court that he no longer contended that the declaration was an interlocutory order and he submitted that it was appropriate for the matter to proceed on the basis that the substance of the application was for an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal  I think it is appropriate to proceed on that basis
