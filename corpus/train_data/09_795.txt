notes  there can be an overlapping between material facts and necessary facts  and as von Doussa J observed in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson     ALR   at   the distinction between material facts and necessary particulars has tended to become more obscured as the years have gone by  Nevertheless  necessary particulars can be  but do not have to be  in the statement of claim  O   r   and a party is not required to plead to necessary particulars  although it is not uncommon for that to be done  In so far as the respondents  objections are based on a failure to provide necessary particulars  they must be taken to be asking for an order that particulars be provided even though a defence has not been filed  For their part  the applicants did not seek to identify paragraphs where the true basis of the objection was a failure to provide necessary particulars and then submit that the provision of particulars should be at least postponed until after a defence is filed  They sought discovery before particulars and seem to accept that if they are successful they would thereafter provide the necessary particulars even though a defence had not been filed discussedBruce v Oldhams Press Ltd     KB  In the case of a number of pleas  counsel for the respondents  objection  as shown in the table  was that the plea was insufficiently particularised  In relation to those cases where the true basis of the objection is that the necessary particulars are not provided  it must not be overlooked that the Rules provide that  in the ordinary case  particulars will not be ordered before a defence is filed  O   r    The Rules proceed on the basis that there is a clear distinction between the pleading of material facts and the provision of necessary particulars  The distinction between material facts and necessary facts was identified by Scott LJ in the well known passage from Bruce v Oldhams Press Ltd     KB    at          The cardinal provision in r    is that the statement of claim must state the material facts  The word  material  means necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action  and if any one  material  fact is omitted  the statement of claim is bad  it is  demurrable  in the old phraseology  and in the new is liable to be  struck out  under Order XXV   r    see Philipps v  Philipps   or  a further and better statement of claim  may be ordered under Order XIX   r             The function of  particulars  under r    is quite different  They are not to be used in order to fill material gaps in a demurrable statement of claim   gaps which ought to have been filled by appropriate statements of the various material facts which together constitute the plaintiff s cause of action  The use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate requirement of pleading  imposed in fairness and justice to the defendant  Their function is to fill in the picture of the plaintiff s cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial  Consequently in strictness particulars cannot cure a bad statement of claim  But in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between a  material fact  and a  particular  piece of information which it is reasonable to give the defendant in order to tell him the case he has to meet  hence in the nature of things there is often overlapping  And the practice of sometimes putting particulars into the statement of claim and sometimes delivering them afterwards either voluntarily  or upon request or order  without any reflection as to the true legal ground upon which they are to be given has become so common that it has tended to obscure the very real distinction between them        Citation omitted  citedComputershare Limited v Perpetual Registrars Limited     VR  In addition to the above authorities  I refer to the discussion by Warren J  as her Honour then was  in Computershare Limited v Perpetual Registrars Limited     VR   at      In my opinion  this is an appropriate case for an order for discovery before particulars  As I have said  there does not seem to be much doubt that the first respondent  and perhaps other respondents  acted as the applicants  agent  owed fiduciary obligations to them and  from time to time  had control of moneys belonging to the applicants  One such obligation was and is a liability to account and to provide information to the applicants  That seemed to be acknowledged by the first respondent because one of his arguments on the applicants  application was that he has already provided a proper reconciliation to the applicants  Secondly  the evidence established that the respondents are in possession of the relevant information and  in a relative sense at least  the applicants do not have the information  or at least all of the information  Thirdly  there is a prima facie case of unauthorised use in relation to a sum of     because it seems that this sum was used by the first respondent to discharge a liability for personal expenses  Both counsel took me through a number of financial and other documents relating to the transactions referred to in the statement of claim  The purpose of the exercise from the respondents  point of view was to establish that all moneys had been used for the applicants  benefit  or in accordance with their instructions  and that they had been provided with all the information to which they were entitled  or  which they had requested  The difficulties in engaging in such an exercise at this early stage are obvious  There are a number of transactions and they are complex transactions  I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that the respondents have established a sufficiently clear case of the type they advanced to overcome those reasons for making an order for discovery before particulars and  in my opinion  it is appropriate to make such an order  ConclusioncitedEdelston v Russell     LT  For reasons I will give  I think this is an appropriate case for discovery before particulars  I do not think the fact that a defence has not been filed is an impediment to such an order at this stage   Edelston v Russell     LT    For reasons I will give  I think that some paragraphs in the statement of claim should be struck out  The defects in the statement of claim are not sufficient to warrant an order that the statement of claim be struck out  I do not think the applicants should be required to replead before discovery is made  even in relation to those paragraphs struck out on grounds other than the ground of a failure to provide necessary particulars  That would be time consuming and wasteful  I turn now to consider the particular objections to the statement of claim  In some cases  the same objection is taken to a number of paragraphs  It is convenient to deal with these paragraphs as a group  I start with the groups of paragraphs and then move to the objections to individual paragraphs discussedMayor    c   City of London v Horner     LT  A plea will have a tendency to cause embarrassment if it is

       FLR     the respondent applied to strike out an allegation in a statement of claim and the applicant sought discovery and leave to interrogate on the allegation  Brennan J  as his Honour then was  said  at        Though the power to require discovery be acknowledged  how should it be exercised  It depends upon the nature of the case and the stage of the proceedings at which the discovery is sought  In the present case  discovery is sought before there is a tittle of evidence to suggest that the Chairman did not have the requisite cause to believe which par    of the statement of claim would put in issue  Some assistance was sought to be derived from cases where discovery had been given to a party before he was required to give particulars of his claim  cases such as Ross v  Blakes Motors Ltd    but in cases of that kind there is either an anterior relationship between the parties which entitles one to obtain information from the other  or sufficient is shown to ground a suspicion that the party applying for discovery has a good case proof of which is likely to be aided by discovery  This is not such a case  This is a case where a bare allegation is made by par    of the statement of claim and  the paragraph being denied  the applicant seeks to interrogate the Chairman and ransack his documents in the hope of making a case  That is mere fishing      Citation
