F Hoffman La Roche Ltd   ATPR     at   the level of generality permitted in a representative pleading should not be so great that the respondents cannot reasonably be expected to know  with any precision  the case they have to meet  This decision was reversed on appeal on other grounds  but that does not affect Merkel J s statement of the principle citedBWK Elders  Australia  Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Other authorities to similar effect are Shelton v National Roads and Motorists  Association     ACSR   at      per Tamberlin J  and BWK Elders  Australia  Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at    per Mansfield J  appliedCadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd     ACSR   This principle is no less applicable today  It was reiterated by Young J in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd     ACSR   at       Young J observed in Cadence at   that the authorities establish that any want of clarity in the pleading can be cured by amendment or by particulars  although he also said that particulars cannot be used to fill gaps in material facts  which must be alleged  His Honour went on to say at   that consistent with the rules of pleading  a case can be pleaded at different levels of generality    But  whatever level of generality is adopted in the statement of claim  it must adhere to the basic principle that the purpose of pleadings is to define the issues and thereby inform the parties in advance of the case they have to meet and so enable them to take steps to deal with it     On the other hand  a pleading will infringe the applicable practice rules if it contains nothing more than broad conclusions asserted at such a high level of generality that the opposite party cannot understand the case it has to meet   In Cadence at   Young J referred to earlier authority of the Court which emphasises that the case management and individual docket system is such that it is well placed to ensure no embarrassment or prejudice about pleadings  Usually this can be addressed by requiring particulars to be supplied or by other means short of striking out the pleading  see Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd   FCA   at      per Merkel J    The effect of what Young J said in Cadence at   is that a strike out motion is a blunt instrument  to be used only in the event that the Court s case management procedures cannot be adapted to enable the matter to go forward   However  it seems to me that this is a case where the defect in the pleading is so fundamental that it cannot be allowed to stand in this form referred toGlobal Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The difficulty which arises is that   of the Statement of Claim is central to the allegation that statements made in the prospectus  and in the August   and October   announcements  were rendered false by reason of events which occurred later  But as a Full Court observed in Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   the non fulfilment of a prediction when the time for performance arrives does not of itself establish that the prediction was false when made or that its maker did not have an adequate foundation for its content  per Bowen CJ  Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ    What is required in the present case is a statement of the material facts in terms sufficiently clear to enable the respondents to understand precisely what the facts are that are relied upon to establish the falsity of the alleged representations or the absence of reasonable grounds   The Statement of Claim does not meet this test because the eight adverse profitability circumstances are stated at a level of generality which does not enable the respondents to know what is alleged  In particular  they are not linked to any comparison with the contents  express or implied  of the prospectus or the August   or October   announcements and they are unlimited in point of time   I accept that the actual dates when relevant matters became known are within the knowledge of the directors of Village Life  But it is for Hanne to plead whether by inference from other facts  or otherwise  matters which disclose an arguable case that the directors were  or ought to have been  aware of particular circumstances which affected the accuracy of the earlier predictions   It may well be that Hanne can do so  It is notable that Village Life does not seek to strike out the claim on the ground that the Statement of Claim is hopeless or does not disclose a cause of action  The proximity of the downgrades in February   and May   to the announcements made in late   is pertinent  So too is Mr Gageler s submission that the matters alleged in general terms in   of the Statement of Claim did not happen overnight  What occurred was apparently revealed by events over a period of time appliedGould and Birbeck and Bacon v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd  in liq    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Banque

Northam v Favelle Favco Holdings Pty Ltd  unreported  Sup Ct of NSW    March   Bryson J observed that it is not fair to require a defendant to flesh out general expressions or indirect allusions distinguishedP Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd     ACSR   Sometimes a Notice to Produce may be an appropriate method of case management  see eg P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd     ACSR   at   per Heerey J  But that would usually be where the notice  or a subpoena  would be expected to produce documents that have at least potential relevance to the issues in the case  see P Dawson at     Here  the difficulty which arises is that the issues are not defined because the pleading is too general to enable that to occur  It is the pleadings which inform the question of the content of a valid Notice to Produce  It is not for Hanne to issue a Notice to Produce to find out what case it might be able to plead  That is not to say that in due course a Notice to Produce may still be impermissible  It will be a question of whether Hanne can plead a case appropriate to what is admittedly an early stage of the proceedings   Moreover    of the Statement of Claim is also defective because it obscures a fact which is fundamental to the claim of reliance  Did Hanne read the prospectus or the August   or October   announcements  If it did  this should be pleaded  If it did not  the pleading should reflect this because there may be serious consequences for the constitution of the proceeding and the composition of the represented group referred toPhilip Morris  Australia  Ltd v Nixon   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In the Full Court decision of Philip Morris  Australia  Ltd v Nixon   FCA         ALR   at     Sackville J set out the principles applicable to pleadings in representative actions under Part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act   His Honour observed that unless the rules of pleading permit a degree of flexibility  serious inroads would be made into the utility of the representative procedure   However  it is clear from what Sackville J said that the level of generality which may be permitted in pleadings in representative actions is concerned with the pleading of facts material to the claims of each member of the represented group  see Philip Morris at     cf  Bray v Hoffman La Roche   FCAFC
