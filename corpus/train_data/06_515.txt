SINGTEL OPTUS PTY LIMITED    ACN         TWENTY SECOND RESPONDENT     JUDGE  SACKVILLE J DATE    MAY   PLACE  SYDNEY RULING ON EVIDENCE     THE REPORT     The News parties have objected to the tender by the applicants  Seven  of what is said to be an expert report prepared by Mr Kevin Kinsella  The report  which is dated   December   addresses four questions     a  What drives subscriptions for pay television           b  Which  if any  sports can be characterised as subscription drivers in the context of the Australian pay television industry           c  What factors and considerations does a retail pay television operator typically take into account in deciding             i  whether or not to acquire channels and if so on what terms  and            ii  whether to include a channel as part of a tier or basic   subscription package       d  What  if any  impact did the loss of the AFL rights from the commencement of the   AFL season and the failure to obtain the NRL pay rights from the commencement of the   season have on the ability of the Seven Network and C  to pursue an integrated media strategy        Like many of the expert reports prepared in this case  Mr Kinsella s reports are of excessive length  He has prepared three reports  the first report  a report in reply   July   and a  supplementary statement    October    The first report comprises   pages  excluding appendices  the report in reply is   pages in length  and the supplementary statement adds a further   pages to the mountain of material tendered in this case   It seems that neither money nor length of exposition is any object in these proceedings  Neither  however  necessarily produces optimum forensic outcomes  Judges have repeatedly warned about the potential waste of resources involved in the preparation of elaborate expert reports that may turn out to be of little or no assistance in resolving the issues before the court  These warnings appear not always to have been heeded in the present case   News objects to the entirety of Mr Kinsella s report  However  its principal concern appears to be with Mr Kinsella s opinions relating to so called  marquee sports   Mr Kinsella s opinions on this topic include the following  par        f  Given that they overcome consumer inertia and are frequently the catalyst for the consumer purchase decision  the most important single factor driving subscriptions is live and exclusive coverage of popular sports  marquee  sports          g  Consequently  there are certain fundamental  marquee  sports rights that a retail pay television operator should acquire if it can do so  either directly or through a channel supplier   The value of such sports rights in building the network and a subscriber base goes beyond the directly attributable cash flows         h  Only a limited number of sports are popular and attractive enough to be categorised as  premium  sports and still fewer possess the appeal  attributes and utility associated with  marquee  sports       i   Marquee  sports are distinguished  in part  by the depth and spread of their appeal to consumers  viewers and subscribers  they are amongst the most popular sports  in part  by social and cultural factors and  in part  by the greater utility they provide to  and for  television  most especially  pay television                  l      W ith respect to anti siphoning regulation and other salient constraints  it is not necessary for pay television to have every match  or every available match  from a  marquee  sport or competition exclusively accessible for live broadcast on its channel s  and or service s  in order to attain critical mass  albeit that such an approach might reasonably be expected to accelerate the time it takes the pay television operator to attain critical mass          m  Given the above  whilst in and of itself it is not sufficient   marquee  sports are a necessary pre requisite for retail pay television operators seeking to attain critical mass and the most important single factor driving subscriptions     Emphasis added   Mr Kinsella expresses the view that Seven Network had to pursue an integrated media strategy  IMS  so as better to face the dual challenges of maintaining audiences and advertising revenues  while investing in necessary diversification to ensure growth  par    a   He considers that the pursuit by the Seven Network of an IMS  was a practical  proven and generally accepted option   par    c   In his view  however  the impact of the loss of the AFL rights and the failure to attain the NRL rights on the IMS was  profound     Without access to such content  the AFL and the NRL  that could overcome consumer inertia and act as a catalyst to the consumer purchase decision  deriving value from producing and providing wholesale sporting or non sporting channels would be  if possible  problematic and the return  if any  modest  The launch of a  stand alone  retail pay television service would not have been feasible without such content   par    e    News  principal objection to the admissibility of the report is that Mr Kinsella s opinions have not been shown to be founded on his specialised knowledge  based on his study  training or experience  as required by s   of the Evidence Act    Cth    Evidence Act    Mr Whitford SC  who appeared with Mr Brereton for News  identified three sections of the report as being of particular concern        pars         which contain Mr Kinsella s analysis of  marquee sports    section   of the report  where Mr Kinsella considers which  if any  sports can be characterised as subscription drivers in the context of the Australian pay television industry  and    appendix   which explains the components of a  marquee sports assessment matrix  adopted by Mr Kinsella in section   of his report   The danger in this case is precisely that identified by Gleeson CJ in HG v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at   where his Honour observed that      Experts who venture  opinions   sometimes merely their own inference of fact  outside their field of specialised knowledge may invest those opinions with a spurious appearance of authority  and legitimate processes of fact finding may be subverted    I do not think that Mr Kinsella has the specialised knowledge required for him to express an opinion on  marquee  sports in Australia and their significance for Australian retail pay television operators  However  News  objection can be dealt with by concluding  as I do  that Mr Kinsella s reasoning process  as disclosed in his report  does not enable me to determine whether he has the necessary specialised knowledge  based on his training  study or experience  to express the opinions he has on those issues  This conclusion is sufficient to uphold the objection  HG v The Queen  at   per Gleeson CJ   I therefore reject the tender of the parts of the report identified by Mr Whitford  see   above  other than appendix    Appendix   may be in a different category because  on one reading  it simply sets out criteria which in Mr Kinsella s opinion should be taken into account in assessing the significance of sports broadcasting rights for pay television in any country  including Australia  Whether that opinion is relevant or helpful may be a different question   Mr Sheahan SC  who appeared with Mr Halley for Seven  put as a fallback position that the portions of Mr Kinsella s reports that are objected to should be treated as submissions  There also may be some other parts of Mr Kinsella s report that are not affected by my ruling  I therefore propose to give the parties an opportunity to consider these reasons before determining whether the whole or only parts of the report should be rejected  The parties should also consider the effect of the ruling in relation to Mr Kinsella s report in reply and supplementary statement          I certify that the preceding thirty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Ruling on Evidence herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville   Associate   Dated    May   Counsel for the first  second  fourth  ninth  thirteenth  fifteenth  nineteenth and twentieth respondents  Mr P
