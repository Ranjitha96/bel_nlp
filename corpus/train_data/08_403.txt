otherwise referred toRural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  None of the Patrick Respondents is an individual  Mr Bathurst  however  argued that the problems identified by Mr Hutley are even more acute so far as Mr Burgess and other individual respondents are concerned  He also pointed out that there is no allegation that Mr Burgess was aware of the precise material facts and circumstances constituting the contraventions of s   see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR     at     per curiam   In answer to these submissions  Mr Burnside used the pleaded allegations of accessorial liability against Mr Burgess to illustrate the argument  Mr Burnside contended that a number of specific allegations are made about the extent of Mr Burgess  knowledge of relevant matters  In response to a question  Mr Burnside stated that the case against Mr Burgess does not depend on which of the P O Respondents happened to be a party to the pleaded arrangements  or to have given effect to the provisions of the pleaded arrangements   I expressed the view   Ts     that if this was the ACCC s case  the Statement of Claim should be amended to make it quite clear  The pleading should explicitly allege that by reason of specific matters known to Mr Burgess  he aided and abetted  or was knowingly concerned in  any contraventions that might be established against either or both of the P O Respondents  The pleading should also identify unambiguously the matters known to Mr Burgess and the other individual respondents that are said to show that each was aware of the material facts and circumstances constituting the contraventions of s   of the TP Act citedTradestock Pty Ltd v TNT  Management  Pty Ltd     FLR   Mr Bannon submitted that this construction of s  b ii  of the TP Act was supported by several matters         First  s

arrangement or realising that its actions constitute a contravention of the TP Act  Tradestock Pty Ltd v TNT  Management  Pty Ltd     FLR   at   per Smithers J  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd   FCA     at   per Merkel J   In the present case  I do not think it appropriate to attempt to resolve the question of law presented by Mr Bannon on behalf of AAT  The contention is arguable  but its correctness is by no means self evident  The authorities recognise  for example  that the expression   in accordance with   in the definition of   give effect to   in s   of the TP Act      are intended to cover the situation where what is done is or may be done for reasons other than to implement the understanding       Tradestock v TNT  at    In other words  the expression indicates that a corporation may give effect to an arrangement otherwise than by implementing it  The statutory language may suggest  therefore  that a corporation can give effect to a provision of an arrangement even though it is not party to the arrangement   In any event  the question of construction raised by AAT ultimately may be resolved by reference to the particular facts of the case which  of course have not yet been found  AAT is not in the same situation as a third party which has no involvement with an alleged arrangement but which subsequently does something that happens to be connected to the goals sought to be achieved by the parties to the arrangement  The ACCC alleges that the very point of the two of the pleaded arrangements was to allow the Patrick Respondent and the P O Corporations to utilise AAT as the vehicle for carrying into effect the anti competitive elements of the arrangement  AAT may well be in quite a different position to a third party that had no prior knowledge of the arrangement and was never intended to have any particular role to play in implementing the anti competitive provisions of the arrangement   For these reasons  it is not appropriate to resolve the question of law raised by AAT on the strike out application  The question is arguable and should be resolved at the trial citedYorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Patrick Respondents point out that the Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Patrick Respondents aided and abetted and was knowingly concerned in the contraventions of each of the others  They submit that the Statement of Claim fails to plead material facts  including the knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation  Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR    Mr Hutley  in his oral argument  pointed out that the complaint is of practical importance since Patrick is now a subsidiary of Toll  but the other four Patrick Respondents are within another corporate group   Mr Hutley illustrated the point by reference to the pleading alleging contraventions by Patrick  Paragraph   pleads that   in the premises   Patrick          by entering into the first arrangement  made an arrangement     containing provisions which had the purpose     or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in each of  twelve markets       and thereby contravened  s  a ii  of the TP Act   or alternatively         aided and abetted  or was knowingly concerned in                the contravention by Patrick Holdings in making the first arrangement               the contravention by Patrick Operations in making the first arrangement                the contravention by Patrick Operations No   in making the first arrangement       The pleadings follow a similar pattern in relation to Patrick s alleged contravention of s  b ii  of the TP Act and its knowing participation in the contraventions of that sub paragraph by each of the other three named Patrick Respondents  para    They also follow a similar pattern in relation to the second arrangement  paras      The same form of pleading is repeated for each of those three Patrick Respondents
