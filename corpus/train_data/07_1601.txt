NSWCA       NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  In the ordinary case  an opportunity should be given to a person affected by a decision to deal with adverse information that is credible  relevant and significant to the decision to be made  While procedural fairness does not normally require the decision maker to disclose his or her thinking processes or proposed conclusions  it may be that an adverse conclusion of a type that could not reasonably be expected by a person affected by a decision ought to be brought to that person s attention  as a matter of fairness   Minister for Local Government v South Sydney City Council   NSWCA       NSWLR   at   and   citedCommissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd   ALR   Where the requirements for procedural fairness apply  a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision maker in support of an outcome that supports that person s interests  That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify  by further information and comment  adverse material from other sources that are put before the decision maker  The decision maker is required to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision that is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made  The decision maker must advise of any adverse conclusion that has been arrived at that would not obviously be open on the known material  On the other hand  a decision maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views for comment by an affected person before making the decision in question   Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd   ALR   at pp     citedVEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The content to be given to an obligation to accord procedural fairness must accommodate the particular provisions made in the enactment that regulates how the decision maker is to go about the task of decision making  The application of principles of procedural fairness in a particular case must always be moulded to the particular circumstances of that case   Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA       CLR   at   and   citedSouth Australia v Slipper   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  When a statute confers a power on a public official  the exercise of which affects a person s rights  interests or expectations  that power must be exercised in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness unless the rules are excluded by express terms or by necessary implication  A legislative intention to exclude the rules will not be assumed or spelt out from indirect references  uncertain inferences or equivocal considerations  In particular  such an intention should not be inferred merely from the presence in the relevant statute of rights that are commensurate with some of the rules of procedural fairness  The rules may be excluded because the power in question is  of its nature  one that is to be exercised in circumstances of urgency or emergency  However  urgency will not of itself exclude the right to procedural fairness  although it may  in particular circumstances  reduce the content of the right to procedural fairness   South Australia v Slipper   FCAFC       FCR   at       The requirement for procedural fairness does not require a decision maker to disclose what the decision maker is minded to decide  so that parties affected may have a further opportunity of criticising the mental processes of the decision maker before a final decision is reached  A decision maker is generally not obliged to invite comment on the evaluation of the subject s case  On the other hand  procedural fairness requires that a party affected by a decision be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material  Thus  the subject of a decision is entitled to have his or her mind directed to the critical issues or factors on which the decision is likely to turn in order to have an opportunity of dealing with it and is entitled to respond to any adverse conclusion drawn by the decision maker on material supplied by or known to the subject that is not an obvious and natural evaluation of that material citedSalemi v Mackellar No     HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au
