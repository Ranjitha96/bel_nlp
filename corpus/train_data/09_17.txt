  At   to    pp   and   their Honours went on to explain the similarities and differences between the test expounded in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd   HCA       CLR   and the test

appreciation of the similarity in outcome  much of the assumed disparity in principle between them loses its force  There is then no objection to the use of the phrase  serious question  if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question  like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham   depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham      However  a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that  provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff s claim is not frivolous or vexatious  then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient  The critical statement by his Lordship is  t he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious  in other words  that there is a serious question to be tried    UKHL       AC   at    That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters

interlocutory relief that is sought    Emphasis added             Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed  They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought     The second of these matters  the reference to practical consequences  is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application  See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch

is sought  inter alia  in respect of private rights  it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought  Their Honours who comprised the majority made clear that the final relief sought need not be injunctive in nature  See   to    pp      per Gleeson CJ    to    pp      per Gaudron J  and   to

where  for the purpose of assessing where the balance of convenience and the balance of justice lie  it is desirable that the Court       evaluate the strength of the plaintiff s case for final relief   Per McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   at  A D  In Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   McLelland J observed that one such class of case is where the decision to grant or refuse the interlocutory injunction which is claimed will in a practical sense determine the substance of the matter in issue on a final basis  Another example is where the applicant for relief is seeking to restrain a public authority or officer from performing his statutory duty   The substance of the matter in issue between the ACCC and Allphones in the present case is whether Allphones should be restrained from conducting itself or from threatening to conduct itself in a particular fashion in relation to the allocation of stock being conduct which is said to be intended to bully certain franchisees into complying with Allphones  wishes and demands for the purposes of and during the negotiations and mediation spawned by the Franchising Code Notice of Dispute which it served in August    Those negotiations and that mediation have commenced but have not yet concluded  They are likely to conclude before the Court can determine the ACCC s claims for final relief in the proceedings   In those circumstances  I think that the case is the kind of case which falls within the principle explained by McLelland J in Kolback   NSWLR    Accordingly  I will apply that principle   As I understand that principle  I am required to have a closer look at the applicant s case than I might otherwise be required to do when considering and determining an application for interlocutory injunction in order to come to a view as to whether the applicant s case for final relief is sufficiently strong to justify the granting of the interlocutory relief sought   Senior Counsel for Allphones submitted that his client was the victim of a series of   verbals    As I understood that submission  it was contended on behalf of Allphones that the entire or a substantial part of the case which the ACCC was putting depended upon evidence of conversations given by disgruntled franchisees  which was  for the most part  denied by Allphones and which could not be properly tested in an interlocutory hearing  The submission was then refined somewhat in order to invoke the principle explained by McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR   to which I have referred in   to   above   As I have already indicated  I propose to apply what McLelland J said in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL     NSWLR     However  I do not think that a correct application of that principle requires me to discount heavily or ignore the evidence given by the deponents of the affidavits which were read by the ACCC at the hearing of the present application   The conversations to which the witnesses deposed took place in a context  To a large extent  that context was governed by the events which had occurred during the course of   to which I have referred above and by the contents of the Baker email  Whilst the conversations have been denied for the most part  they are not of such a character as to lead me to conclude that the ACCC s case for final relief is a weak one citedMaster Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It must also be remembered that  as is the case with other

  at   and    pp     Brennan CJ and McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  in a joint judgment  expressly adopted a passage from Spry  The Principles of Equitable Remedies  th edn    at pp     which may be summarised as follows     a  In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application  the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances   b  Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case  and   c  Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive   In the present case  I must assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by Allphones  any relevantly affected third parties and the public generally if an injunction is granted  with that which is likely to be suffered by Allphones  franchisees who remain on the old franchise agreement  any other relevantly affected third parties and the public generally if no injunction is granted  In determining these matters  I must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief  if granted  will adequately compensate and protect those affected by the alleged wrongful conduct for the continuing contraventions which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted   Section   of the TPA provides that  in a case such as the present  the Court shall not require the ACCC to give any undertaking as to damages   This provision puts the ACCC in a privileged position when compared with the position of ordinary litigants   In my judgment  in a case where the ACCC seeks interlocutory injunctive relief  it may be necessary to take into account the absence of an undertaking as to damages when the Court comes to determine where the balance of convenience and the balance of justice lie  The extent to which this circumstance will play a role in any particular case will be governed by all of the circumstances of the case including the nature and strength of the ACCC s case as presented at the interlocutory stage
