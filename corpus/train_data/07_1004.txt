for the purposes of Div     of the Regulations  which relates to domestic violence  The effect of Div     is to institute a mechanical form of proof of domestic violence  a serious allegation  which absolves an applicant from the need to prove domestic violence in the ordinary course  It is therefore appropriate that every element of that mode of proof be satisfied   Cakmak v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   per Gray J  not the subject of comment on dismissal of the appeal in Cakmak v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    The specification of a Commonwealth declaration also absolves the decision maker from having to ascertain whether a statutory declaration meets the requirements of the varied State laws  Perhaps  as a matter of less significance  a single form of declaration exposes a person making a statutory declaration to uniform penalties for a false declaration   The appellant submits that a declaration sworn under State legislation is no less effective or efficacious than a declaration under the Commonwealth Act  In his submission  it has the same effect of imposing on the deponent an awareness of the consequences of a false declaration and the penalties for perjury  That may be the case for awareness but not necessarily for the consequences   The parties referred the Court to reg     of the Regulations after the hearing  without further comment or submission  That regulation provides that a statutory declaration made under the relevant provisions of Div     is not admissible in evidence before a court or tribunal otherwise than in an application for judicial review or merits review of a decision to refuse to grant a visa or in a prosecution  under section   of the Commonwealth Act  for the making of a false declaration  There is no reference in reg     to admissibility in prosecutions under relevant State legislation  If State declarations were intended to be included within the meaning of reg     such a reference would be expected citedEnergy Resources of Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   In the context of the Act and Div     of the Regulations  reg     refers to a statutory declaration  under  in the ordinary sense of   in accordance with     Macquarie Dictionary     th ed      or   pursuant to   the Commonwealth Act   Energy Resources of Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at   per Lindgren J and the cases there cited  that is a s   statutory declaration  The fact that the expression used is  under  rather than  made under  does not mean that statutory declarations made in accordance with legislation other than the Commonwealth Act are or were intended to be included for the purposes of Div      The appellant contends that Parliament could have stated its intention more explicitly by referring in reg     to a statutory declaration  made under  or  in a manner prescribed by  the Commonwealth Act  That may be so but it does not mean that the intention was the opposite  to include State declarations   The appellant submits that  if the intention were to specify only Commonwealth declarations in reg     the intention was not executed  I do not accept that this is so  A statutory declaration under or in accordance with the Commonwealth Act is a Commonwealth declaration which complies with s   of the Commonwealth Act citedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v Ejueyitsi   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  For the purposes of Div     of the Regulations  it was necessary for the appellant to provide a Commonwealth declaration  that is  a statutory declaration in the form prescribed by the Commonwealth Act  s    He did not do so  The task of the Tribunal was to determine   whether the evidence presented to it satisfie  d  the description called for in the delegated legislation     Cakmak   FCR   at   per the Full Court  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Ejueyitsi   FCAFC   at      For the reasons given  the evidence did not satisfy that description  The Federal Magistrate was not in error in finding that the Tribunal had correctly concluded that the appellant had not satisfied the requirements of reg     of the Regulations in relation to his claims of domestic violence  I agree with Hill J in Morgan v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   that the fact that a declaration was not made under the Commonwealth Act but under a Victorian Act means that  were the matter to go back to the Tribunal  the Tribunal would have to find against the appellant for this reason  Such referral is  therefore  futile citedMorgan v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct

Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is no definition of  statutory declaration  in the Act to provide a contrary intention  There is  however  the     definition in the Regulations  There would be no purpose in defining  statutory declaration  in reg     merely to include a Commonwealth declaration because that has already been provided for by s   of the Acts Interpretation Act and s   of the Commonwealth Act   Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at       Section   applies subject to a contrary intention  A contrary intention is evidenced by the     definition  which purports to exclude a State declaration  There is no other apparent reason for defining  statutory declaration  in reg      Accordingly  s   does not apply to  statutory declaration  in Div     to include a State declaration
