Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at   in the following terms       The question therefore arises whether  as contended by counsel for Ms Hart  the plaintiff instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause  A party does not institute proceedings without reasonable cause merely because that party fails in the argument put to the Court  R v Moore  Ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers  Union of Australia   HCA         CLR   per Gibbs J at    The section reflects a policy of protecting a party instituting proceedings from liability for costs  but that protection may be lost  Although costs will rarely be awarded under the section and exceptional circumstances are required to justify the making of such an order  see Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd     FLR     ALR   per Northrop J  a proceeding will be instituted without reasonable cause if it has no real prospects of success  or was doomed to failure  see Kanan v Australian Postal

 i t is a matter of judgment  sometimes of fine judgment  in all the circumstances of a particular case whether a proceeding is brought without reasonable cause   The phrase   vexatiously or without reasonable cause   was described by von Doussa J in Hatchett v Bowater Tutt Industries Pty Ltd  No       FCR   at   as   similar to the one applied by a court on an application for the exercise of

any event the question remains whether  objectively determined  when the proceeding was instituted it had no real prospects of success or was doomed to failure  In other words  was the claim by REX for recovery of the Training Bond   so obviously untenable that it  could  not possibly succeed  or  manifestly groundless  or  bad beyond argument   Hatchett at   referred toJosephson v Walker   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Secondly  in relation to a further submission by REX that cl   of the Certified Agreement did not prohibit the performance of the Training Bond and did not intend to codify the issue of training for pilots covered by the Certified Agreement  her Honour after referring to cll     and   of the Certified Agreement  dealt with cl   and cl   as follows       Clause   exhaustively deals with the costs of training in a variety of circumstances in clear and unambiguous terms  It places the obligation for payment of the costs associated with training on the employer  except in very narrow and specific circumstances  Clause     dealing with termination of employment does not similarly create a right to seek repayment of a training bond      It is not logically possible for the employer to be required to bear all the costs associated with training  as is the case under the  Certified Agreement  and for that obligation to be passed to the employee in accordance with the terms of the Training Bond  I am not satisfied that the terms of the  Training Bond  can co exist with the  Certified Agreement  they are clearly inconsistent      The terms of the  Certified Agreement  clearly prevail over inconsistent contractual terms   I was referred to Josephson v Walker   HCA         CLR   on this point    Secondly  the decisions of Josephson

au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Finally  her Honour referred to and followed the decision of the Full Court of this Court in McLennan v Surveillance Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   which considered an Australian Workplace Agreement  AWA  and held a training bond that was inconsistent with an AWA was unenforceable  I will consider this decision further later in these reasons   This appeal raised three questions relevant to the question of the enforceability of the Training Bond and  in particular  the ability of REX to recover   from Mr Clarke        the proper construction of the Training Bond and  in particular  whether it was inconsistent with the Certified Agreement and therefore unenforceable    whether the decision of the Full Court in McLennan was distinguishable      whether her Honour fell into error in   failing to recognise that  once  REX had  discharged its onus of proof  on the balance of probabilities  by proving that  Mr Clarke had breached  the Training Bond  the onus of proof shifted to  Mr Clarke  to prove his defence  on the balance of probabilities  that the Training Bond was inconsistent with any and which part of the Certified Agreement and  to that extent  was invalid and unenforceable          As will become apparent  these questions and the answers to them are interrelated   It is necessary to turn to consider the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act dealing with certified agreements  Certified agreements are a creature of statute  The relevant provisions are primarily to be found in Pt VIB of the Workplace Relations Act  ss  L to  NI   However  other parts of the Workplace Relations Act are relevant including Pt VIE  the no disadvantage test  Pt VIII  compliance  and Pt XV  matters referred by Victoria    The object of Pt VIB of the Workplace Relations Act is to   facilitate the making  and certifying by the Commission  of certain agreements  particularly at the level of a single business or part of a single business    s  L  That object is consistent with the overall object of the Workplace Relations Act  see s   and in particular  para  e   The term   single business   is defined in s  LB  so far as is relevant  as   a business  project or undertaking that is carried on by an employer    Section  LB  provides that if two or more employers carry on a business  project or undertaking   as a joint venture or common enterprise   the employers are taken to be one employer  In the present case  s  LB  applies   Division   of Pt VIB sets out the requirements that must be satisfied for applications to be made to the Commission to certify an agreement  Critically    there must be an agreement  in writing  about matters pertaining to the relationship between  an employer and all persons who  at the time the agreement is in operation  are employed in the single business of the employer  s  LI  As Black CJ and Moore J noted in McLennan at   and   when considering the analogous provision in relation to AWAs  s  VF of the Workplace Relations Act  it is clear that not only does the certified agreement need not deal in a comprehensive way with terms and conditions of employment  it is not expected to do so   There are two types of certified agreements agreements between employers and an organisation of employees  s  LJ  and agreements between employers and employees  s  LK   We are concerned with the former   Under Div   of Pt VIB  the Commission must certify an agreement unless it is satisfied that the requirements of s  LT are not met  s  LT   The agreement must pass the no disadvantage test set out in Pt VIE  s  LT   An agreement passes the no disadvantage test if   it does not disadvantage employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment   s  XA   Subject to a number of provisions which are presently not relevant  s  XA  provides that an agreement disadvantages employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment only if its approval or certification would result  on balance  in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment of those employees under  in this case  relevant awards  The relevant award is determined in accordance with s  XF  It was not in dispute that the relevant award in this case was the same award considered by the Full Court in McLennan at     The effect of certified agreements is dealt with by Divs   and   of Pt VIB  A certified agreement comes into operation when it is certified and  subject to other sections which are presently not relevant  remains in operation at all times afterwards  s  LX   It binds the employer and all persons whose employment is  at any time when the agreement is in operation  subject to the agreement  s  M   The Letter of Offer expressly provided that Mr Clarke s position and conditions of employment were   in accordance with the  Certified Agreement    It also bound the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots  the AFAP  who made the agreement with REX  s  M    Variations to certified agreements were provided for in Div   of Pt VIB  A certified agreement cannot be varied except by one of the means specified in s  MD   One method of varying a certified agreement is in writing by agreement between the employer and the AFAP  s  MD   However  any variation has no effect unless the Commission approves it  s  MD  and the Commission must not approve the variation unless it is satisfied that the variation passes the no disadvantage test  s  MD b   The manner in which both certified agreements and variations to them are negotiated is prescribed by Div   and Div   of Pt VIB   Finally  the submission is contrary to the fact that the Workplace Relations Act recognises  and the authorities establish  that a certified agreement not only need not deal in a comprehensive way with terms and conditions of employment  it is not expected to do so  see s  LI of the Workplace Relations Act and McLennan at   and     Although it is not possible to contract out of a statutory instrument   Josephson at   Kidd v Savage River Mines     FCR   at     Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Textile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd     IR   at   to   and McLennan at   that does not prevent an employment contract conferring additional benefits upon an employee over and above those conferred by a statutory instrument  Givoni at   to   and the authorities referred to  These latter cases were concerned with awards  however the same principles apply to certified agreements  see Ardmona Foods Ltd at   and   Amcor Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  CFMEU    FCAFC   at   and Amcor Ltd v CFMEU   HCA         ALR   at   per Callinan J   The question was not whether the Certified Agreement was comprehensive it clearly was not  The question was whether the term of the Training Bond  by which Mr Clarke agreed to pay   to REX if he left REX s employment within a specified time  was a matter pertaining to the relationship between REX and the pilots that the Certified Agreement dealt with and if so  whether that term effectively altered or varied the rights and obligations concerning that matter or those matters in the Certified Agreement to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke  If the answer is yes  then consistent with the decision of the Full Court in McLennan it was not open to REX to seek to recover   from Mr Clarke because       b y clear implication  the  Workplace Relations  Act prohibits the alteration of such rights or obligations which might disadvantage the employee by means other than those provided in the Act and renders ineffectual any agreement which purports to do so    McLennan at     Mr Clarke submitted that the term of the Training Bond by which Mr Clarke agreed to pay   to REX if he left REX s employment within a specified time was referable to two matters pertaining to the relationship between REX and the pilots covered by the Certified Agreement training and termination  I agree  So much was made abundantly clear by the express terms of the Letter of Offer incorporating the Training Bond  However  that of itself is not sufficient  The question is whether that term of the Training Bond effectively altered or varied the rights and obligations concerning that matter or those matters in the Certified Agreement to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke  That requires a comparison between the relevant term or terms of the Certified Agreement and the specified term of the Training Bond   In relation to the  matter  of training  under cl   of the Certified Agreement  REX was not only responsible for arranging facilities to enable Mr Clarke to reach and maintain proficiency in such ground courses and such aeronautical skills as were required by REX  cl     but it was obliged to   pay all costs associated with obtaining and for renewing such rating or endorsement    cl      The Training Bond altered or varied that matter to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke at a price of    That view is reinforced when one recalls that the Commission was required to assess the Certified Agreement against the terms of the relevant award   see par   above  and  under cl     of that award    all facilities and other costs associated with attaining and maintaining those qualifications  were  the responsibility of the employer   McLennan at     Even if the Letter of Offer and the Training Bond did not alter or vary the  matter  of training to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke  it did alter or vary the  matter  of termination to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke  Under the Certified Agreement  the employment was terminable by Mr Clarke giving four weeks  written notice  Under the Letter of Offer incorporating the Training Bond  the employment was terminable by Mr Clarke giving four weeks  written notice and incurring a debt of   payable to REX on the same day that the employment terminated   The facts in this case may be characterised in a variety of ways   the Training Bond effectively altered or varied the rights and obligations concerning a matter dealt with by the Certified Agreement to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke by means other than those imposed by the Workplace Relations Act  the Training Bond imposed an additional burden on Mr Clarke by means other than those imposed by the Workplace Relations Act  the Training Bond was an attempt to contract out of the Certified Agreement  Adopting any one of those characterisations  the Training Bond was unenforceable   In McLennan  the Full Court considered a similar issue but in the context of another statutory instrument an AWA  The Court considered the training bond inconsistent with an AWA and therefore unenforceable  During the course of argument  Counsel for REX submitted  but subsequently abandoned the submission  that the decision of the Full Court was plainly wrong  It was not  On   August   the High Court refused Special Leave to appeal on the basis that  without endorsing all of the reasoning of the Full Court  the conclusion reached by the Full Court was correct  Surveillance Australia Pty Ltd v McLennan   HCATrans     August     REX also submitted that the decision in McLennan was distinguishable because it dealt with a different statutory instrument and because there were some factual differences  In my view  that submission should also be rejected  The differences in statutory instrument relied upon by REX  that the AWA is an employment agreement between an employer and an individual employee as opposed to a collective instrument such as the Certified Agreement  that the variation to the AWA was made between the same parties whereas the variation by the Letter of Offer was not and that under AWAs the employee loses the safety net completely  did not provide any basis for distinguishing McLennan   In relation to the last matter referred to by REX  although an AWA  but not a certified agreement  applies to the exclusion of any award that would otherwise apply  s  VQ  a certified agreement does prevail over them to the extent of any inconsistency  s  LY  and does prevail over State awards and State industrial agreements to the extent of any inconsistency  s  LZ    Moreover  the statutory architecture and express provisions of Pt VIB  dealing with certified agreements  and Pt VID  dealing with AWAs  are not significantly different and do not lead to a different result  Adopting what the Full Court said in McLennan at         Having regard to  the  protective legislative framework  it is unlikely that the legislature intended that the parties to  a certified agreement  could reach agreement under the umbrella of that protection about matters pertaining to the employment relationship  obtain  certification from the Commission  thereby removing protection which might be afforded by an award  made under the Act or a State award  or afforded by State law  and thereafter bargain without similar protection to reach a collateral agreement  enforceable under the common law  imposing additional burdens on an employee in relation to matters dealt with by the  certified agreement   Indeed it is for this reason  and probably one other  that the  Workplace Relations  Act contains procedures with that protection for parties to  a certified agreement  to reach  and obtain approval for  a variation agreement  The other reason would be to allow the parties to  a certified agreement  to add to the  certified agreement  provisions concerning a matter not then dealt with by the  certified agreement    In adopting and applying the language of the Full Court in McLennan at   where a certified agreement deals with a particular matter pertaining to the relationship between an employer and an employee  then the parties to and those bound by the certified agreement can only alter their rights and obligations in relation to that matter in a way which might disadvantage the employee  by entering into and obtaining approval for the variation agreement in the manner presented by the Workplace Relations Act  see also McLennan at     Similarly  none of the factual differences between the decision in McLennan and the facts of this case assist REX  The facts of the present case are  if anything  more compelling than the facts in McLennan in one critical respect  Unlike the AWA in McLennan   cl     of the Certified Agreement obliged REX to  pay all costs associated with obtaining and for renewing such rating or endorsement  This will include all licensing fees and Civil Aviation Safety Authority charges    No similar provision existed in McLennan   see     For these reasons  the Appeal should be dismissed   REX also submitted that her Honour erred when  on   March   she ordered costs against REX on the basis that the complaint was a proceeding instituted in the Magistrates  Court   without reasonable cause   under s   of the Workplace Relations Act   Section   of the Workplace Relations Act provides       A party to a proceeding   including an appeal   in a matter arising under this Act  other than an application under section  CP  shall not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause      Emphasis Added  The issue is finely balanced  As I have sought to explain  the actions of REX seeking to recover the Training Bond were  in my view  contrary to the statutory object of certified agreements in Pt VIB of the Workplace Relations Act and the decision of the Full Court dealing with analogous provisions in McLennan   The attempts to distinguish McLennan failed  However  in the circumstances of this case  I am not persuaded that the proceeding was commenced vexatiously or without reasonable cause  I would set aside the costs order of the Industrial Division of the Magistrates  Court of Victoria of   March     The respondent sought costs of the appeal and on an indemnity basis  That application is refused  This is an appeal to which s   of the Workplace Relations Act applies  see para   above  I am not persuaded that the appeal was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause  There will be no order as to costs in relation to the appeal

include whether or not the Certified Agreement rendered the Training Bond unenforceable so as to prevent REX recovering the   see Transport Workers  Union of Australia v Graham Meyrick Lee   FCA   citing Dixon CJ in R v Spicer  Ex parte Truth and Sportsman Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    The view that the phrase   matter arising under this Act   extends to include the issues in this appeal is reinforced by other provisions of the Workplace Relations Act including  but not limited to  s  A in Division   of Part XIV that the Court may give an interpretation of a certified agreement on application by the Minister  an organisation or person bound by the certified agreement or a person whose employment is subject to the certified agreement distinguishedUnited Firefighters  Union of Australia v Country Fire Authority   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In this context  REX s reliance upon two further decisions was misplaced  In United Firefighters  Union of Australia v Country Fire Authority   FCA   esp at   the Court considered the effect of an act done in breach of particular clauses of the relevant award and the relevant certified agreement  As I have said  this appeal was not concerned with an act done in breach of the Certified Agreement  The issue considered by Gray J did not arise in these proceedings distinguishedYango Pastoral Company Pty Limited v First Chicago Australia Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The other decision on which REX relied was Yango Pastoral Company Pty Limited v First Chicago Australia Limited   HCA         CLR    That case concerned s   of the Banking Act    Cth  which prohibited a body corporate from carrying on any banking business in Australia unless it was in possession of an authority to do so  The provision went on to impose a penalty for each day of contravention  The first respondent in that case  First Chicago Australia Limited  First Chicago  had granted a mortgage which incorporated a guarantee given by the appellants  There was default and First Chicago sued on the guarantee  The appellants pleaded illegality on the basis that the mortgage and the guarantee was illegal and void because of s   of the Banking Act    Cth  or  that by reason of s     a court would not assist the respondent to give effect to the transaction  The Court rejected the contention  Gibbs ACJ outlined four ways in which the enforceability of a contract may be affected by a statutory provision which renders particular conduct unlawful  at    In my view  the High Court decision does not assist the disposition of this appeal because  as was ultimately conceded by Counsel for REX  no provision of the Workplace Relations Act could be identified which rendered conduct of REX unlawful or  in particular  which precluded REX and Mr Clarke entering the Letter of Offer incorporating the Training Bond
