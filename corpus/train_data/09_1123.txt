Hoop   Javelin Holdings Limited v BT Projects Pty Limited  In Liq    FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBourke v State Bank of New South Wales     FCR  In Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales     FCR    at   Wilcox J held that the expression   the interests of justice   in s   of the Jurisdiction of Courts  Cross vesting  Act    Cth  ought to be read widely  His Honour referred to the need to consider all aspects of a matter including both substantive and adjectival matters and concluded by saying      It is not in  the interests of justice  to adopt a course  in relation to those matters  which places unnecessary burdens and delays upon the parties to the litigation       These ideas  although not directly applicable  are nevertheless apt to be applied in the present case  In summary  it seems to me  there is in reality no connection at all with New South Wales  There is nothing else which can fairly be weighed in the balance in favour of keeping the proceedings in this Registry of this Court  There are  on the other side of things  substantial reasons based upon the cost and inconvenience to individual litigants which would justify a transfer to the Queensland District Registry of this Court and I propose to make an order accordingly  It seems to me that the applicant was entitled to resist the application in the form in which it was pressed because the primary order sought was an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland  The third respondent has not persuaded me that such an order should be made  On the other hand  the applicant did resist the making of any orders  In those circumstances each of the relevant parties has experienced some success and some failure  It seems to me that the appropriate order as to the costs of the motion for transfer brought by the third respondent is that those costs be costs in the proceedings appliedNational Mutual Holdings Pty Limited v Sentry Corporation     FCR  In National Mutual Holdings Pty Limited v Sentry Corporation     FCR     a Full Court of this Court held that the power conferred on the Court or a judge by s   was unfettered and should be exercised flexibly having regard to the circumstances of the particular case  The Court went on to say   FCR at       Ultimately the test is  where can the case be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties  the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them  and the most efficient administration of the Court  It cannot and should not  in our opinion  be defined more closely or precisely  Other sources of the power to transfer a proceeding to another Registry of this Court are O   r  f  and O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   The relevant guiding principles are the same under the Rules as under s   of the Act
