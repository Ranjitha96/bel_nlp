Bond v Barry   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Seven Network Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for the applicants referred to a recent decision of the Court concerning s  A  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Seven Network Limited   FCA    It was delivered on   October    the day that the applicants filed and served their submissions in support of this application   It was submitted that  in this decision  Bennett J at   and   had placed a different construction upon s  A to that of French J at   and that on the construction of the section adopted in the Seven Network decision  it is arguable that the applicants  case has reasonable prospect of success   However  the judgment in Seven Network does not immediately assist the present applicant  In that case  the necessary elements of s  A a i  and  iii  which in turn lead to a consideration of s  A a vi  were not in dispute     Bennett J was concerned with the inter relationship between the  matter  in s  a  and the  contract  arrangement or understanding  in s  A a vi    That was not the position in this case  French J concluded that the transmission by a freelance journalist of a news article to a newspaper or other media outlet with whom he or she has a contract to supply such services was not a publication of matter   in connection   with the supply of such services  Thus the necessary element under s  A a i  was held not to have been made out   Nonetheless I propose to grant leave  Section  A is an important statutory provision  Its interpretation is not without difficulty  Bennett J said  in Seven Network at   that the  drafting of the section is not a model of clarity   I respectfully agree  It has ramifications beyond the protection  if any  available to freelance journalists  Its reach ought to be considered by a Full Court  Although I have accorded the matter little weight  I note that an appeal has been lodged in the Seven Network case  To that extent therefore s  A will be the subject of reconsideration by a Full Court which may then examine the section as a whole   The construction placed on the provision by French J has considerable force  However in all of the circumstances I am persuaded that there is sufficient doubt in respect to the decision to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court  Certainly  substantial injustice would follow if leave were refused  assuming the decision to be wrong  Decor Corporation and Another Pty
