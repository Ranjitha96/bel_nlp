Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited     CLR  Section  AA incorporates into the Act the unwritten law in relation to unconscionable conduct thereby extending the remedies available under the Act for unconscionable conduct to the extent that this concept is presently part of the common law or equitable principles recognised by the courts  Unconscionable conduct is conduct which attracts a sufficient level of judicial opprobrium to support the grant of relief based on principles set out in specific equitable doctrines established by Courts of Equity  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited     CLR    Unconscionability is a concept which requires a high level of moral obloquy  It is not necessary for the party who has benefited from a transaction challenged as unconscionable to itself have created the special advantage which forms the basis of the unconscionability claim  It is sufficient if that party knows  or ought to have known  of the other party s situation of special disadvantage and takes unfair advantage of the opportunity presented  Louth v Diprose   HCA         CLR    A person will be under a special disadvantage if there are circumstances seriously affecting the ability of the person to make a judgement in his or her own best interests  Berbatis Holdings per Gleeson CJ at    A person is not under a special disadvantage simply because of inequality of bargaining power  Berbatis Holdings  referred toAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments     FCR  In the present circumstances  the unconscionable conduct on the part of Zanok was the promise that  in return for a fee  the applicant would receive training and thereafter guaranteed skilled employment in circumstances where Zanok knew or ought to have known that many of the applicants were temporary residents and anxious to find skilled employment to assist with their applications for permanent resident status  This conduct constituted more than simply taking advantage of a superior bargaining position but involved an unconscientious exploitation of another s inability or diminished ability to conserve his or her own interests  Dangling the  employment carrot  in return for a fee in circumstances in which the applicant faces having to leave Australia  constitutes a high level of moral obloquy especially where the promised employment does not exist  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments     FCR    In the circumstances  the ACCC submitted the Court
