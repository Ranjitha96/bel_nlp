au au cases cth federal ct   html  The Takeovers Panel was established under s   of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  and continued in existence under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  as described in Schedule   to the Financial Services Reform Act    Cth   the Panel   The proceeding should be understood in the context of the Court s orders of   September   made in Glencore International AG   Anor v Takeovers Panel   Ors   FCA     The questions in the proceeding depend upon the effect of certain transactions described as   cash settled equity swaps    A cash settled equity swap is an arrangement between an investor and a bank whereby the bank agrees to pay the investor an amount equal to the difference between the value of a given number of equity securities at the time of the closing out of the swap and the value of those equity securities at the time when the arrangement was entered into  Under such an arrangement the investor does not acquire any interest in any equity securities and the investor has no right to call for delivery of equity securities or to require the bank to undertake any action involving the acquisition  holding or disposal of equity securities  Closing out of  and settlement under  such a swap will  depending on the terms of the arrangement  be either at the option of one party or be automatic  Of course  it would always be open to the parties to close out a swap by mutual agreement at any time  In order to hedge its risk under such an arrangement  a bank might buy the relevant equity securities   The fourth respondent  Austral Coal Limited  the Company  is a miner of coking coal in southern New South Wales  It sells coking coal both domestically and internationally  The second respondent  Centennial Coal Company Limited  Centennial  is also a miner and marketer of coal  At relevant times  shares in the Company and Centennial were listed for quotation on Australian Stock Exchange Limited  ASX    Chapter   of the Act is concerned with   Takeovers    Part     is concerned with Prohibited acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares and Part     deals with Exceptions to the prohibition   Parts     to     regulate the making and acceptance of takeover offers  Part     deals with the review of  and intervention in  the conduct of takeovers by the Commission and by the Panel   The pivotal provision of the Act in relation to the regulation of takeovers is s    Relevantly  s   prohibits a person from acquiring a relevant interest in issued voting shares in a company if  because of the transaction  that person s  or someone else s  voting power in the company increases      from   per cent or below to more than   per cent  or    from a starting point that is above   per cent and below   per cent   Section   provides that a person has a relevant interest in shares if that person      is the holder of the shares    has power to exercise  or control the exercise of  a right to vote attached to the shares  or    has power to dispose of  or control the exercise of a power to dispose of  the shares   Section   provides for extended circumstances in which  power  and  control  may arise for the purposes of determining whether a person has a relevant interest in securities referred toR v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte Hardiman     CLR   The Commission was the effective contradictor of Glencore and Fornax  However  the Panel has made written submission as to matters that are said to go to the powers and procedures of the Panel  In its written submissions  the Panel indicated that it endeavoured to confine its submissions to questions of principle and to refrain from presenting a substantive case as to the application of those principles  consistent with the observations of the High Court in R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex Parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR   at   referred toBrierly Investments Ltd v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   Under s  A  of the Act  which is in Part     the Panel may declare circumstances in relation to the affairs of a company to be unacceptable circumstances  Section  A  of the Act expressly provides that the Panel may make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances even in the absence of a contravention of the Act  It follows that the Panel s functions under s  A include a supervisory role in respect of conduct that is lawful but perceived to be inconsistent with the objects of Chapter   as stated in s    see Brierly Investments Ltd v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   at pp       The effect of s  A  of the Act is that the Panel may declare circumstances in relation to the affairs of a company to be unacceptable circumstances if it appears to the Panel that the circumstances are unacceptable  having regard to the effect of the circumstances on       the control  or potential control   of that company or another company  or    the acquisition  or proposed acquisition   by a person of a substantial interest in that company or another company   The Panel may also make a declaration if it appears to the Panel that circumstances constitute or give rise to a contravention of Parts    A   B or  C  However  the Panel may only make a declaration if it considers that doing so is not against the public interest and after taking into account any policy considerations that the Panel considers relevant   Under s  D  of the Act  the Panel may make an order under s  D  if it has declared circumstances to be unacceptable under s  A  However  there are restrictions upon the making of such an order  The Panel must not make an order if it is satisfied that the order would unfairly prejudice any person  Further  under s  D  before making an order  the Panel must give  both to the parties to a proceeding before the Panel and to the Commission  as well as to each other person to whom a proposed order relates   an opportunity to make submissions to the Panel about the matter   The Panel  of course  is expressly empowered by s  A  to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act  Part     of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Chapter    It is clear enough that the regime involving the Panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Chapter     Brierley Investments Ltd v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   at    The Panel made its declaration because  notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act  the purposes of Chapter   as expressed in s   were not achieved  That is precisely the circumstances for which s  A provides  It is not unreasonable for the Panel  if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised  to reach that conclusion  The fact that participants in the market do not necessarily make disclosure of cash settled swaps does not necessarily mean that the failure to do so is not unacceptable   I consider that the Panel erred in concluding that the relationship between Glencore on the one hand and the Banks on the other  by reason of the swaps  was such that the Shares in the company held by the Banks should be taken into account in determining whether Glencore had acquired or was acquiring a substantial interest in the Company  I also consider that the Panel erred in concluding that circumstances consisting of the non disclosure  during the Non disclosure Period  of the swaps and the relevant interest held by Glencore had an effect on the control or potential control of the Company  or on the acquisition by Centennial of a substantial interest in the Company  that was unacceptable  Having regard to those conclusions  it appears to follow that neither the Declaration nor the Orders can stand   However  the parties have requested that I make no orders until they have had the opportunity of considering the conclusions that I have reached  Accordingly  I propose to stand the matter over for further submissions as to the appropriate orders after the parties have had a reasonable opportunity of considering my conclusions and my reasons for those conclusions      I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
