Devers v Kindilan Society   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlMs Devers s submissions relied on Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   to suggest that her evidence should be accepted uncritically on several issues  Many of the issues which her counsel referred to were ones on which Focus called evidence from its witnesses  As counsel for Focus observed  the principle in Jones v Dunkel will not assist in the creation of evidence  merely the drawing of inferences where this is supported by Ms Devers s evidence  The evidence before the Court on the relevant issues raised by Ms Devers s application does not lead to the application of Jones v Dunkel   as there is nothing to suggest that Focus failed to called evidence on any matters of material significance from witnesses it would have been expected to call  The Act renders unlawful conduct which constitutes discrimination on the ground of disability in the context of employment  At all material times  s   of the Act relevantly provided        It is unlawful for an employer or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of an employer to discriminate against a person on the ground of the other person s disability or a disability of any of that other person s associates             a  in the arrangements made for the purpose of determining who should be offered employment  or   b  in determining who should be offered employment  or   c  in the terms or conditions on which employment is offered              It is unlawful for an employer or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee s disability or a disability of any of that employee s associates             a  in the terms or conditions of employment that the employer affords the employee  or   b  by denying the employee access  or limiting the employee s access  to opportunities for promotion  transfer or training  or to any other benefits associated with employment  or   c  by dismissing the employee  or   d  by subjecting the employee to any other detriment  For the discrimination alleged to have been unlawful  it must have occurred  on the ground  of Ms Devers s disability  The discrimination may have been either direct or indirect discrimination as defined in the Act referred toWaters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhether a  requirement or condition  has been imposed on a person is a question of fact  see Waters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR   at   per Dawson and Toohey JJ    per McHugh J and see also Catholic Education Office v Clarke     FCR   at   per Sackville and Stone JJ  The phrase  requirement or condition  in s   of the Act is to be construed broadly to include any form of qualification or prerequisite  although the actual requirement or condition itself should be formulated with some precision  see Clarke at   and Australian Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited v Banovic   HCA         CLR   at   per Dawson J  An alleged discriminator may be found to have insisted on compliance with a requirement or condition within the meaning of s   of the Act even though the requirement or condition is not explicitly imposed  It is sufficient that the requirement or condition is implicit in the conduct that is said to constitute indirect discrimination  see Waters at   per Mason CJ and Gaudron J    per Dawson and Toohey JJ and   per McHugh J  For example  the Court in Waters considered that it was open to the trial judge to find that the removal of conductors from trams amounted to a requirement or condition that disabled people could fully avail themselves of the services only if they could use trams without the assistance of conductors  at   per Mason CJ and Gaudron J referred toCatholic Education Office v Clarke   FCAFC

Australian Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited v Banovic   HCA         CLR   at   per Dawson J  Several cases have characterised the requirement to participate and receive classroom instruction without Auslan interpreters as a  requirement or condition  within the meaning of s   of the Act  see eg  Clarke and Hurst v Queensland   FCAFC         FCR    In Clarke both the trial judge and Full Court found that not providing Auslan interpreters to a student with a hearing disability imposed a condition on him with which he could not comply  at   per Tamberlin J    per Sackville and Stone JJ  Similarly  the Court in Hurst held that a student would be  denied the opportunity to achieve her full potential  if she were required to undertake her education without the assistance of Auslan interpreters  at   per Ryan  Finn and Weinberg JJ  Focus submits that cases such as Clarke and Hurst must be treated with caution as they are education  rather than employment  cases  Ms Devers contends that these principles apply to both educational situations and her ability to participate in staff meetings and professional development  In particular  she argues that it was not sufficient for her to simply  cope  by attending some of the required training sessions and staff meetings and access the information through written English  Ms Devers alleges that she was denied meaningful access to her employment as she could not comply with the requirements imposed  Moreover  counsel for Ms Devers argues that Focus s submission that she accessed her employment as she attended work and received her wages over a number of years ignores the conditions of her employment which caused her detriment referred toAustralian Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited v Banovic   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhether a  requirement or condition  has been imposed on a person is a question of fact  see Waters v Public Transport Corporation   HCA         CLR   at   per

Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited v Banovic   HCA         CLR   at   per Dawson J  The next step in determining whether indirect discrimination has occurred within the meaning of s   of the Act is to identify  an appropriate base group  with which to compare the individual alleging indirect discrimination in order to assess whether a substantially higher proportion of the individuals in the base group are able to comply with the requirement or condition  see Banovic at     per Deane and Gaudron JJ    per Dawson J  Ability to complyreferred toHurst v Queensland   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlSeveral cases have characterised the requirement to participate and receive classroom instruction without Auslan interpreters as a  requirement or condition

the requirements imposed  Moreover  counsel for Ms Devers argues that Focus s submission that she accessed her employment as she attended work and received her wages over a number of years ignores the conditions of her employment which caused her detriment  The third step in the analysis is to determine whether Ms Devers was able to comply with the requirement or condition  The Full Court in Hurst at   stated if      a disabled person will suffer serious disadvantage in complying with a requirement or condition of the relevant kind  irrespective of whether that person can  cope  with the requirement or condition    the  not able to comply  element of s  c  of the Act will be satisfied   Reasonableness To succeed in her claim  Ms Devers also must show that the imposition of the requirement or condition was not reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case  In the absence of evidence to establish that the requirement or condition was unreasonable  the conduct engaged in by Focus will not be discriminatory  As with the other aspects of her claim  the onus is on Ms Devers to prove that the requirement or condition imposed was not reasonable in all the circumstances  ANALYSIS OF INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS   Request for a TTY A major issue in contest in the proceeding is whether Ms Devers required Focus to provide her with a TTY before it ultimately provided her with one in July    Ms Devers was able to perform most aspects of her employment without the installation of flashing lights  She was unable to answer the door without the aid of flashing lights  Ms Devers was able to  cope  with the condition as another staff member was required to be in the CRU at all times  Nevertheless  the relevant test is whether Ms Devers was able to comply with the requirement  see Hurst at    The Court in Hurst noted that an inability to comply may shown if  a disabled person will suffer serious disadvantage in complying with the requirement or condition  at    Ms Devers has not shown that she suffered any serious disadvantage from her inability to answer the door  There is evidence to suggest that in   her inability to hear whether someone was at the door was a source of grievances among other staff members  However  there is no evidence to indicate that this was a live issue in   when the request for flashing lights was made  By this time  Focus had also purchased a pager which provided staff members with a means of attracting Ms Devers s attention  Her work consisted of caring for the clients at the Bungower Road CRU and she has not shown that her inability to answer the door led to any serious disadvantage  It is a requirement with which Ms Devers was able to comply in performing her employment  Similarly  Ms Devers has not demonstrated that the requirement was unreasonable in all the circumstances  Her counsel placed considerable emphasis on Focus s failure to plead reliance on s   of the Act  However  the onus is on Ms Devers to demonstrate that the requirement or condition was one which was not reasonable in all the circumstances  At the time  Ms Devers was working approximately   hours per fortnight  It is also reasonable to infer that answering the door was incidental to the performance of her duties as a Disability Support Worker  In addition  Focus s policy was to not have staff members alone at the Bungower Road CRU at any time  Given Ms Devers s hours  the policy that staff members not work alone at any time and the incidental nature of the task  Focus s imposition of the requirement or condition that Ms Devers carry out her employment without the aid of flashing lights was reasonable  Ms Devers s claim of indirect discrimination as a result of the failure to provide flashing lights prior to their installation in   fails  Training sessionsdistinguishedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAustralia is a

v State of New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Purvis v State of New South Wales   HCA         CLR     Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ noted at   that the concept of less favourable treatment involves an objective assessment and comparison      of the treatment which the discriminator gives  or proposes to give  to the aggrieved person and the treatment that the discriminator would give  or would propose to give  to a person without the aggrieved person s disability  in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different      The last phrase in s   qualified by s   of the Act  which provides that a disabled person s need for different accommodation or services does not constitute a material difference when determining whether the alleged discriminator has treated the disabled person less favourably than a person without the disability  Section   of the Act requires that the circumstances surrounding the treatment of the disabled person are identified  What must then be examined is what would have been done in those circumstances if the relevant person were not disabled  see Purvis at   per Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ  These circumstances are the objective features that surround the actual or intended treatment of the disabled person by the alleged discriminator  see Purvis at    If the comparison reveals that the disabled individual was treated less favourably  the further question which must be asked is whether that difference was  because of  their disability  see Purvis at   per Callinan J  The relevant questions for determination are  firstly  how would Focus have treated a person in these circumstances without Ms Devers s profound deafness  Secondly  if the treatment of Ms Devers was less favourable than the treatment that would be given to a person without her disability  was that difference because of her disability  Section   of the Act only applies if it is shown that Ms Devers was treated less favourably than a person without her disability would have been treated in circumstances that were the same as or were not materially different from the circumstances of Ms Devers s treatment  In the present case  that the relevant  comparator  is an employee of Focus  in a similar role  without Ms Devers s disability who also has her attributes  For example  the relevant comparator in Purvis was a child without the applicant s disability who nevertheless displayed the same violent behaviour as the applicant  Purvis at      I will separately consider each allegation of direct discrimination and the relevant circumstances in relation to each allegation  Doctors  appointments Ms Devers claims that Focus treated her less favourably than hearing staff in that it would not allow Ms Devers to attend doctors  appointments with deaf clients but would allow hearing staff to attend appointments  She said that she was only permitted to attend medical appointments when she went with David and Leigh Travaglia s mother  Ms Blake  and did so on two or three occasions  Mr Edo Travaglia gave evidence that both Ms Sipthorpe and Ms Colleen McFarlane told him that  Focus management  had said that Ms Devers was not permitted to take clients to medical appointments as she was deaf and unable to communicate with doctors  However this evidence is hearsay and unsupported
