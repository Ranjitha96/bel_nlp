Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I congratulate the parties on the agreement they have reached and acknowledge the efforts of the National Native Title Tribunal in assisting the parties  As this Court stated in Hughes  on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People  v State of Western Australia   FCA   at        s ettlement of native title claims by agreement is to be welcomed and encouraged  It means that the parties can decide for themselves how best to institute an arrangement that satisfies their respective rights and interests in a way that  as appropriate  recognises the rights and interests of the other parties    The Ngarla applicants have nominated the Wanparta Aboriginal Corporation  the Corporation  as the prescribed body corporate to hold the native title of the claimant group on trust following the determination of these proceedings pursuant to s   of the Native Title Act    Cth   the Act   The nomination is in writing and the Corporation has given its consent to the nomination  I am satisfied that the requirements of the Act and of the Native Title  Prescribed Bodies Corporate  Regulations    Cth  have been met   The Court may make orders giving effect to an agreement reached between the parties where the agreement relates to the proceeding or part of the proceedings without holding a hearing   if it appears to  the Court  to be appropriate to do so    ss   and   of the Act   The Court may also  if agreement is reached on a proposed determination of native title in relation to an area included in the area covered by an application  make an order in  or consistent with  the proposed determination without holding a hearing if the Court considers it would be appropriate to do so  s  A b    As to the fourth precondition  three matters should be noted  The first is that the agreement relates to part of the land and waters the subject of the Ngarla applications  The making of a determination of native title in respect of those parts is a matter that falls within subs   of the Act  It follows that the Court may make orders determining that native title exists in relation to Determination Area A while leaving the issues outstanding in relation to Determination Area B for resolution at a later date   Munn  For and on behalf of the Gunggari People  v Queensland   FCA         FCR   at      This approach has been

Act is designed to encourage parties to take responsibility for the resolution of native title proceedings  without the need for litigation  The Court s power must be exercised flexibly and with this purpose in mind  Orders may be made where the Court is not provided with all of the evidence or the primary facts substantiating native title where the Court is satisfied that the parties have freely

on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia   FCA     Hughes     If  of course  an agreement were reached where there was nothing to support the claimed connection of the applicants to their country  or the determination appeared to be unfair or unjust  the Court might conclude that a determination would be inappropriate and decline to make the orders sought   James at    That is not the case here   The continuous connection of the Ngarla people with Determination Area A is acknowledged by all of the parties  There is also evidence to support that connection  The Ngarla Native Title Claim Connection Report  the Report  prepared by Dr Nicholas Smith  describes the traditional and enduring connection of the Ngarla people to their country within the claim area  They share a distinctive Ngarla identity  a distinct language  and a distinct law and kinship system  They have a contemporary attachment to the land and waters and continue to use the land and waters for subsistence practices  Those practices have been somewhat modified over time in a way that can be traced to practices utilised by their ancestors  However  as the authors of the Report note at    i  t stands to reason that claimants no longer live in exactly the same manner as their ancestors did prior to European settlement  and it would be unrealistic to expect them to do so    The Report concludes that the testimony and evidence indicate that  despite the impact of colonisation  Ngarla people maintain a physical and spiritual connection with their homelands and have continued to do so  at     The Report describes how the Ngarla people  a compact claimant group  identify as belonging to the wider regional cluster of Pilbara Aboriginal peoples but are distinct  at    There are criteria by which individuals identify and are identified as Ngarla  at      The most recognisable feature of Ngarla membership is knowledge of Ngarla country and its resources  at    Many of the claimants have an extraordinary detailed knowledge of Ngarla country  The adults devote time in passing on this knowledge and in this way Ngarla traditions are reinforced and transmitted  The claimants  self identification is grounded and perpetuated in a range of customary beliefs and practices  namely law  language and kinship  at   citedLota Warria  on behalf of the Poruma and Masig
