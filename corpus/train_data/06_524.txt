Restom v Battenberg  in the matter of Battenberg  with Corrigendum dated   May     FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toMathai v Kwee   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my opinion  the fact that the debtor always  on the outgoing and incoming passenger cards in evidence  gave his intended address in Australia as Ethersey House  which is his mother s residence  suggests that there is an available argument that he is able regularly to resort to that place as a residence within the meaning of the authorities  Of course  I can make no decision about the likelihood of the success of such an argument  Simply  having regard to the way the matter has been particularised  it seems to me that there is at least an arguable basis  and I put it no higher than that  that depending on the evidence ultimately advanced at the trial in support of and in answer to the particulars  the trial judge could find that the debtor either was ordinarily resident in Australia or had a dwelling house in Australia within the meaning of the authorities discussed by Graham J in Mathai v Kwee   FCA   at   to     For those reasons  I do not consider that there is any abuse of process or other basis upon which I should strike out the remaining allegations in paragraph   of the creditors petition   The next issue is whether the subpoenas to the two clubs should be set aside  Each subpoena seeks in par    application for membership with  the respective club  No name of any person is set out as to whose application it is  nor is there any relevant time period as to which such an application was to be made referrable  In my opinion  there is no legitimate basis for requiring that paragraph to be answered
