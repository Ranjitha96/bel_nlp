Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedClark v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Mr David Clark and his wife  Helen Clark  are taxpayers who have applied to the Federal Court of Australia  Applications   and   respectively  in the Court s original jurisdiction conferred by s  ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  by way of an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Taxation made on   October   to disallow objections to an amended assessment issued to each taxpayer on   November   for the year ending   June    Those applications involve a number of questions including whether each taxpayer is entitled to take advantage of capital losses in the Carringbush Trust by reason of the disposal of the Rothwells shares so as to offset capital gains derived by the trust from other projects   Clark v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA    In those proceedings  the Commissioner of Taxation takes the position that s   of the Corporations Act renders the disposition void  among a range of other arguments  with the result that no capital loss arises in any event   It is not contended by the Commissioner that the value of the shares at the date of sale was anything other than       On   October   the solicitors for the plaintiffs wrote to the Australian Securities Investments Commission  ASIC  advising of this proposed application for an order under s   in relation to the Rothwells shares the subject of the   May   transaction  ASIC took the position that it would not be necessary  in its view  to secure reinstatement of Rothwells for the purpose of obtaining an order under s   and that while shares in Rothwells no longer exist by reason of the winding up and subsequent deregistration of the company  the deregistration ought not to prevent the Court making an order to validate the transaction that occurred when the company was in liquidation  On   November   the application and supporting material was served upon ASIC and Mr Ian Ferrier  the former liquidator of Rothwells citedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Green Pacific Energy Limited  In Liquidation    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There are many authorities that deal with the principles guiding the exercise of the discretion under s   both as to a disposition of property of the company made after the commencement of the winding up and any transfer of shares made after the commencement of the winding up  although the circumstances of any case or group of cases are not to be treated as prescriptive of the discretion which is conferred in broad terms and is  at large   However  ordinarily the discretion will not be exercised in favour of an order unless the Court is satisfied that the order serves either the interests of the company or its creditors  A recent approach to the making of an order under the section can be seen in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Green Pacific Energy Limited  In Liquidation    FCA   per Emmett J   September    In that case  a transfer of shares was approved under s   of the Corporations Act as a necessary element of a Deed of Company Arrangement providing for a substantially greater payment to creditors than would occur in a liquidation   The considerations that derive from an assessment of whether a  disposition of property  of the company ought to be approved are quite different from those immediately relevant to a transfer of shares especially where the shares are fully paid and thus no calls can or will be made upon the shareholder   As to share transfers   the principles seem to be these citedRudge v Bowman   Law Rep   Q B    As between the parties to a transfer and as regards the liability of one to the other   that is  the inter parties position  the transaction is not affected by  the section    Rudge v Bowman   Law Rep   Q B     The transfer is

question is one of transfer of the shares after the commencement of the winding up  the question is  would it be beneficial to the company    Onward Building Society per Bowan LJ at p   and would it

 assets  it seems clear that the reference is not one to the interest of an investor shareholder  Kay LJ clearly had in mind a reference to the creditors of the company when using that phrase   Onward Building Society per Kay LJ at p    In that particular case  no benefit arose out of the proposed transfer of shares to a buyer in favour of either the company or its creditors as a result of which

Pty Ltd     NSWLR per Hope  Mahoney and Priestly JJA  Jardio Holdings Pty Ltd v Dorcon Constructions Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   per Woodward  Neaves and Beaumont JJ    In Jardio   the Court in considering an application concerning the granting of an equitable mortgage after the date of presentation of a winding up petition  rather than a transfer of shares  noted that  special circumstances  may justify the intervention of the Court to approve the transaction  but only as a means to an end  and that end is the promotion of the interests of the creditors as a whole    Jardio   per Woodward  Neaves and Beaumont JJ at p    The Court regarded the overriding  inquiry  required by s   of the Companies Act  NT   the equivalent of s   of the Corporations Act   as  essentially a commercial or economic one  calling for a balancing of the anticipated net gains or losses from the transaction for which approval is sought    Jardio   per the Court at p    Moreover  the  merits  of the transaction  should be tested at the date of entry into the transaction sought to be validated    Jardio   per the Court at p     It seems to me that in assessing the merits of the approval of a transfer of shares  the Court should also adopt an inquiry that is  essentially a commercial or economic one  although the interests affected will not just be the company or the creditors  In assessing the net gains and losses from the perspective of the company and the creditors  there is no prejudice or loss to either  nor any benefit  by reason of the disposal on   May    The position is  in that sense  neutral  If the disposal of the shares has occurred with no prejudice to the company or the creditors  why should the vendor of the shares be deprived of the validity of a transfer of shares to a buyer  If the prohibition upon transfer is a prohibition inter parties upon a valid disposal  why should a vendor be deprived of a valid disposition when no prejudice is suffered by the company or the creditors citedBackoffice Investments v Campbell   NSWSC       ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  In Backoffice Investments v Campbell   NSWSC       ACSR     Bergin J was required to consider whether in the context of a finding of oppressive conduct by one shareholder  Campbell  on the part of the company  Healthy Water  NSW  Pty Ltd  against another shareholder  Backoffice  an order ought to be made under s    a provisional liquidator having been appointed to the company  validating the transfer of Backoffice s share to Campbell as part of a remedial order that Campbell acquire  pursuant to s  d  of the Corporations Act   Backoffice s share at a particular valuation  The Court so ordered as an incident of relieving Backoffice of Campbell s oppressive conduct  not on the footing that the order served only the interests of the company but  principally  on the footing that the interest of the oppressed shareholder would be served by making an order under s   in connection with the share transfer  as a necessary incident of the remedial orders   In this case  I can see no reason why the vendor of the shares on   May   nor the purchaser ought to be deprived of the validity of the disposition by reason of s   of the Corporations Act if that is what the prohibition upon  transfer  under s   effects  as there is no prejudice to the company or its creditors  all shares at the relevant date were fully paid  and although served with the present application  neither ASIC nor the former liquidator of Rothwells nor the Commissioner has appeared before the Court to contradict the orders sought by the plaintiffs   Accordingly  I propose to make order that the transfer by Carringbush Pty Ltd to Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd on   May   of       cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares of     in Rothwells Limited  each fully paid  and   ordinary shares of     in Rothwells Limited  each fully paid  is not
