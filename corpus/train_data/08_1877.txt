were qualifications to the general proposition that the ASIC Act did not abrogate legal professional privilege  The qualifications were  first  that the ASIC Act is silent as to whether a person other than a lawyer may refuse to give information on the ground that it would disclose a communication for which the person claims legal privilege  If that observation by ASIC was intended to provide support for a contention that an individual  not a lawyer  could be compelled by ASIC to disclose information for which the individual had a claim for legal professional privilege  then that contention is rejected  It is rejected because it finds no support in the Act and is contrary to authority   Daniels    There is no basis for distinguishing between a lawyer and an individual in the context of legal professional privilege  So much is made clear from the express words of s   of the ASIC Act   In the circumstances specified  which includes ASIC s powers of investigation  examination and information gathering in Pt     a lawyer may refuse to comply with a requirement to give information or produce a book  where to do so would involve the disclosure of a privileged

inconsistently with the maintenance of that privilege for privilege to be waived  see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd     ALR   at    Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in   and   above   On the assumption that  at the outset of a s   examination  ASIC told an examinee that legal professional privilege may be availed of by that person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents that would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services  then disclosure by an examinee or witness of information in which he or she holds the privilege would constitute an act inconsistent with the maintenance of that privilege and privilege would be waived  see Cadbury   ALR   at    So much may be accepted  It is consistent with the established principles on waiver   If ASIC s submission is intended to suggest that if that same person  for example  an employee  director  consultant to  but not a legal adviser of  a third party  was privy to the privileged communications of the third party  then ASIC could compel production of that privileged information  that contention should be rejected for the reasons outlined in   and   above citedCommodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub   USSC       US     If  however  ASIC meant to submit not that it could compel a person  here  an employee or former employee  to disclose a third party s  here  a company s  privilege by force of statute  but rather that the person may lack the standing to assert the third party s privilege  then that contention may be accepted  Just as an employee can only waive a corporation s privilege if he or she has authority to do so  typically  where the person is a current officer or director  so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority  Commodity

correct when he told counsel for AWB that  n either     could  the employees  make the claim  of privilege on behalf of AWB  nor  could they  waive the claim       above discussedCowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd   VSCA  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  html  However that may be  the fact of the matter is that ASIC now has possession of information which  at least in theory  could be subject to a valid claim of privilege by AWB  The question then is whether ASIC is entitled to make use of that information  notwithstanding the possible privilege claim  and the answer to that question is yes  As the Court of Appeal in Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd   VSCA   said  at        A lthough it is now accepted that legal professional privilege is more than just a rule of evidence or procedure  it is clear that it is not to be characterised as a rule of law conferring individual rights sounding in damages or an injunction to

Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is settled that  legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law which may be availed of by a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client or his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services  Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   HCA         CLR   at   and   and the authorities cited   In the

procedures of the kind contained in s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TPA  Daniels Corporation   HCA       CLR   at   and    Despite differences in language between the TPA and the ASIC Act   no different result ensues  There is no express provision in the ASIC Act abrogating legal professional privilege  Moreover  there is nothing in the ASIC Act supporting the contention that the abrogation of legal professional privilege is a necessary implication  see eg ss             Pt   and  in particular  ss   and      In the course of argument  ASIC appeared to suggest there were

above   In other words  I accept the contention that although ASIC cannot compel the production of legally privileged communications of a person  ie the ASIC Act does not override or abrogate legal professional privilege  that does not mean that ASIC cannot receive such communications under any circumstances  As ASIC contended  legal professional privilege affords a person immunity from compulsory disclosure of its privileged communication   Daniels    That immunity does not prevent receipt by ASIC in the circumstances of the present case of legally privileged information from the

conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt  Emmett J reasoned  at   that an examinee  would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might

is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege  except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege   To the contrary  it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises   that is  imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so  under Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee  without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer  could waive the corporation s privilege  For those reasons  it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party  nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim  While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer   NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley     SASR   at

www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Of course  there cannot be a general rule that a legal representative of the employer or the former employer of the examinee should be permitted to attend to protect the employer s privilege  There may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation  see eg Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         FCR   at       see also Rochfort at    Mason J   stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but  the protection of the employer s interests  in the information  must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two   But in the absence of such a circumstance  the

Feneley     SASR   at     that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer s legal professional privilege referred toJohns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In early   ASIC received a request from the Australian Federal Police  the AFP  that it disclose certain information  including the AWB Information  to the AFP  AWB s solicitors learned of the request from a current employee and three former employees who had been examined by ASIC  Those current and former employees had been contacted by ASIC about the AFP request  ASIC informed them that ASIC was considering whether to provide the transcript of their s   examination to the AFP and  consistent with the decision of the High Court in Johns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA         CLR     provided each of them with an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of the transcript of their s   examination to the AFP   Upon learning of the proposed disclosure by ASIC  AWB wrote to ASIC on   April   seeking an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of information to the AFP including the conditions of the release  ASIC responded on   April    At that time  the request was limited to the transcripts of the s   examinations  ASIC outlined the terms of the AFP request  its proposal to release the transcripts of the s   examinations to the AFP and the conditions upon which that information was proposed to be released  ASIC expressed the view that      It is ASIC s view that the protocols that were applied during the course of the section   ASIC Act examinations to ensure that information subject to a valid claim of legal professional privilege was not disclosed were sufficient  and that no privileged information was disclosed during the course of any examinations             Further  in light of the conditions on which ASIC proposes to release the examination transcripts to the AFP  and the secrecy provisions imposed on employees of the AFP by section  A of the Australian Federal Police Act   Cth  sic  ASIC does not consider that  AWB s  interests in the confidentiality of any information provided to ASIC by examinees will be adversely affected by the proposed release     Although it is ASIC s view that      AWB s  interests will  not  be adversely affected by any decision to release the information to the AFP on the limited basis identified in paragraph   above  ASIC proposes to give  AWB  an opportunity to make submissions in relation to the conditions to be imposed on the disclosure of the transcripts of examinations of current or former employees of  AWB  to the AFP under section   of the ASIC Act    ASIC and AWB s solicitors corresponded for some months  By July   the AFP request had extended to disclosure of the witness statements that had been provided voluntarily by the employees and former employees of AWB   However  that is not the end of the enquiry  The disclosure of the AWB Information by ASIC to the AFP was subject to conditions imposed under s  A   see   above   ASIC s s   power to disclose is discretionary  Johns at   and    The conditions are important  When  as here  conditions are imposed they are enforceable as an equitable obligation  The AFP is affected by the terms on which it received the AWB Information  Johns at    The obligation  expressed as a condition  is enforceable  at least  by injunction  Johns at     The question which then arises is whether the disclosure of the AWB Information under s   requires ASIC to observe procedural fairness not only towards the examinee but also a party in the position of AWB consistent with the principles set out in Johns v ASC   HCA         CLR    The exercise of the statutory power is conditional upon the observance of the rules of natural justice   Johns at   Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR       and Annetts v McCann   HCA         CLR       but does that natural justice requirement extend to AWB  First  it must be recalled that the AWB Information was protected by disclosure  s   subject to the qualifications prescribed in ss      That antecedent right or duty is not determinative  However  it is a relevant factor affecting the exercise by ASIC of its discretionary statutory power to disclose the AWB Information to the AFP  Exercise of the authority conferred by s   was  apt to affect adversely  the interests of the examinees who are prima facie entitled to have the transcripts kept confidential  Johns at    It was for that reason  consistent with Johns   that ASIC observed the rules of natural justice and informed each of the examinees that it proposed to disclose the transcripts and gave each examinee an opportunity to oppose  Johns at       The present case  however  concerns not the examinee but AWB  the employer or previous employer of each examinee  In Johns   McHugh J said  at   that  the need to preserve the confidentiality of ASIC s investigation does not exclude procedural fairness  but reduces its content  perhaps in some circumstances to nothing   Here  the question of whether or not ASIC was obliged to observe the rules of natural justice in the case of AWB did not arise  Although AWB was not told by ASIC of the proposed disclosures to the AFP  it learned of that fact  was  given the opportunity to put submissions before  ASIC  relating to matters requiring the non disclosure of information by  ASIC    Johns at   and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure  AWB might have persuaded ASIC to accept or adopt its submissions  It did not  In the circumstances  it is not necessary to pursue McHugh J s observation to its end to determine precisely how much the content of procedural fairness may have been reduced with respect to AWB  I need only find  and do find  that the opportunity to be heard that was given to AWB was sufficient   It follows from what I have just said that none of AWB s grounds of review is made out  The specific grounds are disposed of as follows   There was no and could be no constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction or an absence of power contrary to ss  c  and  d  of the ADJR Act   AWB s contentions that ASIC was  not  empowered by the ASIC Act to obtain confidential and privileged communications from persons other than the holder of the privilege in circumstances where the holder has not expressly or by implication waived the privilege  is too broad a proposition  ASIC is not empowered to compel production from the privilege holder and did not do so   In my view  there was no denial of natural justice  AWB was  given the opportunity to put submissions before  ASIC  relating to matters requiring the non disclosure of information by  ASIC    Johns at   and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure  As I have found  this opportunity to be heard was enough to satisfy any requirements of natural justice in the circumstances  see   above  Moreover  it is of the utmost importance to recall that in a proceeding of this nature it is neither necessary nor right to decide the merits of the decision   For those reasons  I would dismiss the

that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer s legal professional privilege   But while there may be a question as to what obligations or abilities a person may have in respect of claims of privilege on behalf of third parties  it is clear that there is no requirement in the ASIC Act   which imposes an obligation on ASIC to afford a person or entity  other than the person the subject of the exercise of the compulsory power   ie the third party itself     an opportunity to intervene or interject in the exercise of the compulsory power over another in order to claim or assert legal professional privilege on behalf of itself  see  in particular Pts   and   of the ASIC Act   or     notice that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual  such as an examinee  may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party     See by way of example  May v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at       and   and MM at   and     That is not surprising  If ASIC were under an obligation to notify a third party that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual  such as an examinee  may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party  by what criteria would ASIC determine when and in what circumstances it was required to notify a third party  Would ASIC be required to interrupt an examination upon becoming aware of the prospect of or the fact of information being provided by an examinee which might be the subject of a claim of privilege by a third party  How would ASIC determine if it was properly subject to a claim for legal professional privilege  The list of difficulties is endless and the possibility great that efficient and timely investigation of wrongdoing would be frustrated   Moreover  there are measures that the third party can take to prevent disclosure of its privileged information even in the absence of a right to intervene  First  where an examinee is subject to the exercise of compulsory powers by a government authority and in possession of privileged information where the holder of the privilege is a third party  it is open to the holder of privilege to require or authorise the examinee to assert the holder s privilege to the authority  MM at    cf s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   Of course  the efficacy of this strategy is likely to be limited in situations where the third party does not have prior notice of the examination or other exercise of power over another under the ASIC Act    Secondly  equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained   especially where the information is used as a  springboard for a claim or defence in litigation  Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd   VSCA   at         As Emmett J noted in MM   there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver  eg ss       of the ASIC Act   ss   and   of the Evidence Act    Cth  and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd  No       All ER    Put another way   the right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her  or it  is not affected by the disclosure of the privileged material by a party within the scope of the privilege but not entitled to control its exercise  MM at    This is a natural consequence of the basic principle that only the holder of the privilege may waive it  Moreover  although not applicable in the present case  because the third party here is a corporation  which has no privilege against self incrimination  Daniels at   that preservation of privilege extends not only to legal professional privilege but also privilege against self incrimination because the ASIC Act abrogates privilege against self incrimination  s   and then provides a  use immunity  to the examinee in relation to information obtained in a s   examination where the requirements of s   are satisfied  s   of the ASIC Act   Interestingly  unlike other Commonwealth legislation  the  use immunity  in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents  s  d  of the ASIC Act   see also Privilege in Perspective   ALRC Report No     at Ch   and in particular  paras         and     and       It is well established that  an administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so  MM at    If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account that will be decisive  However  if the relevant factors are not expressly stated  they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR

Section   of the ASIC Act imposes an obligation on ASIC to take all reasonable measures to protect the unauthorised use or disclosure of information given to it in confidence in performance of its functions  Onefone Australia Pty Ltd v One Tel Ltd   NSWSC   at     Section   provides an exception to that general principle  Where ASIC is satisfied  particular information  will assist  for example  the AFP  then disclosure of that  particular information  to the AFP will be taken to be an authorised use and disclosure of that  particular information    The exercise of the power under s   of the ASIC Act is the exercise of an additional power in relation to the  particular information  identified by ASIC at the time of the request by the AFP  It necessarily will involve consideration of  information  that did not exist at the time of the examination  here  the questions and answers recorded in the transcript  or the taking of the witness statement  here  the statement   It will also necessarily involve the consideration of matters that did not exist at the aforementioned times  including the nature of the agency function or power  here  criminal investigation by the AFP  and the usefulness of the information to that exercise of power  here  the conduct of that investigation   Section  A  of the ASIC Act provides that ASIC may impose conditions in relation to disclosure of the  particular information  under s    The conditions imposed by ASIC in respect of the AWB Information are those set out in   above   In the present case  the dispositive issue  see   above  has two aspects to it  The two aspects to consider are     whether  in exercising the power under s     by deciding to pass the AWB Information to the AFP  ASIC failed to consider a relevant matter  and      a more basic question of power     For reasons which will become obvious  it is first necessary to deal with the question of power   There is no factual foundation yet established that there is material in the AWB Information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches  However  if the AWB Information does contain information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches  ASIC would have power to pass on that material to the AFP  That conclusion requires development citedNP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley     SASR   I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third party privilege  No doubt this is the best policy  but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted  see Rochfort at

those interests   In MM   Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself  In support of this proposition  his

here  an employee or former employee  to disclose a third party s  here  a company s  privilege by force of statute  but rather that the person may lack the standing to assert the third party s privilege  then that contention may be accepted  Just as an employee can only waive a corporation s privilege if he or she has authority to do so  typically  where the person is a current officer or director  so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority  Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub   USSC       US

Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission     CLR   for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self incrimination on behalf of a corporation  at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege  because the privilege is personal to the holder   To put it another way  the ASIC investigator was legally correct when he told counsel for AWB that  n either     could  the employees  make the claim  of privilege on behalf of AWB  nor  could they  waive the claim       above   That conclusion sounds  at least at first blush  as harsh or unjust  Even Mason J  in holding that an employee could not claim privilege against self incrimination on behalf of his or her corporate employer in order to resist a subpoena  accepted that   Rochfort at       To acknowledge that the employee s possession  of privileged information  is sufficient in itself to sustain an obligation to produce  without reference to his employer  would be to disregard the employer s rights with respect to his documents  What is more it would deprive him of the privilege of objecting to produce a document on the ground that it has a tendency to incriminate him       However  closer examination reveals both why this result is not as harsh as it first seems and why it is necessary   First  although the examination under s   of the ASIC Act is private  it is an examination where  the inspector may give directions about who may be present during it  or during a part of it  s    If a direction is made for a person to attend  that person is entitled to attend the examination  s    The  person  referred to in s   is not the examinee s lawyer  The right of the examinee s lawyer to attend and address the inspector is separately and expressly provided for in s    Who then could that person be  One obvious contender is the legal adviser of the examinee s employer in circumstances such as those outlined in the extracts of the transcript  see   above   But ASIC did not permit that to occur  The power to make directions must include directions not only about the identity of the legal representative who might be entitled to attend on behalf of the company at any examination  but also about the non disclosure of the contents of the examination to any person or entity  including the entity seeking to protect its privileged communications    Of course  there cannot be a general rule that a legal representative of the employer or the former employer of the examinee should be permitted to attend to protect the employer s privilege  There may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation  see eg Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         FCR   at       see also Rochfort at    Mason J   stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but  the protection of the employer s interests  in the information  must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two   But in the absence of such a circumstance  the voluntary grant by ASIC of a limited right to be present in the manner outlined by counsel for AWB might have forestalled the issues raised in these proceedings   I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third party privilege  No doubt this is the best policy  but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted  see Rochfort at      noting that in general effort should be made

professional privilege citedUnited States v Western Electric Corp Inc     Trade Cases  P     WL    DDC   However  neither AWB nor AWBI took any step to review the decision of the investigator to refuse to permit AWB to be represented at the examinations  Whether such an effort would have succeeded seems unlikely  see     below  in this regard  it is illuminating to examine United States v
