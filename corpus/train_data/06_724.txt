SZEJF v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAppellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The tribunal dismissed the canal incident because that incident did not result in serious harm but it never considered whether such an attack  by many persons of one faith in company who were hostile to the appellant s religious behaviour and political opinion and or membership of a social group  gave rise to a  well founded fear   Instead the tribunal asserted  without identifying a basis that there was nothing to suggest that there would be a risk of this behaviour being repeated in the future because  so it said  the appellant would not employ a Christian and could modify his use of language to avoid the word  jihad  in campaigning against drug trafficking  This assertion was misconceived  As McHugh and Kirby JJ said in Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   at             and see too per Gummow and Hayne JJ at               The notion that it is reasonable for a person to take action that will avoid persecutory harm invariably leads a tribunal of fact into a failure to consider properly whether there is a real chance of persecution if the person is returned to the country of nationality  This is particularly so where the actions of the persecutors have already caused the person affected to modify his or her conduct by hiding his or her religious beliefs  political opinions  racial origins  country of nationality or membership of a particular social group  In cases where the applicant has modified his or her conduct  there is a natural tendency for the tribunal of fact to reason that  because the applicant has not been persecuted in the past  he or she will not be persecuted in the future  The fallacy underlying this approach is the assumption that the conduct of the applicant is uninfluenced by the conduct of the persecutor and that the relevant persecutory conduct is the harm that will be inflicted  In many    perhaps the majority of    cases  however  the applicant has acted in the way that he or she did only because of the threat of harm  In such cases  the well founded fear of persecution held by the applicant is the fear that  unless that person acts to avoid the harmful conduct  he or she will suffer harm  It is the threat of serious harm with its menacing implications that constitutes the persecutory conduct  To determine the issue of real chance without determining whether the modified conduct was influenced by the threat of harm is to fail to consider that issue properly                Subject to the law  each person is free to associate with any other person and to act as he or she pleases  however much other individuals or groups may disapprove of that person s associations or particular mode of life  This is the underlying assumption of the rule of law   I am of opinion that the tribunal misconceived the question which it was required to address on the review under s   of the Act  It dismissed the appellant s claims of a well founded fear by making mere assertions that  although he complied with the banishment imposed by the Jirga  the chance was remote that they might subject him or his family who remain in Peshawar to harm in the foreseeable future and that a physical assault on him by a large group in company was not persecution because he was not seriously hurt   These assertions were unreasoned and unsupported because they ignored objective facts found and did not deal with the apparently credible newspaper articles which supported the claims  If the tribunal meant to say that because the appellant will accept his banishment he can have no fear  that involved the very mistake of which McHugh and Kirby JJ wrote   CLR at       I have not overlooked that the issue of whether the appellant could relocate within Pakistan  which was also before the tribunal  However  that issue could arise only after a determination that he had a reason to relocate  The tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in dealing with the claims of the appellant   And  in reaching its conclusion that the appellant could relocate to Karachi where he could live safely  the tribunal  first  considered in a jurisdictionally erroneous manner only his claim relating to the tribal and religious leaders of Khyber Agency and  secondly  said it had taken into account all of the evidence  In other words  the tribunal did not assess the claims based on the appellant being free to act in Karachi  as he would have acted without modifying his behaviour to eschew the realization of his fears  Hence  in the penultimate paragraph of its reasons when dealing with the canal attack  the tribunal s approach as described above  was to deal with the claim by reference to its  unfounded  anticipation that the appellant would modify his behaviour  That approach evinced the very error exposed in Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   at                       I am satisfied  for the reasons above  that the tribunal misconceived its task in assessing whether the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for one or more Convention reasons and that it did not have a good reason for rejecting those claims  That is not to say that on a rehearing the tribunal might not come to the same decision but  if it does  it must do so according to law   At the hearing on   April   I gave leave to the Minister to file and serve a note indicating     a  what documents in the appeal book had been given to the tribunal by the appellant and which the tribunal had obtained from other sources and when each document had been received by the tribunal   b  what further authorities the Minister relied on arising out of the course of argument at the hearing   I also gave leave to the appellant to respond to what the Minister served  On   April   the Minister filed a supplementary submission referring to the affidavit to be filed relating to the documents and giving case references appliedApplicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In a case in which the tribunal found  without making any investigation that newspaper articles were not genuine and that parts of the applicant for review s story were  implausible  a Full Court of this court held that the tribunal had made a jurisdictional error by failing to conduct its review in accordance with the fair procedure required by the Act   Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at                 per Lee J      per Tamberlin J agreeing    What is even more extraordinary about the deficiency in the reasoning process in the case before me is that the second newspaper article appeared  while the appellant was in Australia  on   June   during the hearing reinforcing the fact that the Jirga was actively engaged in persecuting the appellant and his family  Again  the tribunal made no finding about the genuineness or otherwise of this article   The   June   article repeated the public condemnation  apparently in the city of Peshawar  of the appellant and his group for the political views they had expressed  Faced with two newspaper publications   months apart in two apparently different newspapers  one in Arabic and the other in English  the tribunal had evidence to support the appellant s claim from apparently genuine and independent sources that he had been publicly identified in the media by a religious group for his expression of political opinion and religious practices  The tribunal gave no explanation as to why it was implausible that that which appeared in the newspaper articles could have  let alone in fact did  come to the notice of the Jirga or why it was not accepted as evidence to support the claims  And  the tribunal did this in the context of then accepting that the appellant held more liberal views than some tribal leaders in the Khyber Agency and that he may have attracted their disapproval in     In my opinion  no reasonable person could have expressed a reasoning process in the way that the tribunal did in order to deal with this evidence  Nor did the tribunal use its investigative powers by means of s   of the Act in the way suggested by Lee J or Tamberlin J in M  v Minister   FCAFC   at           by asking the Secretary of the department to investigate the newspaper articles  Moreover  the fact that the Jirga had banished the appellant from the area in which he worked and that its decree had been publicly notified in his family s home city  indicated that there was in fact persecution for a Convention reason  political opinion  of the appellant at least in the area in which the Jirga s influence extended  Whether or not that went as far as Peshawar may be a matter that was legitimately within the area of fact finding confined to the tribunal  But the tribunal did not consider the punishment of banishment at all in assessing whether the appellant s fear of persecution was well founded  It merely noted that he had complied with the banishment and did not return to the Peshawar area in the subsequent ten months he had remained in Pakistan following it   The tribunal also dismissed as evidence of persecution for a Convention reason the fact that the appellant had been thrown into the canal for what ostensibly was a motivation  by reason of his religion  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  perceived by his attackers  The tribunal reasoned that because the appellant did not suffer any serious harm and was uninjured and   therefore  found  that it did not amount to persecution    The fortuity that when one is attacked by   or   people and thrown into a watercourse one might not be injured sufficiently to require medical attention belies the fact that the experience which the appellant suffered was plainly intimidatory and potentially very dangerous  A mob attack by persons in Peshawar  claiming that the appellant should not have employed a Christian or expressed certain opinions based on religion or politics  was capable of supporting his claim that the influence of the Jirga and those associated with it had extended to that city and that the appellant was a target  Instead  the tribunal dismissed its findings as to this as having no effect because the appellant fortuitously  presumably  could swim and therefore did not drown  and had not been sufficiently harmed in the attack before he was thrown into the water to stop him getting out and getting away   When the tribunal said that it      consider ed  it somewhat implausible that the Jirga members might have even been aware      that the appellant s group existed  it was suggesting that the claim was somewhat  without appearance of truth or acceptability  as Lee J explained in Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     The tribunal gave no explanation for discounting what appeared to be newspaper articles before it in which there could have been no doubt that  if genuine  the Jirga did know of the appellant s group s existence and what is more it had sought to banish him and cause his family to account to the Jirga by reason of the appellant s and his group s activities   The tribunal gave no reasons for asserting any form of implausibility of that material  It did not suggest that the newspaper reports were anything other than genuine  and if it wished to have investigated that question it could have used its powers under s  d  of the Act to require the Secretary to  arrange for the making of any investigation that the tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review  and to give to the tribunal a report of that investigation        see Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at             per Lee J        per Tamberlin J   Likewise  the assertion by the tribunal that there was no evidence that the Jirga had located or threatened the applicant s family in Peshawar or that they had any influence outside the Khyber Agency at all is flatly contradicted by the newspaper articles  especially that of   June   and has no evidentiary support whatever   The tribunal used these findings to conclude that the applicant was not a prominent political activist and was therefore capable of relocating within Pakistan on the ground that the chance would be remote  were he to return to Karachi  that he might be subjected to persecution for reasons of his political opinions by tribal or religious leaders from the remote Khyber Agency followedApplicant NADB of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The tribunal s task was to consider whether the appellant had a well  ounded fear that he might be persecuted  It ignored the fact that an attack such as this following on from his being banished for publicly exposed and

the inference that the tribunal is applying the wrong test or is not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters  If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact

also contended before his Honour that there had been no proper investigation of his genuine claims  His Honour noted  correctly  that the tribunal had assessed the claims and evidence which the appellant had put forward and was not obliged to conduct a further investigation into the matter  referring to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB   HCA         ALR   at         His Honour also correctly dismissed the contention that the appellant should have been provided with specific details of general country information  As his Honour noted  s  A a  of the Act does not require the tribunal to put these matters specifically to the appellant and in any event his Honour found that he was not persuaded that any relevant country information was not raised satisfactorily with the appellant during the hearing so as to afford him a fair opportunity to meet it  I am likewise not persuaded that there is anything in this ground for the reasons his Honour gave   His Honour rejected a contention that the tribunal had acted in bad faith and that this could be established from the transcript of the hearing before the tribunal  As his Honour noted no transcript had been provided then  nor has it been now  and I agree with his Honour that there is no basis for concluding in the material before the Court that the tribunal acted in bad faith   His Honour then dismissed the appeal   The appellant s grounds of appeal are fairly broad and unspecific  He alleges that his Honour failed to find an error of law  jurisdictional error  lack of procedural fairness or to grant relief under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Why his Honour is alleged to have failed was not articulated  The notice of appeal also asserted that his Honour erred in considering the real state of affairs of his persecution in his previous country of residence and his fear of harm  The appellant s grounds also argued that the present government of Pakistan failed to protect the people s lives which is a world wide concern today  He also complained that he would face persecution if he returned to Pakistan as there are significant levels of violation of human rights which his Honour did not consider  The notice of appeal also refers to a number of court decisions but does not specify why any decision has particular relevance to this matter   The appellant asserted that his Honour erred in failing to find that he was a member of a social group of persons working against drug traffickers and producers who acted as informants of the police  The Minister contended that this did not constitute an identifiable social group for the purposes of the Convention  I suggested in argument to counsel for the Minister that the well known anti drugs campaigner  Donald Mackay  had been killed in Griffith  New South Wales  for his political  anti drugs stance and that such a public position could be taken as either an expression of political opinion or membership of a social group  The Minister submitted that this would not be the case here   The appellant also pointed to the way in which the tribunal had addressed his claim to have been persecuted by the tribal leaders and the Jirga who had been in Khyber Agency  He identified the two newspaper articles to which I have referred as showing that there was material before the tribunal which provided objective support for his claims  He said that there were people of strong Islamic beliefs all over Pakistan  not just in the Khyber Agency area and that the tribunal had not given rational consideration to his claim of a well founded fear of persecution   The appellant also argued that the finding that the tribunal had made  in dismissing the canal incident as evidence of persecution  was that it was unlikely to recur because he would not be an employer of a Christian and could readily use less sensitive language and avoid using the expression  jihad  if he returned to campaign against drugs  was not a reasoning process which addressed the claim he was making   Counsel for the Minister put that whatever had happened in the past  the appellant had not been found by the tribunal to have expressed the desire  were he returned to Pakistan  to employ Christians or to use provocative language in expressing his anti drugs campaign and that therefore there was no basis upon which he could say that there was a well founded fear that could have been found by the tribunal  The Minister relied on the findings that the appellant was not a prominent activist and that he had actually lived in Karachi for five months without difficulty   I am of opinion that the tribunal s reasoning in relation to the banishment of the appellant by the tribal elders and the requirement that his family put on a defence to his activities  demonstrates that it made a jurisdictional error in dealing with the review citedMinister for Immigration v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www

       CLR   at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to the inference which is open to a court exercising the function of judicially reviewing a decision of the executive government that if the decision maker does not give any reason for his or her decision the court may be able to infer that he or she had no good reason citedSecretary of State for Education and Science v Thameside
