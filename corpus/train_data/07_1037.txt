SZHJE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  No     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedDe L v Director General  NSW Department of Community Services   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  No submissions have been made this morning as to whether my judgment or order of   June   have been entered  Considering the situation on the best case of the appellant  however  comments of Toohey  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Kirby JJ in De L v Director General  NSW Department of Community Services   HCA         CLR   are relevant   In that case  their Honours said at   as follows  omitting citations    The power of this court to reopen its judgments or orders is not in doubt  The court may do so if it is convinced that  in its earlier consideration of the point  it has proceeded  on a misapprehension as to the facts or law  where  there is some matter calling for review  or where  the interests of justice so require   It has been said repeatedly that a heavy burden is cast upon the applicant for reopening to show that such an exceptional course is required  without fault on his part  ie without the attribution of neglect or default to the party seeking reopening  By such expressions of the power to reopen final orders  courts seek to recognise competing objectives of the law  On the one hand  there is the principle of finality of litigation which reinforces the respect that should be shown to orders  final on their face  addressed to the world at large and upon which conduct may be ordered reliant upon their binding authority  On the other hand  courts recognise that accidents and oversights can sometimes occur which  unrepaired  will occasion an injustice  In the case of a final court of appeal  such as this court  that injustice may be irremediable  unless the court itself  acting promptly  is persuaded to reopen its orders so as to afford relief in the exceptional circumstances of the case relatedSZHJE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I have before me an application filed   June   seeking an order that the orders made by the Court in this matter on   June   be set aside  Those orders are the orders made in the substantive judgment in this matter SZHJE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    In that case  I dismissed an appeal by the appellant against the decision of Emmett FM of   March   which had  in turn  dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of   August   and handed down on   September    The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant   Although I am considering an application filed by the appellant in the substantive matter  for convenience I shall continue to refer to SZHJE as  the appellant   The appellant did not attend the hearing before me on   June   and seeks to have the orders made that day set aside  The appellant s submission is that he did not receive the letter notifying him of the hearing before me on   June   and  therefore  did not attend the hearing  The appellant further submits that he had filed information in preparation for the hearing and it was evident from this action that he wanted to attend  However  he could not do so because he was not aware of the hearing date   I note by way of background that this matter first came before me on   May    Both parties were present  At that hearing  it became apparent that an adjournment would be necessary as the appellant may not have received a copy of the reasons for decision of the learned Federal Magistrate and that in the interests of justice he should have an opportunity to consider her Honour s reasons   I noted at that hearing that the decision of the Federal Magistrate was delivered on   March   at which time her Honour indicated that the reasons for her decision would be given at a later date and that I understood that reasons for her Honour s decision were given on   May     The hearing was subsequently relisted for   June   and the appellant filed written submissions on   June    In my judgment in SZHJE   FCA   at       I outlined the measures taken by the Court and the respondent to notify the appellant of the hearing date and indicated that I was satisfied that all reasonable attempts had been made to notify the appellant of the hearing   The appellant has said in Court this morning that his appeal was dismissed on   June   because he did not appear  This is not the case  As I made clear during the   June   hearing  and as I specifically indicated in my judgment  I was not prepared to adjourn the hearing for want of appearance  In view of the material before the Court  I was prepared to decide this matter on the merits of the material before me  My reasons for decision in respect of each of the appellant s grounds of appeal are set out in SZHJE   FCA   at      Accordingly  I note that this is not a case where the appellant s appeal was dismissed pursuant to s  B bb ii  Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  because the appellant failed to attend the hearing  In light of this  the question is upon what basis the appellant could seek to have my orders in SZHJE   FCA   set aside  One clear avenue is by way of appeal from that decision  which is not a matter for this Court  Another possible ground is in terms of O   r   Federal Court Rules which provides in O   r    The court may vary or set aside a judgment or order before it has been entered   Order   r   is not applicable in these circumstances because the Court is exercising its appellate jurisdiction   To the extent that such comments are applicable in the case before me  I note that this matter was heard by me on   June   and decided on the appellant s grounds of appeal and submissions of both the appellant and the first respondent  It is unfortunate that the appellant did not appear at that hearing and that additional time and expense have been incurred on account of this application  However  I am not persuaded that there is any reason to depart from my decision in SZHJE   FCA    I have considered all the appellant s claims in full in that judgment and am not satisfied that this is a case where there has been some misapprehension as to facts or law or some accident or oversight has occurred which occasions an injustice such that the decision should be set aside  No further submissions have been made by the appellant today which persuade me that there is an appellable error in the decision of the Court below  which could justify a review of my decision and orders of   June     THE COURT ORDERS THAT         The application filed   June   be dismissed      The appellant pay the costs of the first respondent to be fixed in the sum of      I certify that the preceding nine   numbered
