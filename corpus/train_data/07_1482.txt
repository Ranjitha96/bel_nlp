provision operates as a machinery provision to facilitate tax collection in relation to liable trust income  when the liability is otherwise imposed than by s     At   his Honour continued    I conclude that the Income Tax Assessment Act s  d  is a machinery provision which requires a trustee in possession of trust income to retain out of such income received by him in his representative capacity moneys sufficient to pay tax which is  or will become due  in respect of the income   Since there may be a debt to the Commissioner of Taxation arising out of the nondisclosure of income from undisclosed overseas assets of the estate  the Court is satisfied that  prima facie  the applicants may have a claim arising under a Commonwealth statute sufficient to attract the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act    Cth  and s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   Accordingly the Court possesses jurisdiction to grant relief followedPaxus Services Ltd

Foreign Exchange  Regulations    the Regulations  which provides for a possible right to restitution  The applicants refer to the decision in Skyes v Stratton     NSWLR   at   and submit that any contract or arrangement is illegal if it is made for the purpose of or has the effect of defeating  evading  avoiding or preventing the operation of the Regulations  They submit that the evidence prima facie establishes the existence of such arrangement between the deceased and the respondent   The applicants submit that unless restrained  the respondent may destroy relevant records and deal with assets derived from the estate in such a manner as may defeat the interests of the Commissioner of Taxation  Further  there may be tax liabilities of the estate which will need to be met from the assets held overseas  The applicant s concern is based upon the fact that the respondent has refused requests to make disclosure of the existence of such assets   In these proceedings the applicants are trustees as defined by s   of the ITAA    By virtue of s  f  of the ITAA   trustees are indemnified for all payments which they may make pursuant to the ITAA   or of any requirement by the
