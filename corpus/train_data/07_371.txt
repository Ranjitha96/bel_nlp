Commission v Samton Holdings Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   and Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     As is well known  the High Court confirmed the doctrine of unconscionability in Amadio   In that case  Mason J  as his Honour then was  stated  at      But relief on the ground of  unconscionable conduct  is usually taken to refer to the class of case in which a party makes unconscientious use of his superior position or bargaining power to the detriment of a party who suffers from some special disability or is placed in some special situation of disadvantage  e g   a catching bargain with an expectant heir or an unfair contract made by taking advantage of a person who is seriously affected by intoxicating drink  Although unconscionable conduct in this narrow sense bears some resemblance to the doctrine of undue influence  there is a difference between the two  In the latter the will of the innocent party is not independent and voluntary because it is overborne  In the former the will of the innocent party  even if independent and voluntary  is the result of the disadvantageous position in which he is placed and of the other party unconscientiously taking advantage of that position   Following Amadio   there were a number of cases that discussed the doctrine of unconscionability  However  it was not until Samton that the Full Court of the Federal Court held that unconscionability in the context of s  AA requires conduct to be identified that supports the grant of relief on principles set out in specific equitable doctrines  rather than requiring unconscionability at large   In Berbatis   the High Court upheld a decision of the Full Court of this Court  It did so on the basis that the facts found fell short of what would attract the operation of the principles expounded in Amadio and therefore a breach of s  AA could not be established referred toGPG  Australia Trading  Pty Ltd v GIO

the proposition that a breach of contract alone could give rise to unconscionable conduct  He also placed some reliance upon the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Samton    Further  I reject the contention that Einfeld J in HECEC held that a breach of contract alone could give rise to unconscionable conduct  The case is replete with references to the economic disadvantage of the applicant as against the respondents who were various government ministers  and State instrumentalities  Mr Marantelli could point to no case in which a mere breach of contract had been held to give rise to unconscionable conduct  That is not surprising  The High Court has made it abundantly clear that there are limits upon the doctrine of unconscionability  and that the term is not to be used simply as a synonym for general unfairness   It was for these reasons that I concluded that the mere allegation that the ninth to fifteenth respondents had caused the first to fifth respondents to breach their contractual obligations to the applicant  and facilitated the sixth to eighth respondents in gaining the benefits of those breaches  could not of itself amount to unconscionable conduct  In effect  all that was alleged against the ninth to fifteenth respondents is that they were responsible  in various ways  for the failure of the first to fifth respondents to comply with the terms of the various licence agreements   There was no suggestion in the further amended statement of claim of any inequality of position  or bargaining power  between the applicant and the ninth to fifteenth respondents  It was also not suggested that the applicant was in a position of special vulnerability  Although it was pleaded that those respondents had been in business with the applicant  it was not suggested that that fact alone gave rise to a fiduciary relationship  Nor was it suggested that the conduct of those respondents amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty  Although it was pleaded that the respondents had extensive knowledge of the business from their involvement in it  it was not suggested that they misused that information when they facilitated the transfer of the business from the first to fifth respondents to the sixth to eighth respondents
