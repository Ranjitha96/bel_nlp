supra   at   to     FCR at   to   per Black CJ  French and Selway JJ  But such is not the present case  The alternative manner in which the Appellants seek to advance their first Ground of Appeal is to allege a denial of   procedural fairness   on the part of the Tribunal by reference to the   weight   given by the Tribunal to the claims previously advanced by the mother  The Tribunal considered the claims made by the Applicants  mother in her earlier unsuccessful application for a protection visa and relevantly concluded as follows      The Tribunal is satisfied that the Applicants  father is competent to speak on behalf of the Applicants  The Tribunal accepts that the Applicants  mother was happy to leave this role to her husband and that she did not wish to speak on behalf of her children  The Tribunal draws no negative inferences from her stated unwillingness to speak at the RRT hearing        The Tribunal does  however  have regard to the comments she gave in response to its concerns about the difference between the claims she raised on behalf of the Applicants  family in   and the claims now being raised by her husband on behalf of the present Applicants  It is fair to observe that the   coup had not occurred at that stage  so that is one factual element that the Applicants  mother could not logically have been in a position to discuss or even reasonably predict  but that does not satisfactorily explain why the Applicants  mother claimed that her family was being harassed by Speight supporters over all those years  whereas her husband later claimed that they were being harassed by the forces that were actually trying to break up the Speight putsch         The Tribunal gives weight to the fact that the claims lodged by the Applicants  mother  and also evidently subscribed to at the time by the Applicants  father  according to what he said to the presently constituted Tribunal in oral evidence and in writing  were denounced by both of the Applicants  parents  at the RRT hearing  and by the Applicants  father in writing later on  as false claims  citedOdhiambo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii

according to the Australian authorities  want of logic is not synonymous with error of law  So long as there is some basis for an inference   in other words  the particular inference is reasonably open   even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning  there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place     Findings which are

 FCR    Black CJ  von Doussa and Carr JJ there observed          although want of logic in drawing an inference will not of itself constitute error of law  it may sound a warning note to put one on inquiry whether there was indeed any basis for the inference drawn  Likewise  want of logic might in some cases also sound a warning note to put one on inquiry whether there was only a purported  and not a real  exercise of the functions entrusted to the decision maker     But where different conclusions are reasonably open on the facts  it is the Tribunal that is entrusted with the task of making those findings of fact which it considers appropriate  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu   HCA       CLR    Gummow J there observed          where the criterion of which the

prescribed by O   e g  SZJXW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    Notwithstanding the position the Respondent Minister ultimately adopted  namely that no order was sought  his concern as initially expressed should prevail  There should be no uncertainty that the resolution of the present Appeal binds the Appellants  Although an order should not necessarily be made simply   to avoid doubt   there should be no uncertainty as to the conclusiveness of a decision of this Court  An order should thus be made appointing the father as the Appellants  tutor  Compliance with the procedural requirements imposed by O   before such an order may be made is dispensed with pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   Insistence upon compliance with those   formal steps   in circumstances

denial of   Procedural Fairness   initially by reference to a failure on the part of the Tribunal to carry out its functions in an   Inquisitorial Manner    This failure is said to emerge from the

the weight it gave to the claims of the Applicant s mother in her application for a protection visa in   notwithstanding an honest explanation of these claims by both of the Applicant s parents      The Learned Federal Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Second Respondent acted in a  manifestly unreasonable  manner towards the Applicant when dealing with the Applicant s claims because of it s failure to consider the claims in accordance with the Criteria in Article  A  of the   UN Convention relating to Status of Refugee      The Learned Federal Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Second Respondent fell into jurisdictional error in failing to request more information regarding the applicants  father s victimisation for his political affiliations and activities in the SDL letter from the SDL official itself     The Notice of Appeal was signed by the Appellants  father  purportedly as   guardian    A statement of   Contentions of Fact   Law   was

assist the father but he nevertheless wished for the Appeal to proceed  A copy of a written Outline of Submissions filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister had apparently not been previously seen by
