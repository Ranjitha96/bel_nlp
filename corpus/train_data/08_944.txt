Billy Patch and Others on behalf of the Birriliburu People v State of Western Australia   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBrown  On behalf of the Ngarla People  v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The application for a consent determination is made primarily under s  A of the Act  The parties  however  submit that it could equally be made under s    They say that the agreement they have reached relates both to  an area     included in the area covered by the application   s  A b  and  part of the proceedings   s  a ii  s    In this connection reference is made to Brown  On behalf of the Ngarla People  v State of Western Australia   FCA   at     The parties note that following the repeal of s  d  the Court no longer has first to consider whether an order should be made under s  A rather than under s    They submit  however  that where it is possible for an order to be made under both sections it is preferable to use s  A  This is because the balance of the application is deemed to have been amended to remove the area covered by the proposed determination  s  B  and is exempt from the reapplication of the registration test  s  A A   The application would remain registered following the amendment and the Registrar would be obliged to amend the Register of Native Title Claims even though the registration test has not been applied  s  a   In this connection the Court was referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Act    Cth  at     If an order can be made under section  A  the order should be made under that provision rather than section    This is because an order under section  A will give rise to other measures which will assist in promoting expeditious resolution of claims  including automatic amendment of the claim and exemption from the registration test being reapplied to the amended claim   I accept that it is preferable for the order proposed in these circumstances to be made under s  A rather than under s     In their joint submission the State and the applicants have identified a number of formal requirements in s  A  each of which they say has been satisfied  The requirements and the basis upon which it is said they have been satisfied are as follows       The period specified in the notice given under s   of the Act has ended  s  A b      The notification day referred to in ss   and  c  of the Act ended on   July         There is an agreement for a proposed determination of native title in relation to an area included in that covered by the application  s  A b      The terms of the agreement are reflected in the consent minute       All necessary persons comprising the applicant  the State and other parties to the proceeding whose interest is relevant to the determination area are parties to the agreement     The applicant and the State are the only parties to the proceeding  Both are parties to the agreement       The terms of the proposed determination are in writing and signed by  or on behalf of  each of the parties  s  A d       The minute of the proposed determination is in writing and is signed on behalf of the State and the applicants       The Registrar of the Federal Court has given notice to other parties to the proceeding that the proposed determination has been filed with the Court  s  A      The terms of the proposed determination have been filed with the Court  The only parties to the proceeding are also the parties to the determination  There is therefore no need for notification under s  A
