Young v ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Dataline net au Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlHer Honour also referred to the fact that the director was to be a witness for the company and that there were difficulties in his position as a witness and in presenting evidence and making submissions  her Honour referred to Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Dataline net au Pty Ltd   FCA   at      That difficulty does not exist in the present case because counsel will lead the evidence to be given by Mr Young  There is  however  some residual difficulty in the preparation and filing of affidavits to which I referred earlier  The case is also distinguishable on the same or a similar basis  In summary  I do not find any reason in the authorities to which I was referred and have discussed above to dissuade me from the view that leave should be granted distinguishedChecked Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOrder   r   of the Federal Court Rules provides      Except as provided

   I will return to these authorities below  In Checked Out   Emmett J granted leave to the applicant to carry on the proceeding without a solicitor for the purpose of resisting certain motions for summary dismissal  and to be represented on the hearing of those motions by a named individual who was not a solicitor  However  his Honour declined to grant general leave for the company to carry on the proceeding without a solicitor  noting the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved as one reason militating against the grant of leave  The case is distinguishable on the same or a similar basis distinguishedCytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd   FCA  Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules provides      Except as provided by or under any Act  a corporation may not

Finally  in Cytel Bennett J refused an application for leave under O   r    The applicant company sought leave to be represented by its sole director  Her Honour said that it was clear from the matters put by the director in submissions and the material that he had sent to her Honour s chambers  that he had no understanding of court procedure or of evidence  Her Honour was firmly of the view that if the director were to represent the applicant  the time taken to deal with evidence and submissions would be greatly extended distinguishedSilkearl Pty Ltd v Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd   FCA

Ltd v Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd   FCA     Silkearl   and Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd   FCA     Cytel    I will return to these authorities below  In Silkearl   Allsop J  when a judge of this Court  refused an application for leave under O   r    The individual who wished to represent the applicant company was  with his wife  a director of the company  The case involved complex factual and legal issues  His Honour referred to the emotive language used by the individual concerned and the making of sweeping allegations of impropriety by him in correspondence with the respondent and its solicitors  I note in passing that this characteristic  which one often encounters in self represented litigants  has been noticeably absent  so far as I am aware  in the dealings that Mr Young has had with ICM and its solicitors  In his case  the problem has not been one of lack of courtesy  but has been one of lack of knowledge of rules and procedures  The case is distinguishable on the same or a similar basis distinguishedTobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris  Australia  Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlOrder   r   of the

Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd   FCA     Cytel    I will return to these authorities below  In Tobacco Control   Wilcox J granted Tobacco Control Coalition Inc leave under O   r   to carry on the proceeding without a solicitor but limited to preparation for  and attendance at  the hearing of certain motions which were fixed for hearing   days after the making of the order  The order was limited in point of time to the conclusion of the hearing of those motions  His Honour observed  at   that if the matter went to a hearing on the merits it would involve extensive evidence and complex questions of law  and that it would be  most inappropriate for such an action to be litigated without the services of a solicitor   The present case will involve complex questions of law  Most of the evidence will be documentary  although apparently there will be some evidence as to one or two contested conversations  Tobacco Control is  nonetheless  distinguishable by reason of the factors listed in   above  In particular  there was in that case only one applicant the company  In the present case the proceeding will continue in so far as it is brought by Mr Young
