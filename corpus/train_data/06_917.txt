gross sum order for costs may be made after an order for costs to be taxed  was adopted by Branson J in Brookfield v Davey Products Pty Ltd   FCA    In that matter  the costs order had expressly stated that the entitlement was to pay the  costs to be taxed   Her Honour considered that there was power under s   to vary the costs order so made by specifying a gross sum for costs   I observe that  on   December   when this issue was raised  Mr Dunstan did not contend that there was no power to do so citedDunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  No     FCA    the main costs judgment  delivered at the same time as this judgment  I referred at     to certain of the principles relevant to deciding whether to make a gross sum order for costs  I will not repeat them   The course of the taxation of costs thus far in these matters indicates that the process of taxing costs to date in these matters has been prolonged and expensive  Mr Dunstan contends that that is the defendants  fault  and so should not be in the particular circumstances a reason to fix a gross sum for costs   The bills of costs lodged on   February   totalled     and     respectively  An accompanying memorandum indicated that  as the defendant in each matter was represented by the same solicitor and as each matter was conducted simultaneously  many item costs had been apportioned to each bill of costs  Mr Dunstan by letter of   March   raised a number of objections to those bills of costs  The defendants indicated that  apart from the possibility that certain claimed costs relating to discovery ought not to have been included  they disagreed with Mr Dunstan s objections  They were nevertheless prepared to have the items objected to removed from the bills of costs  That led to the bills of costs being reduced by   to     and by   to      The disputed  and conceded  items were identified citedDunstan v Seymour   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   May   directions were given for the taxing process  It was to commence on   September    On   September   Mr Dunstan applied by motion to set aside the costs orders in each matter  On   September   those motions were each dismissed with costs  Dunstan v Seymour   FCA    In the meantime  the taxations were rescheduled to commence on   October     There have then been seven attendances between   October   and   November   totalling     hours for the taxing of costs  There has been no progress since that date  In that time  only five of   pages of the bill of costs in one matter   have been taxed  That covers   of   items  The taxation of the other bill of costs   has not yet started  Mr Dunstan s circumstances have restricted the sessions to no more than two hours  and it has been difficult to arrange his availability  Some schedule sessions have not taken place  though events beyond Mr Dunstan s control   I do not regard that material as supporting Mr Dunstan s claim that responsibility for the slow progress of the taxation of costs rests with the defendants  It shows that the defendants  for the purposes of the taxation  were prepared to concede Mr Dunstan s first round of objections  They did so  on the evidence  to progress the taxation  They did not thereby acknowledge that those items should not have been claimed  An issue arose as to the extent to which Mr Dunstan should have access to material the subject of legal professional privilege for the purposes of the taxation  Another issue arose as to the extent to which time spent on research should be allowed on taxation  They are common issues which arise  They do not indicate the defendants consciously claimed work done which was not done  or claimed that time was spent which was not spent  The taxing officer could adjudicate on the individual items of work claimed  Indeed  the material referred to tends to indicate that Mr Dunstan  rather than the defendants  has approached the taxation of costs in an obstructive way by disputing each item of work claimed  even to the extent of saying that the work was not done
