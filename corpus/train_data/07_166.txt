SZJCM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toHall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Federal Magistrate s decision of   October   was an interlocutory decision  compare Hall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR   at   per Taylor J  Accordingly  pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  the applicant requires leave to appeal before he can proceed with his appeal  It would appear that this application is made out of time  although in the circumstances of the case nothing ultimately turns on this  This is because  for the reasons stated below  I would not grant leave to appeal in any event referred toD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   Whether or not leave to appeal should be granted or refused depends on two matters  They are    whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court  and   whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  supposing the decision to be wrong  see D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   Anor     FCR   at     per Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ  For present purposes  I assume that this second question would be answered in the applicant s favour in view of the claims that he has made  Thus  this application turns on the question  whether the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attended by such doubt that it warrants reconsideration on appeal   The applicant filed an affidavit in support of his application  which stated that he was unrepresented  not knowledgeable in legal matters  and had previously made unsuccessful attempts to lodge his appeal  In this affidavit  he asserted that he had an arguable case for a protection visa since he was a member of  the Akali Dal National Party  which is the representative of the Sikh faith in the Indian Punjab  and repeated matters going to the merits of his claim  In written submission filed in support of his application  the applicant discussed his membership of the Akali Dal and the conditions for Sikhs in India  referring especially to events between   and    He complained that the Tribunal relied wholly on information prepared by the Indian authorities  and on information that was not up to date  He submitted that the Tribunal had not taken his fear into consideration and had not addressed  the four key elements to be a refugee   He reiterated his claim to be a refugee and said that the Tribunal wrongly dismissed his application   The draft notice of appeal apparently raised the following grounds    the Federal Magistrate failed to appreciate the legal errors made by the Tribunal    his fears of persecution were not taken into consideration  and   the authorities failed to investigate the mass killings of Sikh youths  The applicant did not add greatly to these matters at the hearing  although he reiterated his contentions about conditions in India that affected persons of the Sikh faith
