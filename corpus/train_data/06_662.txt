federal ct  html   On   October   the applicant lodged his current application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court to review the delegate s decision and that application was dismissed on   February        The Magistrate said that the applicant s application challenges the delegate s decision and she said it was doomed to fail because  among other things  the decision of the delegate was subsumed in the decision of the Tribunal     I do not think that the applicant s proposed appeal enjoys any reasonable prospect of success  This case is similar to the case which came

Court found that the decision of the Tribunal was in no way affected by jurisdictional error  The delegate s decision is now of no significance having regard to the fact that it was reviewed by the
