FCA  html  It is necessary  because of the jurisdictional issue raised by the Commission  to set out the questions of law and the grounds of appeal contained in Mr Masliczek s notice of appeal  They are           QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED IN THE APPEAL         Was the Tribunal wrong in law in the methodology it adopted to ascertain whether the applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  accepted as a war related disease          Was the Tribunal wrong in law by applying incorrectly or not at all sections         and    A of the Veterans  Entitlements Act    Cth  and the decision of Deledio v Repatriation Commission            This is a reference to the decision of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio   FCA         FCR   in which  at     the Court explained a four step process to be followed by the Tribunal in determining whether the applicant has established a link between his or her operational service and a medical condition which is relied on to support the payment of a pension               Was the Tribunal wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  by reference to the statements of principle alone without regard to the expert clinical medical evidence of the psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant              Was the Tribunal wrong in law in failing to apply or to apply correctly all relevant statements of principle for PTSD              Was the Tribunal wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicant s claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear              Was the Tribunal wrong in law by applying Mines v Repatriation Commission which contradicted the High Court Decisions of Bushell v Repatriation Commission  Byrnes v Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Commission v O Brian  and the full Federal Court Decisions of Repatriation Commission v Whetton and Deledio and Repatriation Commission               Was the Tribunal wrong in law by failing to provide adequate and sufficient reasons for its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based         GROUNDS OF APPEAL         The Tribunal was wrong in law in the methodology it adopted in ascertaining whether the Applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of PTSD as a war related disease                  The Tribunal was required to determine first whether the applicant was suffering from PTSD before proceeding to determine if the disease was war service related         The Tribunal conflated the two questions depriving the Applicant the benefit of the doubt in ascertaining whether he suffered a stressful event during his service         The test adopted by the Tribunal throughout was that of the balance of probabilities whereas because of his operational service some of the circumstances surrounding the stressful events had to be given the more generous test of a reasonable hypothesis                  The Tribunal was wrong in law in the application of  or in the failure to apply sections           and  A of the Veterans  Entitlements Act and the decision of Deledio v Repatriation Commission                   These sections and the decision had application to determine the basis of a reasonable hypothesis whether the applicant had experienced a stressful event  The Tribunal erred in law in failing to apply the sections or the authority         The Tribunal was required by law only to determine that the injuries claimed were not war caused if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were no sufficient grounds for making such a claim  s   to do so it had to raise the test of a reasonable hypothesis based on all the material before it  s    This the Tribunal failed to do         The Tribunal was wrong in law in requiring the applicant to provide objective evidence that he had encountered the bodies of the children whereas the Tribunal was required to determine whether there was a reasonable hypothesis pointed out by the material that he had encountered the bodies  The Tribunal  although rejecting the event as being neither truthful nor accurate  did not challenge it pursuant to the requirements of s     namely disprove it beyond reasonable doubt         The Tribunal failed to apply s   to the circumstances of the applicant s case         It was insufficient for the Tribunal to note that the circumstances of mortar and rocket fire did not accord with official records and that the events were not mentioned to two psychiatrists and to conclude that these were not traumatic events experienced by the applicant  It was not appropriate for the Tribunal to prefer the accuracy to the old official records of the events in relation to the shooting event  The Tribunal was required to ascertain whether the Applicant had been exposed or confronted with a traumatic event regardless of the position of the body or whether or not he had entered the tent         The Tribunal appears to confuse between what constituted a traumatic event and whether or not the event took place  The Tribunal conflates these two questions to the detriment of the applicant                  The Tribunal was wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder by reference to the statements of principle rather than the clinical evidence of psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant                  Post traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed by both the psychiatrists commissioned by the Applicant  Dr Cole and Dr Holwill  and the Repatriation Commission psychiatrists  Dr Walton and Dr Gelb   The Tribunal failed to take into consideration these reports and the evidence given                  The Tribunal was wrong in law in the application of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder                  The Tribunal was required to determine the most favourable of the Statements of principle instead it used the more onerous         The Tribunal was wrong in law in the standard of proof it adopted in determining whether the applicant met the requirements of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder                  The Tribunal was wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicants claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand and in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear when there was a loss of hearing to the right side                  The Tribunal failed to provide clear reasons for rejection of osteoarthritis of the fingers of the right hand in which it needed to explain why  pursuant to s   of the Act   it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not war caused               The appellant did not press this ground insofar as it dealt with hearing loss           This ground was not pressed          The Tribunal was wrong in law in failing to provide sufficient and adequate reasons for its decision                  The Tribunal was required to do so pursuant to section  B  of the Administrative Appeals Act    Once the Tribunal had concluded that the traumatic events described by Mr Masliczek had not occurred and that he was not suffering from PTSD there was no occasion for the Tribunal to embark on the four step process which is outlined Deledio in order to determine whether a non existent medical condition could be linked to operational service   Mr Masliczek submitted that it was not open to the Tribunal  having regard to the specialist medical evidence  to find that he did not suffer from PTSD  This submission must be rejected  Only one psychiatrist gave oral evidence  That was Dr Walton  Dr Walton made a diagnosis of PTSD on the basis of the bodies  event  the shooting event and the firing event as described by Mr Masliczek  He did not consider that the taxi event or the casualty event were stressful in the necessary sense  Drs Holwill  Cole and Gelb  whose reports were before the Tribunal  also diagnosed PTSD principally on the basis of the bodies  event  As the Tribunal found  this event did not occur  The fifth doctor  Dr Kenny  did not diagnose PTSD  The evidence did not  therefore  compel a finding that Mr Masliczek suffered from PTSD   During oral argument counsel for Mr Masliczek sought to argue that the Tribunal had erred in the manner in which it dealt with the general anxiety and the depressive disorders which it found  in paragraph   that Mr Masliczek suffered  He argued that the Tribunal s reasons suggested that these conditions had been found not to be service related because Mr Masliczek had fallen at the third of the Deledio steps  he had not experienced a category  A or a category  B stressor as defined in Statements of Principles Nos   of   and   of    It was argued that  in accordance with the Full Court s decision in Repatriation Commission v Keeley   FCA         FCR   at       the Tribunal was required to consider whether earlier versions of these instruments  which were in force at the time at which the primary decision on Mr Masliczek s claim was made  might  if applied  have led to a favourable decision  These earlier versions did not contain a requirement that an applicant must have experienced defined stressors during service  The Tribunal had not considered the earlier versions   Grounds     deals with Mr Masliczek s claim that the osteoarthrosis of the fingers from which he suffers was service related  The Tribunal held that Mr Masliczek did  not satisfy the first step  which was identified in Deledio    In Deledio the Full Court explained the first step as follows  at          The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person  No question of fact finding arises at this stage  If no such hypothesis arises  the application must fail   The Tribunal noted that Mr Masliczek had attributed his painful fingers to injuries sustained while playing volleyball in Vietnam  It noted the reports of medical examinations conducted shortly after he was discharged from the Army in    Those reports did not detect any injuries to his hand  The Tribunal also considered Mr Masliczek s evidence  The Tribunal determined that  the material does not point to a hypothesis connecting the condition with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by him   This conclusion was open to the Tribunal  None of the material pointed to the necessary connecting hypothesis   Ground     as developed in argument  directed attention to the way in which the Tribunal had explained  or failed to explain  its reasons relating to Mr Masliczek s general anxiety and depressive disorders and his osteoarthrosis   Paragraph   of the Tribunal s reasons has already been examined above at   to    The Tribunal has adopted some shorthand expressions such as  the first step from Deledio    Nonetheless its reasoning processes  as I have earlier summarised them  are sufficiently clear  in my opinion  to satisfy its obligations under s  B  of the AAT Act    The appeal should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding thirty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY

questions of law  now made over many years  for the Court to strike out purported appeals which do not identify questions of law  I would  nonetheless  be prepared  reluctantly  to attempt to frame questions of law in the present case if I considered that the interests of justice so required  I have concluded that they do not because I do not consider that the Tribunal has made any of the errors attributed to it by Mr Masliczek   Grounds             and     deal with the Mr Masliczek s claim insofar as it relies on a diagnosis of PTSD  As already noted the Tribunal found  as a matter of fact  that the traumatic events which Mr Masliczek claimed had given rise to PTSD  either had not occurred or had not occurred in the manner described by him and that they did not give rise to a response of

it dealt with the general anxiety and the depressive disorders which it found  in paragraph   that Mr Masliczek suffered  He argued that the Tribunal s reasons suggested that these conditions had been found not to be service related because Mr Masliczek had fallen at the third of the Deledio steps  he had not experienced a category  A or a category  B stressor as defined in Statements of Principles Nos   of   and   of    It was argued that  in accordance with the Full Court s decision in Repatriation Commission v Keeley   FCA         FCR   at       the Tribunal was required to consider whether earlier versions of these instruments  which were in force at the time at which the primary decision on Mr Masliczek s claim was made  might  if applied  have led to a favourable decision  These earlier versions did not contain a requirement that an applicant must have experienced defined stressors during service  The Tribunal had not considered the earlier versions citedBenjamin v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Tribunal does not explain why it was that it embarked on a consideration of the general anxiety and depressive disorders from which it found Mr Masliczek to suffer  Counsel for Mr Masliczek  who also appeared for him before the Tribunal  was unable to advise the Court as to whether the Tribunal had been urged to find that Mr Masliczek suffered from these conditions or whether the Tribunal was referred to the Statements of Principles which deal with the conditions  It may be that the Tribunal felt bound to deal with these additional conditions  because of the ruling of the Full Court in Benjamin v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD   at   that the Tribunal is required to consider issues raised by the material and evidence before it  even if an applicant does not articulate a case which is or may be supported by that evidence   The difficulty which confronts Mr Masliczek is that there is no question of law or ground of appeal which raises any issue arising from the Tribunal s treatment of the psychiatric conditions identified in paragraph    No application to amend was made  Had it been it was not bound to succeed because counsel for the Commission indicated that  had such issues been raised  it was likely that it would have filed a notice of contention
