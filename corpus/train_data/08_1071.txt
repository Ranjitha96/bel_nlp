Australian Securities   Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd  in liq   No     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR   Western Retirement Village Management Pty Ltd  WRVM  was formerly the registered proprietor of  the Mews  situated at Lot     Railway Parade  Upper Swan  Western Australia  being the whole of the land in Certificate of Title Vol   Folio    the Land   The Land was the subject of an unregistered investment scheme referred to as  the Mews Village  or  the Mews Retirement Village Scheme   the Scheme  which is in the process of being wound up  Messrs Brian McMaster and Mark Mentha of KordaMentha were appointed receivers of the Scheme to oversee its winding up and were appointed as liquidators of WRVM upon the winding up of WRVM  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR     The Scheme and its participants were described by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR   at   to   in the following terms         By way of background  the promoters of the  Scheme  described their purpose as being to establish and operate a top quality resort style retirement village with facilities for respite care  The idea was to develop and sell self contained and fully serviced units and townhouses to people over the age of   years  The village was to be located on land purchased from another company associated with the promoters  Investors would put up the deposit with the balance to be raised by loans from the vendor  A management company controlled by the promoters would operate the village  After payment of a management fee  the profit would go to the investors  The key attraction to investors was the expectation that they would be entitled to deduct from their assessable income not only the amount of their investment but also their proportionate share of the loan taken to pay the balance of the purchase price            The Mews Village was to be established on  the Land   The  L and was registered in the name of  WRVM   By a contract dated   April   WRVM agreed to sell the  L and to the fourth defendant  The Mews Village Nominees Pty Limited  for    Other agreements to which Mews Village Nominees is a party show that it entered into the contract as  bare nominee  for a group of investors described as  Investor Partners   The contract of sale provided for the payment of a deposit of   with the balance to be paid by a loan from the vendor secured by a mortgage over the  L and  The purchase price was not the exchange value of the  L and  The price far exceeded that value  This came about because under the contract the vendor was required to construct the village  The building work was to take place in two stages over several years  Most of the deposit was raised from the investors who were grouped into several partnerships  The balance was provided by the vendor under a non recourse loan agreement  The agreement required the loan to be repaid out of the fees payable by residents of the village  In the event of default the vendor could only look to the  L and for payment            I indicated that the investors were grouped into several partnerships  The principal partnership is styled The Mews Village Partnership and has    Investor Partners   It was established by a partnership agreement dated   April    The parties to this agreement appear to be the Investor Partners  although no provision is made for them to execute the agreement  and two companies associated with the promoters  Mews Retirement Nominees Pty Ltd and the first defendant  GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd  The partnership business is described as  the development and operation of retirement village facilities at  the Land   GDK was appointed to manage the partnership s business  Mews Retirement Nominees was appointed to hold the partnership property as  bare trustee for the partnership                 The Mews Retirement Village was to be managed by WRVM  To this end a Marketing Management and Profit Share Agreement was entered into between Mews Village Nominees  the purchaser of the  Land  and WRVM  Only an unsigned copy of the agreement is in evidence  The copy does not indicate clearly the identity of the contracting parties  The front page suggests that the agreement is between WRVM and The Mews Retirement Nominees Pty Ltd which  it will be remembered  is the  bare nominee  of The Mews Village Partnership  A schedule records that the agreement is between WRVM and the Mews Retirement Village Nominees Pty Ltd  Notwithstanding those references  the body of the agreement shows that the agreement was between WRVM and Mews Village Nominees  The sealing clause is the latter company s name  A recital describes it as the purchaser of the  Land   Moving on  the only substantive provision of the agreement to which reference should be made is the management fee which is set at   per cent of the profit derived by the village plus a commission of   per cent of the fees received from residents  This suggests that not much was to go to the investors  although one should not lose sight of the substantial tax advantage they derived from entering into the scheme            Notwithstanding the complex series of agreements  and the subscription by investors of capital in the order of   million  The Mews Retirement Village did not get off the ground  All that has happened is that The Mews Retirement Nominees paid the purchase price for the  Land  using the investors  capital and loan funds obtained from the vendor  Despite receiving the purchase price  WRVM has not transferred the  L and to the purchaser   it  remains registered as the proprietor of the  L and  Nor has WRVM carried out the building works which by the contract of sale it had promised to do  I assume it did not have the funds to undertake the work  There has been no accounting to investors for any of the money they contributed  despite many requests for information  The investors have simply been left in the dark            There is no hope of the development going ahead  at least while it remains in the hands of its present controllers  GDK has been wound up  There is an unresolved dispute over the control of Mews Village Nominees      To be blunt  things are in a mess and it will take a good deal of time and great expense to sort them out   What Finkelstein J referred to as a  mess  is made more complicated by a series of transactions that is an immediate cause of the present proceedings  At the risk of undue abbreviation  with consequent inaccuracy  that series of transactions was made by interests associated with a principal of WRVM  Mr Michael Brereton  and interests associated with one Mr Salvo  an investor in the Scheme both as an individual and through a number of related entities   Whether because the Scheme was not being implemented  or for some other reason  and it may not matter which  the Brereton interests agreed that the Salvo interests would advance money to WRVM  it is said secured against the Land  for the purpose of developing the Land in a manner contrary to that intended under the Scheme  Again at the risk of undue abbreviation  these proceedings are intended to decide whether these transactions created debts of WRVM that are secured by the Land   On   March   WRVM filed an interlocutory process  AVS Property Pty Ltd  ACN        AVS  and Rental Fleets Australia Proprietary Limited  RFA  members of the First Delta Group of Companies and entities associated with Mr Salvo  are the respondents  AVS and RFA were formerly the holders of a second ranking registered mortgage over the Land  the AVS mortgage  and are presently the holders of a registered charge over the assets of WRVM  the AVS charge   National Australia Bank Limited  NAB  was the holder of the first registered mortgage over the Land   Pursuant to a contract of sale dated   December   the Land was sold  The sale proceeded pursuant to orders made by Finkelstein J on   November   and   December    In substance  the orders required the mortgagees  NAB  AVS and RFA  to produce discharges of their respective mortgages so that the sale of the Land could proceed  The discharges occurred on the basis that NAB was paid the amount that it claimed was secured by its mortgage and a sum of approximately   was set aside in a separate bank account to cover certain contingencies  AVS and RFA were not paid out  Their discharges were ordered to be produced on the basis that there would be proceedings for the taking of accounts of what is secured by the AVS mortgage and the AVS charge and that  to assist that taking of accounts  interlocutory proceedings of the kind now under consideration would be instituted   It is common ground that RFA does not have any claim against WRVM which is secured by either the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge  Accordingly  there is no need for an account to be taken in relation to what amount  if any  WRVM owes RFA   The position of AVS is quite different  It contends that it has a claim against WRVM and that the amount claimed is secured by both the AVS mortgage and the AVS charge  The total amount claimed  about   million  exceeds the balance of the proceeds of sale of the Land after payment to NAB and of GST  That balance is about   million   Against that statement of general position  it is necessary to set out the principal facts  Much of what is set out constitutes facts as found by Finkelstein J  No party in the present proceeding disputed those findings  Nor did any party in the present proceeding dispute the other facts set out below  though there was a lively dispute about the legal consequences that follow from those findings   On   March   WRVM contracted to purchase the Land for     million  It became the registered proprietor of the Land on   July    Mr Michael Brereton was the sole director of WRVM   Approximately one month later  on   April   WRVM entered into a contract to sell the Land to The Mews Village Nominees Pty Ltd  Mews  for    the Mews Sale Contract   On   November   Finkelstein J concluded  as a finding of fact  that although WRVM remained the registered proprietor of the Land  it held the Land as bare trustee for Mews  see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR   at   to    In fact  it was not until   December   when the Land was sold pursuant to the orders of Finkelstein J  that WRVM ceased to be the registered proprietor of the Land   The Mews Sale Contract contained Special Conditions  By cl     of the Special Conditions  WRVM agreed that  Stage   would be constructed by WRVM in an expeditious manner  In general terms  WRVM was obliged to construct a number of three bedroom duplex and freestanding units  four bedroom duplex and freestanding units  and serviced apartments  including the necessary infrastructure   Nothing of significance transpired between   and September    That was the problem  Significantly  the Land was not developed in accordance with the terms of the Mews Sale Contract   On   November   for the reasons dated   November   Finkelstein J ordered the Scheme to be wound up  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd     ALR    By paragraph   of those orders  his Honour directed the receivers of the Scheme to call for any person claiming any right  title or interest in Land to prove his or her claim by affidavit to be served by   December    AVS responded to that direction  The substance of its response was relied upon by WRVM as providing a factual foundation for an estoppel claim in the event that I found each of the components as owing by WRVM to AVS and secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge  In general terms  WRVM submitted that even if the debts were secured  the liquidators and receivers of WRVM had priority because of their reliance on representations made by  or attributable to  AVS   AVS s response to the call for proofs was provided by way of affidavit sworn by Mario Salvo on   December    Paragraph   confirmed that it was an  affidavit in support of the claims made by RFA  AVS and Statewide     of their interests in the Land   Mr Salvo described himself as the director of RFA and the general manager of AVS  He went on to say that the sole director and secretary of AVS was a Mr Andrew Vito Salvo  but that nonetheless he was authorised to make the affidavit on behalf of RFA  Statewide and AVS  Significantly  the affidavit explained the background to and circumstances surrounding the events in and after early    Mr Salvo deposed to the fact that in or about early   he became concerned for  his investment   In the context   his investment  could only refer to RFA s investment in the Scheme   Strictly speaking  however  the documents record investment in the Scheme by Mario Salvo as an individual and by some of his related entities including DFX and CLA Holdings   As a result of these concerns  Mr Salvo held discussions with Mr Brereton regarding whether RFA might assign its rights in the Scheme to WRVM for    A draft agreement was prepared  signed by WRVM but not signed by RFA  Salvo said that he chose not to sign the agreement for the sale of RFA s interests because he was not entirely sure he wanted RFA to assign its rights as an investor  In substance  he decided to hold the signed sale agreement and see how things in relation to the Land developed   As at May   the Land was subject to the Westpac mortgage  The Westpac facility had in fact expired on   October   and penalty interest was being charged on an outstanding loan of     million  At this time two events crystallised  Mr Salvo spoke to Mr Brereton and was told by him that he was going to pay out the investors and intended winding up the Scheme  At the same time  Mr Salvo said he believed the Land had development potential with his property development expertise and capital base which provided him with an opportunity to recoup RFA s investment and make a profit from the development of the Land   On   December   Finkelstein J made orders that the court appointed receivers do all things necessary to progress and complete the sale of the Land in accordance with the Sale Agreement between WRVM and Clarendon Residential Group Pty Ltd  The sale of the Land was at arm s length  On   February   Goldberg J made orders authorising the receivers to commence proceedings to prevent payment out of the proceeds of sale of the Land to AVS and RFA  On   March   Finkelstein J noted the undertaking of WRVM to commence this interlocutory process and  on that undertaking  ordered the joinder of NAB to those proceedings  and effectively the discharge of the relevant mortgages so that completion of the sale of the Land could proceed  Completion of the sale took place on   March    On completion  the NAB mortgage was discharged  The entitlement of AVS to the balance of the sale proceeds is the issue to be resolved in these proceedings   Finally  on   March   AVS s solicitors wrote to WRVM s solicitors  AVS asserted that the amount then due by WRVM to AVS under the AVS Facility Agreement was      WRVM submitted this was the first time that the AVS claim had included the five components identified earlier  see    Although the profit share and management fee were said to be secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge  the precise amounts owing were said to be incalculable   On   March   WRVM as guarantor paid to NAB the sum of     thereby discharging Salrest s liability to NAB followedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich   NSWSC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The first issue is whether each of the general ledgers and journal entries identified earlier  see   above  is a book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of the Corporations Act   They clearly are  see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich   NSWSC         ALR   at      The documents  on their face  purport to be documents kept by a body corporate  They are printouts of electronic records which identify the relevant body corporate by name  the nature of the document by name and  in many cases  the time and date on which the printout was printed  It was not submitted by WRVM  and there are no bases for contending  that the presumption arising under s   has been rebutted  On the contrary  The evidence of the contents of the documents together with the unchallenged evidence of Mr Wunsch that the documents were sourced from the relevant body corporate reinforces the conclusion that each document is a book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of the Corporations Act    The second issue is what facts those documents record  As noted earlier  see     so far as is presently relevant  the documents record     a loan by NAB to Salvern of   million     a loan by Salvern to AVS of     with the notation  AVS Loan to  WRVM     that     of the Deacons bill of     was on charged to AVS     a loan by AVS to WRVM of three amounts        with the notation  Re Salvern Loan       being payment of legal fees  and        a credit by AVS to WRVM of     with the notation  Tranche   La    WRVM did not challenge the admissibility of these records or the facts recorded in them  Moreover  WRVM did not seek to cross examine Mr Wunsch who identified the documents and the source of them  In the circumstances  the only conclusion to be drawn from those financial records is that AVS did advance the Tranche   Loan to WRVM under the AVS Facility Agreement  In this context  AVS also referred to cl   of the AVS Facility Agreement  It provided that AVS  described as the Financier  was entitled to maintain records specifying the payments made by AVS for the account of WRVM  any payments made by WRVM for the account of AVS under  inter alia   the AVS Facility Agreement and the interest  fees  charges  costs and expenses payable and that those records would  as against AVS  constitute conclusive evidence  in the absence of manifest error  of the matters set out in them  The documentation described earlier records the advance of the Tranche   Loan by AVS to WRVM  Whether other amounts were paid or incurred in relation to the Tranche   Loan was not disclosed  Those issues  if relevant  would be considered at the time of the taking of any account followedASIC v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd  in liq   No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Finkelstein J considered and rejected the AVS profit share claim in his reasons for judgment in ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd  in liq   No     FCA   at         Although the claim at that time was merely foreshadowed rather than actual  it turns out the actual claim is on precisely the same basis and in precisely the same terms as the foreshadowed claim rejected by Finkelstein J  While it is true that his Honour s comments on the profit share issue are non binding dicta  I nevertheless consider them to be clearly correct and adopt them  Although I do not propose to repeat all of his Honour s reasons here  a simple restatement of the fundamental premise is that  in the absence of any definition of  profit  in the agreement  there is no reasonable  or even rational  implied definition or formula for profit under which it could be said that a profit was made   Again  any implied definition must be reasonable and equitable  The definition must be in keeping with the purpose and other provisions of the agreement  Here  the purpose of the Development Agreement was the development of the Land  Again  cl   states that AVS is entitled to   of the profits from the  development of the land   On that basis  I consider that a reasonable and equitable definition of profit could only be one involving profit resulting from improvements made to the land  whether by construction of a housing development or otherwise   Because no development was undertaken  there can be no profit   I should emphasise one other point made by Finkelstein J  which goes to answer a claim that profit that should be defined more broadly  a claim which I reject  to include profit derived from appreciation of the Land s value over the years due to a general rise in the real estate market  As noted by his Honour  the problem with this argument is that because WRVM was only the bare legal owner of the Land  and not the beneficial owner  it is not entitled to any proceeds from the sale  It goes without saying that AVS  apart from its mortgage interest  which as a secured legal interest superseded the equitable interests of the Mews investors  was neither a beneficial nor a legal owner of the Land  Neither WRVM nor AVS is entitled to the sale proceeds as an item of profit to which the joint venture agreement could attach   With respect to the remaining items claimed by AVS  development costs incurred before   May   of approximately   or   development costs incurred after   May   of     million  and a management fee of   the fact that some amounts may be owing follows from the conclusion that the Development Agreements are valid and enforceable  Whether the particular amounts claimed are supportable is another story  For example  although a project management fee of approximately   is claimed  it cannot stand  Clause   of the Development Agreement states that AVS is entitled to a project management fee  equal to   of the before tax profits of the Joint Venture  with a minimum of   plus GST   Given that I have already concluded that there was no profit  it follows that the maximum amount that could be claimed is only   ex GST  Clause   further provides that any   monthly retainer fee charged is to be offset against the management fee  which might further diminish the amount allowable as a management fee   I need not consider the accuracy of the fees and costs claims any further  however  because I conclude that those amounts are not secured by the AVS mortgage or charge  As noted earlier  at     the all moneys clause in the mortgage will not be held to secure debts of a fundamentally different character from those contemplated at the time at which the contract was entered into  Here  I consider that while the mortgage explicitly considered the two tranches of loans  the   million and   million advances  at the time of contracting in May   the mortgage did not consider the development costs and management fees  As noted earlier  cl   of the AVS Facility Agreement states that the purpose of the mortgage loan agreement was to discharge encumbrances on the Land  In effect  it was a refinancing agreement of the distressed Westpac loan  I consider that the amounts now claimed to be secured as development costs and management fees are costs related to development  not costs relating to encumbrances  and are thus of a fundamentally different character from the debts contemplated at the time of the mortgage s execution  Further  I consider that this analysis applies equally to the all moneys clause in the AVS charge discussedBahr v Nicolay  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Indefeasibility is the foundation of the Torrens system  Bahr v Nicolay  No     HCA         CLR        In Western Australia  the principle of indefeasibility of title is  give n  expression to  and at the same time  qualif ied  by  ss   and   of the TLA   Bahr at    Each section refers to the concept in the context of the registered  proprietor    Proprietor  is defined in s   of the TLA to include  in relation to freehold land  the owner  whether in possession  remainder  reversion or otherwise  of land or of a lease  mortgage or charge over land   As a result ss   and   of the TLA confer indefeasibility of title not only on the holder of the fee simple but also on the registered holder of an interest in the land including a mortgagee  The qualifications to or limits of indefeasibility for present purposes may be put to one side  It was not submitted that any exception arose for consideration   In the circumstances that then existed       WRVM was and remained the registered proprietor of the Land     NAB was a registered mortgagee with priority over the other mortgagees  AVS and RFA       NAB s mortgage and liability has been discharged     The AVS RFA mortgage had also been discharged but with the issue of WRVM s liability to AVS remaining unresolved together with the issue of whether any such liability was secured by the AVS mortgage   In ascertaining whether WRVM is indebted to AVS and  if so  whether the whole or part of that debt is secured by the AVS mortgage necessarily involves questions of fact  and no less significantly  the proper construction of the terms of the AVS mortgage itself  It is therefore necessary to turn to consider the five components of the  debt  citedBP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings     CLR   Another way of putting it is that there was an implied obligation on both parties to nominate the relevant related entities or representatives and an implied obligation on the part of AVS to generate a development proposal in return for its management and retainer fees  I consider such terms to be reasonable  equitable  obvious  and necessary within the meaning of the test for the implication of contractual terms set out in BP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings     CLR       and the subsequent cases that have adopted that test  In the absence of any development efforts by AVS  WRVM could have asserted breach of contract based on complete failure to perform  similarly  AVS could have asserted breach of contract if WRVM had failed to allocate the   per month  Accordingly  I consider that the lack of a specified development proposal did not render the agreements unenforceable   WRVM s further contention was that even if the agreements were enforceable contracts  then properly construed they were subject to a condition precedent that the Scheme would be wound up and  in particular  WRVM would be discharged from its obligations under the Mews Sale Contract  see     above  but that condition precedent had not been satisfied  That contention proceeded on an assumption that it was not possible for WRVM to enter into the Mews Sale Contract and yet at the same time contract with Mario Salvo under the Heads of Agreement  That assumption is incorrect  It may be reasonable to conclude that WRVM was not going to be in a position to complete both agreements but that does not mean that one or both of the agreements is subject to a condition precedent citedBreskvar v Wall   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Before turning to consider the five components identified earlier  see   it is necessary to restate some important principles about Torrens land and the securities registered against it  The Torrens system implemented in Western Australia by the Transfer of Land Act    WA   the TLA  is a system of  title by registration    Breskvar v Wall   HCA         CLR       and not a system of  registration of title   Registration has two consequences  it not only confers title but it also determines priority  Priority is governed by order of registration and not by date of execution citedChacmol Holdings Pty Ltd v Handberg   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  It is well

Agreement are not ambiguous  In the absence of such ambiguity  the written document stands on its own as a record of the agreement between the parties to it   The question which then arises is whether the Tranche   Loan is secured by the AVS mortgage  That requires consideration of the proper construction of the terms of the AVS mortgage itself   As noted earlier  see   the AVS mortgage secured the  Secured Money  which was defined to mean  all amounts now or at any time in the future  falling within identified categories  see cl      The categories included       a  all money now or in future owing or payable to the Mortgagee  AVS      by  WRVM  either alone or on joint or partnership account and whether as principal debtor  guarantor or indemnifier on any account         i  all costs and

Provisions such as these are not at large  Fountain v Bank of America Trust   Savings Association     BPR   at    The clause is confined in its operation   by reference to the context in which  it  appear s  and by reference to the commercial purpose for which  it was  intended to serve   Fountain at      Those matters are ascertained by having regard to the language of the clause construed in the context of the security instrument as a whole  the apparent purpose and object of the transaction and any admissible evidence as to the surrounding circumstances  Olympic Holdings Pty Ltd v Windslow Corporation Pty Ltd  in liq    WASCA   at     Consistent with that approach  an all moneys clause will not secure a debt of a fundamentally different character from the debt specifically contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract  McVeigh  in the matter of Piccolo v National Australia Bank Limited   FCA   at     As Gleeson CJ said in Fountain  at    The critical question     is whether  on the true construction of the document and in the events that have occurred  the transaction  the Tranche   Loan was  within the purview of  cll     and   of the AVS mortgage   distinguishedHadley v Hazian Proprietary Limited  Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia  unreported    July   WRVM s primary complaint was as to the identity of the contracting parties  As noted earlier  see   the preamble referred to the fact that   Mario Salvo or his nominee  defined as  MS  and WRVM and or its nominee  wish ed  to establish a joint venture for the development of  the Land     The meaning of that provision is unambiguous and certain  Mr Salvo and WRVM were the parties to establish  a joint venture for the development of the Land   However  each was given a power to nominate an alternative  If no alternative party was nominated  Mr Salvo and WRVM alone were bound to establish a joint venture  The clause unambiguously records that the parties intended to create a binding agreement which created a joint venture and then governed the relationship between them  WRVM s contention that the parties were insufficiently defined or uncertain to constitute a binding agreement is without foundation  Moreover  contrary to the submissions of WRVM  the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Hadley v Hazian Proprietary Limited  Unreported    July   does not support its contention  As the unanimous Full Court in Hadley made clear  a clause in the form of that found in the preamble to the Heads of Agreement is unambiguous and certain  What was unambiguous but uncertain was a clause which required a sale to be implemented by any one of A  B or C or some or all of them or their respective nominees  The uncertainty arose because the clause did not identify who was bound to purchase  That criticism cannot apply to the preamble  The preamble provides with certainty that Mario Salvo and WRVM wish to establish a joint venture and that each of them is entitled to nominate an alternative  Moreover  cl   of Heads of Agreement provides that each of the WRVM and  MS  is to be entitled to   of the profits of the joint venture subject to certain variations  If in the future WRVM wished to nominate an alternative or sell down part of its   interest in the joint venture then it was entitled to do so  That might never occur  And until it did  the parties and their obligations were unambiguous and certain citedHarpur v Levy     VR   Furthermore  even if the preamble s identification of the parties was uncertain or ambiguous  cl   of the Heads of Agreement clearly states that  WRVM and MS  will form the joint venture  and cl   identifies AVS as the Salvo entity that will discharge the Westpac debt  loan money to WRVM  etc  To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the recitals and the operative portion of the contract  the operative portion controls  Harpur v Levy     VR   at   and Chacmol Holdings Pty Ltd v Handberg  as administrator of Australian Risk Analysis Pty Ltd    FCAFC         ALR   at           and    The same analysis applies equally to the Development Agreements  Clause   of the Development Agreement states that  WRVM and MS have formed a joint venture  and the same is true of cl   of the Second Development Agreement citedHospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There is no general rule that parties having knowledge of a prior contract between different parties may not subsequently enter into a contract with fundamentally inconsistent terms  which is really the result of the  implied condition precedent  argument put by WRVM   The lack of any such rule is the inevitable consequence of the efficient breach theory of contract  which  although it has occasionally been criticised  remains the controlling theory of contract damages under Australian law  Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR   at      To understand both the theory and its rationale  a simple hypothetical may assist  Suppose A agrees on Day   to sell his bicycle to B for    which happens to be fair market value at the time of contract but   more than A himself paid  with delivery to take place on Day    Now suppose that on Day   C approaches A and offers to buy the bicycle for the above market price of   on the spot  maybe he happens to have an urgent need for a bicycle for which he is willing to pay a premium   It is perfectly rational in those circumstances  and completely open under the law of contract  for A to sell the bicycle to C  breach his contract with B  pay damages  and pocket the difference  if any  Assuming there is nothing special about A s bicycle and equivalent bicycles are readily available in the market  the damages for breach are likely to be only the replacement costs  i e  fair market value  of a like bicycle on Day   the date of delivery  There is of course a risk to A that the market price of bicycles will rise  Provided that the price does not rise above   by Day   however  A will make more money by breaching his contract with B and selling to C even after he pays B damages  The law encourages  or at least allows  this eventuality on the basis that everyone is better off  or at least no worse off   A makes a bigger profit  B gets a substantially identical replacement bicycle  or strictly speaking  the cost of cover  and C gets the bicycle he wanted   In short  which of the contractual arrangements WRVM decided to complete  if any  was ultimately a matter for it to decide in the future in light of its own enlightened self interest  And even if WRVM entered into the Heads of Agreement or Development Agreements on the basis of an ill informed judgment on its part either that ultimately it could or would extricate itself from the Mews Sale Contract or that it could make a greater profit by simply breaching that contract and paying damages  it does not assist WRVM  The consequence or consequences that flowed as a result of WRVM failing to complete one or more of those arrangements was ultimately to be determined depending on the way in which the facts resolved themselves and the remedial step or steps  if any  the disappointed contracting party took against WRVM  As in the bicycle hypothetical where A runs the risk that the cost of bicycles on Day   may exceed    i e  he will incur a loss rather than a profit by breaching the first contract  WRVM ran the risk that it would not be able to get out of the Mews Sale Contract and Scheme at a cost that would justify breach of that agreement  That  however  is a commercial rather than a legal consideration  As such  WRVM s contention that the Heads of Agreement or the later agreements never came into effect due to the non fulfilment of a condition precedent is rejected citedManks v Whiteley     Ch   It is

Agreement is not enforceable as a contract for want of intention to create legal relations  WRVM contends that it is a document by which the parties have done no more than record a stage in their negotiations with no intention to be bound by it  Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at      Alternatively  WRVM contends that if the document is not wanting for intention  it is insufficiently certain in its terms to be enforceable as a contract  In support of the latter submission  WRVM identified a number of respects in which it submitted the document was insufficiently certain in its terms  WRVM s primary complaint was that there was no indication as to who were the parties to the joint venture   For the sake of completeness  it is appropriate to record at this stage that WRVM contends that even if the Heads of Agreement is enforceable as a contract    it was replaced by two later agreements a Development Agreement  see   below  and a Second Development Agreement  see   below  and    even if the amounts identified in   are payable under the Heads of Agreement or Development Agreements  none of the amounts is secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge   Notwithstanding WRVM s contentions in this litigation that it was not contractually bound by the Heads of Agreement  WRVM took steps to satisfy the obligations stipulated in the Heads of Agreement  On   or   May    after execution of the Heads of Agreement  WRVM entered into the AVS Facility Agreement  Under the AVS Facility Agreement  AVS agreed to provide to WRVM what was described as the  Tranche   Loan    million  and the  Tranche   Loan    million  cl      The Facility Limit was   million  sched    Clause   of the AVS Facility Agreement provided that     WRVM  must use part of the Tranche   Advance to repay  the  principal owing to Westpac under the Westpac Facility        WRVM  must use all of the Tranche   Advance to repay the then remaining proportion of moneys owing to Westpac under the Westpac Facility and   or to fully discharge any existing encumbrances over the Land   As noted previously  WRVM contends that the Heads of Agreement is not enforceable as a contract for want of intention to create legal relations  WRVM contends that it is a document by which the parties did no more than record a stage in their negotiations with no intention to be bound by it  Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at      Alternatively  WRVM contends that if the document is not wanting for intention  it is insufficiently certain in its terms to be enforceable as a contract   The simplest answer to any questions about the validity or enforceability of the Heads of Agreement is that those questions need not be answered because cl   of the Development Agreement terminated that agreement  Accordingly  the parties agree that no money can be owing under the Heads of Agreement  However  because the same arguments are put by WRVM against each of the three agreements  it is convenient to address them together   WRVM identified a number of respects in which it submitted that the agreements were insufficiently certain in their terms including    the identity of the contracting parties was not known but a matter for further negotiation    although the agreement was in relation to the development of land  there was no agreement as to what the proposed development would be    the identity of the party on whom obligations were imposed was not certain    although each agreement provided for the appointment of a manager who was entitled to substantial benefits  no corresponding obligations were imposed on the manager    WRVM identified a number of matters which it will be necessary to consider in further detail below citedOlympic Holdings Pty Ltd v Windslow Corporation Pty Ltd  in liq    WASCA  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  html  These provisions  read together  are commonly described as an  all moneys  clause  Provisions such as these are not at large  Fountain v Bank of America Trust   Savings Association     BPR   at    The clause is confined in its operation   by reference to the context in which  it  appear s  and by reference to the commercial purpose for which  it was  intended to serve   Fountain at      Those matters are ascertained by having regard to the language of the clause construed in the context of the security instrument as a whole  the apparent purpose and object of the transaction and any admissible evidence as to the surrounding circumstances  Olympic Holdings Pty Ltd v Windslow Corporation Pty Ltd  in liq    WASCA   at     Consistent with that approach  an all moneys clause will not secure a debt of a fundamentally different character from the debt specifically contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract  McVeigh  in the matter of Piccolo v National Australia Bank Limited   FCA   at     As Gleeson CJ said in Fountain  at    The critical question     is whether  on

LJ  appliedUranium Equities Ltd v Fewster   WASCA  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  html  As the Western Australian Court of Appeal recently noted  it is trite to say that a contract can fail for uncertainty if it is missing an essential term  a typical example being price  Uranium Equities Ltd v Fewster   WASCA   at     More useful is what the Court in Uranium Equities went on to say about essential terms in the uncertainty context  at   We have said what is meant by the word  essential  in this context  When dealing with the question of contractual intention  we have expressed opinions on the question whether or not terms left over for future negotiation were essential  We have concluded that  although some of the matters left over were indicative of a lack of intention to be bound  they were not such as to lead to a finding that  if the requisite intention was present  the contract failed for lack of certainty  As Lloyd LJ said in Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd     Lloyd s Rep     there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later  He went on to say that it  happens every day where parties enter into so called  heads of agreement   While many of the matters left over in this case were important  none seems to us to have been essential to the efficacy of the alleged agreement  in the sense that the agreement could not be enforced without it   I consider this case to be of the kind referred to by Lloyd LJ  Here we have a heads of agreement in which many matters of import  including the precise nature of the development  were left to be agreed later  In my view  however  the lack of a project definition is not essential to the efficacy of the agreement in the sense of its enforceability  Regardless of the precise nature of the development project  it is clear that the agreements contemplate at least some effort or work toward development however defined  That is to say  the development work contemplated in the agreements  at least initially  is the work required to put together a proper development proposal  including financing  whether for the building of a golf course  a residential development  or otherwise  That AVS or its nominee was to undertake such work  with the aid of WRVM s representative  is evident from the project management and project representative provisions in cl   including the retainer provision requiring a payment of   per month to AVS or its nominee
