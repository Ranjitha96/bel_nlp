Mirabella International Pty Limited   HCA         CLR     Philips   the High Court  Brennan  Deane  and Toohey JJ with Dawson and McHugh JJ dissenting  held that the primary or threshold requirement of a patentable invention under s   of the Act was that it should be an alleged invention  meaning an alleged manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within s   of the Statue of Monopolies    Imp   In the majority judgment at         The primary focus of inquiry should  as we have indicated  be upon the opening words      a patentable invention is an invention that      of that sub section which impose a threshold requirement which must be satisfied before one reaches that contained in the body of par  a           The effect of those opening words of s   is that the primary or threshold requirement of a  patentable invention  is that it be an  invention   Read in the context of s   as a whole and the definition of  invention  in the Dictionary in Sch   that clearly means  an alleged invention  that is to say  an  alleged   manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within s   of the Statute of Monopolies       W  hat is involved in an alleged manner of new manufacture  that threshold requirement of  an alleged invention  will  notwithstanding an assertion of  newness  remain unsatisfied if it is apparent on the face of the relevant specification that the subject matter of the claim is  by reason of absence of the necessary quality of inventiveness  not a manner of new manufacture for the purposes of the Statute of Monopolies  That does not mean that the threshold requirement of  an alleged invention  corresponds with or renders otiose the more specific requirements of novelty and inventive step  when compared with the prior art base  contained in s  b   It simply means that  if it is apparent on the face of the specification that the quality of inventiveness necessary for there to be a proper subject of letters patent under the Statute of Monopolies is absent  one need go no further      The High Court in Philips dismissed an appeal from a majority of the Full Federal Court that the subject matter of the patent in suit as disclosed by the specification when read as a whole  was merely a new use of a particular known product  The respondents  cross claim that the applicant s Patent is invalid on the grounds that it is not a patentable invention or a manner of manufacture with the meaning of s   of the Act is framed as follows      Not a patentable invention  section       The alleged invention so far as claimed in each claim of the Patent is not a patentable invention within the meaning of the Act in that  so far as claimed in each and every claim  it does not satisfy the threshold requirement of  an invention  and is not properly the subject of letters patent        Particulars           The Patent does not  on the face of the specification  disclose an invention            The alleged invention amounts to no more than the incorporation of a  guard member  to overlie a series of barrier elements for the purpose of guarding the barrier elements against collisions which the barrier elements are expected to incur in their usual operation  Mr Yates SC  counsel for the respondents  submitted that all that was claimed as the invention is  in fact  the use of a guard rail      All that s being provided is a guardrail to barriers for the purpose of protecting the barriers  including protecting the connection between barriers  So it is simply a guardrail for the barrier system  and that  we submit  is simply just another use of a known product for its known purpose  and for which its properties make it suitable discussedPfizer

with French and Lindgren JJ that Claim   of the Patent in Suit was invalid because it was invalid because it was obvious or disclosed no inventive step  and with the other findings of their Honour
