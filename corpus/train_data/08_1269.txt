Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd  No      FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toWhitaker v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   Even if the offer made by the respondents by letter dated   March   was commensurate with the overall financial result to flow from the orders I made on   July   and I hasten to add that I do not think it is  the ground on which the motion is brought is misconceived  As Lockhart J said in Whitaker v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at      The primary purpose of an award of pre judgment interest is to compensate a successful plaintiff for the loss or detriment which he or she has suffered by being kept out of his or her money during the relevant period  that is to compensate the plaintiff for having been deprived of the use of the money  Ruby v Marsh   HCA         CLR     Batchelor v Burke   HCA         CLR     and MBP  SA  Pty Limited v Gogic   HCA         CLR    See P D Finn  ed  Essays on Damages  st ed    and in particular the essay by J L R Davis   Interest as Compensation  pp        The applicant has been without its money since   January   and that remains the case  It is only appropriate that it should have interest on that money up to the date of judgment   The motion for the vacation of Order   is dismissed   The respondents  notice of motion seeks  at   the vacation of Orders   and   made on   July   and their variation based on the matters set out in the affidavit of Ms Ellis sworn   August    It does not say how they should be varied  Nor do their written submissions  What the respondents  notice of motion does seek  at   is an order that the applicant pay the respondents  costs  on an indemnity or  alternatively  party party basis  from   April   or such other time as the Court thinks fit  On the hearing of the motion  the further alternative was introduced  namely  that each party pay its own costs from that date  Presumably  implicit in all this is that the first  second and third respondents should pay the applicant s costs of the application as ordered by Order   but only up to   April    On the hearing of the motion  nothing was said about the second limb of Order   namely  that the first  second and third respondents pay the fourth  fifth and sixth respondents  costs of defending the application  Nor was anything said about Order   that the cross claimant pay the first and second cross respondents  costs of defending the cross claim
