Lockett v Military Rehabilitation   Compensation Commission   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toComcare Australia  Department of Defence  v Maida     AAR   In Comcare Australia  Department of Defence  v Maida     AAR   the claimant had an accepted schizophrenic condition  That was a permanent impairment that the claimant had prior to   December    There was no entitlement to compensation by way of a lump sum for that condition under the   Act  The claimant s condition worsened after   December    The question was whether the claimant s claim under the SRC Act should be allowed  After reviewing the authorities  Mansfield J said  at   that the following was a correct summary of the state of the law         The progression of a disease or gradual worsening of the degree of an impairment does not constitute a new or distinct impairment                 If there is no change in the underlying patho physiological condition causing an impairment  any worsening of that impairment will not constitute a new or distinct impairment                 A significant worsening of an impairment may constitute a new or distinct impairment  but only if there has been a change in the underlying path physiological condition  so that there has been a qualitative change to the impairment that is  the development of a new impairment   On the evidence in this case  the deterioration in the applicant s hearing loss was an effect of ageing and that means that it was not a new or further impairment in the relevant sense  The applicant has already received compensation of a lump sum in respect of his hearing loss under the   Act  Any claim for compensation of a lump sum in relation to a deterioration of that condition of the nature indicated is precluded by s  a  of the SRC Act   As I have said  there is no evidence of a deterioration of the applicant s tinnitus  but even if it has deteriorated  there is nothing to suggest that that deterioration is other than a progression or gradual worsening of the condition  Tinnitus was not a compensable condition under the   Act or the   Act  Any claim for compensation of a lump sum in relation to that condition or a deterioration of that condition of the nature indicated is precluded by s  b  of the SRC Act   The claim in relation to the conditions of loss of balance and stress were not the subject of any debate before the Tribunal  The applicant s case is that those conditions were permanent impairments that occurred in    The applicant s claim for compensation of a lump sum in relation to those conditions in these proceedings cannot succeed for a number of reasons referred toComcare v Mooi     FCR   Finally  although there are related conditions or effects under the SRC Act  eg  vertigo  loss of balance and stress are not of themselves conditions compensable under the approved guide prepared under s   of the SRC Act  see also Comcare v Mooi     FCR     In my opinion  the proposed appeal is futile and doomed to fail and  in those circumstances  the application for an extension of time within which to appeal should be dismissed   The application for an extension of time within which to appeal is dismissed     I certify that the preceding forty   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko   Associate Dated    July   The Applicant  The Applicant appeared in person      Counsel for the Respondent  Mr M Roder     Solicitor for the Respondent  Sparke Helmore     Date of Hearing    May       Date of Judgment    July         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toDepartment of Defence as Delegate of Comcare v West     ALR   In Department of Defence as Delegate of Comcare v West     ALR   the question was whether a deterioration in the claimant s lumbar spine and an impairment in both legs were new impairments for the purpose of a claim for compensation under the SRC Act  Merkel J  with whom O Connor J agreed  stated the relevant principles in the following passages from his reasons for judgment  at   and      The present state of the authorities can be summarised as follows          the gradual worsening of a permanent impairment in accordance with its natural progress does not constitute a series of new impairments each giving rise to a separate liability to pay compensation  see Blackman at   and Brennan at FCR     per Gummow J  cf Brennan at FCR     per Burchett J        the observation in Blackman at   that a permanent impairment which worsens significantly or is such that the variation between it and the earlier permanent impairment is substantial does not result in a new permanent impairment is to be approached with  some caution  see Brennan at FCR     and     per Burchett J and at   per Gummow J and Levett at FCR          The present case requires resolution of the question left unresolved in the current state of the authorities  that is  whether a deterioration in a permanent impairment which existed as at   December   is capable of constituting a new permanent impairment      The caution expressed in relation to Blackman by Burchett and Gummow JJ in Brennan and adopted by the Full Court in Levett suggests a reluctance to accept that a substantial variation  or a significant deterioration  in a person s permanent impairment is incapable of constituting a permanent impairment which is different to that which existed prior to the variation or deterioration           A loss of the entitlement conferred under ss   and   by reason of s   only occurs when the permanent impairment the subject of the claim is the permanent impairment that the employee suffered as at   December    On my reasoning  and that of Burchett J in Brennan   where a change in a permanent impairment occurring after the commencement date is such that  quantitatively and qualitatively  it is properly to be characterised as a further or new impairment occurring after the commencing date it is compensable by a lump sum payment under ss   and    That conclusion is consistent with the language used and with the statutory policy to be discerned from ss     and   of providing benefits to workers in respect of a further permanent impairment that occurs after the commencing day irrespective of whether the injury that resulted in the impairment occurred before or after the commencing day  It also avoids capricious and arbitrary outcomes under workers  compensation legislation  which is of a remedial nature and should be construed liberally  see Brennan at FCR   and the cases there referred to  referred toLees v Comcare     ALD   First  it was the claim for loss of hearing which was the subject of the reconsideration under s   of the SRC Act  In those circumstances  it seems that a claim in relation to loss of balance and stress could not have been considered by the Tribunal  Lees v Comcare     ALD     Secondly  the applicant s case is that the conditions of loss of balance and stress were permanent impairments which occurred in    Those conditions were not impairments for which there was an entitlement to compensation of a lump sum under the   Act or the   Act  Accordingly  there was no entitlement to receive compensation of a lump sum in relation to them under the SRC Act  s  b  of the SRC Act
