Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd  in liquidation   No     ATPR  P    The respondents submit that neither s   of the Fair Trading Act nor s   of the Trade Practices Act permits such orders  I do not accept this submission  Unlike s   of the Trade Practices Act these sections specifically anticipate the situation where loss or damage is likely rather than specifically determined at the time the order is made  An example of the flexibility of sections in granting relief can be seen in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd  in liquidation   No     ATPR  P    where  pursuant to s     Gyles J made orders having the effect of indemnifying a company from claims made by other persons  see    The orders sought by the applicant have the advantage of avoiding further expense in what has undoubtedly already been a very expensive proceeding especially in relation to the amount in dispute between the parties  They allow for the applicant to be compensated only if he actually suffers a loss and  if he does not  for him to have no more than his fair share of the partnership profits  It seems to me that the orders do justice to the parties in a practical and cost effective way   The respondents object to proposed order   by which the applicant seeks to have the cross claim dismissed  They say that this order is inappropriate because the cross claim  for all intents and purposes was successful  In fact  except in so far as it was premised on the agreement between the parties being a purchase of shares in the first respondent  there was never any real dispute between the parties as to what was being sought under the cross claim  see the earlier judgment at      The applicant has never disputed that the   that he was paid should be accounted for in the winding up of the partnership  The respondents did not succeed in their claim concerning an agreement to purchase shares  As this was the only issue in dispute in the cross claim it is appropriate that it be dismissed  The cross claim was not the subject of significant separate argument at the hearing and it should have no impact on the ultimate assessment of costs   Relying on a letter of   July   from his solicitor to the respondents  solicitor offering to settle the proceedings  the applicant seeks costs on a party party basis until   July   and thereafter on an indemnity basis  The letter  which was without prejudice except as to costs  offered to settle the matter  conditional upon mutual releases and the surrender of our client s interest in the business     and the withdrawal of the caveat over the Narrabeen property  on payment by the respondents to the applicant of  a  the sum of    without interest  and  b  the cost of the proceedings on a party party basis to the date of the offer  The letter concluded with a reference to the applicant s intention to tender the letter on the question of costs  which we will seek on an indemnity basis from the date of this offer  and to the   Calderbank principles on which this offer is made  appliedByers v Dorotea Pty Ltd     ALR   A major issue in contention is the proposed orders for distribution of the partnership assets and compensation for the applicant  The applicant does not seek  nor in my view would he be entitled to  rescission of the partnership contract  This does not preclude him from obtaining orders under s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  or s   of the Fair Trading Act    NSW  to compensate him for loss or damage   Byers v Dorotea Pty Ltd     ALR   appliedDr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The amount to which I have found the applicant to be entitled is significantly more than the sum mentioned in the letter of   July and is sufficient to raise the Calderbank principles as a live issue  It does not follow  however  that the applicant is automatically entitled to the indemnity costs it seeks  As Goldberg J pointed out in Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at     it is necessary to look at all the surrounding circumstances and not just at the fact that an offer has been made and rejected  The issue is whether it was reasonable in all the circumstances for the respondents to reject the offer  bearing in mind the competing principles in favour of sensible compromises of disputes and in favour of parties being able to pursue claims to which they reasonably believe they are entitled   In opposing the applicant s claim for indemnity costs from the above date  the respondents relied on a letter dated   September   also without prejudice except as to costs  sent by their solicitor to the applicant s solicitor  The letter  in which the respondents offered to settle for a total of   was one in an exchange of letters between the parties before the commencement of proceedings attempting to settle their dispute  The history of these offers is set out in the applicant s response to the letter of   September  It is not necessary for me to recount that history other than to say it appears that the second respondent had accepted an offer to settle for   and had failed to make the payment by the agreed date  The offer of   September was rejected and a counter offer made in the applicant s solicitor s response of   September   In my view  the offers and counter offers made in   fall into a different category from the offer made in the letter of   July    Mr Sahade  counsel for the respondents  submitted that the fact that the offer of   September was made before the commencement of proceedings should not preclude the application of Calderbank principles  That may well be so  although it is not necessary for me to decide the point  In September   the issues in the case had not crystallised and it is difficult to say that refusal of the offer at that stage was unreasonable  By the time of the letter of   July   the position was quite different  This much is made clear in the opening paragraphs of the letter    We refer to the unsuccessful mediation on Thursday    July conducted by the Hon Morton Rolfe QC    It is a mater  sic  of regret to our client that these proceedings have not been resolved  Given the amount of dispute we do not believe that the parties should be in a position where their differences cannot be resolved but through recourse to the court system  On   September   we made  on behalf of our client  an offer which effectively provided for the dispute to be resolved in circumstances where our client would surrender all interest in the business for a payment by your client of    including the   already paid to him   This offer was rejected    Two things have now occurred  First  the issues in the dispute have been defined by way of pleadings and evidence has been served  Accordingly  there can be no suggestion that all parties have not had access to sufficient material to make an informed decision about the resolution of proceedings  Secondly  our client has incurred and continues to incur significant legal costs that will escalate as the matter progresses to hearing    Against this background  we are instructed to make one final effort to resolve the proceedings     appliedI   L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers  Brisbane  Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is necessary  however  that he has suffered or be likely to suffer loss or damage  I   L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers  Brisbane  Pty Limited   HCA         CLR    The applicant paid   for a   share in the partnership business  This indicates that  consistent with the valuation of Mr Magin  the business was valued at   million  Mr Philip Rennie  whose subsequent valuation both parties agreed to accept  and which I also accepted   see the earlier judgment at   et seq  assessed the partnership business as being worth at most    On that basis a   share would be worth only    Mr Rennie s valuation did not take into account the value of the Supreme Court action referred to in   of the earlier judgment however I am not satisfied that any value can be attributed to that action  In accepting Mr Rennie s valuation I accepted that the applicant has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage  I say   likely  because it is possible that on realisation of the partnership assets  the partnership will be shown to have made a profit  On Mr Rennie s valuation that is extremely unlikely but it is at least a theoretic possibility  This finding is sufficient to enliven the Court s power to make orders under s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and under s   of the Fair Trading Act    NSW    The orders sought by the applicant would provide for the assets of the partnership to be distributed in accordance with s   of the Partnership Act    NSW  with one exception  which relates to the distribution of the ultimate residue of the assets of the partnership referred to in s  b  of the Partnership Act   Section  b  provides that  after the other payments specified in s   have been made  the ultimate residue is to be  divided among the partners in the proportion in which profits are divisible   Central to the exception proposed by the applicant is the amount of   that the applicant paid to the second respondent for investment in the partnership  The applicant seeks to have that amount returned to him with interest  the  Applicant s Contribution Amount   It is not in contention that  with interest calculated up to and including Thursday   September   that amount is       The applicant s proposal is as follows  The receiver should distribute the ultimate residue in the following order    pay to the applicant his   of the ultimate residue  the  Applicant s Residue Amount      if the Applicant s Residue Amount is less than the Applicant s Contribution Amount  pay the difference between these two amounts to the applicant  and    pay the balance  if any  to the other partners     Finally  the applicant submits that the respondents should be ordered to pay to the applicant the amount  if any  by which the amount payable to the applicant by the receiver from the proceeds of the partnership is less than the Applicant s Contribution Amount appliedLewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   August   I delivered a judgment  the  earlier judgment  on the substantive issues in the above matter    FCA    At the request of the parties I made no orders for relief or in relation to costs at that time but allowed them a reasonable time to bring in short minutes of order for the resolution of the matter in the light of my findings and reasons  The applicant has supplied short minutes of the orders for which he contends   The respondents accept that some of those orders are appropriate in the light of the findings in the earlier judgment but oppose others  On   September   the parties made oral submissions in support of their respective positions  The background to the matter is set out in sufficient detail in my earlier reasons and I do not propose to repeat it here  I propose to discuss only those orders that are in contention  The earlier judgment sufficiently explains the basis for those about which there is substantial agreement   The first three orders proposed by the applicant are declarations that reflect my findings that       a  the first respondent engaged in conduct in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in making certain representations to the applicant in relation to the purchase of the East Village Hotel in Darlinghurst  NSW   b  the second respondent engaged in conduct in contravention of s   of the Fair Trading Act    NSW  in making representations to the applicant in relation to the purchase of the hotel  and   c  at all material times  the applicant had a   share in the partnership
