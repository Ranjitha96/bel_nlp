Roper v Repatriation Commission   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedRepatriation Commission v Kohn     ALR   The Tribunal commenced its reasoning with an analysis of a number of decisions of this Court  Repatriation Commission v Kohn     ALR     Repatriation Commission v Ahrenfield     FCR     Proctor v Repatriation Commission   FCA         ALD   and Roscoe v Repatriation Commission   FCA    Having considered these authorities  the Tribunal set out  at   the principles which it considered should guide it in making a decision       the nature of the veteran s service overall         the essential character of the veteran s service during the period spent outside Australia when that essential character is determined by reference to matters such as            the period of time for which the veteran is outside Australia      the purpose for which the veteran was outside Australia              events that occurred during the period in which the veteran was outside Australia including enemy activity  or likelihood of  enemy activity in the relevant area                the veteran s activities during the period outside Australia  and              the veteran s activities both before and after the period of service outside Australia  and                whether  having regard to its conclusions on the first two matters  the veteran s service in the particular period can be seen to be treated as operational service   In any event  had the questions been framed in the manner suggested the answer to both of them must have been  no  The Tribunal s task  when called on to apply s  A    necessarily involves questions of degree and requires the making of value judgments  In Repatriation Commission v Kohn     ALR     Hill J provided guidance on the exercise of the Tribunal s power under s  A  His Honour said  at      It seems to me that to give effect to what I believe to be the legislative policy behind the current legislation and indeed the policy which the foregoing analysis of the history of the legislation indicates was behind all previous manifestations of it  an interpretation of s  a  should be advanced which would exclude mere transitory passages outside Australia from the definition of  operational service  in s  a   When attention is focused on the rendering of continuous full time service outside Australia  it is not correct to look in isolation at the period of time in which the member of the defence force is outside the three mile limit to the exclusion of the periods of time immediately before and immediately after that period  Nor is the purpose for which the member of the forces comes to be outside Australia irrelevant  Rather  it may be necessary to consider a wider period of time  How wide a band of time that is to be considered will depend upon the facts of each case  One must then ask  looking at the relevant period overall  whether it is correct to categorise the member s service in that time as being continuous full time service inside Australia or continuous full time service outside Australia  If the essential character of the service considered overall can be seen to be continuous full time service outside Australia  then for the purpose of the legislation it is to be treated as operational service  If  on the other hand  looked at overall  notwithstanding that at a discrete moment of time the service of the member was outside Australia  the service is properly as a matter of ordinary English language to be seen as having an essential character of continuous full time service within Australia  then for the purposes of the legislation it will not be treated as  operational service   It is obvious that there can be questions of degree involved  Service on a naval ship  where the ship was sailing to some place in the middle of the ocean to refuel planes there and then return during the war  would clearly enough be characterised as service outside Australia  The purpose of the voyage will in such a case give the service its essential character  So too  an airman piloting a plane on a mission from Australia and back  not landing in the meantime  will likewise be seen to be engaged in operational service for the purposes of the legislation because it will then  having regard to the purpose of the mission and as a matter of fact  be proper to look at this mission in isolation and characterise the airman s service by reference to it  However  where the purpose of the journey outside Australia itself  being but brief  is merely to facilitate the performance of service which itself is continuous full time service within Australia  the service outside Australia will not give colour to the service nor will it permit a characterisation of the service as being continuous full time service outside Australia    The definition of operational service  now found in Item  a  of s  A of the VE Act   appeared in s  a  at the time at which Hill J s decision was made  Kohn has been adopted and applied by the Court in later cases  see Proctor at   and   and Roscoe at     Mr Roper had ventured outside Australia on only two occasions during his military service  There was evidence before the Tribunal  including evidence from Mr Roper s son  that the two flights formed part of the training regime for aircrew  The training was designed to familiarise the crew  including Mr Roper  with new aircraft prior to them being posted overseas  The possibility of any enemy contact during the flights was low  The fact that surveillance work was undertaken during the flights did not detract from the essential training purpose which they served  It was open to the Tribunal to determine that the relevant service of Mr Roper fell into the second category of case identified by Hill J  namely  that in which when  looked at overall  notwithstanding that at a discrete moment of time the service of the member was outside Australia  the service is properly as a matter of ordinary English language to be seen as having an essential character of continuous full time service within Australia       The training base was in Australia  The training flights left from and returned to the Australian base  The duration of those parts of the flights which took place outside Australian territorial limits were relatively short  In these circumstances it cannot  in my opinion  be said that there was no evidence to support the two impugned findings  Nor can the submission  made by counsel for Mrs Roper  that the only conclusion open on the facts found was that Mr Roper performed operational service outside Australia  be accepted   These paragraphs are both very difficult to understand  Paragraph     appears to attribute to the Tribunal a finding which it did not make  The Tribunal did not reason that  because the two flights were for the purposes of training and familiarisation with the new aircraft  this precluded Mr Roper s service being operational service  Paragraph     appears designed to raise a construction point  It seems intended to raise the question of whether  in deciding whether or not Mr Roper had rendered continuous full time service outside Australia  the Tribunal was entitled to pose and answer the subsidiary question of whether the service was for the purpose of training and familiarisation with the new aircraft  The Tribunal did not ask this question  It asked whether  the essential character of Mr Roper s service during the periods he was outside Australia was one of training and familiarisation with the Liberator   Neither paragraph propounds a pure question of law   These questions appear to be linked to grounds          Mrs Roper submits that the question for the Tribunal was whether Mr Roper rendered service outside Australia  By asking itself whether the essential character of the service was  one of training and familiarisation with the Liberator  the Tribunal was  so it was said  diverted from giving attention to this question  Mrs Roper complains that the Tribunal treated the task of characterisation as being at large and that the Tribunal drew a dichotomy between service and training which was inconsistent with the terms of s  A  of the VE Act    The Tribunal directed itself consistently with Hill J s judgment in Kohn  It was required to characterise Mr Roper s flights to  or towards  Middleton Reef  The amount of time Mr Roper spent outside Australia during these flights was a matter to be considered in forming this judgment  This was a fact finding exercise  It is clear from the principles identified by the Tribunal  see above at   that it correctly understood the task it was required to perform  It did not treat the time spent outside Australia as a relevant principle  Rather it identified this as a matter which  in an appropriate case  would assist in determining the essential character of a veteran s service  The Tribunal s reasoning at paragraphs   to   demonstrates that it considered the evidence before it in light of the principles which it had distilled from decisions of this Court   For the reasons explained above at   it was open to the Tribunal to find that the flights were undertaken for training purposes and that the essential character of Mr Roper s relevant service  considered overall  was not continuous full time service outside Australia   The question asked in paragraph     lacks precision  In particular  it is not clear what is comprehended by the phrase  the correct application of s  A Item  a        If paragraph     is intended to raise the question of whether  on the facts found  Mr Roper s two flights outside Australia constituted operational service within the meaning of s  A   a pure question of law could probably be framed  It is another way of raising the issue to which question     seems to be directed   It is clear  particularly from the definition of  continuous full time service  in s  C   that the words in s  A Item  a  are used according to their ordinary meaning  see also Kohn at   quoted above at    For the reasons given earlier the facts found by the Tribunal did not necessarily render Mr Roper s service  in the course of the two flights  continuous full time service outside Australia  There is  therefore  no question of law raised by paragraph     even if it is broadly construed   For these reasons I do not consider that a question of law has been identified for the purposes of s   of the AAT Act   Even if the necessary foundation for the Court s jurisdiction had been established the appeal would  for the reasons given above  have failed   There is a further problem with the present appeal  It is brought against what amounts to a preliminary decision on a matter of evidence  The Tribunal has yet to determine Mrs Roper s application to it  There are strong policy reasons for avoiding fragmentation of and delay in proceedings before the Tribunal citedRepatriation

properly analysed  is not a question of law no amount of formulary like  erred in law  or  was open as a matter of law  can make it into a question of law    Had the questions been framed along the
