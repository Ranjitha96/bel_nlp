experience as to the way in which shoes are bought by retail consumers  As counsel for the respondents pointed out  shoes are usually not a quick impulsive purchase of something off the supermarket

FCR   Use  as a trade mark  in s   is use of the mark as a  badge of origin  in the sense that it indicates a connection in the course of trade between goods and the person who applies the mark to the goods  See Johnson   Johnson Aust Pty Ltd v Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd     FCR   at       Johnson    That is the concept embodied in the definition of  trade mark  in s   appliedCoca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR     All Fect   the appellant s well known  Coca Cola shaped bottle  mark was registered in two dimensional form  Key features of the shape included    its curved rather than flat sides    a top portion with longitudinal fluting    a central portion without fluting and a lower portion with fluting    a flat base and a banded neck   The respondent imported and distributed cola flavoured confectionary  The issues in suit were whether a three dimensional shape   namely confectionary   could be used as a mark to denote the origin of goods  and whether such use infringed the appellant s registered two dimensional trade mark  At   the Full Court referred to the authorities relevant to the issue of use      the question is whether the sign used indicates origin of goods in the user of the sign  whether there is a connection in the course of trade between the goods and the user of the sign   At   the Court said   T he question at this stage is not whether the respondent has used a sign so as to indicate a connection between it and the appellant  It is whether the use indicates a connection between the confectionary and the respondent  So it does not assist the respondent to demonstrate by reference to the packaging that the suggested connection is with Efruti rather than Coca Cola   These passages reflect High Court authority that a trade mark is a sign used to indicate origin of the goods in the user of that sign  Therefore  in the ordinary case  a court must first examine the use of the impugned mark and whether such use is trade mark use for the purposes of the Act  In cases such as the present this threshold issue should be determined before the court considers whether the two marks are substantially identical or deceptively similar  The threshold issue only examines the impugned mark  not the registered trade mark  As was said in All Fect at    At this stage the hypothesis is not that the appellant is trying to tell the consumer that the goods emanate from it  but that the respondent is trying to tell the consumer that the goods emanate from the respondent    The Full Court in All Fect held that the confectionary shape denoted use as a mark  primarily because the confectionary had non descriptive features in the shape of the mark  The Court said at   The confectionary has three features that are not descriptive of the goods  They are the silhouette  the fluting at the top and bottom  and the label band  It is not necessary for the respondent to adopt any of those features in order to inform consumers that its product is a cola flavoured sweet  It could do so by using the cola colour  the word COLA and the shape of an ordinary straight walled bottle  The silhouette  fluting and band are striking features of the confectionary  and are apt to distinguish it from the goods of other traders  The primary function performed by these features is to distinguish the goods from others  That is to use those features as a mark  It is true  as the respondent said  that the fact that a feature is not descriptive of goods does not necessarily establish that it is used to distinguish or differentiate them  But in the present case we are compelled to the conclusion that the non descriptive features have been put there to make the goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive  and thus to distinguish them from the goods of other traders   Emphasis added  The existence of striking features that were not descriptive of the confectionary was enough to indicate that it was used as a trade mark  Features that made the goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive had the capacity to distinguish the respondent s goods from those of others   At   the Court said that whether the respondent had used features of the confectionary as a trade mark was a matter for the court  and was not governed by the absence of evidence that shopkeepers or customers concluded that the confectionary had a trade mark origin   The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out    a  A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin  However the shape must have a feature that is  extra  and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods  Mayne at   Remington at   and Kenman Kandy at    b  Non descriptive features of a shape point towards a finding that such features are used for a trade mark purpose  Where features are striking  trade mark use will more readily be found  For example  features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others  All Fect at      c  Descriptive features  like descriptive words  make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product  For example  the word COLA or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance  All Fect at   and Mayne at        d  Where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods  references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark  Mayne at    For example  evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin  Remington at   and Mayne at      e  If a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent  it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element  This may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark  Kenman Kandy at   and Mayne at      f  Whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court  and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point  All Fect at      g  Context  is all important  and will typically characterise the mark s use as either trade mark use or not  Remington at   and Mayne at       At the other end of the spectrum are those features of a mark that are non descriptive and non functional  They ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive  thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others  All Fect and Remington show that non functional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape  A concocted feature will typically be considered non functional  Kenman Kandy    In my view the Photon and the Cube shoe are used as trade marks where the features listed in   especially features  a   b   d   g  and  h  are combined in the shape of a shoe  The most important of these features for present purposes are the stitched YD label on both shoes  the small rounded piece at the back of the Cube shoe  and the Photon s stripe running parallel to the base of the sole  Neither the Cube s rounded piece nor the Photon s parallel strip is found on any of the shoes in evidence other than YD s shoes  Mr Vickery described the rounded piece as  quite distinctive  and not a feature commonly used in the shoe industry  It can I think be considered a striking feature given its lack of commonality in the trade  cf All Fect at     Features  c   e   i  and  j  in the list at   are either functional or in common use  Common features are like descriptive words   In my view the non functional and non descriptive features referred to in   overwhelm the functional features and common features referred to in   and give the Cube and Photon shoes a trade mark purpose   Of the essential features  the D is the most dominant feature of the Shape Mark  Significant weight and importance have been attached to that feature  cf Melbourne Chinese Press Pty Ltd v Australian Chinese Newspapers Pty Ltd     IPR   at     Melbourne Chinese Press   and All Fect at     Finally  the context is all important  In the present case the risk of confusion is mitigated by the circumstances in which the products are bought and sold    Purchasers of the shoes in suit are metro shoppers  They are fashion conscious and discerning in their choices  They are likely to be well informed about the products before purchasing them  The steps involved in a purchase  see   constitute a relatively lengthy process in the course of which a customer will become well informed about a product before making a purchase     Metro shoppers review product labels  Branding  labels and logos are important features to this class of consumer  Their purchasing habits are refined  and this lessens the chance of confusion     YD s shoes are sold only in YD stores  The stores display YD s signage  and customers are well aware that they are in a YD store when purchasing an item     The applicants  and YD s shoes are relatively expensive items compared with impulse products such as soft drinks and confectionary  cf  All Fect at    Purchasers of shoes generally tend to be discerning in their purchasing habits     While it is not necessary for the applicants to lead evidence of actual deception  cf Crazy Ron s at   it is relevant that there was no such evidence appliedKoninklijke Philips Electrics NV v Remington Products Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The issue in Koninklijke Philips Electrics NV v Remington Products Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     Remington   was whether Remington s electric shaver was used as a trade mark  Philips  marks were shapes depicting a triple headed rotary shaver  The product depicted in the shape had previously been the subject of a patent which had expired  Remington s product was very similar to the Philips mark  and Remington used images of the shaver head on its packaging and in its brochures and press advertisements  The primary judge s holding that this use was not use in a trade mark sense was upheld on appeal  Burchett J  with whom Hill and Branson JJ agreed  said at   In my opinion  merely to produce and deal in goods having the shape  being a functional shape  of something depicted by a trade mark  here the marks do depict  one more completely than the other  a working part of a triple rotary shaver  is not to engage in a  use  of the mark  upon  or in physical or other relation to  the goods  within s     or to  use  it  in relation to the goods  within s     Use  and  use  in those contexts  convey the idea of employing the mark   first  as something that can be  upon  or serve in a  relation  to the goods   and secondly  so as to fulfil a purpose  being the purpose of conveying information about their commercial origin  The mark is added  as something distinct from the goods  It may be closely bound up with the goods  as when it is written upon them  or stamped into them  or moulded onto them     or  in the case of a liquid  it may be sold in a container so formed as to constitute at once both container and mark  But in none of these cases is the mark devoid of a separate identity from that of the goods  The alternative ways of using a trade mark in relation to goods do not include simply using the goods themselves as the trade mark  The reason is plain  it is to be assumed that goods in the market are useful  and if they are useful  other traders may legitimately wish to produce similar goods  unless  of course  there are  for the time being  subsisting patent  design or other rights to prevent them from doing so  and it follows that a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish their commercial origin  which is the function of a mark  Johnson   Johnson at         In other words where the features of a mark are functional aspects of the design  they are not being used as a trade mark for distinguishing purposes  because they are essential to the  usefulness  of the product  The triple headed rotary design was found to be one of the best ways to make an efficient electric shaver  It was a useful model and  proved extremely successful  at     The Full Court provided guidance as to when a shape may be used as a trade mark for the purposes of the Act  At     Burchett J said  It does not follow that a shape can never be registered as a trade mark if it is the shape of the whole or a part of the relevant goods  so long as the goods remain distinct from the mark  Some special shape of a container for a liquid may  subject to the matters already discussed  be used as a trade mark  just as the shape of a medallion attached to goods might be so used  A shape may be applied  as has been said  in relation to goods  perhaps by moulding or impressing  so that it becomes a feature of their shape  though it may be irrelevant to their function  Just as a special word may be coined  a special shape may be created as a badge of origin  But that is not to say that the   Act has invalidated what Windeyer J said in Smith Kline  The special cases where a shape of the goods may be a mark are cases falling within  not without  the principle he expounded  For they are cases where the shape that is a mark is  extra  added to the inherent form of the particular goods as something distinct which can denote origin  The goods can still be seen as having  in Windeyer J s words   an existence independently of the mark  which is imposed upon them   His Honour said at    A  mark remains something  extra  added to distinguish the products of one trader from those of another  a function which plainly cannot be performed by a mark consisting of either a word or a shape other traders may legitimately wish to use citedKoninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In finding that Remington s use was not use as a trade mark  the Full Court gave particular attention to the rotary heads of Remington s product  They were viewed as  vitally important  to the design of the product and having a  purpose quite different from those of a trade mark  at    The fact that the three headed rotary design was one of the best designs for a rotary shaver was a relevant factor in Remington s favour  Another factor was that Remington had prominently displayed its  Remington  trade mark on the packaging of the product and on the product itself  in a way that a mark would be used for goods of this type  at     and    The

is all important  and will typically characterise the mark s use as either trade mark use or not  Remington at   and Mayne at       As is apparent from the foregoing propositions  a shape mark case may require consideration of different types of features in determining whether the mark is used as a trade mark for the purposes of the Act  At one end of the spectrum are shapes or features thereof that are purely functional  The features may have derived substantially from a patented product  such as the S shaped fence dropper  or go to the usefulness of the product  Remington at   and    Cases such as Mayne and Remington show that such features point away from trade mark use   YD s submission that the sole patterns are applied to provide grip  and are thus for a functional and not for a trade mark purpose  is pitched at too high a level of generality to be helpful in the present context  All soles provide some grip  The sole is inherent in the shoe itself and provides traction when a person is walking or running  Saying that the grip is functional is like saying that the shoe protects the foot from cuts and abrasions  In each case it is too broad a proposition  The position might have been different had there been evidence that the grip pattern provided a special quality leaving little or no room for choice  When choice is limited  it is likely that the goods or an important feature thereof will reflect the product or feature itself  as in Mayne and Remington   In such a case function will overwhelm a trade mark purpose  In the absence of evidence to this effect  grip is in my view but a broad functional requirement  As Mr Vickery s evidence indicated  this function can be achieved by use of a variety of different patterns  In my view any functionality of the grip offered by the sole is overwhelmed by the non descriptive aspects of the marks   In the light of what I have said at   and   the Gamon shoe does not fall for consideration  If what I have said there is wrong  the Gamon sole is almost identical to the Cube  and what I have said about that sole is applicable to the Gamon sole   The features of the Photon and Cube shoes are set out below   a  a stylised YD label stitched to the inside sole of each shoe   b  a sole comprising a rubber cross hatched pattern with dimples between the triangles in the Cube shoe  and without dimples in the case of the Photon  which also has a blank rectangular shape at the base of the sole   c  two oblique stripes on either side of the Cube shoes  and two stripes on the Photon shoe with the front stripe turning back to overlap the other   d  the Cube shoe has a  small rounded piece  at the back of the shoe and the Photon has a stripe on the back that is parallel to the base of the sole   e  each shoe has a squarish toe cap or toe panel incorporating a strip of material flowing from the bottom of the laces to the point where the toe cap or toe panel joins the sole   f  each shoe has small dots carved into its side   g  the Cube shoe has a flat sole with two rubber panels coming from the outer side of the sole to the upper of the shoe  The Photon has a flat sole and three such panels   h  each shoe has one large rubber panel coming from the inner side of the sole to the upper of the shoe   i  each shoe has a facing   j  each shoe has a padded collar    It is not claimed that the Gamon shoe infringes the Shape Mark   This case is not as clear cut as Kenman Kandy on the one hand  use  or Mayne and Remington on the other  no use   It is towards the middle of the spectrum referred to at

 The  inherent form  of goods  in my view  can only refer to those aspects of form that have functional significance  Were the   Act to enable the registration of a trade mark that would give the owner a monopoly over functional features  it would indeed have made a radical change to trade mark law   Greenwood J said at   Where the three dimensional shape inheres in goods or a part of goods and the goods or that part perform a functional role  particularly where the shape derives from a novel and patented improvement to functionality  the use of the shape     is not use of the sign as a trade mark but the expression of the essential features of the goods   As distinct from a  word  a shape may be registrable under several intellectual property regimes  Greenwood J at   said  A further consideration bearing on whether the respondent has used the shape of the S loop catch as a trade mark is this  The social compact underlying the patent legislation is the encouragement of novel innovation by the grant  subject to qualifying criteria  of a term of exclusivity on the footing that upon the expiry of the monopoly  others are free to exercise the former monopoly  The   Act by enabling shapes to be registered as a badge of origin did not establish a regime under which inventors might be able to secure enduring exclusive rights of use and foreclosure of others through infringement proceedings for the shape of a functional manner of new manufacture formerly the subject of a patent  as in this case  A shape essential to the very subject of the patent will almost always be largely functional as the invention must be novel and useful  If the shape is entirely incidental to the subject matter of the patent  it is unlikely to be a shape bearing any functional element   The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out    a  A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin  However the shape must have

other  no use   It is towards the middle of the spectrum referred to at   to   neither black nor white  but just on the use side of the grey in the middle   Clark was a word case  but Kitto J s observations have been applied to signs other than words  including shapes and aspects of packages  Kenman Kandy   In that case at   to   Stone J said  omitting citations  The authorities give very little guidance as to what is necessary for inherent adaption either generally or with respect to shapes  It is clear that words  ordinary or technical  which are descriptive of the character or quality of the goods are not inherently adapted to distinguish      It is also well established that the name of a geographical location is not inherently adapted to distinguish goods because another trader may legitimately wish to use the name in connection with goods made in or associated with that place          Signs that are descriptive of the character or quality of the relevant goods or which use a geographical name in connection with them cannot be inherently distinctive because the words have significations or associations that invite confusion and because registration of a trade mark using such words would preclude the use by others whose goods have similar qualities or which have a connection with the relevant areas   After referring to Kitto J s judgment in Clark   Stone J continued at   In my opinion it is the absence of these associations and significations that makes a sign inherently adapted to distinguish one trader s goods from those of another  In other words the concept is negative not positive         It is the absence of association and signification that accounts for invented words often being found to be inherently adapted to distinguish a trader s

distinguish those goods in the course of trade from the goods of others  The answer to that question requires examination of the purpose and nature of the impugned use  the relevant context  the way the trade mark has been adopted or applied in relation to goods and the use of brochures  catalogues and advertisements  Johnson   Johnson v Sterling at    A part of that contextual analysis involves an assessment of whether use of the trade mark might be illustrative or descriptive of the goods rather than use as a trade mark  In that context  the extent to which a three dimensional shape for the goods or a part of the goods serves function is an important element in the determination of whether use is distinctive of commercial origin or illustrative or descriptive of the embodied shape of the goods  Use of the trade mark must be demonstrated to be use that serves the primary function of a trade mark  Johnson   Johnson v Sterling at   and   Christodolou v Disney Enterprises Inc   FCA

or cause confusion   They include  i  To show that a trade mark is deceptively similar to another it is necessary to show a real tangible danger of deception or confusion occurring  A mere possibility is not sufficient  ii  A trade mark is likely to cause confusion if the result of its use will be that a number of persons are caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products or closely related products and services come from the same source  It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt     iii  In considering whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion all surrounding circumstances have to be taken into consideration  These include the circumstances in which the marks will be used  the circumstances in which the goods or services will be bought and sold and the character of the probable acquirers of the goods and services appliedde Cordova v Vick Chemical Co     RPC   In Shell at   in a passage approved on appeal to the Full Court  Windeyer J said  In considering whether marks are substantially identical they should  I think  be compared side by side  their similarities and differences noted and the importance of these assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison   The identification of an essential feature depends  it has been said   partly on the Court s own judgment and partly on the burden of the evidence that is placed before it  de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co     RPC     at p    Whether there is substantial identity is a question of fact   The applicants  written submissions on substantial identity in relation to the Sole Mark were as follows  While the first respondent s shoes do not have a  D  insignia  as in the registered mark  they are otherwise covered entirely with a very similar diamond shaped pattern  It is submitted that the degree of resemblance here is still overwhelming and such that it can be judged to be  substantially identical  with the registered mark  In addition  the Photon Footwear has a blank panel in place of the  D  insignia  which makes it even closer in visual impression to the Sole Trade Mark than the Cube Footwear and the Gamon Footwear  This blank panel  moreover  is in the same position relative to the shape of the sole as is the panel with the stylised  D  in the Sole Mark  The respondents were unable to give any proper explanation about the presence of this blank panel  which it is submitted  and put to Trenear  was done to convey an impression of closeness to the Wish shoe but without the actual addition of the  D  device   Tr       However  it is submitted that all three of the alleged infringing shoes are close enough in their use of the pattern feature on the soles to infringe the Sole Trade Mark on the basis that they are  substantially identical  with the registered mark   YD contended that the stylised D on the heel was the prominent and distinctive feature of the Sole Mark  In the absence of the stylised D  it was submitted that that YD s sole patterns were not substantially identical   At   the Court quoted with approval the following passage from the Privy Council s decision in de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co     RPC     de Cordova   a mark is infringed by another trader if  even without using the whole of it

statement of claim by adding a cause of action for infringement of the Sole Mark and Shape Mark  the very marks in suit in the present case  Goldberg J said at   The test  for deceptive similarity  necessarily concerns consumers  recollection of the marks in a trade context  It is by its nature therefore not a matter that can be determined at this stage  The applicant conceded that the absence of the stylised D makes its case difficult  but contended that evidence may establish that the cross hatched sole pattern is the distinctive feature of the sole mark  According to the applicant  it is therefore necessary for the Court to hear evidence of consumers  recollections and impressions of the marks and the relevant footwear  and any expert evidence as to the manner in which consumers perceive brands  before the Court is in a position to understand whether any consumers might be deceived by the infringing footwear  The shoes in question appeal to a particular group of consumers  and the Court should have evidence from the relevant consumers  presumably young people  of the fad and whether the brand is distinguished by the cross hatched sole pattern in the absence of the stylised D   In allowing the amendment  his Honour made clear that evidence of consumer recollections would be important in determining whether consumers might be deceived by the alleged infringing footwear  No such evidence has been adduced by the applicants  The applicants have had since   to assemble evidence of consumer recollections  In the circumstances  it is reasonable to infer that they have been unable to find such evidence  As is apparent from what I have said thus far  I have concluded that there is no deceptive similarity between YD s shoes and the applicants  marks without needing to rely on the absence of deception or confusion evidence   YD s cross claim for removal of the trade marks from the Register arises under s   of the Act  Under sub s  b  the Court may order

ss   to    Section   provides that registration of a trade mark may be opposed on any of the grounds upon which an application for registration may be rejected under Division   of Part    One of those

on the ground that the applicant is not the owner of the mark  YD relies on ss   and   for its cross claim for removal of the trade marks from the Register appliedBlount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section   is in part as follows        An application for the registration of a trade mark must be rejected if the trade mark is not capable of distinguishing the applicant s goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is sought to be registered  designated goods or services  from the goods or services of other persons     In deciding the question whether or not a trade mark is capable of distinguishing the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons  the Registrar must first take into account the extent to which the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons       Where the Registrar is  still unable  to decide the question posed by sub s   sub ss   and   apply  sub s    The cascading effect of s  s provisions is helpfully described by Branson J in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA

Marks   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Clark Equipment Co v Registrar of Trade Marks   HCA         CLR   at       Clark   Kitto J said  That ultimate question must not be misunderstood  It is not whether the mark will be adapted to distinguish the registered owner s goods if it be registered and other persons consequently find themselves precluded from using it  The question is whether the mark  considered quite apart from the effects of registration  is such that by its use the applicant is likely to attain his object of thereby distinguishing his goods from the goods of others      the question whether a mark is adapted to distinguish  is to  be tested by reference to the likelihood that other persons  trading in goods of the relevant kind and being actuated only by proper motives   in the exercise  that is to say  of the common right of the public to make honest use of words forming part of the common heritage  for the sake of the signification which they ordinarily possess   will think of the word and want to use it in connexion with similar goods in any manner which would infringe a registered trade mark granted in respect of it   Clark was a word case  but Kitto J s observations have been applied to signs other than words  including shapes and aspects of packages  Kenman Kandy   In that case at   to   Stone J said  omitting citations  The authorities give very little guidance as to what is necessary for inherent adaption either generally or with respect to shapes  It is clear that words  ordinary or technical  which are descriptive of the character or quality of the goods are not inherently adapted to distinguish      It is also well established that the name of a geographical location is not inherently adapted to distinguish goods because another trader may legitimately wish to use the name in connection with goods made in or associated with that place          Signs that are descriptive of the character or quality of the relevant goods or which use a geographical name in connection with them cannot be inherently distinctive because the words have significations or associations that invite confusion and because registration of a trade mark using such words would preclude the use by others whose goods have similar qualities or which have a connection with the relevant areas   After referring to Kitto J s judgment in Clark   Stone J continued at   In my opinion it is the absence of these associations and significations that makes a sign inherently adapted to distinguish one trader s goods from those of another  In other words the concept is negative not positive         It is the absence of association and signification that accounts for invented words often being found to be inherently adapted to distinguish a trader s product       YD s submissions on s   were brief  namely that the shape and configuration of a shoe is largely dictated by functional considerations  most notably that the shoe  including the sole  must fit the foot of a human being  It was said that largely because of this  all shoes have a commonality of shapes and features  Because of this  and applying the Clark test  s   has not been satisfied   YD s submission at   does not reflect that the mark is not for a general shape but for a particular combination of features stylised D on rear and outer side  shoe shape as depicted in representations  cross hatched sole pattern with rectangle containing stylised letter D  two oblique stripes on sides and one vertical stripe on rear   The answer to the question posed by the Clark formulation is first  that the particular combination of features is such that by its use Diesel is likely to attain the object of thereby distinguishing its Trainers from those of others  and second  that other traders in Trainers would not reasonably want to use the combination  There would be no occasion for a competitor to adopt the features other than the shape  especially as some of them are Diesel related  The stylised D is of the greatest import  It is particularly prominent  It is mentioned three times in the endorsement on the Shape Mark  In my view  it is the combination of this feature and the other essential features identified at   that give the Shape Mark the status of inherent distinctiveness to satisfy s     Diesel does not claim a sole as such  Rather the claim is to a diamond shaped pattern with a panel containing a stylised D  That combination is such that by its use Diesel is likely to attain the object of distinguishing its Trainers from those of others  In addition  other traders in Trainers would not reasonably want to apply the sole mark to their own goods  especially as it incorporates Diesel s D   YD s cross claim

 The ground of opposition is s    see s  a   Bearing in mind the definition of applicant in s   as meaning the person in whose name the application is for the time being proceeding  the time to judge the satisfaction of s  a  is during the application  Aust P L initially  implicitly  claimed to be the owner  by being identified on the application form as the applicant  Later  this was changed to Crazy John Pty Ltd      I think on the evidence that Crazy John Pty Ltd was the owner  The respondents seek to hoist the applicants upon a proposition     that notwithstanding that Aust P L first applied for the mark  the position should be considered as if Crazy John Pty Ltd was the original applicant  Since Crazy John Pty Ltd did not  as at   August   claim to be the owner of the mark  but did so only later  in November  it is said s  a  was not satisfied  I do not agree  Crazy John Pty Ltd was a person who  while the application was proceeding  claimed to be the owner and who claimed to be the owner at the time of grant  Aust Pty Ltd before then claimed to be the owner  but withdrew that claim  To make the application fail because of innocent error of the kind displayed in the evidence would impermissibly narrow the power of amendment in Part   of the TM Act  Crazy John Pty Ltd claimed to be the owner during the registration process  It was an applicant  Section  a  was satisfied    August   was the date of Aust P L s application for registration  It was in November   that the Trade Marks Office was requested to amend the application to show Crazy John Pty Ltd as applicant citedIn re Jellinek s Application     RPC   I think I should follow Crazy Ron s   There the date at which the validity of registration was to be tested was squarely raised  The decision on this issue was based on the definition of  applicant  in s    The relevant date was not an issue in Lomas   The Full Court did not refer to the definition of  applicant   The question there was who was the owner at the priority date  The parties were not in dispute as to the time at which to test ownership  Nor was the proper date at which the rights of the parties were to be determined an issue in Southern Cross   Further  the Trade Marks Act   contained no definition of  applicant   Kitto J s five propositions were  as his Honour said  taken from Romer J s judgment in In re Jellinek s Application     RPC   at    That was a decision under the Trade Marks Act         Geo   c   which contained no definition of  applicant
