reason of an alleged failure to comply with s  A  of the Migration Act    Cth   No Ground of Appeal seems to raise any such alleged non compliance  But that was a ground raised before the Federal Magistrate and rejected  Although not raised in the Notice of Appeal   the contention emerged in the written Outline of Submissions as filed in this Court by the Appellant  Those submissions contended that there had been a breach of s  A  by the non provision to the now Appellant of   the country information it had about Kerala and India    As explained by the Federal Magistrate  s  A  provides that such information does not fall within s  A   That   information   as is apparent from the reasons of the Tribunal  was not   about   the now Appellant  SZICU v Minister for Immigration

HCA       ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  One Ground of Appeal asserts a failure to accord procedural fairness  Reliance is placed upon Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA       ALJR     a decision which the Appellant maintains is   identical   to his own   The Notice of Appeal goes on to state      My case is identical to Muin contending a want of procedural fairness in two respects  Muin had been misled into believing that the Tribunal had read some information  which had been in part B documents  and the Tribunal had not drawn to his attention some material adverse to his claims so as to enable him to comment upon them  It is the first of those contentions  which is relevant here   In Muin the applicants had been led to believe that the Tribunal had certain documents    called the Part B documents    which had been before the delegate  Those documents were not before the Tribunal  A majority of the High Court concluded that there had been a denial of procedural fairness  Hayne J referred to an agreed statement of facts and concluded        The consequence of what has been agreed between the parties to each of the present actions is that each plaintiff was led to believe  by what the Tribunal said  that it had material relevant to that plaintiff s claim which it did not    The agreed facts are silent about whether the Tribunal was aware of the information and opinions contained in the PtB documents  It may have been  but more importantly  it may not  It follows  therefore  that in each case  the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness  Neither plaintiff was given an opportunity to place before the Tribunal the material and submissions which  on the agreed facts  it is accepted that he or she would have submitted if not mistaken about what was before the Tribunal  Moreover  it also follows from the parties  agreement that each plaintiff would have made further submissions and sought to adduce further evidence that the Tribunal did not comply with the statutory provisions governing its conduct of the reviews of the plaintiffs  cases  It did not give each plaintiff the opportunity to make the submissions or give the evidence which the plaintiff wished to make and give  For these reasons  Question   of the questions reserved should  in each case  be answered  yes    Gummow J  at   and Kirby J  at   agreed with Hayne J  Gaudron J also agreed that there had been a denial of procedural fairness   One difficulty confronting the Appellant in the present proceedings is not the principle for which Muin is authority  the Appellant s difficulty is the application of Muin to the circumstances of the present appeal   The material before the delegate is set forth in his decision dated   December    The material that was before the Tribunal is also set forth in its reasons for decision  There was no identification by the Appellant of those documents which he contended should have been before the Tribunal but were not  Generalised assertions as to a denial of procedural fairness and a citation of the decision in Muin does nothing to assist this Court in the resolution of a challenge to a decision of the Tribunal  SZJMU v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA   at   per Mansfield J   A further difficulty confronting the Appellant in his reliance upon Muin is the fact that this ground was also not raised before the Federal Magistrate for resolution  Again  it is a ground apparently inserted consequent upon the meeting with the migration agent  Again  leave to raise this as a Ground of Appeal is refused   An instance of such indiscriminate repetition of grounds advanced in other proceedings into the circumstances of the present appeal is  it is considered  exposed by the Appellant s reliance upon the decision in Muin  The documents which were not before the Tribunal in that case and which occasioned the denial of procedural fairness had been there identified as   the PtB documents    But there were no comparable documents identified in the present appeal which were said to have been not before the Tribunal and thereby denying the now Appellant of procedural fairness followedRandhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government   Ethnic Affairs     FCR   One ground  however  asserts that the Federal Magistrate failed to apply   the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR       Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government   Ethnic Affairs     FCR   was a decision of the Full Court which concerned whether a person was a refugee who could reasonably relocate within his own country  Black CJ  at     concluded in part as follows  The appellant s primary argument must be rejected  Although it is true that the Convention definition of refugee does not refer to parts or regions of a country  that provides no warrant for construing the definition so that it would give refugee status to those who  although having a well founded fear of persecution in their home region  could nevertheless avail themselves of the real protection of their country of nationality elsewhere within that country  The focus of the Convention definition is not upon the protection that the country of nationality might be able to provide in some particular region  but upon a more general notion of protection by that country  If it were otherwise  the anomalous situation would exist that the international community would be under an obligation to provide protection outside the borders of the country of nationality even though real protection could be found within those borders   Whitlam J agreed  The conclusions of the Chief Justice were further considered by the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   HCA   at       HCA       ALR   at   per Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Their Honours there accepted that the basic test is whether it is reasonable  in the sense of being practicable  for a claimant to relocate to a region where objectively there is no appreciable risk of the occurrence of the feared persecution   Leave to raise reliance upon Randhawa is refused  It is a ground which has no substance   A number of grounds assert that the Tribunal failed to consider the claims being advanced  One ground thus asserts that the Tribunal s decision failed to take   into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim    Another ground separately asserts that the   Tribunal did not take in to account certain relevant consideration or  integers  central to the applicant s claim    Other grounds refer to the   immense and intimidating pressure   to which the now Appellant was exposed and assert a failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider those matters   A number of answers may be given for rejecting these grounds   In the present proceedings  a number of the Grounds of Appeal are in substantially the same terms as were before Justice Collier in SZINP v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA    Those grounds in the present appeal provided  without alteration     The learned Federal Magistrate has dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors contained in the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal     The Federal Magistrate made a legal  factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Afairs     FCR       The Federal Magistrate failed to take consideration that the Tribunal decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim         The Tribunal applied the wrong test  Particulars  a  The Tribunal applied the wrong test  by requiring independent evidence of the fact before the Tribunal would accept a claim being made by the applicant the Tribunal was   in fact   placing high an onus of proof an the applicant and failing to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt  b  The Tribunal left out individual elements of the applicant s claims and tested whether they individually amounted to persecution rather than look at the claim as a whole to determine whether the claim so considered amount to persecution   The grounds as they were expressed in the proceedings before Collier J differed to the extent that those grounds did not refer to the Magistrate as being   learned   and did not refer to the decision in Randhawa as being a decision of the Full Court or the citation to that decision  There is not much other difference between these grounds in the present proceedings and those before Collier J   Reliance upon Randhawa may provide a further instance  The ground now relied upon in this Court did not find its counterpart in any of the grounds relied upon before the Federal Magistrate and was not mentioned in the applicant s written submissions as filed with that Court   Other parallels may also be discerned from a comparison between the grounds raised in the present proceedings and those before Collier J   The orders of the Court are     The appeal be dismissed       The Appellant to pay the costs of the First Respondent of and incidental to the appeal
