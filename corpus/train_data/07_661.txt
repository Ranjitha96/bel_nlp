SZGWJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedApplicant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Where an applicant before the tribunal explicitly adopts what he or she put to the Minister in support of the initial application for a protection visa  including adding qualifications or amendments to that claim  the applicant for review can be seen properly to have  given  the initial material to the tribunal for the purpose of his or her application for review  Applicant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Heerey  Mansfield and Emmett JJ  I am of opinion that in the circumstances of this case the tribunal was entitled to proceed on the basis that the appellant had given it the information in her protection visa application in the form of the claim which she had earlier made  It was entitled to have regard to that information without serving any notice under s  A   The submission made by RACS in April   in my opinion  expressly republished the original claim in the protection visa application for the purposes of the application for review  see also SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at          The appellant put forward no material to suggest why the tribunal could be seen to have acted in a way that was either biased or gave the appearance of bias  I reject that ground  I have considered the tribunal s reasons for myself and have not seen any basis on which prejudgment either appeared or could be suggested  Rather  the tribunal appears to have considered the appellant s claims on its merits  While s  B indicates qualification of the natural justice hearing rule  it does not qualify any obligation of the tribunal to identify the claims made by an applicant for review and to determine those claims   I now return to the first two grounds raised by the appeal citedMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The reasons of an administrative decision maker  such as the tribunal  are not to be scrutinised minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to perception of error  Rather their function is to express in the decision maker s own language the findings and reasons which s   of the Act requires him or her to give  see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ and Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ  I am of opinion that read in have regard its context  the passage which I have extracted reveals that the tribunal gave consideration to the way in which the appellant had explained her role and found that it was not as significant as her earlier claim had asserted  By saying that she had failed to repeat her earlier claim at the second hearing  the tribunal was doing no more than saying that she had not satisfied it that the claim as originally framed had been made out   The tribunal ultimately was satisfied that although the appellant had had what it described  with justification if not understatement  as  some unpleasant non Convention related experiences in the past in her village  she was not a refugee  It found that if for any reason the appellant has subjective fear of returning to her village more than   years after she ceased to occupy her position in the women s welfare group  it would be reasonable for her to go elsewhere in the province in which she lived in China  or to some other location in that country  to live  and that in those other places there was no real chance of her experiencing serious harm amounting to persecution for any Convention related reason   The tribunal did not accept that the appellant would not be able to obtain the protection of the authorities if she needed it  Although that is a factual finding that seems to be in the teeth of the evidence  which it did accept  of the substantial number of instances of harm which had befallen the appellant  nonetheless I am unable to see how the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in its assessment that the appellant could relocate within China to a place away from any danger that might have been occasioned to her from any activity she had undertaken in her village   While persecution is selective harassment  and in appropriate cases can include single acts of oppression or measures in disregard of human dignity   Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan CJ and Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  approving what McHugh J had said in Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     the activities of the individuals  which the tribunal accepted had affected the appellant and her family in her village  were not found to be activities which had a real risk of repetition elsewhere in China away from the appellant s home area   Unfortunate and terrifying as the assaults and intimidating behaviour found by the tribunal to have been suffered by the appellant were  I am not able to detect any jurisdictional error in the way in which the tribunal characterised that activity as not having been suffered by her for a Convention reason   In those circumstances I am unable to perceive a basis upon which the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error  or it could be said that his Honour failed to identify one  It follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs       I certify that the preceding twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares    Associate Dated
