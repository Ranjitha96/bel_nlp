SZHYI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toDecor Corporation v Dart Industries Inc     FCR  On   March   the applicant filed a notice of appeal from the decision in this Court  Rule     of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules   makes it clear that an order for dismissal under paragraph  a  is an interlocutory order  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs filed a notice of objection to competency of the appeal and submits that the appeal is not competent in the absence of a grant of leave to appeal  In my opinion  that submission is correct  The order made by the Magistrate is interlocutory  and under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  leave to appeal is required  The Minister does not object to me treating the purported notice of appeal as an application for leave to appeal  and I think that that is the appropriate course  The test for granting leave to appeal is well known and I will not repeat it  Decor Corporation v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at      The applicant is a citizen of the People s Republic of China  and she arrived in Australia on   March    On   April   she lodged an application for a protection  Class XA  visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs under the Act  On   August   a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused to grant a protection visa  On   September   the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of that decision  The applicant was born on   March   and she claims that she is one of the leaders of Falon Gong in Shanghai  China  She claims that the Chinese authorities regard Falon Gong as an illegal organisation  She claims that she helped to organise a number of activities related to Falon Gong  She claims that she was warned about her involvement in Falon Gong by the local police and local government  She claims that in April   she was put into detention for one month  She claims that in October   she was ordered to attend a  re education  centre for two months  She claims that in May   she was imprisoned for one week because an unidentified person told the police that she practised Falon Gong every day  On   September   the Tribunal wrote to the applicant and advised her that it had considered the material before it in relation to the application  but was unable to make a decision in her favour on that information alone  The applicant was invited to attend a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of her claims  She was told that if she did not attend the hearing and if the Tribunal did not postpone the hearing  then the Tribunal could make a decision on her case without further notice  She was advised that the proposed hearing would take place on   October    The applicant did not attend the proposed hearing of the Tribunal
