Coshott v Barry   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAgrillo v Codisposto  unreported  Federal Court  Sackville J    December  His Honour made the following observations    It is not only on the hearing of a petition that the Court may  go behind  the judgment giving rise to the judgment debt on which the petitioning creditor relies  the judgment debt can be impeached on a notice to set aside a bankruptcy notice  at  D       His Honour noted the different approaches of Kiefel J in Re Baker  Ex parte Baker v Staples  unreported  Federal Court  Kiefel J    September   and Sheppard J in Re Geard  Ex parte Reid  unreported  Federal Court  Sheppard J    February   and to later decisions in which Geard was followed     In the course of his judgment in Geard   Sheppard J had taken on board the following considerations   a  The debtor had not made any application for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal   b  an application to extend time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice is not the hearing of a bankruptcy petition  The refusal of the application will not affect the status of the debtor but it will mean that he  in all probability  will commit an act of bankruptcy   c  if the appeal is ultimately dismissed and the judgment stands with the consequence that the bankruptcy proceedings go on  it may be quite important to the petitioning creditor  whoever he or she may be  to the general body of creditors and to the trustee in bankruptcy  that there be  for the purposes of the administration of the bankrupt estate  an act of bankruptcy committed at an earlier time than would be the case if the application were acceded to     The approach adopted by Sheppard J was followed by Whitlam J in Re Smith  unreported  Federal Court    May   and by Sackville J in Agrillo v Codisposto  unreported  Federal Court  Sackville J    December   referred toAustralian Securities and Investment Commission v Forge   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn other words  the first application was to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice  There is no express power in the Act to do so but it is common ground that it is within the general powers of the Court conferred by s   of the Act  see Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Forge   FCAFC         FCR   at   per Emmett J  There are  in my view  a number of problems with Mrs Coshott s application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice  not the least of which are    Her amended application of   October   was not accompanied by an affidavit which complied with r     of the Federal Court  Bankruptcy  Rules   in that the affidavit did not set out the grounds in support of the application to set aside  Arguably  Mrs Coshott s affidavit of   October   filed in support of her amended application of   October   set out the grounds upon which she sought an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice in compliance with r     but even that is not beyond argument  But even if she did  that would not satisfy the requirements of r     which requires the affidavit to set out the grounds in support of the application to set aside  As was noted in Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FMCA     a failure to address the material requirements of r      in that case it was r     of the Federal Magistrates Court  Bankruptcy  Rules  but they are in the same terms  will normally be fatal to an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice     Second  counsel for Mrs Coshott did not articulate any grounds upon which the application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice was founded  The best one can find is at para   of his written submissions where it is put        The application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice is underlying  the  application to set aside the Certificate of Determination  of Costs   in  the District Court            With respect  that is not a proper ground in support of Mrs Coshott s application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice  As was said by Emmett J in Forge at        T he Act gives no general discretion to set aside bankruptcy notices that are valid in form and not an abuse of process  The Act permits the issue of a bankruptcy notice and  if the notice is valid  prescribes the consequences to the bankrupt of non compliance  The grounds upon which a bankruptcy notice may be set aside must relate to the form or content of the notice  service of the notice or the existence of the debt upon which the judgment  and  in turn  the notice  is founded  Reference to the existence of a debt includes the existence of a counterclaim  set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the debt  Re Briggs  Ex parte Briggs v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  WA      FCR     Re Athans  Ex parte Athans     FCR    Since jurisdiction to set aside a defective bankruptcy notice is not a general discretionary jurisdiction  it differs from the jurisdiction to make a sequestration order under s   which is expressly discretionary referred toAustralian Shepherd v Chiquita Brands South Pacific Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe second application sought an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice in reliance on s  A  of the Act pending the outcome of Mrs Coshott s notice of motion filed on   October   in proceeding No     As Hill and Marshall JJ observed in Shepherd v Chiquita Brands South Pacific Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at         Clearly s  A  was intended to be in aid of the application to set aside     the bankruptcy notice          See too Re Sterling  Ex parte Esanda Ltd   FCA         FLR   at   consideredByron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd     FCR  In Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd     FCR     Lehane J undertook a comprehensive review of the considerations that had been taken into account in other cases involving the exercise of the discretion under s  A    although  and it almost goes without saying  the considerations to which his Honour referred were conditioned by the facts of the case in respect of which the exercise of his discretion was called for  At   Lehane J went on to reason      In my view the considerations to which Sheppard J refers indicate that the principles to be applied where the question is whether a petition should be adjourned or dismissed are not necessarily those which should guide the exercise of the discretion to set aside  or extend time for compliance with  a bankruptcy notice  The commission of an act of bankruptcy is  undoubtedly  a serious matter  it is  however  of a different order of gravity from the change of status brought about by the making of a sequestration order  and there is also to be taken into account the interest of both the judgment creditor and other creditors of the judgment debtor in ensuring that  if ultimately a sequestration order is made  the relevant act of bankruptcy occurs earlier rather than later  In Conway v Jackson at   the Full Court said      In exercising the discretion whether or not to extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice  the creditor should not be routinely frustrated from enforcing the judgment by the device of the institution of an appeal  Section  C    to an extent  recognises that position  Moreover  the date of the commission of the act of bankruptcy is significant to determine the commencement of the bankruptcy if a sequestration order is made  s     and so to determining the property of the bankrupt which is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt  s    It also has significance to the application of ss           and   of the Act  The delay in the commission of the act of bankruptcy  if ultimately the requirements of a bankruptcy notice are not complied with and a sequestration order is made  by an extension of time to comply with a bankruptcy notice may therefore have significant consequences to the creditors of the bankrupt  An extension of time to comply with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice does not  on the other hand  preclude any other judgment creditor from procuring the issue and service of a bankruptcy notice  or from presenting a petition for a sequestration order if some other act of bankruptcy has already been committed  Such considerations  if significant in the particular circumstances  together with other considerations relevant to the circumstances of the particular case  will no doubt be considered by the Court in exercising its discretion under s  A  of the Act  see for example the discussion by Lehane J in Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd     FCR    However  such considerations are properly left to the Court in exercising its discretion whether to extend time for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice  Counsel for Mrs Coshott submitted that a further extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice should be allowed in terms of the amended order sought in the amended application by reference to the following considerations    The discretion to grant an extension of time for compliance is  at large  Re

FCA  htmlCounsel for Mrs Coshott further relied on what a Full Court of this Court said in Conway v Jackson   FCA         FCR   at         We do not agree that the language of s  A a  is apt only to encompass an application to set aside a judgment or order where there has been a failure to follow the rules of procedure or where there is shown to be some defect or irregularity or some other circumstance which renders it desirable that the debtor should be given an opportunity to have the issue further litigated  and so as to exclude proceedings by way of appeal which may result in the judgment being set aside  It does not seem to accord with any legitimate policy consideration that a debtor whose careless or delictual conduct has allowed judgment to pass by default should be in any better position than a judgment debtor who has unsuccessfully but conscientiously defended a claim and succeeds in having the judgment set aside on appeal       Earlier  at   the Court had said       W e are of the view that the expression  proceedings to set aside the judgment or order  includes the institution of an appeal from the judgment or order in respect of which the bankruptcy notice was issued where that appeal does in reality seek to have that judgment or order set aside  I am satisfied that I have jurisdiction to entertain Mrs Coshott s application for an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice based on the existence of proceeding No    in the District Court and the terms of para  a  of s  A  of the Act  The only remaining issue is how I should exercise my discretion  to further extend the time beyond the extensions already made  or to decline to do so  In Conway v Jackson at   the Full Court said      In exercising the discretion whether or not to extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice  the creditor should not be routinely frustrated from enforcing the judgment by the device of the institution of an appeal  Section  C    to an

delay in the commission of the act of bankruptcy  if ultimately the requirements of a bankruptcy notice are not complied with and a sequestration order is made  by an extension of time to comply with a bankruptcy notice may therefore have significant consequences to the creditors of the bankrupt  An extension of time to comply with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice does not  on the other hand  preclude any other judgment creditor from procuring the issue and service of a bankruptcy notice  or from presenting a petition for a sequestration order if some other act of bankruptcy has already been committed  Such considerations  if significant in the particular circumstances  together with other considerations relevant to the circumstances of the particular case  will no doubt be considered by the Court in exercising its discretion under s  A  of the Act  see for example the discussion by Lehane J in Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd     FCR    However  such considerations

austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlCounsel for Mrs Coshott submitted that the fact that it was not sought to set aside the judgment in proceeding No    but rather the underlying certificate of determination which had merged into the judgment is of no import because the judgment is liable to be set aside or varied if the certificate on which it is based is set aside or varied  Reliance was placed on what was said by Hodgson JA  with whom Mason P and Campbell JA agreed  in Doyle v Hall Chadwick   NSWCA   at   to    What was said there was said in relation to s  J  of the Legal Profession

judgment upon which the Bankruptcy Notice is based and no suspension of the costs assessor s determination or decision  But both were sought and refused on jurisdictional grounds  see   and   above  The contrast with Geard and Byron is clear citedRe Smith  unreported  Federal Court    May  His Honour made the following observations    It is not only on the hearing of a petition that the Court may  go behind  the judgment giving rise to the judgment debt on which the petitioning creditor relies  the judgment debt can be impeached on a notice to set aside a bankruptcy notice  at  D       His Honour noted the different approaches of Kiefel J in Re Baker  Ex parte Baker v Staples  unreported  Federal Court  Kiefel J    September   and Sheppard J in Re Geard  Ex parte Reid  unreported  Federal Court  Sheppard J    February   and to later decisions in which Geard was followed     In the course of his judgment in Geard   Sheppard J had taken on board the following considerations   a  The debtor had not made any application for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal   b  an application to extend time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice is not the hearing of a bankruptcy petition  The refusal of the application will not affect the status of the debtor but it will mean that he  in all probability  will commit an act of bankruptcy   c  if the appeal is ultimately dismissed and the judgment stands with the consequence that the bankruptcy proceedings go on  it may be quite important to the petitioning creditor  whoever he or she may be  to the general body of creditors and to the trustee in bankruptcy  that there be  for the purposes of the administration of the bankrupt estate  an act of bankruptcy committed at an earlier time than would be the case if the application were acceded to     The approach adopted by Sheppard J was followed by Whitlam J in Re Smith  unreported  Federal Court    May   and by Sackville J in Agrillo v Codisposto

JJ observed in Shepherd v Chiquita Brands South Pacific Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at         Clearly s  A  was intended to be in aid of the application to set aside     the bankruptcy notice          See too

went on to observe that considerable weight should be given to the circumstance that in the case before him  as in Geard   no stay has been granted  or  apparently  sought  of the judgment supporting the bankruptcy notice  It did not follow that other matters were not to be taken into account  the discretion is  at large    Re Taylor  Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    FCA         FLR   at    Counsel for Mrs Coshott submitted that a further extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice should be allowed in terms of the amended order sought in the amended application by reference to the following considerations    The discretion to grant an extension of time for compliance is  at large  Re Taylor at   Byron at       While there is no stay in place  the application for a stay of proceeding No    having been dismissed on   November   it was dismissed on jurisdictional  rather than discretionary  grounds  Considerable weight should only be given to the absence of a stay of the underlying judgment   Byron at  G  Geard  in the passage quoted in Byron at  G  if the court that granted the judgment had jurisdiction and power to grant a stay  In circumstances such as the present  where the court that issued the judgment has determined that it has no jurisdiction to grant a stay  the absence of a stay should  in relation to the discretion under s  A    be viewed as carrying no weight  rather than  considerable weight      Only a short amount of time is likely to be involved in any extension of time  as the proceeding in the District Court is of limited scope     If Mrs Coshott succeeds in the District Court to any extent  she will be entitled to an order setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice  Halstead v Westpac Banking Corporation
