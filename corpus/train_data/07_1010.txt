Carnegie Corporation Limited v Pursuit Dynamics Plc Corrigendum dated   July     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAir Services Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Order  A is premised upon the proposition that the discovery sought  whether it be identity discovery under r   or discovery to enable the applicant to decide whether it has the right to obtain relief  relates to the prospective invocation of the jurisdiction of the Court in a claim for relief against an identified or yet to be identified respondent  Finn J put it thus in Air Services Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    at            Ordinarily a court s jurisdiction is enlivened by an initiating process seeking a determination of the substantive claim one party alleges it has against another  But     such need not necessarily be the case  Necessity may require otherwise if a person s right is to be vindicated in a substantive claim  Preliminary discovery of the types provided in O  A rr   and   have long been accepted as a proper and appropriate precursor to the making of a substantive claim and appropriate because it assists in the administration of justice in relation to the making of the claim itself  There is no reason for present purposes to distinguish between the two types of discovery  Each reflects a different necessity                 Though in form a discrete proceeding  as was the old bill of discovery  see the quotation from Story   preliminary discovery is  as a matter of substance  properly to be regarded as interlocutory in character in that it does not  nor is it intended to  determine finally the rights inter se of the parties to the substantive application  cf Malouf v Malouf     FCA       FCR    Its function rather is to assist in that determination when or if the substantive application is brought consequent upon what is revealed in the preliminary discovery itself                 In consequence I consider an O  A order for preliminary discovery to be an unexceptionable exercise of judicial power when made in relation to the matter necessitating the making of the order citedKirella Pty Ltd v Hooper   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Tamberlin J  like Finn J  had been confronted with a challenge to the validity of O  A in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper   FCA         FCR    He held that the rule did not purport to confer jurisdiction on the Court  Rather it was      an exercise of the rule making power by the judges in accordance with s   of the Federal Court Act    And further  at         The Court has the necessary jurisdiction because  at the time when preliminary discovery is sought in the present case  there is a matter in existence and the grant of preliminary discovery is an exercise of power with respect to that matter     The Full Court dismissed an appeal against the decision of Tamberlin

the point whether an application for preliminary discovery is an originating process in a proceeding  There is analogous authority in relation to like processes  In Re Sherlock     ALR   Lockhart J held that an application for orders that persons be directed to attend before the Court for examination under the provisions of the Corporations Law was not an originating process  In this his Honour followed Re Austral Oil Estates Ltd  in liq      FLR   at   a decision of McLelland J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to an examination order under s   of the Companies  NSW  Code which was the predecessor of s   of the Corporations Law  In neither of those judgments was there any elaboration of the characterisation of an application for examination as falling outside the concept of  originating process    In Fiorentino v Irons     FCR   Foster J declined to follow what he characterised as the obiter observations of Lockhart J in Re Sherlock   ALR    He noted that the decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court turned upon the precise meaning of the Supreme Court Rules   He made the point that they were not framed in the same way as the Federal Court Rules were at that time  In particular  there was then no definition of  originating process  in either the Federal Court Rules or the Federal Court Act  His Honour relied upon the definition of  proceeding  in the Act  He said it was a very wide definition and he was satisfied that the issue of summons for examination was a proceeding  As to the width of the term  proceeding  his Honour referred to Re Interchase Corporation Ltd     FCR   at    Kiefel J  and Pasdale Pty Ltd v Concrete Constructions     FCR   at    Finn J   In the latter case Finn J said      The definition of  proceeding  in the
