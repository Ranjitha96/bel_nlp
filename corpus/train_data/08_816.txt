html  A few additional words should be said in relation to the Applicant s argument under reg    a i   The Respondent accepts that he did not consider the Applicant s registration under reg    a i   That is not surprising  He was not asked to do so  The fact that the Applicant did not ask to be registered under reg    a i  undermines his assignment of error at both the administrative and judicial review levels  With respect to the administrative level  the rule is that the decision maker is not obligated to make a party s case for them  Abebe v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     The Applicant acknowledges this rule but submits that he did make his case in his application for registration that he had  been employed as required by paragraph  c  of the   Patents  Act   I do not accept that this general statement was sufficient to put the Respondent on notice that the Applicant was making a case under reg    a i   I also do not accept the Applicant s submission that the  Respondent is required at law to consider each of the provisions of     before he can find that a person does not satisfy them   In the absence of evidence or materials that would clearly put an administrative decision maker on notice of an unarticulated claim  there is no affirmative burden on the decision maker to scour the papers and the legislation sua sponte to see if there is a basis on which a party s case may succeed  NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  No     FCAFC         FCR   at         Hill v Repatriation Commission     ALR   at      I am satisfied that neither the Applicant s general statements that he had met the employment qualification nor any of the supporting materials he filed with the Respondent were such as to squarely raise his current claim that he was employed as his own  or anyone else s  technical assistant citedAttorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Before turning to consider each of the grounds of review  it must be noted that  to a significant extent  the Applicant s written and oral submissions proceeded  or at least appeared to proceed  on the premise that the Court s task involved a reconsideration of the merits of the decision  That premise is not correct  As was said by Brennan J in Attorney General  NSW  v Quin   HCA         CLR   at     The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository s power  If  in so doing  the court avoids administrative injustice or error  so be it  but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error  The merits of administrative action  to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality  are for the repository of the relevant power and  subject to political control  for the repository alone   It is not disputed that the factors the Respondent was required to take into account were affected by the proper construction of reg    a   The issue was whether the Respondent s construction of reg      see   above  was the proper construction  In my view  subject to one exception which did not affect the Applicant adversely  it was the proper construction   The Respondent concluded that reg    a ii  refers to employment in a company or firm in which an employee undertakes patent work for that company or firm and does not extend to include experience in a law firm undertaken on behalf of client companies or firms  Again  subject to one issue which does not affect the outcome of the current application  the Respondent s construction was consistent with the express words of the   Patents Act and the Regulations   The Applicant nevertheless submitted that if that was the object of the legislation and the Regulations  then the regulation is both over and under inclusive  It is over inclusive in the Applicant s submission because a person who is employed as a technical assistant for one year but spends the whole year making photocopies will nevertheless qualify for registration even though he or she has gained no experience with patent specifications  It is under inclusive because a person who has spent a year drafting patent specifications under the supervision of a registered practitioner outside a traditional patent practice or a corporate context  eg at a university legal department  may not qualify for registration   Whether the Respondent would or should consider a university legal department under those circumstances as a  patent attorney s practice  within the meaning of reg    a i  is an interesting question   These criticisms  though not without force  do not advance the Applicant s case  Every system of rules based credentialing  and every bright line rule generally  suffers from the same flaws  no doubt there are many articled clerks who spend two years in a conference room reviewing documents and never learn to draft a pleading or a contract  and  no doubt  there are many   year olds who are mature enough to vote  and some   year olds who are not   Despite these drawbacks  bright line rules are preferred over case by case decision making in many instances because it is judged by the rule making authority where the advantages in administrative efficiency  transparency  and certainty outweigh the disadvantages of over and under inclusiveness  Ultimately  the Applicant s case boils down to the complaint that the Regulations are unfair and ought to be redrawn  However  the rule the Applicant seeks  whereby an Australian legal practitioner  having provided patent advice for the requisite period  is exempted from having to obtain further work experience in order to become a registered patent attorney  is a matter for government to provide for  not the courts  While the rejection of his application by the Respondent may seem unjust to the Applicant  it must be remembered in considering an application for judicial review that  the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice  Quin   HCA         CLR   at     For the foregoing reasons  the Applicant s construction point fails citedBiochem Pharma Inc v Commissioner of Patents     FCR   A number of principles emerge from consideration of these provisions of the   Patents Act   First  the Act recognises the existence and separate roles of registered patent attorneys and legal practitioners  ss     and    Secondly  both registered patent attorneys and legal practitioners may apply for or obtain patents  prepare documents for the purposes of the   Patents Act and give advice  other than advice of a scientific or technical nature  about the validity or infringement of patents  ss   and   and see also Biochem Pharma Inc v Commissioner of Patents     FCR        per Hill J   However  only a registered patent attorney  or a legal practitioner under the instruction of a registered patent attorney  may draft patent specifications or a document relating to an amendment of a specification  s    Finally  ss   to   exempt from the area of work restricted to registered patent attorneys  work done for an employer  or a company which is a member of the same group as the person s employer   Accordingly  individuals and companies may prosecute their own patent applications and draft their own patent specifications  The last principle reinforces that reg    a ii  of the Act  properly construed  permits experience gained whilst employed by a company engaged in their own patent applications and specifications as relevant experience for the purposes of registration as a patent attorney   None of those provisions support the contention that reg    a i  and   or  ii  should be construed to include a person in the position of the Applicant as having the necessary work experience to qualify as a registered patent attorney  As noted earlier  the   Patents Act clearly marks out the drafting of patent specifications as the exclusive domain of registered patent attorneys  Read in that context  that the three categories of work experience in reg    a  should be directed toward the acquisition of experience in the construction and drafting of specifications is neither anomalous nor unreasonable   Since   the patents legislation and regulations have been the subject of a number of reviews  recommendations and changes  The Respondent submitted  and I accept  that since the  s a number of themes have emerged from the patents legislation and the regulations as they have existed from time to time  first  a concern with protecting the public from unqualified and inexperienced persons undertaking work in relation to patents  secondly  the introduction in the  s and the  s of increasing degrees of competition  and  thirdly  an attempt to balance those two themes  see Biochem   FCR   at    The balance has been achieved in three ways    acknowledgement that prior to registration as a patent attorney  relevant experience may be gained in the public or private sector    acknowledgement that the business of registered patent attorneys and legal practitioners overlaps but that registered patent attorneys  or legal practitioners under the instruction of a registered patent attorney  retain the exclusive right to draft patent specifications  and   adoption of a narrow exemption that permits persons to continue to prosecute their own patent applications or those of their employers   In the early  s  the  employment as prescribed  requirement prior to registration was limited to employment for a period by a patent attorney  The period was six months for persons who had previously been employed in the Patents Office as an examiner for a prescribed period and  in other cases  for not less than one year  ss  e      and   and   of the   Patents Act and reg   of the Patent Attorneys Regulations    Cth    In a report to the Minister for Science and Technology dated   August   from the Industrial Property Advisory Committee entitled  Patents  Innovation and Competition  the Committee recommended  inter alia   that the qualifying period in employment be made a uniform period of   months in the public and the private sector  recommendation  iii   The Committee explained the role of Patent Attorneys in the following terms  see para     and     Patent attorneys are a body of professionals specialising in patent law and practice  and particularly in the searching  preparation  and prosecution of patent applications in Australia and abroad  While patent applicants may prosecute their own applications before the Office  patent attorneys have the exclusive right under the Patents Act to prepare specifications for a fee  so they have an effective professional monopoly to handle patent applications  They advise clients in relation to patent validity and infringement and also deal with trade marks  industrial designs  and licensing  The care and skill with which patent applications are prepared materially influence the scope and value of the protection obtained under a patent  The drafting of patent specifications and claims requires special skill and knowledge of the applicable law and practice  as well as a capacity to understand the technology involved  No amount of legal skill will avail if the subject matter is not understood  If Australian inventors are to obtain adequate protection for their inventions here and abroad  the assistance of people possessing these attributes must be available in Australia      We have already commented on the important service role which patent attorneys play in preparing and filing patent applications in Australia and abroad  We believe that it is appropriate for the drafting and filing of patent specifications for reward to be the exclusive domain of a trained and regulated professional body  The work is highly technical and it is an integral part of the whole process of effective innovation      The Committee therefore accepts that a limited monopoly of practice by patent attorneys should be retained   Emphasis added

meaning  While purpose may sometimes be used to add  subtract  or clarify words in a statute or regulation   Saraswati   HCA       CLR   at       where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning  the grammatical meaning is  the ordinary meaning  to be applied  A court cannot depart from  the ordinary meaning  of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies     See also SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC   at        noting that where a party contends that a provision should not be given its literal or plain meaning  such a contention may lack force absent a plausible competing construction   The only exception to this rule is where the ordinary meaning would lead not just to an anomaly  but to a result that is  manifestly absurd  or  unreasonable  Saraswati   HCA       CLR   at   see also Chiropedic Bedding

all of the relevant facts that would establish beyond controversy that the Applicant has been employed as a technical assistant are before the Court  In particular  the record does not disclose that the Applicant has ever drafted a patent specification or prosecuted a patent  which is not surprising  given that evidence to that effect might also suggest that the Applicant had committed an offence

cth FCA  html  The Applicant placed considerable emphasis on the absence of the word  registered  in reg    a i   As the Respondent submitted  the omission is  curious   However  the omission does not assist the Applicant for at least two reasons  First  as Heerey J noted in Eli Lilly   Company v Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals  No     FCA         FCR   at      registered patent attorneys  in s   of the   Patents Act means registered in Australia  If that is correct  and it was not suggested that his Honour was wrong  the practical effect of the omission may be no more than a recognition that applicants who have worked overseas as a technical assistant for a patent attorney who is not registered under the   Patents Act   may still satisfy the employment requirement of reg    a i   Secondly  even if it were accepted that reg    a i  is not referring to a registered patent attorney  a submission I do not accept  the Applicant would have to demonstrate that he has been employed as a technical assistant in the practice of a patent attorney  practicing as a patent attorney within the meaning of s   of the   Patents Act   As a matter of ordinary English syntax  one cannot be employed as an assistant to oneself  thus the Applicant cannot satisfy the criterion of having been employed as a technical assistant in a patent attorney s practice discussedEshetu v Minister for

that his   October   rejection of the Applicant s application was for the same reason as his   August   tentative rejection   namely  that even accepting that all of the material provided by the Applicant was true and correct  the Applicant failed as a matter of law to satisfy the requirements of reg    a    and did not turn on any credibility or evidentiary issues  That the Respondent had

As noted earlier  a review of the statutory context  legislative history  and legislative purpose reveals an attempt to balance two competing objects    the need to reduce barriers to entry and competition and thus reduce costs of patent attorney services  while   maintaining strict professional qualification requirements and thus safeguarding the public interest in receiving only high quality services  This understanding of context and purpose does not throw doubt on the construction of reg    a  such as required by the High Court in Saraswati to justify judicial amendment of a statute or regulation that departs from the ordinary meaning  The legislative and regulatory scheme has hit on a compromise whereby in house corporate patent practice  which would tend to be focused much more on out of court matters such as patent drafting and prosecution  but not ordinary law firm practice  which would tend to focus more on the giving of advice with respect to court related matters such as validity and infringement proceedings  satisfies the registration requirements  This is entirely consistent with a legislative objective of partial deregulation while ensuring that high standards are maintained with respect to the complex technical arena of patent drafting and prosecution referred toSalomon v Salomon   Co Ltd   AC   The Applicant contended that the reference to

the reg    a i  argument in this Court   i t is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law  SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at    citations omitted  emphasis added  see also Commonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR    stating that failure to timely raise a point may be deemed waiver of that point   In the instant case  it is at best questionable whether all of the relevant facts that would establish beyond controversy that the Applicant has been employed as a technical assistant are before the Court  In particular  the record does not disclose that the Applicant has ever drafted a patent specification or prosecuted a patent  which is not surprising  given that evidence to that effect might also suggest that the Applicant had committed an offence under s   of the   Patents Act   cf Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd   NSWSC   at    suggesting that a  technical assista nt  is one who has the duty of prosecuting patent applications on behalf of clients  under the supervision of a registered patent attorney   Even accepting the Applicant s statutory declaration at face value  it states only that he has  liaised with patent attorneys in relation to the preparation and filing of patent specifications on behalf of  his  clients   Accordingly  the Applicant s claim under reg    a i  would ordinarily fail at the outset both because it was not clearly raised below and because not all of the facts necessary to make good the point have been established beyond controversy citedSZKTI v Minister for

documents  specifically  memoranda from the Acting Secretary of the Professional Standards Board for Patent and Trade Marks Attorneys dated   October and   October   which contain no more than opinions on  or rejections of  the Applicant s material  That premise is wrong  An applicant in an administrative context is entitled to comment only on adverse information that is  credible  relevant and significant  Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Miah   HCA         CLR   at     and VEAL   HCA       CLR   at   and     Credible  relevant and significant  material is  information that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision maker before making the decision  VEAL   HCA       CLR   at     As the Respondent s letters of   August     and   October   and   November   demonstrate  the Respondent took the consistent view that the Applicant did not satisfy the requirements of reg    a  based on a plain reading of the regulation  There is no evidence that the Respondent could not or did not dismiss from further consideration the Acting Secretary s opinions of the Applicant s material  given that his   October   rejection of the Applicant s application was for the same reason as his   August   tentative rejection   namely  that even accepting that all of the material provided by the Applicant was true and correct  the Applicant failed as a matter of law to satisfy the requirements of reg    a    and did not turn on any credibility or evidentiary issues  That the Respondent had already tentatively reached that view before ever receiving the October memoranda from the Acting Secretary conclusively demonstrates that the memoranda played no part  much less a significant one  in the Respondent s consideration or decision citedZhang De Yong v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethic Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Thirdly  there was no requirement for the Respondent to provide the Applicant with an oral hearing  Not only is there no general rule that decision makers making a decision affecting a person are bound to conduct a face to face interview or a hearing  see Zhang De Yong v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethic Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   but the express words of reg     refer to written  not oral  forms of application  Even if  contrary to the view I have formed  the Respondent was obliged to provide the Applicant with an oral hearing  a view I reject  that oral hearing could not have produced a different result for the reasons discussed above
