conclusion does not exclude the possibility of a claim by Olivaylle for relief under the TPA  The following observations made by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems    Developments  Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd     FCR   at     are apposite      The result of this examination of the provisions of the legislation before and after the   Act is that para       a  in dealing with  conduct  operates generally  in its terms  so that the T P  Act after the   Act  was to be read as  one connected and combined statement of the will of Parliament       Sweeney v Fitzhardinge     HCA         CLR   at    So understood  para       a  provides significant support for the conclusion reached in this case by the primary Judge  and for the general proposition that the making of a statement as to a presently existing state of affairs  if false  may be the engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct  where the statement is embodied as a provision of a contract  In many cases  there will have been pre contractual conduct which itself contravenes s     The present case is a striking one because it was presented on a narrower basis  and concerned the giving of the warranties in the contract itself        Where the conduct relied upon involves not a statement as to a presently existing state of affairs  but a representation with respect to a future matter  which is contained purely in a contractual promise  then a case for contravention of s    will involve consideration of the extra steps spelled out in s   A of the T P  Act  Some of the issues that would arise in such a case are discussed by Ormiston J in Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR   at     where reference is made to the relevant authorities in this Court  But this is not a case concerning representations as to future conduct appliedBP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings     CLR  In Reigate v Union Manufacturing Co  Ramsbottom  Ltd     KB   at   in a passage cited with approval by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in an Australian appeal  BP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings     CLR   at   Scrutton LJ said    A term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract i e   if it is such a term that it can confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated some one had said to the parties   What will happen in such a case  they would both have replied   Of course  so and so will happen  we did not trouble to say that  it is too clear   Lord Justice Mackinnon made observations to like effect in relation to the implication of a contractual term in Shirlaw v Southern Foundries   Ltd     KB   at   in a passage which also commended itself to the Judicial Committee in BP Westernport Case  ibid   That they did so did not relieve Flottweg of all design responsibility  so far as the supply of a line  N  flushed  from the malaxeurs is concerned  It necessarily followed  in order to give business efficacy to the contractual specification of the level of exclusion of atmospheric oxygen to be achieved   BP Refinery  Westernport  Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings   supra  that the equipment in the line from the malaxeurs on which Flottweg supplied at least had design features  or could be modified as contractually anticipated  so as at least to achieve that specification with an occupationally safe and commercially feasible supply of nitrogen of sufficient purity  As to what this might be  Mr Carey did not offer an opinion  Mr Nieuwkerk  who undertook the design and who consulted Mr Lorenz and Dr Paterson  did  When Mr Nieuwkerk had the benefit of a range of data not available to him when working on the plant during the test conducted on   May   or  because of Olivaylle s belated attention to the rigour of its discovery obligation  when giving his initial affidavit in these proceedings  he came in his further affidavit to express the following opinion concerning the required sufficiency of nitrogen for the production line in its condition as last encountered by him in     It is apparent that the filing and emptying of the malaxeurs has much less effect on the oxygen levels than I first thought  In particular       the fact that oxygen levels were able to remain under   during the filling and emptying of the second run of malaxeur   suggests that the volume of additional nitrogen required to ensure that oxygen levels were maintained at similar levels in the other malaxeurs may not be as much as I     estimated  in an earlier affidavit   Accordingly  my estimate  in  my earlier affidavit that the volume of nitrogen necessary to operate at below   might be in the order of   cubic metres per hour  now appears to be high      The data also confirms my previous view that the nitrogen supply to the malaxeurs should be maintained continuously during the harvesting season  including when the system was not actively processing olives  This is because it was my observation  consistent with my experience  that were the oxygen levels were brought down to low levels prior to the start of processing those low levels were able to be maintained  For example  on each of the   st April     th April   and   May   where the levels were brought down to below   prior to the commencement of processing  in most cases  those levels were able to be maintained throughout the process run      In my opinion  having observed the operation of the plant in   and   and now having the benefit of the data on the compact disc and Daily Data Sheets  if the available supply of nitrogen was doubled to   cubic metres per hour  which is the expanded maximum capacity of the existing nitrogen generator  this may be sufficient to maintain oxygen levels of below   in all parts of the plant through the process     Emphasis added   In his oral evidence  Mr Nieuwkerk explained what he meant by the word  may  in his opinion as to sufficiency of nitrogen supply  The answer he gave was  should  ie more likely than not  It was well within his expertise to express such an opinion  I recall also that  in relation to the task of the provision of sufficient nitrogen and sufficient purity  Nr Nieuwkerk was retained by Olivaylle  not by Flottweg  The following excerpt  taken from Mr Nieuwkerk s later affidavit  offers a convenient summary both of his views and those initially given by Mr Carey in relation to the further data    At paragraph     and      of his affidavit  Mr Carey sets out his observations in relation to the oxygen sensor data for the test on   May   which appears on the compact disc which is marked as Exhibit ADC  to Mr Carey s affidavit  I was at the plant during the   May   test  I have reviewed the material on the compact disc in detail  I have also been given and have reviewed a bundle of documents which are described as the  Daily Data  sheets for various days during the   and   harvests  Daily Data Sheets   A folder which contains copies of the Daily Data Sheets that I have been provided is exhibited to me and is marked  DWN    The Daily Data Sheets in DWN   are in chronological order separated by numbered tabs  I did not have access to the Daily Data Sheets or the information on the compact disc at the time of the test in   or at any time prior to swearing my earlier affidavit  According to my recollection of the events of   May   along with these additional materials now made available to me it appears to me that a number of statements made by Mr Carey in paragraphs     and      of his affidavit  are incorrect as follows       i  at paragraph     Mr Carey states that in the time immediately before    pm the level of oxygen in the malaxeur  rose sharply to around the atmospheric level of      This is incorrect  The data shows that the only changes in recorded oxygen levels during this period were as follows     A  At    pm and   seconds the oxygen level is recorded at      B  At    pm and   seconds the oxygen level is recorded as dropping to      C  At    pm and   seconds the recorded oxygen level is recorded as rising at      D  At    pm and   seconds the oxygen level is recorded as rising to      E  At    pm and   seconds the oxygen level is recorded as dropping to         It is apparent from the data  and as Mr Carey states at paragraph       that there is a sampling interval of   minutes  that is  a single fresh reading is only taken every   minutes  despite the spreadsheets included on the compact disc reporting values for every   second interval   With respect to the recorded drop from above   to below   at    pm  as opposed to the rise referred to by Mr Carey  I say that in my experience such a drop is impossible to achieve in   minutes in a vessel the size of a malaxeur with a maximum available nitrogen supply of   cubic metres per hour  I believe that this data reflects the sensor being switched at that time from sampling the outside air to sampling the atmosphere in the malaxeur  This is only the explanation that is consistent with the very sharp changes in the oxygen levels  If correct  the data for the time immediately prior to    pm does not record the oxygen levels inside the malaxeur at all and is irrelevant to any assessment of whether the malaxeur was sufficiently sealed prior to that time  I note also that for the   minute cycle between    pm and    pm the reading is zero  This indicates  as Mr Carey states at       that the sensor was not functioning at that time      Mr Carey states that the second time in the day that the level of oxygen was below   in malaxeur   was between    pm and  pm  when the malaxeur was empty and closed after the last batch of olive paste during the day s run had been malaxed   This is not correct  The Daily Data Sheet for   May    a copy of which is at Tab   of DWN   shows that malaxeur   was filled and emptied during that time  In particular  it commenced filling at    pm  it was full by    pm  it started to empty at    pm and it was not completely empty until  pm  This is consistent with my recollection of the events of that dayappliedCodelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail

discussed by Ormiston J in Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR   at     where reference is made to the relevant authorities in this Court  But this is not a case concerning representations as to future conduct  This case does concern a representation with respect to a future matter  In that regard and as Lockhart and Gummow JJ counsel in the passage quoted assistance is to be gained by regard to the judgement of Ormiston J in Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR   at     His Honour offered the following analysis with which I respectfully agree    It would seem on the authorities that  at the least  a contractual promise would amount to an implied representation that the promisor then had an intention to carry out that promise  If it can be shown that he had no such intention he would be guilty of misleading or deceptive conduct  Likewise it would seem that such a representation connotes a present ability to fulfil that promise which  if shown to be untrue at the time of making  would likewise characterise the implied representation as misleading or deceptive      It is not easy to fit s A and s A into the scheme of each Act if the broader view should prevail  One of the principal difficulties is subs  in each case which says that subs  shall be deemed not to limit by implication the meaning of any reference in the Division to  inter alia   conduct that is misleading or is likely       to mislead   One can understand that the section should not be treated as qualifying by implication the types of conduct which can be characterised as misleading or deceptive  It is another to say that the section does not show in what way a defendant can establish that a representation as to the future which is  taken to be misleading  does not amount to a contravention of s  or s  as the case may be  for subs  by negative implication  says that  if a person adduces evidence that he had  reasonable grounds for making the representation  as to future conduct  then the representation shall no longer be taken to be misleading  If those who maintain that implied promise plus breach are sufficient to constitute misleading conduct are correct  then the question whether the promisor had reasonable grounds for making the representation would be irrelevant  It would be sufficient  on that hypothesis  to show that the promisee was  led into error  by reason of the promise subsequently broken  regardless of the promisor s having reasonable grounds for making the representation  Thus  despite the apparently restrictive words of subs  the basis for holding that a promise amounts to misleading conduct must be that it carries with it an implication that the promisor had no reasonable grounds for making the representation  i e  the promise  If he overcomes the section s presumption against him  by proof to the contrary  then it follows that his representation and thus his conduct was not misleading  for present purposes  Otherwise each of the inserted sections would be pointless in so far as it purports to qualify  or expand  s  and s       In my opinion  therefore  accepting that s A and s A each assumes that a promise may give rise to an implied representation that the promisor will perform an act in the future  namely the promised act  then the promisee is not  in proceedings under s  or s  bound to show that the promisor had no intention or no ability to perform the promise at the time of its making  The promisor will be deemed not to have reasonable grounds for making the representation or promise  unless he satisfies the court by evidence to the contrary that he had reasonable grounds for making that representation  He may achieve this  in part  by showing that he had a genuine intention to perform his promise and that he had the ability at the time to perform it  but in the end he must show objectively that he had reasonable grounds for making the representation  For present purposes I am not prepared to accept that the plaintiff can make out its case by showing merely promise and breach  In my opinion  that evidence  on its own  is insufficient to show that the promisee was  led into error  unless the plaintiff can rely on s A or s A If there is no element of actual or deemed misrepresentation then the promisee can have been led into no error  nor can it be said to have been misled  by reason of some subsequent breach which causes it harm or loss  If the facts connote no error or misrepresentation  nothing thereby led it to take a course which was erroneous      It follows from what has been said that I am not persuaded that one should treat every contractual promise as giving rise to an implied representation of the kind referred to in s A  and s A  However  I am persuaded that if there be an unconditional promise which forms part of the contractual obligations  then it is proper to treat the giving of that promise  at least in the ordinary case  as the making of a representation as to a future matter  being either the doing of an act or the  refusing   sic  to do an act  being in each case the subject of the promise  Perhaps conditional promises may also be treated as the making of a representation as to future conduct  but in each case the qualified terms of the promise would usually lead to the conclusion that the maker had reasonable grounds therefore  unless it could be shown that under no circumstances would the promisor have fulfilled his promise  It is  however  not necessary to determine this latter point  Has Flottweg shown that it had reasonable grounds for making each of the  representations  ie the promise as to oil recovery  the promise as to the achievement of a minimum level of atmospheric oxygen and the promise as to the processing speed of the line  I find that  objectively  it did  for the following reasons  I should observe at once that I am satisfied on the whole of the evidence that Flottweg had a genuine intention to fulfil the Contract in all respects  including the supply of equipment that would meet each of the specifications in the Contract appliedJAD International Pty Ltd v International Trucks Australia Ltd     FCR  This production line has been used certainly for   years  and perhaps now also a   th    It is hardly new any longer  It has been used to derive income  It is not possible to effect perfect restitution after this length of time  I accept that this does not automatically rule out the making of an order for rescission  JAD International Pty Ltd v International Trucks Australia Ltd     FCR    Delay and depreciation of the goods sold are but factors to take into account in the exercise of a discretion  To make an order now for rescission and return of the goods would require the making of compensatory orders in favour of Flottweg to take account of what I infer must be an inevitable deterioration in the value of the goods after this length of time and to make allowance for the benefit of the use Olivaylle has enjoyed  I have no evidence that would allow me justly to assess the diminution in value of the machines in the production line  only to form a conclusion that they must have depreciated  Further  the goods are not as Flottweg sold them or even last modified them  There is evidence before me that  at Olivaylle s request  Mr Carey has made modifications to the line since July    As to delay  Olivaylle was requested as long ago as January   by Flottweg to return the goods  I am not persuaded that it was left with no alternative to keep them  at least beyond the   season  It made no response to this  It was in July   that Olivaylle purported to withdraw from the Contract  On Mr De Moya s evidence  it seems that Flottweg was but one of a number of potential suppliers of a production line  On the evidence  it took less than a year once the order was placed for Flottweg to deliver  install and commission the production line  Olivaylle seems to have done nothing to that end  Even though I further accept that the power conferred to order rescission conferred by virtue of s   of the TPA is wider than under the general law   JAD International Pty Ltd v International Trucks Australia Ltd   supra  it seems to me that  even at the end of the   season  the considerations to which I have adverted would not have made that remedy just as a matter of discretion citedLong v Lloyd   EWCA Civ         All ER  That  of course  assumes that Olivaylle should not be regarded as having earlier elected to affirm the Contract  In February   it believed  based on its experience of the   season  that the production line was non compliant in each of its processing speed and its ability to achieve   or less v v of atmospheric oxygen  Yet it chose then not to bring the Contract to an end but rather to seek to rely upon the peculiar right of  withdrawal  after allowance of a reasonable period of grace that it conferred  Thereafter  it chose to use the production line  In my opinion  that amounted to an affirmation of the Contract  Long v Lloyd   EWCA Civ         All ER    Olivaylle s decision to install  commission and use an on site bottling plant after what it believed was Flottweg s non compliance with contractual specifications is also consistent with its having decided to affirm the Contract and retain the production line  As to the claims based on the Contract  there is a limitation of liability clause present  That clause would not  in my opinion  affect the operation of the contractual provision for  withdrawal   The limitation of liability clause would though limit the amount of any further sum which could be awarded to Olivaylle under the Contract to   of the total price  ie to      The language of the clause is such that it would limit each of Olivaylle s consequential loss claim and it loss of profits claim to no more than this amount in aggregate  For reasons which will shortly emerge  these claims might aptly be described as fantastic citedOlivaylle Pty Limited v Flottweg GMBH   Co KGAA  No     FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlMr Lorenz was not initially a witness whom Flottweg proposed to call  After the expiry of the time fixed by direction for the filing of evidence in chief and for that matter after Olivaylle had closed its case

Flottweg to adduce evidence from him  Olivaylle Pty Limited v Flottweg GMBH   Co KGAA  No     FCA         IPR    Mr Lorenz was at the time of his involvement with events of present relevance and

the General Assembly in    It has as its mandate from the General Assembly the progressive harmonisation and unification of the law of international trade  It has fostered the development of a number of international conventions and model laws which range in subject from the international sale of goods through to cross border insolvency and  as Ms Christensen s article  supra  reminds  electronic commerce  When this fact and that the Vienna Convention  governs only the formation of the contract of sale and the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer arising from such contract  in particular  the Vienna Convention  is not concerned with the effect that the contract may have on the property to the goods sold    Roder Zelt Und Hallenkonstruktionen GMBH v Rosedown Park Pty Ltd   Eustace     FCR   at   are taken into account  it is an unlikely construction of the Contract that the sentence referring to  UNCITRAL law  is to take its meaning from the sentence which precedes it  Given the nature of the Contract  the fact that a party to it  Flottweg  was and was known by Olivaylle to be a company which sold its wares internationally and the reference to the exclusion of  UNCITRAL law  appearing at its conclusion under the heading  Other dispositions  the more likely construction of  UNCITRAL law  is that it was intended to be a reference to the particular UNCITRAL convention that governed the international sale of goods  ie the Vienna Convention   Other dispositions  looks to me to be a heading which describes miscellaneous  unrelated terms of general application to the goods sold  The positioning of the sentence at the end of the Contract further supports a construction that it was meant to govern all of its terms  The Contract provided for the supply by Flottweg to Olivaylle of an olive oil production line more particularly described as a  Continuous Flottweg Special   TPH in sealed N  Version Olive Oil Line    TPH  refers to tonnes per hour  N  is a reference to nitrogen  In this production line nitrogen gas was used as a means of displacing oxygen from the line  It was thought by Mr De Moya that this would yield qualitative benefits in the production of olive oil  In its initial form  the production line was delivered to Olivaylle s olive grove at Telopea Downs in April   citedShevill v Builders Licensing Board   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe right of  withdrawal  in the Contract seems to me to be of a quite different character to what in Meagher RP  Gummow WMC and Lehane JRF  Equity Doctrines   Remedies   th ed Butterworths    at     describe as the  first sense  of five senses in which the term  rescission  is used in law  The learned authors there state  by reference to observations made by Gibbs CJ in Shevill v Builders Licensing Board   HCA         CLR   at     that  so used  it describes  the situation where a party to a contract  upon a breach by the other party of a condition  elects to treat the contract as no longer binding upon him   In that situation   both parties are discharged from further performance of the contract  But rights already acquired are not divested or discharged and causes of action which have accrued from the breach continue unaffected  Equity Doctrines   Remedies     th ed  ibid  That in the Contract  withdrawal  is offered as an alternative to reduction in price persuades me that restoration of the original position is intended rather than a release from further performance  The intent is to offer a choice between returning the goods and getting one s money back or keeping the goods but with the benefit of a reduced price  Though that conclusion follows as a matter ordinary English read in context  it also seems to me to be in accord with civil law notions of what is meant by such alternatives   Withdrawal  would thus enable orders for the return of the goods supplied and for the refund of the amount paid under the Contract  It is truly a quite exceptional right  That it is available only after the allowance of a  reasonable period of grace  which can apply in the case of the repair or replacement obligation  persuades me that the right continues to be available even if the result is that used and thereby devalued goods are returned  That substantial restitution of the goods sold was not possible would otherwise disentitle a party to a contract to an entitlement to  rescission  but not  as I conceive it  to exercise the right of  withdrawal  conferred by the Contract appliedShirlaw v Southern

       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI have already made reference to Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas   HCA         CLR    Later  in their joint judgement in Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Callinan JJ remarked of that case    This Court  in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas  has recently reaffirmed the principle of objectivity by which the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined  It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations  What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe  References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement  The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean  That  normally  requires consideration not only of the text  but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties  and the purpose and object of the transaction appliedW A Dewhurst   Co Pty Ltd v Cawrse   VR  Flottweg s acceptance was communicated by email to Olivaylle at its olive grove in Victoria  Experience suggests that email is often  but not invariably  a form of near instantaneous communication  The parties seemed content to assume that the place of contract was either Victoria or New South Wales  content because the common law of Australia was the same in either place and so  too  was the only statute law considered material  There was no suggestion in submissions that the place of contract was  for example  Germany  As a result  the ramifications of the adoption by the parties of email for their written pre contractual communications  particularly the acceptance  were not explored  As it happens  the subject of formation of contracts by email has been explored in depth in an article by a local academic  Christensen S   Formation of Contracts by Email Is it Just the Same as the Post      Queensland University of Technology Law and Justice Journal    Ms Christensen details there arguments for and against the assimilation of email communications with  the postal rule  or with what one might term  the instantaneous communication rule  and also the local adoption of international convention which touches on the subject  Having regard to the position taken by the parties in this case  it is not necessary to give detailed consideration to the point  It is enough to observe that I consider that there are analogies to be drawn with the way the law developed in relation to telex communications in an earlier era where what I have termed  the instantaneous communication rule  came to be adopted  perhaps at the expense of scientific precision but not so in relation to common commercial understanding  Thus  by analogy with cases concerning the position with what were  or were treated as  other forms of instantaneous communication  I consider that the contract was made where the acceptance was received  ie in Victoria  Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation     QB   W A Dewhurst   Co Pty Ltd v Cawrse   VR     Express Airways v Port Augusta Air Services   Qd R   Reese Bros Plastics Ltd v Hamon Sobelco Australia Pty Ltd     BPR
