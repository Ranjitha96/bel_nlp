CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicants submit however that the  context otherwise requires  that the term  Leased Premises  when used in the option provision in special cl   of the Schedule  should not be given its defined meaning if that meaning is construed to refer to part only of the Land  Such a construction  it submits  would impute to the parties the absurd and commercially unreasonable intention of recording the grant of a void option  They point to the traditional doctrine that courts should be astute to adopt a construction that will preserve the validity of the contract  Meehan v Jones   HCA         CLR   at   and to prefer a construction which will encourage performance rather than avoidance of contractual relations  Ankar Pty Ltd   Arnick Holdings

created a valid demise in that a demise of part of the Land for less than   years did not contravene the subdivision provisions of the Planning Act   s  a   However the option to purchase would contravene s  d  of the Planning Act and hence would be void  if it is construed as referrable to a purchase of part only of the Land  The proper construction  in that context  the applicants submit

think that it can be said that the applicants have no reasonable prospects of success of demonstrating that the proper construction of the option in the Lease is as they contend  aided by a consideration of the above extrinsic circumstances  There are real issues of fact and law to be determined  The rights of the parties depend upon their resolution  In these circumstances it is appropriate that the matter should go to trial  Hicks v Ruddock at     Harbeth contends that there is no evidence to support the pleas that Mr Healey was its agent to prepare and negotiate with potential purchasers the terms of the documents  to effect the sale of the business and the lease including the option  The second and third respondents submit that neither of them were agents to effect the commercial relations between Dandaven and Harbeth  This  they say  was the function of Performance Business Brokers  Mr Pannekoek  in his affidavit sworn on   December   at   said that  in January   he arranged for the Signs Business to be advertised for sale through Russell Lyon of Performance Business Brokers and that subsequently he instructed Mr Healey to assist  He did not explain what assistance it was that Mr Healey was to render  He said that Mr Healey provided accounting services to Harbeth and related entities as a consultant to PA   Pty Ltd  the third respondent  In his affidavit sworn   March   at     Mr Pannekoek said that PA   acted as Harbeth s settlement agent   The emails of   February   from Mr Healey to each of Mr Reynolds and Mr Pannekoek concerned the Contract to Lease  The contents of each  in my opinion  arguably  is evidence that he  or by implication PA   to which he consulted  acted as agent for Harbeth in relation  at least  to the Contract to Lease as pleaded by the applicants  Arguably  any such agency may extend to the formation of the Lease including the option  The Contract to Lease was inextricably tied up with the Lease and both were interrelated with the agreement for the sale of the business  Accordingly there are questions of fact and law as to the allegations of agency  which will require further exploration at trial

Company of Australia Limited   FCAFC       The respondents contend however that  whatever be the position in relation to the Contract to Lease  none of this extrinsic material is even arguably relevant to the construction of the option in the Lease itself which they say is clear in its terms and was drawn by the applicants  solicitors  I do not consider that this necessarily follows  The context  background or history to the Contract to Lease may arguably  in my view  also be relevant to a consideration of what is intended by the option in the Lease  The Contract for Lease  as I observed earlier  by clause   contemplated that any Lease would contain the terms of the offer in the Contract to Lease  Both are inter related in this sense  There was no evidence as to what instructions were given by the applicants to their solicitors for the preparation of the Lease  It is reasonable to infer however that they were provided with the Contract to Lease  Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd   FCAFC   at   per Gordon J  It is hardly surprising then that any ambiguity  absurdity or shortcoming in the Contract to Lease  could be repeated in the Lease
