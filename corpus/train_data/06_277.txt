 html  The genesis of this provision was s   of the Trustee Act    UK  which is in substantially the same terms  In Riddle v Riddle   HCA         CLR   the High Court considered the scope of the power of s   of the Trustee Act    NSW  which is in similar terms to the Victorian Act  The majority of the High Court construed s   in very wide terms  Dixon J said at      Section   is a provision conferring very large and important powers upon the Court which depend upon the Court s opinion of what is expedient  a criterion of the widest and most flexible kind          I do not think that the powers given by s    were intended to be restricted by any implications    Williams J said at      The section is couched in the widest possible terms  The sole question is whether it is expedient in the interest of the trust property as a whole that such an order should be made       and at    The one and only test is the expediency of the act or thing which the Court is asked to authorise a trustee to do or abstain from doing  The Court has only to be of the opinion that the trust property as a whole will in fact benefit from the making of the order       Riddle v Riddle  supra  was subsequently applied in Re Baker   VR   and Arakella v Paton   NSWSC         NSWLR   consideredRe Royal Society s Charitable Trusts   Ch   In Re Royal Society s Charitable Trusts   Ch   Vaisey J was asked by the Royal Society to permit it  inter alia   to consolidate various different trust funds of which it was trustee for investment and accounting purposes  Vaisey J held that the application did not come within s   of the Trustee Act    UK   the equivalent section to s   of the Trustee Act    Vic  or alternatively under what he called  the rather ill defined scope of the court s general jurisdiction   However  he held that the Court had power under its special jurisdiction relating to charities to consider the applications   I doubt whether s   provides a basis for the directions sought by the Administrators as they are seeking directions as to how they may exercise their power as trustees  rather than seeking a direction for a particular transaction  even though a particular transaction will result from the exercise of their power  if approved or directed by the Court  Notwithstanding the breadth of the definition of  expedient  I do not consider that it is expedient  in the interests of the trust properties or the beneficiaries under the trusts that the Administrators be given the power to put a resolution and vote in favour of it adversely to the interests of the beneficiaries   I turn to deal with the issue of the pooling of assets and liabilities of companies  Pooling of assets and liabilities of companies in administration or liquidation as a concept is well known although it does not appear that pooling has been approved in circumstances where a number of the creditors of one or more of the companies have been disadvantaged by the pooling proposal and the creditors have not unanimously consented to  or approved of  the pooling proposal consideredDean Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd     NSWLR   In Dean Willcocks v Soluble

Mans     In Dean Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd  supra  all the creditors except the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation attended the meetings and approved of the resolution  However the order made by Young J approving of the pooling resolutions was made expressly subject to the opportunity given to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to apply to the Court to have the order discharged  Young J set out a number of principles which he considered applied which included the following  at      It would be possible for the court to advise a liquidator in a court winding up that he should consolidate debts  but it would be unlikely that the court would do so unless every creditor agreed or a regime was put in place for creditors to object   In Re Charter Travel Co Ltd     ACSR   Young J approved of the calling of a joint meeting of creditors of two companies to consider a pooling proposal for two companies in liquidation in circumstances where it was virtually impossible to define which creditor belong to which company  Young J said at      As I indicated in my judgment in Dean Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd     ACSR   administration of two companies in insolvency conjointly is something that can occur only in exceptional cases  As I said at   this normally means a scheme of arrangement  but if no creditor objects and it is impracticable to keep the assets and liabilities of different companies separate  and the consolidation is for the benefit of creditors generally  then the court might advise the liquidators concerned that they would be justified in consolidating the administration      One of the factors which persuaded Young J that the case fell within the exceptional circumstances was that no creditor could be disadvantaged by the proposal   This review of the recent authorities on pooling leads me to the conclusion that there is no authority or support for the view that a Court will approve a pooling proposal in circumstances where a number of the creditors of one or more of the companies will be significantly disadvantaged  These authorities also proceed on the basis that it is not sufficient for an order for pooling that the administration or liquidation is complex or that the identity of creditors is difficult to determine  So much was stated by Powell J in Anmi Pty Ltd v Williams  supra  at    par   above   The

v GE Capital     ACSR   Finkelstein J accepted that in appropriate circumstances pooling of assets and liabilities of companies in insolvency might be  both just and equitable if not essential   His Honour said at      In my opinion the power to enter into a deed of company arrangement under Pt    A is sufficiently broad to permit an arrangement binding on two or more insolvent companies pursuant to which their respective assets and creditors will be consolidated  There is no justification for a construction of this part of the Corporations Law that would lead to the conclusion that arrangements made pursuant to Pt    A must be more narrowly confined than arrangements made under s      However  Finkelstein J was not required to address this issue in circumstances where it was apparent that any creditors would be disadvantaged by the pooling proposal consideredHumphris  Re ACN           ACLC   In Humphris  Re ACN           ACLC   I approved of a pooling proposal where the creditors present at the meetings unanimously approved of the proposal to enter into deeds of company arrangements which contained provisions to pool the assets and liabilities of each company  In those particular circumstances  it was inevitable that if pooling did not occur  all creditors would be worse off  This was because the costs which would be incurred if there was no pooling would erode the balance available for distribution to creditors consideredRe Tayeh  the Black Stump Enterprises Pty Ltd     ACSR   In Re Tayeh  the Black Stump Enterprises Pty Ltd     ACSR   an application for approval of a pooling proposal in a creditors  voluntary liquidation scenario was dismissed  What weighed heavily in the reasoning of Barrett J was the fact that the creditors as a body had not been given a clear opportunity to make a positive expression of their views  Barrett J said at      As I have said  Charter Travel was a case in which what was effectively a clearance for the liquidators to implement a specific pooling arrangement if  creditors unanimously approved the proposal  was given by Young J in a context where his Honour made an order that the liquidators would be justified in convening a combined meeting of the creditors of two companies  There was thus to be a forum for the positive statement of opinions and wishes actively sought  no doubt by way of proposed resolution in relation to a specifically identified proposal  The lack of objection contemplated there  as well as in Soluble Solution which involved a s  A application  was in a context quite different from the context involved in the present case  Here  there has been no attempt to engage any of the statutory provisions under which rights in a winding up may be varied   The Administrators submitted that pooling was justified on the basis of a number of propositions to be extracted from United States of America authorities  They relied upon what they called      the reliance test as a single economic unit        the entanglement test  that is to say the interrelationship of the companies in the group is so hopelessly inter related that to disentangle it would be both time and cost prohibitive  and       the balancing test  that is to say the benefits of the consolidation outweigh the harm it would cause creditors if there was no consolidation consideredIn Re Owens Corning   F  d     rd Cir    The principles applicable to what is called in the United States of America  substantive consolidation  which is akin to  pooling  were recently re stated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in In Re Owens Corning   F  d     rd Cir     The Court analysed In re Augie Restivo   F  d     nd Cir    where the Court found that there were two rationales  to be extracted from previous decisions  for substantive consolidation  These rationales were     a  where the creditors dealt with the various entities in the group as a single economic unit and did not rely on their separate identity in extending credit       b  where the affairs of the companies in the group were so entangled that consolidation would benefit all creditors   The Court noted that there was nearly unanimous consensus in the substantial body of case law on substantive consolidation that it was a remedy to be used  sparingly  consideredIn re Augie Restivo   F  d     nd Cir    The

separate identity in extending credit       b  where the affairs of the companies in the group were so entangled that consolidation would benefit all creditors   The Court noted that there was nearly unanimous consensus in the substantial body of case law on substantive consolidation that it was a remedy to be used  sparingly    Having analysed the competing lines of authority on substantive consolidation  the Court s conclusion was to follow the In re Augie Restivo  supra  approach  It said  at      In our Court what must be proven  absent consent  concerning the entities for whom substantive consolidation is sought is that  i  prepetition they disregarded separateness so significantly their creditors relied on the breakdown of entity borders and treated them as one legal entity  or  ii  postpetition their assets and liabilities are so scrambled that separating them is prohibitive and hurts all creditors    The Court rejected the proposition that mere benefit to the administration of the various companies was sufficient to warrant substantive consolidation  The Court also rejected the proposition that the commingling of assets justified consolidation when the affairs of the companies were so entangled that consolidation would be beneficial  The Court set out the following principle at           commingling justifies consolidation only when separately accounting for the assets and liabilities of the distinct entities will reduce the recovery of every creditor that is  when every creditor will benefit from the consolidation  Moreover  the benefit to creditors should be from cost savings that make assets available rather than from the shifting of assets to benefit one group of creditors at the expense of another  Mere benefits to some creditors  or administrative benefit to the Court  falls far short    The Court emphasised that the theoretical justification for what it called  hopeless commingling  consolidation was that no creditor s rights would be impaired   I consider these principles appropriate to apply within the context of the proper approach to pooling in the Australian jurisdiction  They are not inconsistent with the Australian
