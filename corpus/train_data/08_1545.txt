http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  confers power upon this Court to grant declaratory relief  The power conferred is a discretionary power which is not to be limited by the laying down of rules as to the manner of its exercise  Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at      Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ there observed  It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief  It is a discretionary power which  i t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter     by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise   However  it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power  Hence  declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions  The person seeking relief must have  a real interest  and relief will not be granted if the question  is purely hypothetical  if relief is  claimed in relation to circumstances that  have  not occurred and might never happen  or if  the Court s declaration will produce no foreseeable

may finally be noted  the Secretary does not maintain that there has been   any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention    But  as was pointed out by Olney J in Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   in the context of pecuniary penalties being sought under s   of the Trade Practices Act for resale price maintenance    an absence of loss or damage is not a mitigating factor    His Honour observed at         The Act also requires that regard be had to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission  In the facts of the present case there appears to be no basis upon which any loss or damage can be identified  Whatever may have been the circumstances that induced all other Victorian distributors to agree to maintain retail prices at the levels nominated by ICI  it is the conduct in relation to MRW and Heinrich O Loughlin which is the subject of these proceedings  Nothing has been said to indicate that either of these companies  nor indeed any of their customers  suffered loss or damage by the attempt to induce them to maintain a minimum price  However  I do not think that the absence of loss or damage is necessarily a mitigating factor  In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller  the question of loss or damage will rarely  if ever  arise  The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price maintenance   The same conclusion was also reached by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity  Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at       FCA       FCR   at   when considering s   of the Spam Act    Cth    The same conclusion should also be reached in respect to s  Y  of the   Act now under consideration citedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  That question was answered    No  but the reasons in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   disclose no error of principle    The Full Court reviewed the authorities and observed    The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods   i  It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s   of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act   ii  Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science  Within a permissible range  the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another   iii  There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation  particularly where it is likely to be lengthy  Accordingly  when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement  they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts  together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed   iv  The view of the regulator  as a specialist body  is a relevant  but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty  In particular  the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise  such as the ACCC s views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market  will usually be given greater weight than its views on more  subjective  matters   v  In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  the Court examines all the circumstances of the case  Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts  the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so   vi  Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty  it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement  The question is whether that figure is  in the Court s view  appropriate in the circumstances of the case  In answering that question  the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure  It will be appropriate if within the permissible range   Five further points were there made by their Honours  being    First  the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is said by the Court to be the savings in resources for the regulator and the Court  as well as the likelihood that a negotiated resolution will include measures designed to promote competition  As Jeremy Thorpe points out  a related advantage is that the savings in resources can be used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the courts  This has the effect of increasing deterrence which is one of the principal justifications  if not the only justification for imposing civil penalties under the TP Act or the Sites Act  J Thorpe   Determining the Appropriate Role for Charge Bargaining in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act      Comp   Cons LJ   at            Secondly  the sixth proposition drawn from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods does not mean  in our opinion  that the Court must commence its reasoning with the proposed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range  A Court may wish to take that approach  However  it is open to a Court  consistently with the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods  first to address the appropriate range of penalties independently of the parties  proposed figure and then  having made that judgment  determine whether the prepared penalty falls within the range    Thirdly  as has been noted  the appellant in NW Frozen Foods admitted contravening the TP Act and had reached agreement with the ACCC upon the facts to be put before the Court  There was no suggestion that the admissions or statement had been tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the ACCC in proving its case  The Full Court therefore acted on the basis of clear admissions and a detailed statement of agreed facts setting out how the contraventions had occurred        Fourthly  as the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   ATPR       has pointed out  the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning that justifies a discounted penalty            Fifthly  there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods that is inconsistent with any of the following propositions   i  The Court  if it considers that the evidence or information before it is inadequate to form a view as to whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or verify the information provided  If they do not provide the information or verification requested  the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the range   ii  If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s   of the TP Act  s   of the Sites Act  or similar legislation  it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR  O   r     iii  If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties  it may be appropriate  depending on the circumstances  for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing   See  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd   FCA   at     per Nicholson J  Most recently  it has been said that the   upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties  The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties  but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount  within the permissible range  of penalties that might properly be imposed   Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Finkelstein J  See also  Beaton Wells C   Judicial Scrutiny of Penalty Agreements to Increase      TPLJ   followedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The requirement for the Court itself to be satisfied as to the appropriateness of a penalty is a responsibility which ultimately derives from s   of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act and is not a responsibility which can be circumscribed by private agreement  cf Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Hobie Cat Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Finn J  And in discharging that responsibility in the context of the Therapeutic Goods Act the Court  as it is in the context of the Trade Practices Act when considering whether to make an order by consent    is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties  it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so   cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission

Ltd   FCA   at       ATPR     followedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Given the written submissions previously filed on behalf of the Secretary as to the penalties then being propounded  some reservation was expressed during the hearing as to whether the then proposed combined penalty of   was indeed   appropriate    As was observed by Wilcox  Hill and Carr JJ in Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   FCA    and as approved by the Full Court in Mobil Oil   FCAFC   at            W here the Commission proposes to the Court an agreed penalty which is calculated taking into account a substantial discount from what would otherwise be considered the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of co operation  it would be desirable that the Commission disclose the process by which the discounted penalty has been arrived at  In particular  it would be of assistance to the Court  particularly where there are other proceedings pending  to hear submissions on the range of appropriate penalties and the discount which it is proposed should be allowed to take into account the level of co operation afforded by the offender       The figure of   was such that submissions were sought from both Counsel  The caution previously expressed by Lockhart J  and other judges of this Court  as to the Court refraining from stating whether the penalty to which the parties have agreed was the same as that which the Court would have imposed  is nevertheless heeded citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd   FCA       ALR   In addressing the role that agreement between the parties may have when addressing penalties to be imposed under the Trade Practices Act in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR     Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed  The Act places on the shoulders of the Court the responsibility to determine the  appropriate  penalty in each particular case  having regard to  all relevant matters  including the matters specified in the section  But effects upon the functioning of markets  and other economic effects  will generally be among the most significant matters to be considered as relevant  so that the Court is likely to be assisted greatly by views put forward by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  or by economists called on behalf of the parties  Since the decision in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd     FLR   it has been accepted that both the facts  and also views about their effect  may be presented to the Court in agreed statements  together with joint submissions by both the Commission and a respondent as to the appropriate level of penalty  Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science  the Court  in such a case  does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed  but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount  There is an important public policy involved  When corporations acknowledge contraventions  very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided  freeing the courts to deal with other matters  and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention  At the same time  a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote  for the future  vigorous competition in the particular market concerned  These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks  A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances  The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure  or except in a clear case  It appears to us that the authorities in both Australia and New Zealand have provided unanimous support for the approach we have outlined    They approved the general acceptance of a  negotiated settlement  reserving for further consideration only the case where a compromise was based  not on considerations bearing on the quantum of the penalty  but on doubts or difficulties attending the proof of the contravention  In Simsmetal  Trade Practices Commission v Simsmetal Ltd   ATPR     Lee J  in approving agreed penalties  said  at   that  the approach adopted by the parties in fixing  the figures put to the Court  is not dissimilar to the approach that would have been adopted by the Court had it been necessary for the Court to undertake the penalty fixing exercise itself  and that he agreed with the approach of Lockhart J in another case of refraining from  stating whether the penalties to which the parties have agreed are the size of  those  which the Court itself would have imposed   In Pioneer  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pioneer Concrete  Qld  Pty Ltd   ATPR     Lockhart J said  at        I am of the view that the agreement that has been reached  subject to the Court s concurrence  is broadly in accord with what the Court would have done itself based upon the facts as I have read them from the affidavits  and I think the result is a sensible one  I propose to endorse it       In TNT  Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   HCA       ATPR     Burchett J said  at        I t cannot be denied that the fixing of the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science  It is not done by the application of a formula  and  within a certain range  courts have always recognised that one precise figure cannot be incontestably said to be preferable to another       When the Court approaches the task of assessing a penalty under s   or of determining whether an agreed penalty is appropriate  there are certain principles which must be kept steadily in mind  The section itself lays down that the penalty is to be  appropriate having regard to all relevant matters  and then indicates certain matters which the legislature regarded as relevant     Reference may also be made to Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd   FCA   at   where French J stated that the   Court has  over many years  accepted as a general principle that it should encourage fair and appropriate settlements to reduce the burdens of litigation on public and private resources    See also  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd   FCA   at       FCA       ALR   at     per Lee J  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v FChem  Aust  Ltd   FCA   at     per Cowdroy J  These comments were obviously directed to the specific statutory provisions and objectives of the   Act followedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  That question was answered    No  but the reasons in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   disclose no error of principle    The Full Court reviewed the authorities and observed    The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods   i  It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s   of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act   ii  Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science  Within a permissible range  the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another   iii  There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation  particularly where it is likely to be lengthy  Accordingly  when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement  they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts  together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed   iv  The view of the regulator  as a specialist body  is a relevant  but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty  In particular  the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise  such as the ACCC s views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market  will usually be given greater weight than its views on more  subjective  matters   v  In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  the Court examines all the circumstances of the case  Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts  the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so   vi  Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty  it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement  The question is whether that figure is  in the Court s view  appropriate in the circumstances of the case  In answering that question  the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure  It will be appropriate if within the permissible range   Five further points were there made by their Honours  being    First  the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is said by the Court to be the savings in resources for the regulator and the Court  as well as the likelihood that a negotiated resolution will include measures designed to promote competition  As Jeremy Thorpe points out  a related advantage is that the savings in resources can be used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the courts  This has the effect of increasing deterrence which is one of the principal justifications  if not the only justification for imposing civil penalties under the TP Act or the Sites Act  J Thorpe   Determining the Appropriate Role for Charge Bargaining in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act      Comp   Cons LJ   at            Secondly  the sixth proposition drawn from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods does not mean  in our opinion  that the Court must commence its reasoning with the proposed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range  A Court may wish to take that approach  However  it is open to a Court  consistently with the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods  first to address the appropriate range of penalties independently of the parties  proposed figure and then  having made that judgment  determine whether the prepared penalty falls within the range    Thirdly  as has been noted  the appellant in NW Frozen Foods admitted contravening the TP Act and had reached agreement with the ACCC upon the facts to be put before the Court  There was no suggestion that the admissions or statement had been tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the ACCC in proving its case  The Full Court therefore acted on the basis of clear admissions and a detailed statement of agreed facts setting out how the contraventions had occurred        Fourthly  as the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   ATPR       has pointed out  the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning that justifies a discounted penalty            Fifthly  there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods that is inconsistent with any of the following propositions   i  The Court  if it considers that the evidence or information before it is inadequate to form a view as to whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or verify the information provided  If they do not provide the information or verification requested  the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the range   ii  If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s   of the TP Act  s   of the Sites Act  or similar legislation  it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR  O   r     iii  If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties  it may be appropriate  depending on the circumstances  for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing   See  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd   FCA   at     per Nicholson J  Most recently  it has been said that the   upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties  The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties  but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount  within the permissible range  of penalties that might properly be imposed   Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  But there has been a departure from such a confined view  at least in a statutory context where declaratory relief is sought as an adjunct to an order imposing a pecuniary penalty or involving a matter of public interest  In the context of the Trade Practices Act   in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd   FCA       ALR   Kiefel J reviewed the earlier authorities and relevantly concluded as follows    The power to grant declarations  s   of the Federal Court Act    Cth  is unconfined  Order  A itself imposes no constraints upon the relief sought  Refusals to make declarations in cases of default are based upon a practice  not a rule of law  The practice is one of long standing and might be seen as derived from views about litigation which pre date more recent concerns expressed by the courts as to the costs of unnecessary litigation  the management of cases and efficiency overall  Views expressed in older cases may not take account of the increase in the use made of declaratory orders in developing areas of law which may involve matters of public interest  A caution with respect to the use of older authority is made in the White Book Service   to the English Civil Procedure Rules            It may no longer be correct to have a practice which operates as a prohibition in every case of default and preferable to consider the circumstances pertaining to the particular case and the purpose and effect of the declaration  Millett J made declaratory orders in Patten v Burke Publishing Co Ltd     WLR       All ER   where justice to the plaintiff required it  The order  however  operated principally inter partes and it might be doubted whether it would be of interest to other persons  Cases such as this  involving the protection of consumers  are of public interest  Declarations are often utilised in such cases to identify for the public what conduct contributes a contravention and to make apparent that it is considered to warrant an order recognising its seriousness  It is however important that there be no misunderstanding as to the basis upon which they are made  This could be overcome by a statement  preceding the declarations  that orders are made   upon admissions which  the respondent in question  is taken to have made  consequent upon non compliance with orders of

JJ  there have been decisions which   have expressed reservations about the approach taken in NW Frozen Foods    In Mobil Oil a pecuniary penalty was sought in respect to a contravention of s   of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act    Cth   The resolution of those reservations was there effected by a direction given by the Chief Justice pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  that the jurisdiction of the Court should be exercised by a Full Court in respect to the following question  Where the parties propose an agreed amount to be imposed as a penalty pursuant to s   of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act    Cth  is the Court bound by the decision in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   to consider whether the proposed amount is within the permissible range in all of the circumstances and  if so  impose a penalty of that amount  In the present proceeding it is considered that the principles expressed in NW Frozen Foods and Mobil Oil are equally applicable to a proceeding in which a civil penalty is sought under the Therapeutic Goods Act and where an agreement has been reached as between the Regulator and those against whom the penalty is sought   Given the written submissions previously filed on behalf of the Secretary as to the penalties then being propounded  some reservation was expressed during the hearing as to whether the then proposed combined penalty of   was indeed   appropriate    As was observed by Wilcox  Hill and Carr JJ in Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   FCA    and as approved by the Full Court in Mobil Oil   FCAFC   at            W here the Commission proposes to the Court an agreed penalty which is calculated taking into account a substantial discount from what would otherwise be considered the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of co operation  it would be desirable that the Commission disclose the process by which the discounted penalty has been arrived at  In particular  it would be of assistance to the Court  particularly where there are other proceedings pending  to hear submissions on the range of appropriate penalties and the discount which it is proposed should be allowed to take into account the level of co operation afforded by the offender       The figure of   was such that

provisions operating so as to effect an   automatic forfeiture   may be   draconian   and may be a reason for construing such provisions in a strict manner  Murphy v Farmer   HCA         CLR    In the course of importing a motor vehicle into Australia an answer to a question on a customs form was there provided by the Respondent which was wrong  but not deliberately or intentionally so  The majority  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  construed the term   false   so as to mean purposely  deliberately or intentionally untrue  In doing so Their Honours observed  at        I t seems to us to be more strongly arguable that clear words should be required before there is attributed to the Parliament an intention to take the draconian step of imposing automatic forfeiture as a penalty for  any  wrong  entry invoice declaration answer statement or representation  regardless of whether the wrong information was provided as the result of an innocent mistake or excusable ignorance  The effect of the penalty of automatic forfeiture under s  i  can be devastating and quite disproportionate in that it applies regardless of the value of the goods or the importance or effect of the wrong statement which was made       Also in the context of s   of the Customs Act   it has been said that       I n the history of English and Australian Customs legislation forfeiture provisions are common  drastic and far reaching     they have been considered a necessary measure to vindicate the right of the Crown and to ensure the strict and complete observance of the Customs laws  which are notoriously difficult of complete enforcement in the absence of strong provisions supporting their administration  Burton v Honan   HCA         CLR   at     per Dixon CJ appliedNW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In addressing the role that agreement between the parties may have when addressing penalties to be imposed under the Trade Practices Act in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR     Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed  The Act places on the shoulders of the Court the responsibility to determine the  appropriate  penalty in each particular case  having regard to  all relevant matters  including the matters specified in the section  But effects upon the functioning of markets  and other economic effects  will generally be among the most significant matters to be considered as relevant  so that the Court is likely to be assisted greatly by views put forward by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  or by economists called on behalf of the parties  Since the decision in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd     FLR   it has been accepted that both the facts  and also views about their effect  may be presented to the Court in agreed statements  together with joint submissions by both the Commission and a respondent as to the appropriate level of penalty  Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science  the Court  in such a case  does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed  but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount  There is an important public policy involved  When corporations acknowledge contraventions  very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided  freeing the courts to deal with other matters  and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention  At the same time  a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote  for the future  vigorous competition in the particular market concerned  These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks  A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances  The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure  or except in a clear case  It appears to us that the authorities in both Australia and New Zealand have provided unanimous support for the approach we have outlined    They approved the general acceptance of a  negotiated settlement  reserving for further consideration only the case where a compromise was based  not on considerations bearing on the quantum of the penalty  but on doubts or difficulties attending the proof of the contravention  In Simsmetal  Trade Practices Commission v Simsmetal Ltd   ATPR     Lee J  in approving agreed penalties  said  at   that  the approach adopted by the parties in fixing  the figures put to the Court  is not dissimilar to the approach that would have been adopted by the Court had it been necessary for the Court to undertake the penalty fixing exercise itself  and that he agreed with the approach of Lockhart J in another case of refraining from  stating whether the penalties to which the parties have agreed are the size of  those  which the Court itself would have imposed   In Pioneer  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pioneer Concrete  Qld  Pty Ltd   ATPR     Lockhart J said  at        I am of the view that the agreement that has been reached  subject to the Court s concurrence  is broadly in accord with what the Court would have done itself based upon the facts as I have read them from the affidavits  and I think the result is a sensible one  I propose to endorse it       In TNT  Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd   HCA       ATPR     Burchett J said  at        I t cannot be denied that the fixing of the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science  It is not done by the application of a formula  and  within a certain range  courts have always recognised that one precise figure cannot be incontestably said to be preferable to another       When the Court approaches the task of assessing a penalty under s   or of determining whether an agreed penalty is appropriate  there are certain principles which must be kept steadily in mind  The section itself lays down that the penalty is to be  appropriate having regard to all relevant matters  and then indicates certain matters which the legislature regarded as relevant     Reference may also be made to Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd   FCA   at   where French J stated that the   Court has  over many years  accepted as a general principle that it should encourage fair and appropriate settlements to reduce the burdens of litigation on public and private resources    See also  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd   FCA   at       FCA       ALR   at     per Lee J  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v FChem  Aust  Ltd   FCA   at     per Cowdroy J  These comments were obviously directed to the specific statutory provisions and objectives of the   Act   But  and as noted by the Full Court in Minister for Industry  Tourism   Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at     by Branson  Sackville and Gyles JJ  there have been decisions which   have expressed reservations about the approach taken in NW Frozen Foods    In Mobil Oil a pecuniary penalty was sought in respect to a contravention of s   of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act    Cth   The resolution of those reservations was there effected by a direction given by the Chief Justice pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  that the jurisdiction of the Court should be exercised by a Full Court in respect to the following question  Where the parties propose an agreed amount to be imposed as a penalty pursuant to s   of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act    Cth  is the Court bound by the decision in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   to consider whether the proposed amount is within the permissible range in all of the circumstances and  if so  impose a penalty of that amount  That question was answered    No  but the reasons in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   disclose no error of principle    The Full Court reviewed the authorities and observed    The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods   i  It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s   of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act   ii  Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science  Within a permissible range  the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another   iii  There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation  particularly where it is likely to be lengthy  Accordingly  when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement  they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts  together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed   iv  The view of the regulator  as a specialist body  is a relevant  but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty  In particular  the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise  such as the ACCC s views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market  will usually be given greater weight than its views on more  subjective  matters   v  In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  the Court examines all the circumstances of the case  Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts  the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so   vi  Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty  it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement  The question is whether that figure is  in the Court s view  appropriate in the circumstances of the case  In answering that question  the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure  It will be appropriate if within the permissible range   Five further points were there made by their Honours  being    First  the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is said by the Court to be the savings in resources for the regulator and the Court  as well as the likelihood that a negotiated resolution will include measures designed to promote competition  As Jeremy Thorpe points out  a related advantage is that the savings in resources can be used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the courts  This has the effect of increasing deterrence which is one of the principal justifications  if not the only justification for imposing civil penalties under the TP Act or the Sites Act  J Thorpe   Determining the Appropriate Role for Charge Bargaining in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act      Comp   Cons LJ   at            Secondly  the sixth proposition drawn from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods does not mean  in our opinion  that the Court must commence its reasoning with the proposed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range  A Court may wish to take that approach  However  it is open to a Court  consistently with the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods  first to address the appropriate range of penalties independently of the parties  proposed figure and then  having made that judgment  determine whether the prepared penalty falls within the range    Thirdly  as has been noted  the appellant in NW Frozen Foods admitted contravening the TP Act and had reached agreement with the ACCC upon the facts to be put before the Court  There was no suggestion that the admissions or statement had been tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the ACCC in proving its case  The Full Court therefore acted on the basis of clear admissions and a detailed statement of agreed facts setting out how the contraventions had occurred        Fourthly  as the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd   ATPR       has pointed out  the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning that justifies a discounted penalty            Fifthly  there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods that is inconsistent with any of the following propositions   i  The Court  if it considers that the evidence or information before it is inadequate to form a view as to whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or verify the information provided  If they do not provide the information or verification requested  the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the range   ii  If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s   of the TP Act  s   of the Sites Act  or similar legislation  it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR  O   r     iii  If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties  it may be appropriate  depending on the circumstances  for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing   See  Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd   FCA   at     per Nicholson J  Most recently  it has been said that the   upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties  The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties  but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount  within the permissible range  of penalties that might properly be imposed   Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd

Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR     French J made the following observations in the context of assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act  at       The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases  These include the following     The nature and extent of the contravening conduct     The amount of loss or damage caused     The circumstances in which the conduct took place     The size of the contravening company     The degree of power it has  as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market     The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended     Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level     Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act  as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention     Whether the company has shown a disposition to co operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention   Those observations are both an elaboration of the terms of s   itself and directed to the legislative context set forth in the   Act  Comparable principles have also been applied when assessing penalties under the Superannuation Industry  Supervision  Act   Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian   FCA       ATR     Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v

Perspective      Melb Univ L Rev    particularly at       In addition to the more general factors referred to in CSR   and in the specific context of the Therapeutic Goods Act   there was agreement between the parties that further   relevant matters   within the meaning of s  Y  also included  in particular  the following   i  the object of maintaining a national system of controls relating to the quality  safety  efficacy and timely availability of therapeutic goods     ii  the object of creating a national Register   iii  the fact that the Act creates both civil and criminal offences  the latter being punishable by imprisonment     iv  the particular difficulties that may be encountered in detecting a contravention of the   legislation  and    v  the particular difficulties that may be confronted if an application was to be defended and the Secretary put to proof    All of these matters place emphasis upon an important public interest in maintaining the integrity of the legislative regime in respect to therapeutic products  Further matters of relevance in the present statutory context  as in many  if not all  civil penalty cases are   vi  whether or not there has been co operation by a respondent in the conduct of a proceeding  and   vii  whether or not there has been agreement as to the relief to be granted   These matters  it is considered  emerge from a proper construction of the Act itself  They are only reinforced by a recognition that s  Y was inserted by way of an amendment effected by the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act  No      Cth   During the course of the Second Reading Speech in the House of Representatives on   August   of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill    Cth  the then Minister for Health and Ageing said  The bill introduces a parallel civil penalty regime for breaches of the act  The inclusion in the act of civil penalties  alongside criminal penalties  will allow for an alternative and quicker process for dealing with a wide range of legislative breaches  Civil penalties are expected to be more effective in deterring and preventing non compliance with regulatory requirements by body corporates  who represent the bulk of those regulated under the Therapeutic Goods Act   and regulations  Higher penalty levels attach to civil penalties because they are designed to provide adequate incentives  especially in relation to well resourced corporate entities  for deterring breaches of regulatory requirements under the act  The inclusion of alternative civil penalties and criminal offences is an effective strategy that has worked well under other Commonwealth legislation   Prior to the commencement of the hearing on   October   there was agreement between the parties as to the facts  but there was no agreement as to the relief to be granted  At that stage  the task of the Court was to apply the principles to such facts as were the subject of agreement and to those further facts set forth in three Affidavits filed by the Respondents and the cross examination of those deponents appliedTrade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  For the purposes of s  Y b    it may finally be noted  the Secretary does not maintain that there has been   any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention    But  as was pointed out by Olney J in Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   in the context of pecuniary penalties being sought under s   of the Trade Practices Act for resale price maintenance    an absence of loss or damage is not a mitigating factor    His Honour observed at         The Act also requires that regard be had to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission  In the facts of the present case there appears to be no basis upon which any loss or damage can be identified  Whatever may have been the circumstances that induced all other Victorian distributors to agree to maintain retail prices at the levels nominated by ICI  it is the conduct in relation to MRW and Heinrich O Loughlin which is the subject of these proceedings  Nothing has been said to indicate that either of these companies  nor indeed any of their customers  suffered loss or damage by the attempt to induce them to maintain a minimum price  However  I do not think that the absence of loss or damage is necessarily a mitigating factor  In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller  the question of loss or damage will rarely  if ever  arise  The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price
