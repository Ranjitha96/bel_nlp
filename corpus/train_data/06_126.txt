Selim v Lele   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toYung v Adams     FCR   This point was made in Yung v Adams     FCR   at   where Davies J observed that  notwithstanding the width of the definition of  inappropriate conduct  it should be read subject to the legislative power under which the Act was passed     The Federal Parliament has no general power to regulate the activities of medical practitioners  Therefore  under Pt VAA  the power to discipline in relation to  inappropriate practice  must be understood as a power to discipline in relation to conduct which is related to the payments which are made by the Commonwealth under the Act by way of medical benefits and the like  Accordingly  the reference to  inappropriate practice  in s   refers to conduct in relation to which Commonwealth benefits were paid or payable and in respect of which the medical practitioner failed in some way to meet the standards of the general body of the members of the profession in which the services were rendered  The Commonwealth s interest is to see that the services which are provided by a medical practitioner and for which a Commonwealth benefit is or may be claimed are services in respect of which the medical practitioner provides due care and skill  that a claim if made is brought under the correct item and that overservicing does not occur   The applicant contends that the comments of Gibbs J quoted at   above are not to be taken as stating a  blanket proposition  that any regulation of the manner in which practice is conducted is within power  This is clearly correct  However  his Honour s statement that     If the incident of practice which is regulated is not medical or dental  but financial or administrative  it is clearly outside the prohibition   cannot be used  as the applicant attempts to do  as authority for the proposition that any attempt to regulate an incident of practice which is medical or dental will fall within the prohibition   The applicant puts forward the General Practitioners case as authority for the blanket proposition that it is constitutionally impermissible to regulate any performance by medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions  that such regulation was equated with compulsion and therefore with conscription  This however is not what is held in the General Practitioners case  What was crucial for Gibbs J in the General Practitioners case was that no medical service was compelled  This is quite clear from his Honour s comments at        The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices  but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out  and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services  Most of the duties imposed relate only to things done incidentally in the course of practice  rather than to a medical service itself  The only possible exception is s  A   which requires that a request by a medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render a pathology service shall be made or confirmed in writing as prescribed  A request of that kind may be regarded as a medical service  However  s  A  does not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request  What it requires is that the request  if made  be made or confirmed by written instrument which satisfies reg     There is nothing in that regulation which affects in the slightest the performance by a medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions  The statutory requirements may impose on him more administrative work  In particular he is required to specify  in his own handwriting  the services to which the instrument relates  and cannot simply mark a form on which is printed a list of possible services  The reason why a condition of this kind is attached to the entitlement to medical benefits is no doubt that the use of the printed form might reasonably be regarded as likely to contribute to laxity and to facilitate fraud  However that may be  to require a practitioner to write out particulars of the service which he has decided to request another practitioner to perform is not to compel the practitioner making the request to perform a medical service  Even more clearly  the requirements of s  A  with regard to accounts and receipts  and those of s  A  with regard to the retention and production of any written request or confirmation  do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical service        For these reasons none of the provisions in question imposes any form of civil conscription contrary to s  xxiiiA  of the Constitution    I have quoted his Honour s comments at length to make quite clear his Honour s position  His Honour found that the provisions in question did not breach the constitutional prohibition because  put simply  that which was compelled was not a medical service in itself  although it may have been incidental to a medical service  and where a medical service was regulated  as by requiring a request to be made in writing  the medical service itself was not compelled  These comments do not support the proposition that any regulation of the way in which a medical service is provided is unconstitutional   In my view the General Practitioners case is directly applicable to the present situation  For the reasons I have given I do not find that the Medicare Scheme or the PSR Scheme impose any compulsion to provide medical services  The decision to provide medical services is a voluntary decision  The regulation of the manner in which such services are provided is properly incidental to the Commonwealth s power under s  xxiiiA  to provide medical services and does not offend the constitutional prohibition against civil conscription  In my view a proper application of the term  inappropriate practice  would sufficiently confine the concept to matters which are within the incidental power of the Commonwealth   For the above reasons the applicant s challenge to the constitutional validity of PSR Scheme must fail  The appeal must be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding sixty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

cth HCA  html  The High Court has cautioned that when considering the ambit of the incidental power  whether arising by implication or expressly under s  xxxix  of the Constitution   it is important not to allow the incidental power to dominate the main power or  as Rich J said  not to put the cart before the horse  Attorney General for Victoria v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at    The point was well illustrated by Dixon J in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case  The legislation under consideration there rested on the power of the Commonwealth to appropriate money under s   of the Constitution   Dixon J concluded that even if one accepted that s   authorised the expenditure of money on any purpose that the Parliament might think fit without restriction  the scheme established under the legislation would still be invalid  His Honour  at   put the point thus       T  he fact is that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act appropriation of money is the consequence of the plan  the plan is not consequential upon or incidental to the appropriation of money   Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits case  s  xxiiiA  has  of course  authorised the provision of services that were not possible under the previous constitutional arrangements  However  as the General Practitioners case shows  the incidental power is still relevant in an assessment of the constitutional standing of the PSR   The applicant accepts that matters  merely incidental to the core of clinical practice of medicine  do not fall within the constitutional prohibition because they might constitute a necessary part of the Commonwealth s administration of its benefits scheme  In the applicant s written submissions such incidental matters are said to include requirements about completing forms or with respect to accounts and receipts or financial and administrative matters  The applicant does not accept that it is incidental to the Commonwealth s provision of medical services either that it has the power to impose a standard which the services provided have to meet or the power to discipline medical practitioners whose services fail to meet that standard citedAttorney General for Victoria v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section  xxiiiA  was inserted into the Constitution by amendment pursuant to s   of the Constitution   The proposed amendment had been approved by the necessary majorities of electors and was assented to on   December    In explaining the background to this amendment in BMA at     Williams J referred to the different views as to the proper scope of s   of the Constitution  Commonwealth power of appropriation  expressed in Attorney General for Victoria v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     Pharmaceutical Benefits Case  and to the likelihood  if the point arose for decision  that a majority of the Court would hold that the Commonwealth could only expend its money on those forms of social services expressly authorised by the Constitution   namely invalid and old age pensions authorised by s  xxiii   The extension of Commonwealth power to the provision of the benefits enumerated in s  xxiiiA  had been put beyond doubt by the amendment and concerns that the extension of power might lead to the nationalisation of medical and dental professions were met by the prohibition of civil conscription  see also D Mendelson   Devaluation of a Constitutional Guarantee  The History of Section  xxiiiA  of the Commonwealth Constitution       MULR      Williams J was also not prepared to confine the operation of the constitutional prohibition to direct legal compulsion  at    In his Honour s view  however  the fact that s  A carried a penalty for non compliance implied legal compulsion and by compelling medical practitioners  in the absence of a relevant request to the contrary  to write prescriptions on forms supplied by the Commonwealth  the section compelled the provision of a medical service to the Commonwealth  Williams J summarised his view at      The scheme of the Act is to make the provision of a pharmaceutical benefit conditional upon a medical practitioner prescribing particular treatment  so that in prescribing that treatment the medical practitioner is rendering a medical service to the Commonwealth  He is in effect certifying to the Commonwealth that the patient requires a pharmaceutical benefit within the meaning of the Act      He is compelled to render that service in the course of rendering a contractual service to his patient  But it is a service which forms no part of the implied contract for services created by a patient seeking the advice and treatment of a medical practitioner and the medical practitioner examining the patient with a view to giving him advice and treatment  It is a compulsory service to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Act which is super imposed upon the contract of the parties  It is a compulsory service whether the obligation is absolute or absolute unless performance is excused by the person in respect of whom or at whose request the prescription is written   Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case  Latham CJ at   Williams J at   and Webb J at   to the effect that  a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription   At   Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus     That expression   any form of civil conscription  used in its natural meaning  and applied  as the context of par   xxiiiA  requires  to medical and dental services  refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services  However  in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do  in a particular way  some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service  when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service      it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers      There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression  any form of civil conscription  where it appears s  xxiiiA  should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear  The words  any form of  do not  in my opinion  extend the meaning of  conscription  and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed  Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services  but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s  xxiiiA  that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed  and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained  I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par   xxiiiA  any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind  provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed distinguishedFederal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In making these submissions the applicant relies on the decision of the High Court in The General Practitioners Society in Australia v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR    General Practitioners case   In the alternative the applicant submits that     a  GPS is distinguishable and does not apply to the present case  and or    b  the construction of  civil conscription  in GPS is incorrect and should not be accepted by this Court  Rather  it is submitted  the broader view of what constitutes  civil conscription  taken by Latham CJ  Rich  Williams and Webb JJ in Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR    BMA case  should be accepted   In the BMA case   the High Court held that the prohibition against civil conscription in s  xxiiiA  applied only to medical and dental services and not to the other elements of the section  At issue was the validity of s  A of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act    Cth  which required medical practitioners to use a prescribed form and adhere to a prescribed list of pharmaceuticals in writing a prescription if their patients were to be entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits  It was an offence  carrying a penalty of  sterling  for a medical practitioner to write a prescription other than in the statutory form unless asked to do so by the person for whom or at whose request the prescription was written  The majority of the High Court  Latham CJ  Rich  Williams and Webb JJ  Dixon and McTiernan JJ dissenting  held that the section imposed a form of civil conscription contrary to the prohibition in s  xxiiiA    Latham CJ emphasised  at   that the power given to the Commonwealth under s  xxiiiA  is not a power to make laws with respect to pharmaceutical benefits and medical services but for the provision of such benefits and service  The Chief Justice accepted that in providing such benefits and services  the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon the existing  position in the community  that is  a system whereby private doctors prescribe medicine  His Honour found that the incidental power derived from s  xxxix  of the Constitution entitled the Commonwealth  when providing benefits out of public moneys  to take precautions so as to prevent injury to the public and the useless or dishonest expenditure of public moneys   The Chief Justice also said  at   that the term  civil conscription  is wider than  industrial conscription  and is applicable to  any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation  perform particular work  or perform work in a particular way   The Chief Justice emphasised that the words  any form of  in s  xxiiiA  evinced an intention on the part of the Parliament to ensure that any service to which the limitation applied should be  completely voluntary   Considering s  A  his Honour accepted that a doctor might escape the penalty by not writing a prescription but noted that if a doctor could not carry on practice without writing many prescriptions included in the prescribed list  the doctor is not given any live option  Given that the doctor had no power or right to procure or control a request that he not use the Commonwealth forms then he either had to use them or go out of practice  The Chief Justice viewed this as a very real form of compulsion commenting  at      There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in that way  and possibly in the only way  in which he is qualified to earn a living    Webb J expressed a similar view at       The aspects of the legislation that had led Webb J to conclude that the legislation involved a compulsory medical service were clearly identified by his Honour at      To reiterate  if s  A had not been enacted a patient requesting a doctor to write a prescription on the Commonwealth form  which involves consulting and consideration of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary or its addendum or both  would request a service which only a doctor can render  and which therefore is properly described as a medical service  But when this service is made compulsory by a fine  or loss of practice to avoid the fine    then  having regard not only to the extent of the professional work involved but to the almost unlimited number of persons entitled to insist on the service at any time  it becomes  I think  not merely a compulsory service but a form of civil conscription within any meaning that can be given to that expression which  if not quite clear  was certainly intended to be comprehensive  It is civil conscription of doctors as doctors    His Honour s comments on these aspects of the legislation are particularly instructive in the present proceeding   The only other case in which the High Court has considered the meaning of  civil conscription  in any detail is the General Practitioners case   Certain provisions of the HIA  ss  A   B and  C  and regulations made under the Act imposed conditions to be met before Commonwealth medical benefits were payable in respect of pathology services  other than prescribed pathology services  and also imposed obligations on some  at least  of the persons providing those services  It was necessary for those services to be provided by or on behalf of an  approved pathology practitioner   The conditions and obligations were designed to prevent the supply of unnecessary or excessive pathology services   The legislative provisions operated in conjunction with an undertaking to be provided by approved pathology practitioners and a code of conduct  They had no application to a medical practitioner who was prepared to render pathology services for which no medical benefit would be payable and there was no legal compulsion on any medical practitioner to become an approved pathology practitioner  The arguments put to the Court that the legislation imposed a form of civil conscription were summarised by Gibbs J at      First  it was said that the laws positively require a practitioner to perform services of a medical kind  Secondly  it was said  the laws  by prohibiting practitioners from carrying on practice in what was formerly the normal way  compel them to carry on practice in a different way      it was argued for the plaintiffs that few practitioners would be able to attract patients  or to make a living from their profession  if medical benefits were not payable in respect of their services  and that therefore  if ss  A   B and  C are valid  a practitioner who intends to render pathology services  whether as a specialist or as a general practitioner  is compelled by practical considerations to apply to become an approved pathology practitioner   Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case  Latham CJ at   Williams J at   and Webb J at   to the effect that  a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription   At   Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus     That expression   any form of civil conscription  used in its natural meaning  and applied  as the context of par   xxiiiA  requires  to medical and dental services  refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services  However  in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do  in a particular way  some act in the

challenge to Dr Selim s standing to bring the present proceeding  The respondents have accepted that should the applicant be disqualified from participating in the Medicare Scheme  then for the period of the disqualification the applicant s patients would not receive benefits in respect of the applicant s professional services  The respondents accept that  depending on the length of any disqualification the applicant  may lose a number of his patients   The pervasiveness of the Medicare Scheme and its role in covering an individual s medical expenses or  at least  in subsidising those expenses  is sufficiently well known generally as to allow me to take judicial notice of this and of its impact on medical practitioners who are unable to participate in the scheme  Holland v Jones   HCA         CLR     Evidence Act    Cth  s    It is not difficult to conclude that the consequences for a medical practitioner who is excluded from the scheme would be sufficiently serious  The disadvantages of operating outside the Medicare Scheme are such as  in my view  to impose practical  if not legal compulsion  to participate in the Scheme   The written submissions made on behalf of the applicant went into considerable detail about the repercussions for the applicant should he be disqualified from the Medicare Benefits Scheme for up to three years  These included the virtual devastation of his practice and loss of his livelihood  As I have explained above these submissions are not relevant to the issue I have to decide  The applicant sought judicial review of the decisions of the Director and the Committee  Jacobson J dismissed that application  I understand that  pending the outcome of the present constitutional challenge to the legislation  no penalties have been imposed on the applicant  Whether or not hardship submissions will be relevant to the assessment of any penalty is not for me to say  The issue of whether the PSR exceeds the powers of the Commonwealth however  cannot depend on issues of hardship particular to an individual practitioner   It is not in contention that medical practitioners are not obliged to participate in the Medicare Scheme  Nevertheless  the applicant contends that the realities underlying the medical benefits scheme are such that  realistically  economically and practically  it requires medical practitioners to become approved medical providers in order for them to practise as general practitioners  The applicant submits that the HIA requires general practitioners to provide medical services in a manner designated as  appropriate  but which is  unstated and undefined   According to the applicant  this dictates the  kinds of and manner in which medical services are actually provided  and attaches significant sanctions to a failure to conform including disqualification from participation in the scheme for up to three years  public reprimand and or the imposition of substantial repayments of Medicare benefits paid to them or assigned to them by their patients  By so doing  the applicant submits  the HIA  impermissibly  constitutes civil conscription appliedThe General Practitioners
